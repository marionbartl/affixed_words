Partial Evaluation of Maple

Programmers wish to use high levels of abstraction and generality in order to create programs that are readable , modular , reusable , portable and maintainable .
On the other hand it is often necessary to write programs that are efficient .
These two goals are often in conflict ; abstraction usually adds overhead and reduces the chances for optimization .
Meanwhile the need for efficiency pulls the programmer away from abstraction and promotes the use of platform and type specific optimizations .
Partial evaluation ( PE ) is a program transformation technique that uses a subset of the inputs to a program to generate a specialized version of the program that will then accept the rest of the inputs .
With PE it is possible to write algorithms in a highly general and abstracted form , and then automatically extract optimized versions of the algorithm specialized for certain inputs .
Partial evaluation performs aggressive optimizations by performing as much computation as possible based on the given inputs while generating code that will perform the deferred computations .
Several specialized versions of a program section may be generated based upon different usages within the program .
An optimized program generated by a partial evaluator may be larger in size than the original program , but will perform fewer computations at run-time .
Maple is a Computer Algebra System ( CAS ) and visualization environment .
It uses a high - level language , which is also called Maple , to perform symbolic and numeric computations .
Maple 's core library contains a vast amount of mathematical knowledge and problem solving power .
MapleMIX is a partial evaluator for the Maple programming language .
It is a program transformation and optimization tool for Maple programs .
MapleMIX is a completely online partial evaluator written in Maple itself .
It has the ability to produce highly specialized results from input programs and user provided static data .
It was developed with two goals in mind .
Firstly to produce optimized code by generating specialized versions of general algorithms .
And secondly to exploit the vast amount of mathematical knowledge present in the Maple library by extracting precise answers to parametric problems written to produce generic solutions .

Manchester City have confirmed Sheikh Mansour has completed a 100 per cent buy - out of the club .
Shinawatra sells up his shareholding
Manchester City have confirmed Sheikh Mansour has completed a 100 per cent buy - out of the club .
Through the Abu Dhabi United Group , Sheikh Mansour gained control of the Eastlands outfit from former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra last summer .
Shinawatra had kept a 10 per cent stake but now City have confirmed Mansour has gained control of that as well , giving him full control of affairs at Eastlands .
" As a result of the transaction , Manchester City is now 100 per cent owned by his highness Sheikh Mansour , " said a club statement .
Sheikh Mansour has already invested huge sums in the club , sanctioning a British record £ 32.5 million capture of Robinho on the day of his buy - out and spending in excess of £ 120 million on new players this summer .
It is thought he is also keen to use land around City 's stadium to build a new training facility .

It was buried as Viking nobility fled from Yorkshire at a key moment in British history and more than a thousand years later it was discovered by two men with metal detectors in a field near Harrogate in North Yorkshire .
It is the greatest Viking hoard of treasure to be discovered in Britain for more than 150 years .
And now it 's been cleaned and prepared for display in York and London - it has revealed its stories .
There are coins from Afghanistan and northern Russia .
Britain in the tenth century was part of a globalised trading system .
The hoard lay buried for more than 1000 years
There is one coin featuring Athelstan , the King of England .
Experts believe this means it was from 927 - 8 .
This was the time when Viking Northumbria was conquered and the birth of what was to be the Kingdom of England .
Athelstan is also described as King of Britain .
He was , it appears , claiming overlordship over Scotland and Wales as well as England .
A matter that other Kings may well have disagreed with .
A coin featuring St Peter but also the hammer of Thor .
It 's evidence that worshippers of Thor were being encouraged to Christianise their allegiance by switching the Scandanavian god for Peter .
A selection of the coins and jewellery will be going on display in York and the British Museum in December .

The operators of The Pirate Bay launched a long - awaited VPN service Monday , promising to make file sharers and other internet users more anonymous online .
The IPREDATOR Global Anonymity Service , at about $ 7 monthly , is named for Sweden 's IPRED law that went into force in April .
That law empowers copyright owners to acquire data from ISPs identifying people linked to file sharing .
The four operators of the Pirate Bay are staring down a year in prison each , and millions of dollars in fines , after being convicted in a Swedish court for facilitating copyright infringement .
They run the world 's most notorious BitTorrent search engine .
Their fines and imprisonment are pending appeal .
On Monday , The Pirate Bay announced that 180,000 people have signed up for the service .
Invitations to the first 3,000 who signed up in April went out Monday .
" There 's been some small issues but it 's being resolved right now , " the Bay announced Monday on its blog .
" Then we 'll invite more people in ...
We 're hoping that all will have their invite within a month 's period . "
TorrentFreak notes that the IPREDATOR service , announced in April , likely would be more secure than rank - and - file virtual private networks , which encrypt a user 's traffic stream , making it theoretcially invulnerable to interception by a local ISP , or intermediate carriers .
" The weak link in any VPN / anonymity service is always their willingness ( or otherwise ) to hand over your customer data when pressured under the law .
However , with IPREDATOR this should not be an issue since the service is promising to keep no logs of user activity whatsoever , " Torrent Freak said .
Pirate Bay administrators Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg and Peter Sunde were found guilty in April , along with Carl Lundström , who was accused of funding the five - year - old operation .
In addition to jail time , the defendants were ordered to pay damages of 30 million kronor ( $ 3.6 million ) to a handful of entertainment companies , including Sony Music Entertainment , Warner Bros , EMI and Columbia Pictures , for the infringement of 33 specific movie and music properties tracked by industry investigators .
The April verdicts are on appeal amid allegations the judge who presided over the case was biased because he was a member of pro-copyright groups .

In fact , there are different ways to prove that the Qur'an is the word of God , which has always been true and has never been subjected to change or distortion .
These proofs can be classified into three types : the way the Qur'an was transmitted throughout the centuries , some challenging verses within the Qur'an itself , and the periodic , modern - day discoveries in the universe that were first mentioned in the Qur'an more than fourteen centuries ago .
Unlike the Bible and Old Testament that have been subject to innumerable translations , doubtful and spurious transmissions , and corruptions at the hands of clerics up till now ( with the “ gender sensitive ” versions coming out these days ) , the Qur'an was transmitted to us in an unprecedented and unique manner according to rigorous rules of transmission .
The Qur'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) via the angel Gabriel , and the Prophet subsequently memorized the whole scripture .
Allah has said in the Qur’an that He alone will protect His book , and indeed He has kept His promise .
The Qur’an that we read today contains the same exact words that were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) over 1400 years ago .
This is quite a miracle , especially when you consider that no other group of people can say that their book has not been subject to change by the time it reached the present generation .
Only the Qur’an has survived through the centuries unchanged , and the language in which it was revealed , classical Arabic , still enjoys practical usage around the world .
While classic English of the 14th century can be understand by very few native English speakers , the Qur’an can be understood by the vast majority of Arabic - speaking Muslims .
When compared to other scriptures , the Qur’an is unique in these two respects .
from thAT NO ONE CAN EVER CHANGE A THING IN QURAN , AND LISTEN U SANDWICH , IF U WANT TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT , I DON'T CARE , JUST BE AWAY FROM OUR RELIGION , DON'T SPREAD HATERY ......
In Christianity , the only negative aspect is when people play religion without having a relationship with God .
There is no lifestyle , just words .
That 's why Jesus was so mad at the Pharisees .
They were supposed to be the leading examples and were far away from God.

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
JERUSALEM
The Russian freighter mysteriously hijacked in northern European waters in July and located off the African coast by Russian warships was hijacked by Russia itself , according to the Israeli news agency Ynet .
The Arctic Sea had gone missing after reportedly sailing from Finland to Algeria with a load of timber bound for Algeria .
Off Sweden its captain reported being hijacked by eight men .
Communication with the vessel was then lost until it was located near Cape Verde three weeks later and boarded by Russian commandos .
Time Magazine on Wednesday quoted Adm. Tarmo Kouts , the European Union ’s rapporteur on piracy , as saying that the most likely explanation for the “ bizarre ” incident was that the vessel was carrying advanced missiles destined for a Muslim country and that its hijacking had been carried out by Israel .
The Ynet article , written by veteran military correspondent Ron Ben - Yishai , concludes that the incident was even more bizarre than that .
Citing “ Russian , European and Middle Eastern sources , ” Mr. Ben -Yishai wrote yesterday that the vessel had initially set sail not from Finland but from Kaliningrad , a Russian enclave on the Baltic coast where illegal trade in weapons and other items is rife .
According to his sources , a deal was struck between Russian and Middle Eastern businessmen for the sale of advanced S -300 anti-aircraft missiles , the kind being sought by Iran to defend its nuclear facilities from air attack , as well as X - 500 anti-ship missiles .
The Kremlin was uninvolved in the deal , writes Mr. Ben -Yishai , but businessmen from the private sector were .
“ After the deal was executed , ” wrote Mr. Ben - Yishai , “ an intelligence agency whose identity so far remains secret learned of the ship ’s departure … and transferred an anonymous tip to the Russian authorities . ”
Mr. Ben -Yishai does not mention the Mossad but the Israeli espionage agency has been widely referred to in press speculation about the incident .
Israeli officials have declined to comment .
The Arctic Sea proceeded from Kaliningrad to Finland to pick up a small load of timber to provide legitimate cover for its voyage .
Near Sweden , a small boat carrying eight men pulled alongside and said they were lost at sea .
When they were permitted to board the freighter they identified themselves as Swedish police and arrested the crew at gunpoint .
The freighter ’s crewmen reported that the boarding party spoke Russian among themselves .
The vessel was permitted by the hijackers to continue sailing .
It passed through the English Channel .
It was not boarded by Russian commandos until Aug. 18 when it had reached the African coast .
According to Mr. Ben -Yishai , the delay in the “ rescue mission ” was to permit the vessel to sail beyond the surveillance of the media .
Russia sent eight large cargo planes to bring them back the ship ’s cargo , writes Mr. Ben -Yishai , an indication that something other than cheap timber was involved .
The “ pirates , ” whom Mr. Ben - Yishai identified as Russian intelligence officers , were shown on television being roughly handled by security forces when they were brought back to Russia , a seemingly staged performance .

I was shocked , surprised , and flabbergasted to hear it .
I ’m sure that you ’ll never believe it , either .
The federal government is — get this , readers — butting into your most personal and private business .
OK , you ’ve caught me in a rare moment of sarcasm .
Maybe I was n’t really that surprised .
After all , government bureaucrats attempt to control what types of substances you put into your body , what kind of work you do with your body , and even how you can legally dispose of your body after death ; it makes perfect sense that they would also scramble for power over what parts of your body should remain attached .
Yes , that ’s right .
The CDC is now considering a campaign for universal circumcision in the US .
The reason for pushing this one - size - fits - all policy stems from the results of several studies , all done in Africa , which have demonstrated the benefits of male circumcision for reducing the transmission of HIV .
The studies on circumcision and HIV transmission are very interesting .
They are large , randomized , controlled trials ; the methodology is solid .
They show , on average , a 40 — 60 % reduction in the risk of a circumcised , HIV negative man contracting the virus from an HIV positive woman , as compared to an uncircumcised man .
The precise mechanism of circumcision ’s protective effect is unknown .
There are many potential explanations , none of which are mutually exclusive .
First , the foreskin has a relatively high population of cells that are receptive to being infected by HIV .
Second , it acts as a reservoir which may trap infected secretions .
Third , the foreskin has a higher propensity to ulcerate ( become scraped ) and become infected with other sexually transmitted infections that cause open sores .
It seems that removing the foreskin also removes several potential avenues for HIV entry into the body .
Circumcision , The Hidd ... Goldman , Ronald Best Price : $ 9.40 Buy New $ 21.00 ( as of 07:40 EST - Details )
However , when considering the benefits of circumcision , there are some significant caveats .
For one , circumcision is not a panacea ; it does not completely prevent transmission of HIV , it just lowers the probability that a man will contract the virus during any given sexual encounter with an HIV positive woman .
It should be noted that these studies only examined the effect of circumcision on transmission of the virus from an HIV positive woman to an HIV negative man .
While this is a relatively common scenario in Sub - Saharan Africa , HIV epidemiology in the US is different .
Overall rates of infection are lower .
Also , HIV in the US is relatively more common among men who have sex with men ( MSM ) .
There is no evidence that circumcision protects against HIV acquisition in MSM .
Circumcision also does nothing to protect anyone against acquiring HIV via bloodborne routes , such as sharing needles with an HIV positive person .
It should go without saying that men can protect themselves from acquiring HIV in other ways besides getting circumcised , such as practicing safe ( r ) sex and avoiding intravenous drug use .
These methods are much more reliable than the 40 — 60 % risk reduction conferred by circumcision .
Circumcision also has risks and demerits .
My personal philosophy on medicine leads me to look skeptically at any procedure that removes a part of the body which is not causing harm , pain , or annoyance to the patient ; in other words , do n’t mess with success .
As with any surgical procedure , infections and pain after circumcision are both possibilities that should not be ignored .
Medical errors should be considered as a legitimate risk during circumcision , too .
There are rare case reports of penile amputation that have occurred during botched circumcisions .
There are also many more reports of less extreme , but still real , consequences resulting from circumcision mishaps .
What Your Doctor May N... Paul M. Fleiss , Freder ... Best Price : $ 61.08 Buy New $ 3,549.27 ( as of 01:25 EST - Details )
Of course , the question on the minds of many who are considering circumcision is that of whether the procedure impacts sexual enjoyment and satisfaction .
That question is , in my opinion , impossible to answer accurately .
To distill the immense debate surrounding this issue to its barest essence , choice seems to play a significant role in how men view their foreskins ( or lack thereof ) .
Men who choose to get circumcised tend to be happy that they did so ; those who did not have a choice in the matter because they were circumcised at birth are more likely to lament it .
That brings me to my main point in writing about the prospect of universal circumcision : the issue of choice .
If my patient asked me about circumcision , I would discuss with him the information above .
I would also encourage him to do his own research about the procedure if he felt interested .
He would make his own decision about whether he wanted to have the surgery .
Socialism : An Economic ... Ludwig von Mises Best Price : $ 6.00 Buy New $ 1.99 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
By contrast , the CDC ’s attitude demonstrates a lack of consideration for patient autonomy and consent , two essential elements in all medical decisions .
The CDC would like every baby boy born in America to be circumcised , no matter the opinion of his parents and , more importantly , without the boy ’s consent .
If circumcision were a medically necessary and life - saving procedure with no possible ill effects , things might be different .
In reality , it is a surgical procedure that is not essential for the health of a normal man ; furthermore , it has both risks and benefits .
The relative importance of those risks and benefits is subjective .
Every man may value them differently .
For that reason , it ’s essential that each individual be afforded the choice about what to do with his own foreskin .
To be perfectly blunt , I do not see any justification for removing a part of a baby boy ’s body without his consent .
Men can always get circumcised as adults if they wish ; by contrast , once the foreskin is gone , it ’s gone forever .
Most people will concede that the procedure is painful even for babies , but they insist that the pain is justified because the baby will not remember it .
I wince at the thought of causing pain to a newborn boy .
I say that even if he does not remember the physical pain as an adult , he may still suffer from the psychological sting of having had a body part removed without his permission .
Another argument from the advocates of universal circumcision is that it makes good hygiene easier .
This is a typical government one - size - fits - all solution : parents are too stupid , in the minds of government agents , to teach their sons good hygiene , so instead we should just circumcise everyone .
People are also too stupid to practice safe sex , so we should circumcise them all because they will gain a marginal reduction in the overall risk of contracting HIV .
I ’ve also heard arguments for circumcision based in religious tradition and cultural norms .
Sure , circumcision is common — and a very old tradition in some religions and cultures .
But does that make it right ?
I do n’t think that ’s for us to decide .
I think that each individual , the owner of his own body , should make the call about whether or not circumcision is appropriate for him .
It ’s difficult for me to assume the mindset of statists who advocate for this kind of thing , so I raised the issue of universal circumcision in conversation with a few people whose opinions I thought would be unencumbered by that pesky philosophy of leaving others alone and letting them make their own decisions .
In addition to the religious and culturally based arguments that several people trotted out , one colleague had an interesting comment .
He thought that universal circumcision was a good idea , envisioning a world where no more would awkward teens have to worry about getting teased in the locker room , because “ everyone would look the same . ”
Oh really ?
The last time I checked , people came in all shapes , colors , and sizes , and that was a good thing !
I guess that if everyone looked alike , wore the same clothes , and had the same hairstyles , nobody would ever have to worry about not fitting in .
Would this egalitarian also propose to redistribute the wealth from the best - endowed men to those who are not quite as blessed by Mother Nature ?
Ridiculous .
I certainly cannot agree with the CDC ’s move toward making a blanket recommendation that all boys should undergo a medical procedure at birth , without their consent .
I want each man to have the opportunity to make his own decision about what to do with his foreskin when he reaches an age at which he is capable of doing so , based on his understanding of the risks and benefits , and how much he personally values each .
The bloated , overreaching federal government apparently does not want the same .
The Best of Stephanie Murphy
That movie , with a budget of more than $ 1 million , had special effects ( pirates materializing from the mist ) , and , yes , lots of sex .
Two years later , the movie ’s studio , Digital Playground , spent $ 8 million on a sequel  a remarkable sum in an industry where the average movie costs $ 25,000 , according to the director of the two movies , Ali Joone .
But interest in DVDs has fallen sharply , Mr. Fishbein said , because the Internet has made it easy to watch snippets of video .
Mr. Fishbein estimated that pornographic DVD sales and rentals in the United States generated $ 3.62 billion in 2006 but had fallen as much as 50 percent since then .
He says the slump has made some companies reluctant to share sales figures , so his estimates are getting rougher .
The big studios , like Vivid and Digital Playground , have turned to a subscription model , charging monthly fees for access to their Web sites and advertising the frequency with which they add new clips .
Mr. Joone said that of Digital Playground ’s 60 productions this year , roughly 30 had little or no plot , up from about 10 two years ago .
At Wicked Pictures , which averages one production a week , one - third are essentially just sex , twice as many as a few years ago , said the company ’s president , Steve Orenstein .
“ The feature is not as big a part of the industry today , ” Mr. Orenstein said .
But he says he still plans two to three bigger - budget releases each year , including the recently shot “ 2040 , ” which is about the pornography business of the future .
Mr. Orenstein described the movie as “ an almost Romeo - and - Juliet story between an aging porn star and a cyborg . ”
In lieu of plot , there are themes .
Among the new releases from New Sensations , a studio that makes 24 movies a month , is “ Girls ’n Glasses , ” made up of scenes of women having sex while wearing glasses .

Cut off my hair and donated it to Locks of Love today .
Chason , you owe me 500 trillion dollars .
On the outskirts of a desert town in the Moroccan - occupied territory of Western Sahara , about a dozen young activists are gathered .
They are involved in their country ’s long struggle for freedom .
A group of foreigners — veterans of protracted resistance movements — is conducting a training session in the optimal use of a “ weapons system ” that is increasingly deployed in struggles for freedom around the world .
The workshop leaders pass out Arabic translations of writings on the theory and dynamics of revolutionary struggle and lead the participants in a series of exercises designed to enhance their strategic and tactical thinking .
These trainers are not veterans of guerrilla warfare , however , but of unarmed insurrections against repressive regimes .
The materials they hand out are not the words of Che Guevara , but of Gene Sharp , the former Harvard scholar who has pioneered the study of strategic nonviolent action .
And the weapons they advocate employing are not guns and bombs , but strikes , boycotts , mass demonstrations , tax refusal , alternative media , and refusal to obey official orders .
Serbs , South Africans , Filipinos , Georgians , and other veterans of successful nonviolent struggles are sharing their knowledge and experience with those still fighting dictators and occupation armies .
The young Western Saharans know how an armed struggle by an older generation of their countrymen failed to dislodge the Moroccans , who first invaded their country back in 1975 .
They have seen how Morocco ’s allies on the U.N. Security Council — led by France and the United States — blocked enforcement of U.N. resolutions supporting their right to self - determination .
With the failure of both armed struggle and diplomacy to bring them freedom , they have decided to instead employ a force more powerful .
The Rise of Nonviolence
The long - standing assumption that dictatorial regimes can only be overthrown through armed struggle or foreign military intervention is coming under increasing challenge .
Though nonviolent action has a long and impressive history going back centuries , events in recent decades have demonstrated more than ever that nonviolent action is not just a form of principled witness utilized by religious pacifists .
It is the most powerful political tool available to challenge oppression .
It was not the leftist guerrillas of the New People ’s Army who brought down the U.S. - backed Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines .
It was nuns praying the rosary in front of the regime ’s tanks , and the millions of others who brought greater Manila to a standstill .
It was not the 11 weeks of bombing that brought down Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic , the infamous “ butcher of the Balkans . ”
It was a nonviolent resistance movement led by young students , whose generation had been sacrificed in a series of bloody military campaigns against neighboring Yugoslav republics , and who were able to mobilize a large cross-section of the population to rise up against a stolen election .
It was not the armed wing of the African National Congress that brought majority rule to South Africa .
It was workers , students , and township dwellers who — through the use of strikes , boycotts , the creation of alternative institutions , and other acts of defiance — made it impossible for the apartheid system to continue .
It was not NATO that brought down the communist regimes of Eastern Europe or freed the Baltic republics from Soviet control .
It was Polish dockworkers , East German church people , Estonian folk singers , Czech intellectuals , and millions of ordinary citizens .
Similarly , such tyrants as Jean - Claude Duvalier in Haiti , Moussa Traoré in Mali , King Gyanendra in Nepal , General Suharto in Indonesia , and , most recently , Maumoon Gayoom in the Maldives were forced to cede power when it became clear that they were powerless in the face of massive nonviolent resistance and noncooperation .
The power of nonviolent action has been acknowledged even by such groups as Freedom House , a Washington - based organization with close ties to the foreign policy establishment .
Its 2005 study observed that , of the nearly 70 countries that have made the transition from dictatorship to varying degrees of democracy in the past 30 years , only a small minority did so through armed struggle from below or reform instigated from above .
Hardly any new democracies resulted from foreign invasion .
In nearly three - quarters of the transitions , change was rooted in democratic civil - society organizations that employed nonviolent methods .
In addition , the study noted that countries where nonviolent civil resistance movements played a major role tend to have freer and more stable democratic systems .
A different study , published last year in the journal International ­Security , used an expanded database and analyzed 323 major insurrections in support of self - determination and democratic rule since 1900 .
It found that violent resistance was successful only 26 percent of the time , whereas nonviolent campaigns had a 53 percent success rate .
From the poorest nations of Africa to the relatively affluent countries of Eastern Europe ; from communist regimes to right - wing military dictatorships ; from across the cultural , geographic and ideological spectrum , democratic and progressive forces have recognized the power of nonviolent action to free them from oppression .
This has not come , in most cases , from a moral or spiritual commitment to nonviolence , but simply because it works .
Why Nonviolent Action Works
Armed resistance , even for a just cause , can terrify people not yet committed to the struggle , making it easier for a government to justify violent repression and use of military force in the name of protecting the population .
Even rioting and vandalism can turn public opinion against a movement , which is why some governments have employed agents provocateurs to encourage such violence .
The use of force against unarmed resistance movements , on the other hand , usually creates greater sympathy for the government ’s opponents .
As with the martial art of aikido , nonviolent opposition movements can engage the force of the state ’s repression and use it to effectively disarm the force directed against them .
In addition , unarmed campaigns involve a range of participants far beyond the young able - bodied men normally found in the ranks of armed guerrillas .
As the movement grows in strength , it can include a large cross-section of the population .
Though most repressive governments are well - prepared to deal with a violent insurgency , they tend to be less prepared to counter massive non-cooperation by old , middle - aged , and young .
When millions of people defy official orders by engaging in illegal demonstrations , going out on strike , violating curfews , refusing to pay taxes , and otherwise refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the state , the state no longer has power .
During the “ people power ” uprising against the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines , for example , Marcos lost power not through the defeat of his troops and the storming of the Malacañang Palace but when — due to massive defiance of his orders — the palace became the only part of the country he still effectively controlled .
Furthermore , pro-government elements tend to be more willing to compromise with nonviolent insurgents , who are less likely to physically harm their opponents when they take power .
When massive demonstrations challenged the military junta in Chile in the late 1980s , military leaders convinced the dictator Augusto Pinochet to agree to the nonviolent protesters ’ demands for a referendum on his continued rule and to accept the results when the vote went against him .
Unarmed movements also increase the likelihood of defections and non-cooperation by police and military personnel , who will generally fight in self - defense against armed guerrillas but are hesitant to shoot into unarmed crowds .
Such defiance was key to the downfall of dictatorships in East ­Germany , Mali , Serbia , the Philippines , Ukraine , and elsewhere .
The moral power of nonviolence is crucial to the ability of an opposition movement to reframe the perceptions of the public , political elites , and the military .
A Democratizing Force
In many cases , armed revolutionaries — trained in martial values , the power of the gun , and a leadership model based upon a secret , elite vanguard — have themselves become authoritarian rulers once in power .
In addition , because civil war often leads to serious economic , environmental , and social problems , the new leadership is tempted to embrace emergency powers they are later reluctant to surrender .
Algeria and Guinea - Bissau experienced military coups soon after their successful armed independence struggles , while victorious communist guerrillas in a number of countries simply established new dictatorships .
By contrast , successful nonviolent movements build broad coalitions based on compromise and consensus .
The new order that emerges from that foundation tends to be pluralistic and democratic .
Liberal democracy carries no guarantee of social justice , but many of those involved in pro-democracy struggles have later played a key role in leading the effort to establish more equitable social and economic orders .
For example , the largely nonviolent indigenous peasant and worker movements that ended a series of military dictatorships in Bolivia in the 1980s formed the basis of the movement that brought Evo Morales and his allies to power , resulting in a series of exciting reforms benefiting the country ’s poor , indigenous majority .
Another reason nonviolent movements tend to create sustainable democracy is that , in the course of the movement , alternative institutions are created that empower ordinary people .
For example , autonomous workers ’ councils eroded the authority of party apparatchiks in Polish industry even as the Communist Party still nominally ruled the country .
In South Africa , popularly elected local governments and people ’s courts in the black townships completely usurped the authority of administrators and judges appointed by the apartheid regime long before majority rule came to the country as a whole .
Recent successes of nonviolent tactics have raised concerns about their use by those with undemocratic aims .
However , it is virtually impossible for an undemocratic result to emerge from a movement based upon broad popular support .
Local elites , often with the support of foreign powers , have historically promoted regime change through military invasions , coup d’états , and other kinds of violent seizures of power that install an undemocratic minority .
Nonviolent “ people power ” movements , by contrast , make peaceful regime change possible by empowering pro-democratic majorities .
Indeed , every successful nonviolent insurrection has been a homegrown movement rooted in the realization by the masses that their rulers were illegitimate and that the political system would not redress injustice .
By contrast , a nonviolent insurrection is unlikely to succeed when the movement ’s leadership and agenda do not have the backing of the majority of the population .
This is why the 2002 –2003 “ strike ” by some privileged sectors of Venezuela ’s oil industry failed to bring down the democratically elected government of Hugo Chavez , while the widely supported strikes in the Iranian oil fields against the Shah in 1978 – 1979 were key in bringing down his autocratic regime .
Homegrown Movements
Unlike most successful unarmed insurrections , Iran slid back under autocratic rule after the overthrow of the Shah .
Now , hard - line clerics and their allies have themselves been challenged by a nonviolent pro-democracy movement .
Like most governments facing popular challenges , rather than acknowledging their own failures , the Iranian regime has sought to blame outsiders for fomenting the resistance .
Given the sordid history of U.S. interventionism in that country — including the overthrow of Iran ’s last democratic government in 1953 in a CIA - backed military coup — some are taking those claims seriously .
However , Iranians have engaged in nonviolent action for generations , not just in opposition to the Shah , but going back to the 1890 – 1892 boycotts against concessions to the British and the 1905 – 1908 Constitutional Revolution .
There is little Americans can teach Iranians about such civil resistance .
Citing funding from Western governments and foundations , similar charges of powerful Western interests being responsible for nonviolent insurrections have also been made in regard to recent successful pro-democracy movements in Serbia , Georgia , and Ukraine .
However , while outside funding can be useful in enabling opposition groups to buy computers , print literature , and promote their work , it cannot cause a nonviolent liberal democratic revolution to take place any more than Soviet financial and material support for leftist movements in previous decades could cause an armed socialist revolution to take place .
Successful revolutions , whatever their ideological orientation , are the result of certain social conditions .
Indeed , no amount of money could force hundreds of thousands of people to leave their jobs , homes , schools , and families to face down heavily armed police and tanks and put their bodies on the line .
They must be motivated by a desire for change so strong they are willing to make the sacrifices and take the personal risks to bring it about .
In any case , there is no standardized formula for success that a foreign government could put together , since the history , culture , and political alignments of each country are unique .
No foreign government can recruit or mobilize the large numbers of ordinary civilians necessary to build a movement capable of effectively challenging the established political leadership , much less of toppling a government .

Even workshops like the one for the Western Saharan activists , usually funded through nonprofit , nongovernmental foundations , generally focus on providing generic information on the theory , dynamics , and history of nonviolent action .
There is broad consensus among workshop leaders that only those involved in the struggles themselves are in a position to make tactical and strategic decisions , so they tend not to give specific advice .
However , such capacity - building efforts — like comparable NGO projects for sustainable development , human rights , equality for women and minorities , economic justice , and the environment — can be an effective means of fostering inter­national solidarity .
Back in Western Sahara , anti-occupation activists , building on their own experiences against the Moroccan occupation and on what they learned from the workshop , press on in the struggle for their country ’s freedom .
In the face of severe repression from U.S. - backed Moroccan forces , the movement continues with demonstrations , leafleting , graffiti writing , flag waving , boycotts , and other actions .
One prominent leader of the movement , Aminatou Haidar , won the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award last November , and she has been twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize .
Those in the Western Sahara resistance are among the growing numbers of people around the world struggling against repression who have recognized that armed resistance is more likely to magnify their suffering than relieve it .
From Western Sahara to West Papua to the West Bank , people are engaged in nonviolent resistance against foreign occupation .
Similarly , from Egypt to Iran to Burma , people are fighting nonviolently for freedom from dictatorial rule .
Recent history has shown that power ultimately resides in the people , not in the state ; that nonviolent strategies can be more powerful than guns ; and that nonviolent action is a form of conflict that can build , rather than destroy .

In the 1980s , the Soviets built a Doomsday Machine – and it 's still active .
I learned about it while researching my new book , The Hawk and the Dove : Paul Nitze , George Kennan , and the History of the Cold War .
It 's also the subject of a story in the current issue of WIRED .
The system would have allowed the USSR to respond insemi-automatic fashion to an American nuclear strike – even one that had knocked out the Kremlin and the Defense Ministries .
And one obvious question that people ask when they learn about this system is " Why did n't the Soviets tell us ? "
As we all know from Dr. Strangelove , the point of a Doomsday Machine is to convince the other side in a conflict that attack is futile .
The answer to that question is the most interesting thing I learned in my research .
Yes , the Soviets were extremely secretive ; and , yes , they were worried that , if they told us , we could disable it .
But the more interesting reason is that they also built the system to deter themselves .
Here 's the relevant passage from the story :
Observations by the European Space Agency ’s Venus Express mission have provided strong new evidence that the solar wind has stripped away significant quantities of water from Earth ’s twin planet .
The data also shed new light on the transfer of trace gases in the Venusian atmosphere and wind patterns .
The results will be presented at the European Planetary Science Congress in Potsdam , Germany , on Wednesday 16 September .
The SPICAV and VIRTIS instruments carried by the spacecraft have been used to measure concentrations of water vapour in the Venusian atmosphere at altitudes ranging from the lowest 10 km up to 110 km , high above the cloud tops .
Studies led by scientists from Belgium and Russia have found that the ratio of heavy water , which contains the isotope deuterium instead of hydrogen , to normal water is nearly twice as high above the clouds compared to its value in the lower atmosphere .
“ Water vapour is a very rare species in the Venusian atmosphere : if it were in liquid form now , it would cover the surface of Venus with just a few centimetres of water .
However , we believe Venus once had large volumes of water that have since escaped into space or stripped away by the solar wind .
These results from Venus Express demonstrate that the heavier water containing deuterium has not been able to escape Venus ’s gravity as easily as normal H 2 O .
This enrichment of heavy water provides strong evidence that water loss is occurring in the upper atmosphere and that Venus was probably more humid and Earth - like in the distant past , ” said Dr Emmanuel Marcq of the LATMOS laboratory in France .
A team led by Dr Marcq has also used SPICAV to study the variation of sulphur dioxide with latitude and found that there is a gradual decrease of concentrations of the gas towards the poles .
“ This fits well with our knowledge of global circulation , ” said Dr Marcq .
“ Incoming energy from the Sun is redistributed so that the atmosphere rises near the equator and subsequently falls towards the poles .
We also see a decrease in the amounts of sulphur dioxide in the upper atmosphere , where it is destroyed by ultraviolet radiation .
Globally , our measurements confirm the downward trend in sulphur dioxide concentrations since the first measurements were made in the 1970s , which indicates that there may be active volcanism on Venus , although it has never been directly observed yet . ”
The VIRTIS and VMC team has also been able to measure the velocity of the wind at different altitudes in Venus atmosphere by analysing observations in different wavelengths .
The cloud tops at an altitude of 70 kilometres reflect visible and ultraviolet light on day side .
The lower atmosphere can be viewed on the night side in infrared wavelengths , in which radiation escapes from the lower atmosphere and the surface through narrow spectral intervals called “ transparency windows ” .
Observations of the lower cloud layer over a two year period show that the wind is nearly constant in time with no seasonal effects or variations linked to the position of the Sun in the Venusian sky .
A study , led by Dr Ricardo Hueso at the Universidad País Vasco , has found that variations in the intensity of the wind happen from time to time , especially in subpolar regions close to 65 ºS latitude .
“ The variations seem to be linked to the polar vortex which may affect latitudes beyond its overall location , however we do n’t yet have an explanation as to how this occurs , ” said Dr Hueso .
Previous studies have shown that East - West wind speeds are very high , reaching 400 km / h in the upper clouds at equatorial latitudes and 230 km/h in the lower cloud at tropical latitudes .
However , the new analysis also shows that there is almost no wind in meridional ( North - South ) directions between tropical and subpolar latitudes in the lower cloud , which is in contrast to wind speeds of around 35 km/h in the upper clouds flowing from tropics to the pole transporting heat .
Intriguingly , particular structures in the lower cloud layer may still travel North and South in this region with significant velocities of up to 40 km/h .
“ Most of the cloud structures in the lower cloud do not travel in the meridional direction but sometimes some of them travel Northwards and others Southwards .
The average of all these turbulent and chaotic motions is very close to zero but rarely some structures can travel at these high speeds of 40 km/h to the North or the South .
When we have been able to analyse further these turbulent motions in the lower cloud , we might discover important hints to the origin of the atmospheric super- rotation and finally solve the big mystery of why the winds on Venus flow faster than the planet ’s rotation , ” said Dr Hueso .
In an interview published by Gay City News over the weekend , NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg put the chances of passing a marriage equality bill in New York at zero .
“ I do n’t know how to get it to come up , ” he said , explaining his view that having the issue move to the Senate floor may prove more difficult than rounding up the votes .
“ If you want my honest opinion , ” Bloomberg continued , the Senate leadership is unlikely to move a gay marriage bill “ when I do n’t see these guys willing to stand up for less controversial issues . ”
Despite the fact that the number of states with legal gay marriage quickly shot up to six this past spring , the mayor said , “ I ‘m scared to death that the country is going in the wrong direction …
I think on other LGBT issues they are clearly moving in the direction that I think they should go and you probably do too .
It ’s the marriage thing that I do n’t see . ”
Even in New York , where Paterson and his predecessor Eliot Spitzer have been outspoken in supporting gay marriage , Bloomberg argued , “ Whether anybody who runs for governor next year will stand up for gay marriage , I ’ll bet you 25 cents no . ”
Though the Democrats did finally achieve a majority in the State Senate last November , the mayor who vows to deliver Republican votes views the composition of the Democratic caucus as a bar to action .
“ There are a lot of traditional Democratic communities that are very conservative , ” he said .
“ The black community is very conservative .
The Latino .
You know , I do n’t win any points with these communities when I go in their churches and point out I ’m very pro-choice .
I ’m very pro-gay rights .
I ’m anti-gun .
I ’m very pro-immigration .
I believe in Darwin . ”

The pro-government Basiji militiamen on the streets " really beat people and they want to kill people , " she said in an interview , asking that her last name not be published for fear of retribution .
At the time of the 1979 Islamic Revolution , " the military were in the streets but they were just soldiers , " she recalled .
" They were just doing their duty because of orders from their commander .
Most of the time they came and told people to run and not to stay , because they were afraid of their commanders . "
Last month , the 48 - year - old professor of physiology again took to the streets , again her with family , to oppose the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad amid allegations of massive vote fraud .
Three decades ago Mina , an 18 - year - old who had recently graduated from high school , took to the streets with her family to protest the injustice and tyranny of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in demonstrations that led to his overthrow .
In 1979 , so long as you did n't leave your neighborhood you were safe .
But now the fighting has spread to all parts of the capital .
" In our streets , two or three young people were killed " in recent days , she said .
Mina said she and her family went into the streets 1979 because they opposed the Shah 's autocratic rule .
" Our family were in a good economic situation , better than now , " she said .
" But at that time we thought , ' We want a change of regime for justice . '
We wanted a new system in the framework of justice .
We thought , ' The foreigners plunder our oil and money . '
We did not have independence in our foreign policy .
We thought the distance between rich people and poor people was too much . "
Even up to two years after the revolution , Mina says her family was satisfied with the changes wrought by the new clerical rulers .
" We thought we were on our golden way , " she recalled .
" We were very happy for the revolution . "
Still , she admits that when she and her family cast votes for the Islamic Republic , they did n't really understand what they were after .
People wanted these things called democracy , freedom and independence , but were n't sure what they meant . "
When the Iran - Iraq war started in 1980 , it only strengthened their support .
" We said that they forced the war on us , and OK , now we are in a war situation , and we should have patience .
And the government just told us , ' Be silent !
We are at war . ' "
But after war the ended in 1988 , they waited for positive change and got nothing .
" We wanted corruption to decrease .
We could no longer accept the government 's claim that 'we are in a special situation . '
And we started to think that we are far away from the goals we had in the revolution .
Now we want to return to those days .
We want the good thing we wished for our country back . "
Still , she said she and her family do n't long for another revolution .
They want the system to slowly change , to reform .
" We know that , with a real revolution , you can not be sure that you will arrive at your goal , " she said .

Five members of a family were found slain in their Beason , Illinois , home , authorities said Tuesday , and they urged people in the area to be cautious until the killer is found .
Police officers stand patrol outside the Gee household late Monday evening .
" This was a brutal homicide against an entire family and we are determined to identify and arrest those responsible , " Logan County Sheriff Steve Nichols said in a news conference .
He said authorities received a 911 call about a possible shooting at the home shortly before 4:30 p.m. ( 5:30 p.m. ET ) Monday .
When law enforcement officials arrived , they discovered the five bodies , Nichols said .
He identified the dead as Raymond Gee , 46 ; Ruth Gee , 39 ; Justina Constant , 16 ; Dillon Constant , 14 ; and Austin Gee , 11 .
One survivor , a 3 - year - old girl , is in a hospital in Peoria , Illinois , he said .
He did not identify the girl .
The sheriff did not release the manner of death , but said autopsies were under way Tuesday .
He warned people in the area to be cautious .
" Until we find this person , we would consider this person armed and dangerous , " Nichols said .
He did not release any further details , and it was not immediately clear if authorities had identified a suspect .
" Leads have been developed and are being vigorously pursued , " he said , without elaborating .
Beason is about 45 miles northeast of Springfield , Illinois .

Scientists at the Kaohsiung Medial University in Taiwan have discovered that the roots of a plant used in 1918 to fight the Spanish influenza pandemic produces natural antiviral compounds that kill the swine flu virus , H1N1 .
Ferula asafetida is commonly known as Dung of the Devil because of its foul - smelling sap and grows primarily in Iran , Afghanistan and mainland China .
In their tests of a group of chemical compounds contained in extracts from the plant , scientists Fang - Rong Chang and Yang - Chan
Wu discovered that some of them where more potent in killing the H1N1 virus than a prescription antiviral drug .
The plant has a long history in Chinese folk medicine and is in a genus of plants that contain more than 230 natural healing compounds , the researchers said .
They were aware that the root of the plant was used as an important remedy for the 1918 flu , so they wanted to see if the root contained an organic compound that was indeed an anti-viral .
Using plants they purchased from a Chinese herb shop in Taipei , they discovered several strong anti-viral compounds that killed the H1N1 virus .
In an article published in the American Chemical Society 's Journal of Natural Products , the researchers said the compounds " may serve as promising lead components for new drug development " against this type of flu .

( Fortune Small Business ) --
Few entrepreneurs plan to shoot their product down .
For David Lashmore , it was a necessity .
Lashmore 's company , Nanocomp Technologies , is the first in the world to make sheets of carbon nanotubes -- microscopic tubes stronger than steel but lighter than plastic .
The Pentagon has financed much of the Concord , N.H. , firm 's work ; stakes include the $ 500 million U.S. market for body and vehicle armor , which is currently dominated by DuPont 's Kevlar .
In April , Lashmore had a mechanical multicaliber gun shoot bullets at different versions of his sheet , each less than a fifth of an inch thick , at a speed of 1,400 feet per second .
Four sheets were breached , but three showed no damage .
Lashmore and his 35 employees were ecstatic .
" We did n't expect it to work at all , " he admits .
Carbon nanotubes are not new .
The superstrong molecules have excited scientists since the early 1990s .
In theory , they could be used to build superlight cars or aircraft .
But it proved difficult to grow nanotubes longer than 20 microns ( one - fifth the width of a human hair ) .
You could get the stuff only as a powder that was used to make tennis rackets and bicycles .
In 2003 , Lashmore started experimenting with carbon nanotubes at a high - tech incubator .
A year later he was making nanotubes 1,000 microns long .
That got the attention of Peter Antoinette , the former CEO of a high - tech materials company , and the pair founded Nanocomp in 2004 .
They developed a patent - pending system , controlled by a computer , that could produce large quantities of one - millimeter nanotubes .
This was long enough to start making yarn and sheets .
More than 80 % of Nanocomp 's revenue , at least $ 10 million this year , comes from the Pentagon .
" We 're funding them more than we 've ever funded any fiber project , " says engineer Philip Cunniff at the Army 's Research , Development and Engineering Center in Natick , Mass .
Army tests show the material works as well as Kevlar .
The military also hopes to replace copper wiring in planes and satellites with highly conductive nanotubes , saving millions of dollars in fuel costs .
Within four years , Antoinette says , he will be producing the nanotube textile for upward of $ 10 per 35 - gram sheet .
The price of Kevlar varies wildly depending on the application , but Nanocomp will probably have to reduce costs to roughly $ 1 a sheet to be competitive .
( DuPont makes 50,000 tons of Kevlar a year . )
Still , experts are optimistic .
" They 've solved a lot of problems , " says Ray Baughman , director of the NanoTech Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas .
" It 's a relatively near - term product . "
DuPont may soon have trouble shooting it down .

It 's no coincidence that most of those who are obsessed with population growth are post - reproductive wealthy white men : it 's about the only environmental issue for which they can't be blamed .
The brilliant Earth systems scientist James Lovelock , for instance , claimed last month that " those who fail to see that population growth and climate change are two sides of the same coin are either ignorant or hiding from the truth .
These two huge environmental problems are inseparable and to discuss one while ignoring the other is irrational . "
But it 's Lovelock who is being ignorant and irrational .
A paper published yesterday in the journal Environment and Urbanization shows that the places where population has been growing fastest are those in which carbon dioxide has been growing most slowly , and vice versa .
Between 1980 and 2005 , for instance , sub -Saharan Africa produced 18.5 % of the world 's population growth and just 2.4 % of the growth in CO 2 .
North America turned out only 4 % of the extra people , but 14 % of the extra emissions .
Sixty - three percent of the world 's population growth happened in places with very low emissions .
Even this does not capture it .
The paper points out that about one sixth of the world 's population is so poor that it produces no significant emissions at all .
This is also the group whose growth rate is likely to be highest .
Households in India earning less than 3,000 rupees ( £ 40 ) a month use a fifth of the electricity per head and one seventh of the transport fuel of households earning 30,000 rupees or more .
Street sleepers use almost nothing .
Those who live by processing waste ( a large part of the urban underclass ) often save more greenhouse gases than they produce .
Many of the emissions for which poorer countries are blamed should in fairness belong to the developed nations .
Gas flaring by companies exporting oil from Nigeria , for instance , has produced more greenhouse gases than all other sources in sub-Saharan Africa put together .
Even deforestation in poor countries is driven mostly by commercial operations delivering timber , meat and animal feed to rich consumers .
The rural poor do far less harm .
The paper 's author , David Satterthwaite , points out that the old formula taught to students of development – that total impact equals population times affluence times technology ( I = PAT ) – is wrong .
Total impact should be measured as I = CAT : consumers times affluence times technology .
Many of the world 's people use so little that they would n't figure in this equation .
They are the ones who have most children .
While there 's a weak correlation between global warming and population growth , there 's a strong correlation between global warming and wealth .
I 've been taking a look at a few super - yachts , as I 'll need somewhere to entertain Labour ministers in the style to which they are accustomed .
First I went through the plans for Royal Falcon Fleet 's RFF135 , but when I discovered that it burns only 750 litres of fuel per hour I realised that it was n't going to impress Lord Mandelson .
I might raise half an eyebrow in Brighton with the Overmarine Mangusta 105 , which sucks up 850 litres per hour .
But the raft that 's really caught my eye is made by Wally Yachts in Monaco .
The WallyPower 118 ( which gives total wallies a sensation of power ) consumes 3,400 litres per hour when travelling at 60 knots .
That 's nearly a litre per second .
Another way of putting it is 31 litres per kilometre .
Of course , to make a real splash I 'll have to shell out on teak and mahogany fittings , carry a few jetskis and a mini-submarine , ferry my guests to the marina by private plane and helicopter , offer them bluefin tuna sushi and beluga caviar , and drive the beast so fast that I mash up half the marine life of the Mediterranean .
As the owner of one of these yachts I 'll do more damage to the biosphere in 10 minutes than most Africans inflict in a lifetime .
Now we 're burning , baby .
Someone I know who hangs out with the very rich tells me that in the banker belt of the lower
Thames valley there are people who heat their outdoor swimming pools to bath temperature , all round the year .
They like to lie in the pool on winter nights , looking up at the stars .
The fuel costs them £ 3,000 a month .
One hundred thousand people living like these bankers would knacker our life support systems faster than 10 billion people living like the African peasantry .
But at least the super wealthy have the good manners not to breed very much , so the rich old men who bang on about human reproduction leave them alone .
In May the Sunday Times carried an article headlined " Billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation " .
It revealed that " some of America 's leading billionaires have met secretly " to decide which good cause they should support .
" A consensus emerged that they would back a strategy in which population growth would be tackled as a potentially disastrous environmental , social and industrial threat . "
The ultra-rich , in other words , have decided that it 's the very poor who are trashing the planet .
You grope for a metaphor , but it 's impossible to satirise .
James Lovelock , like Sir David Attenborough and Jonathan Porritt , is a patron of the Optimum Population Trust .
It is one of dozens of campaigns and charities whose sole purpose is to discourage people from breeding in the name of saving the biosphere .
But I have n't been able to find any campaign whose sole purpose is to address the impacts of the very rich .
The obsessives could argue that the people breeding rapidly today might one day become richer .
But as the super wealthy grab an ever greater share and resources begin to run dry , this , for most of the very poor , is a diminishing prospect .
There are strong social reasons for helping people to manage their reproduction , but weak environmental reasons – except among wealthier populations .
The Optimum Population Trust glosses over the fact that the world is going through demographic transition : population growth rates are slowing down almost everywhere and the number of people is likely , according to a paper in Nature , to peak this century , probably at about 10 billion .
Most of the growth will take place among those who consume almost nothing .
But no one anticipates a consumption transition .
People breed less as they become richer , but they do n't consume less – they consume more .
As the habits of the super - rich show , there are no limits to human extravagance .
Consumption can be expected to rise with economic growth until the biosphere hits the buffers .
Anyone who understands this and still considers that population , not consumption , is the big issue is , in Lovelock 's words , " hiding from the truth " .
It is the worst kind of paternalism , blaming the poor for the excesses of the rich .
So where are the movements protesting about the stinking rich destroying our living systems ?
Where is the direct action against super - yachts and private jets ?
Where 's Class
War when you need it ?
It 's time we had the guts to name the problem .
It 's not sex ; it 's money .
It 's not the poor ; it 's the rich .
On the Web , no one can hear you scream .
But no one can stop you , either .
In a world without the hard borders and the finite frame of a sheet of paper -- and without the mediating effects of various supervising editors and copy editors -- Web-centric writers are free to go on at length and without restraint about whatever topic happens to interest them .
And they do , convinced that millions of loyal readers want nothing more than for them to share their definitive takes on everything from the latest MacBook to Michael Jackson to Barack Obama to the sandwich they 're eating for lunch .
The term for speaking or writing verbosely and windily is bloviation ; and to judge from their output , certain online practitioners are more adept than a pod of humpback whales at endlessly spouting vaporous nothings .
Some even make a living at it .
After much debate , we 've rounded up our favorite Web blowhards , ten leather - lunged loudmouths whose loquacity knows no bounds .
Now , do n't get us wrong :
We love these guys ( and gal ) ; after all , they ultimately make our jobs easier .
So please take our commentary in the spirit of good fun and ( every now and then ) constructive criticism in which it is intended .
And of course , we 're not above a little blowhardism ourselves .
It 's an occupational hazard -- and if your friends and admirers wo n't tell you , who will ?

Then , last month , after the hideaway hubbub had faded , a British court found him guilty of libel and " sustained character assassination , " all but banishing him from the shores of England lest he be arrested at the airport .
( In fairness to Arrington , he refused to defend himself against the charges . )
The upshot is that his future exile options have diminished .
3. John C. Dvorak ( http://www.dvorak.org/blog/)
As hoary old sacred cows go , none are closer to " downer " cattle than the venerable John C. Dvorak , who has been expounding on computers since before computers were invented .
Dvorak 's official bio claims that the man has written more than 4000 articles , a number that seems small in view of his omnipresence .
Beneath those millions of words , Dvorak has buried just about every company and product in the industry , often ( nay , usually ) with wild prematurity .
He famously declared the iPhone a disaster months before Apple released it ; and more recently he pronounced Windows 7 to be a total mess , using a forced march of 1000 words to redeploy his argument from a comparison of Windows 7 to OS / 2 to a diatribe against the Windows Registry .
It 's bad enough that people keep giving Dvorak outlets to complain in print , but he also somehow keeps persuading people to put him on TV - - or at least on Web video .
His most noteworthy video endeavor is Cranky Geeks , a show in which Dvorak invites three tech experts ( I 've appeared twice ) to talk about current events in the industry , and then cuts them off and repeatedly changes the subject to something completely irrelevant and boring .
Also :
He had nothing at all to do with the Dvorak keyboard .

Jason Calacanis is to Nick Denton as Donald Trump is to Warren Buffett .
A serial entrepreneur , Calacanis has made a living off of building smallish , dot - commy businesses and then selling them off to outfits with much less business savvy .
His biggest hit : Selling Weblogs , Inc. ( home of the mega - tech site Engadget ) to America Online , reportedly for more than $ 25 million .
His latest play : Mahalo.com , a human - powered search engine that seems to have dedicated itself to the goal of beating Wikipedia to the top of the list on a variety of common Google search - term results .
Of course , Calacanis is n't happy just to run these various businesses .
He likes to crow about his achievements on his blog , on Twitter , on Facebook , on Flickr ... everywhere .
A master of self - promotion , Calacanis rarely lets a day go by without plugging something that 's under his thumb -- and if he has nothing to say about Mahalo , he 'll blog about whatever else comes to mind .
Recent posts have included scans of childhood photos , a weather report , and --a Calacanis trademark - - videos of his pet bulldogs .

Whether you 're a political junkie or a borderline anarchist , you can't easily escape the Web publishing machine that is Arianna Huffington ( born Arianna Stassinopoulos in 1950 ) .
Despite sounding as though it would be exclusively about herself -- seriously , what else could " The Huffington Post " cover ?-- Huffington 's " HuffPo " Web newspaper has arguably become the leading liberal political Web site ( er , excuse us , " media brand " ) on the Net .
It 's also the leading source of gale - force sententiousness , stuffed to the gills with blustery editorial after blustery editorial about every political subject under the sun .
Huffington 's actual comments appear relatively infrequently on the site -- she blogs just a few times a week -- but her influence is ubiquitous .
Kudos to Huffington for building up her brand to the point where she has become a household name .
Pity , though , about that run for California governor .
And the plagiarism lawsuit .

Lest the humble domain name throw you off , Cuban 's ego is even bigger than his supersize bankroll .
The man who created Broadcast.com and sold it to Yahoo for billions has fashioned himself as more than just the owner of a playoff - caliber but not quite championship - caliber basketball team ( whose name , incidentally , was Mavericks 20 years before he bought it ; actor James Garner owned a stake in the expansion team ) .
His blog spans myriad topics in the world of business and technology , and Cuban is altogether full of advice , mostly of value to fellow billionaires .

After decades of toiling in software startups that you 've never heard of , Winer was in the right place at the right time and became a pioneering force during the early days of the Web .
Nevertheless , he 's still working off the chip on his shoulder that came from inventing RSS and ( debatably ) blogging itself without receiving adequate credit for them .
Winer caused his biggest disturbance in the Force when he abruptly ( albeit temporarily ) shut down his free blog - hosting service , Weblogs.com , leaving thousands of users in the dark .
Hates everyone .
Tried to push the idea of providing a permalink to every paragraph in a blog , as if it were a Bible verse .

10 . David Coursey ( http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/blogs/tech_inciter.html)
Holier than thou and -- more important -- smarter than thou , Coursey ( the " Tech Inciter " ) pushes the hot - topic buttons of the day while expounding on his superior knowledge of everything from iPhone architecture to how the First Amendment should be interpreted .
Of course he does all this for PC World , so we forgive him :
He may be an opinionated loudmouth , but he 's our opinionated loudmouth .
A robot that can open doors and find electrical outlets to recharge itself .
Computer viruses that no one can stop .
Predator drones , which , though still controlled remotely by humans , come close to a machine that can kill autonomously .
Impressed and alarmed by advances in artificial intelligence , a group of computer scientists is debating whether there should be limits on research that might lead to loss of human control over computer - based systems that carry a growing share of society ’s workload , from waging war to chatting with customers on the phone .
Their concern is that further advances could create profound social disruptions and even have dangerous consequences .
As examples , the scientists pointed to a number of technologies as diverse as experimental medical systems that interact with patients to simulate empathy , and computer worms and viruses that defy extermination and could thus be said to have reached a “ cockroach ” stage of machine intelligence .
The government ’s Cash for Clunkers program has left some auto salvage yard owners angry and confused .
They said it could cut back the supply of used cars and used car parts .
" I thought I was going to buy every car from every dealer around here , and somebody ’s not giving me the information that I need , ” said Marty Cope , owner of Stillwater ’s 108 Auto and Truck Salvage .
Cope said he buys about 300 cars a month , supplying him with motors , transmissions and body parts to sell .
He said all he understands about the Cash for Clunkers program is that the old cars being traded have to be destroyed , making good used parts even harder to find .
" I ’ve got to crush those cars , ” he said .
Cope has more than 6,000 cars in the yard that need to be crushed .
According to cars.gov , the government ’s official Web site on the CARS Act , the program requires trade - in vehicles be crushed or shredded so they will not be resold for use in the U.S. or elsewhere .
Those responsible for crushing or shredding vehicles can sell some parts , but those parts cannot include the engine or drive train .
Tim Huskey , owner of Cars and Parts by Tim Inc. in Guthrie , is outraged over the federal program .
" This does n’t make smart recycling sense , adding more cars to be crushed , ” he said .
" This is taking away from a man who needs to buy an engine for an older car that he can now get for around $ 700 and installed for another $ 500 . ”
To be eligible for the Cash for Clunkers program , a trade - in vehicle must have been manufactured less than 25 years before the date of the trade - in , must have a combined city / highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less , must be in drivable condition and have been continuously insured and registered to the same owner for a full year preceding the trade .
Endangered , hunted , smuggled and now some would say abandoned , these animals have the smallest chances of recovery out off all the Earth ’s creatures .
Last year , studies shown that there are at least 35 different animals with world populations of under 1000 .
But which are the rarest , the animals on the brink of extinction ?
We have rounded up a list of 10 of the rarest animals in the wild .
These animals are so rare , they might disappear forever , and they ’re not alone !
The Pinta Island tortoise
Without argument , this turtle is one of the few species of Giant Galapagos tortoises and the rarest animal in the world since there is only one left alive .
Lonesome George is the sole surviving member of the Pinta Island race , the giant tortoise being a symbol for the fragility of the Galapagos islands , and a constant reminder for vigilence and conservation of the species .
The species was considered extinct until 1971 , when a lone example was located by rangers .
Since then , the Charles Darwin Research Station has been searching for a female tortoise , even posting a reward of $ 10,000 to those that find one .
Baiji ( Yangtze River Dolphin )
With no more than a few tens of individuals , the dolphin is one of the world ’s rarest mammals , and a victim of China ’s breakneck economic growth , competing for food with the human beings .
It has been driven to extinction due to the activity in 50 years , this being the fourth time when an entire evolutionary line of mammals has vanished from the face of the Earth since the year 1500 .
The main reason for this fact are the numerous dams and barrages , built starting in the 1930 ’s , that have fragmented the population and reduced the amount of available habitat .
There are news that the species is functionally extinct , experts still searching for members of the species .
Fingers crossed !
The Vancouver Island Marmot
This marmot is found only in the high mountainous regions of Vancouver Island , in British Columbia , the Canadian Species at Risk Act listing it as endangered in May 2000 .
In 1998 , the population reached an all - time low of 75 individuals , a captive breeding programme being started during that time .
In captivity , there are around 90 Vancouver Island marmots in four breeding facilities , while an estimated 30 members of this species live in the wild ibn 2004 .
The ultimate goal is to restore a sustainable population of 400- 600 Vancouver Island marmots in the wild , so there ’s still much to be done .
2005 was a successful year , with 150 individuals in captivity and over 44 pups born .
Seychelles Sheath - tailed Bat
Inhabiting the central granitic islands of the Seychelles Islands north of Madagascar , the bat is part of our list , being one of the most endangered animals since fewer than 100 are believed to exist in the world .
It was once commonly found in Seychelles , but the species has undergone a dramatic decline in population during the mid to late 20th century .
More research needs to be done in order to understand how the species behave and what needs to be done in order to save them .
Scientists believe that , with a heavy amount of effort , 500 individuals may be sufficient to guarantee long - term persistence of the population .
Javan Rhino
This scarce animal is one of the rhino species with fewer than 60 animals surviving in only two known locations : one in Indonesia and the other in Vietnam .
Though once widespread throughout Asia , by the 1930 ’s the rhinoceros was nearly hunted to extinction in Peninsular Malaysia , India , Burma and Sumatra .
It was poached for its horn , that is believed to have medicinal uses , and driven to extinction to the intense agricultural practices .
Even with all the conservation efforts , the Javan rhinoceros ’ chance of survival is small : the population is reduced , hence there are risks of disease and inbreeding .
Hispid hare
Also called the “ bristly rabbit ” , this hare has been recorded along the southern foothills of the Himalayan mountain chain , Nepal , , Bengal , and Assam .
Deforestation , cultivation , and human settlement had the most negative impact on the species , isolating the rabbits in Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , West Bengal and Assam .
This animal was feared extinct in 1964 , but in 1966 , one was spotted .
There were an estimated 110 hispid hares worldwide in 2001 , numbers continuing to plunge due its unsuccessful adaptation to captivity .
Northern Hairy - nosed Wombat
In the 19th century this species of wombat was present in New South Wales and Victoria but now can only be found in a small national park near Epping Forest Station in tropical Queensland .
While this area has been protected as a National Park , the native grasses that the wombat eats are overtaken by non-indigenous plants .
The Northern hairy - nosed wombat is the rarest Australian marsupial , and probably the world ’s rarest large mammal .
In the latest population study , there are an estimated 113 ( range 96 to 150 ) individual .
A major recovery program is underway , funded by the Queensland and Commonwealth governments to the tune of $ 250,000 per year .
Tamaraw ( Dwarf Water Buffalo )
Found in the the island of Mindoro in the Philippines , the tamaraw is the only endemic Phillipine bovine .
In 1900 there were an estimated 10,000 tamaraw on Mindoro , 120 in 1975 , 370 in 1987 .
It was declared critically endangered species in 2000 by the World Conservation Union and remained so until today , being threatened by agriculture , hunting or disease brought by domestic species .
The current population was estimated in 2002 at a number between 30 and 200 individuals .
Although protected by law , the illegal capture and killing of this species continues to occur .
Iberian Lynx
The Lynx , the most endangered of the world ’s 36 cats , stands on the edge of extinction .
This lynx was once distributed over the entire Iberian Peninsula but now its area is severely restricted in Andalusia .
Threatened by destruction of habitat and of its prey , the cat was killed by traps set for rabbits or hit by cars as the number of roads increase .
The Spanish Government is now in the process of developing a national conservation effort to save the Iberian Lynx .
Studies from March 2005 have estimated the number of Lynx to be as few as 100 , down from about 400 in 2000 .
On March 29 , 2005 , the birth of 3 cubs , the first born in captivity , was announced , a hope for the future reintroduction of the species .
Red Wolf
This wolf is a smaller and a more slender cousin of the gray wolf , historically ranging from southeastern United States to Florida and Texas .
Now , their home is the 1.7 million acres throughout northeastern North Carolina , including Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge .
Only 20 pure red wolves were estimated in 1980 , however the number increased to 207 captive red wolves , found in 38 captive breeding facilities across the United States .
With the successful breeding programs , over 100 red wolves currently live in the wild .
Dwarf Blue Sheep
The Dwarf Blue Sheep or Dwarf Bharal Pseudois schaeferi is an endangered species of caprid found in China and Tibet .
The dwarf blue sheep population in the world has declined to a total of 70 –200 individuals , currently being listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
The species is hunted , and in their limited range cannot escape from humans and livestock .
As of 1997 , China did not recognize them as a seperate species so efforts to conserve the species have not been initiated .
Investing in Death Betting on US Life Expectancy Proves Risky

But angry German investors are finding that Americans are n't dying as quickly as expected -- and that only the bankers are making a buck .
The PySide team is pleased to announce the first public release of PySide : Python for Qt. PySide is a project providing an LGPL 'd set of Python bindings for the Qt framework .
PySide already provides a full set of Qt bindings as well as automated binding generation tools .
Since the whole tool set has been made available , the team expects PySide to be valuable not only to Qt software developers , but to people willing to create Python bindings to any Qt - based library , or to any C++ library in general .
Although based on a different technical approach , PySide will initially be API - compatible with existing Python bindings for Qt .
PySide is still a work in progress , and some work is still required to stabilize the codebase .
This being said , the team believes it is already in a usable state , especially if an occasional rough edge and unpainted surface can be tolerated .
Due to practical reasons , the initial development efforts have been focused on Linux , but the team hopes people to join in porting the code to other platforms and to further develop the bindings and tools .
Fedor and the big wigs from Strikeforce held a conference call today to talk about the big signing and goals for the promotion now that the Russian is aboard .
Click in to read the transcript of what was said .
** PRESS RELEASE **
MMA superstar and the world ’s universally recognized No. 1 heavyweight Fedor , Senior VP & GM , Sports & Event Programming , Showtime Networks , Ken Hershman , STRIKEFORCE Founder & CEO Scott Coker and President of M - 1 Global , Vadim Finkelchtein participated in a conference call discuss the potentially game - changing announcement made earlier this week that the fervently sought - after Emelianenko had signed a historic , multi - fight agreement that will see him headline mega-events co-promoted by STRIKEFORCE and M - 1 Global .
Fedor will make his premium television debut during the fall when his first fight under the new agreement airs live on SHOWTIME ® .
Up until now , all his live fights had aired exclusively on pay - per-view in the United States .
What the participants had to say on Thursday ’s call :
OPENING COMMENTS :
SCOTT COKER : “ I ’d like to welcome the greatest heavyweight fighter of all time in Mixed Martial Arts to Strikeforce / M1 - Global in conjunction with SHOWTIME . ”
KEN HERSHMAN : “ This is an epic signing and an epic moment in Strikeforce ’s young history with SHOWTIME .
We ca n’t wait to feature Fedor on our network against the other top heavyweights out there in the world .
We ’re looking forward to a great relationship and this is the start of many great things to come . ”
VADIM FINKELCHTEIN : “ We ’re very happy to finally determine ( finalize ) our great partnership with Strikeforce .
Strikeforce is a company we ’ve known for a long time and ( it ) has been our long - lasting wish to be united with them .
We know that Strikeforce is a great company that also has a great TV platform with SHOWTIME .
From that side , they have great potential .
From our side , we have a great relationship with European and Japanese TV .
Together , the two of us will make a great partnership . ”
FEDOR EMELIANENKO : “ I ’m really very happy that we ’ve found a great partner .
I ’m very happy to fight again and I will be happy to fight for all our fans . ”
What does signing of M1 and Strikeforce mean ?
COKER : “ It ’s not just the signing with Fedor , but also the partnership with M1 .
They have a lot of resources internationally .
They have a lot of other good fighters .
Now , with the conjunction with Strikeforce , we ’re going to be able to put some sizeable ventures together and some fights that are going to be amazing .
When you talk about Fedor , he is truly the greatest heavyweight MMA fighter in the history of MMA .
When he was a free agent , everyone was after him .
For us to land him and for him to fight on SHOWTIME , I feel like we won the lottery . ‘’
Fedor , who would you like to fight ?
FEDOR : “ I do n’t know the name of the opponent yet , but I know for sure the fight will take place in the fall .
I ’ll be happy with any opponent that is offered by the organization . ”
Scott , who do you think he should fight first ?
COKER : “ I think it ’s a little premature and something that M1 , myself and Ken Hershman will have to get on a call and figure out .
It has n’t been determined yet . ”
What were the key reasons that you turned down the UFC and decided to sign with Strikeforce ?
VADIM : “ The advantage in making the deal with Strikeforce is really great because the UFC did n’t give us any chance to develop .
The UFC wants Fedor to be a fighter only for the UFC .
That ’s all they offered us .
They did n’t offer us anything else .
Dana
White stated that Fedor and M1 rejected a huge amount of money and decided to fight for nothing .
But , that ’s not true .
Nothing special was offered to M1 and Fedor during the negotiations with UFC .
When we made the deal with Strikeforce we had opportunities to show our fights in many other countries .
But the UFC would n’t give us these opportunities . ”
Fedor , a lot of fighters fight well into their 40s .
Do you have that in mind to get set financially for the future ?
FEDOR : “ I do n’t think that the age is important .
I would like to develop MMA and I would like to also earn some money .
If Strikeforce was able to offer the same ( a better ) deal as the UFC , why should we go to the UFC ? ”
Scott , can you respond to Dana ( White ’s ) comments that Strikeforce has no money and that they ’ll put you out of business ?
COKER : “ The comments that were just made a little bit ago were that we had no money , we ’re Strikefarce ?
My response to that is of course he ’s going to say that .
He ’s a promoter .
He ’s going to go out and say what he ’s going to say .
We ’ve been in business a long time and we know how to operate a business .
We ’ve forged a relationship with Ken and SHOWTIME and M1 .
I feel very confident that we ’re going to have some great , big shows with Fedor . “
Are you surprised about his ( White ’s ) comments ?
COKER : “ Under the current circumstances , is anybody surprised ?
I do n’t think so . ”
Vadim , when the Affliction show was cancelled , did you go to UFC first and then Strikeforce ?
Or did you shop around for the best option for you ?
VADIM : “ When he came to America , we already had a plan to meet with Lorenzo Ferttita and Dana White to hear the offers from the UFC .
We wanted them ( Fedor and UFC ) to meet each other and we wanted also to listen to the offer . ”
Scott , it has been written that Fedor might not get an immediate title shot .
What is the thought process of that ?
COKER : “ I did n’t say that we would and I did n’t say that we would n’t .
I think that our champion , Alistair Overeem , and the M1 champ , Fedor , would be a fantastic fight .
That probably will happen at some point .
I have to circle back with everyone involved including SHOWTIME .
We ’ll make a decision and let everybody know . ”
Do you have an update on Overeem ?
COKER : “ As of right now , no .
I know he re-injured his hand , what was that two or three weeks ago ?
I ’m sure he ’ll be ready to fight in the fall . ”
Ken , what is SHOWTIME ’s approach to get the word out about Fedor ?
HERSHMAN : “ We ’re actually beginning our planning now .
We ’re going to start with some pieces that we can market on SHOWTIME and across the Internet to start introducing Fedor .
For us , Fedor is a sold commodity among the hard - core fans .
Everyone recognizes him as the best fighter in the world .
So , what we have to do is reach beyond the hard - core fan base and reach the casual fan and the regular , general sports fans and begin to generate some excitement out there .
This is the most exciting fighter out there .
Even if you ’re not a hard - core Mixed Martial Arts fan , you ’re still going to get a lot of excitement watching him do his thing in the cage .
It ’s a big task , but we ’re up to it .
We have some great support from our partners and we ’ve got some exciting stuff to come . ”
Fedor , can you respond to Dana ’s comments that you do n’t want to fight the best in the world and that you do n’t give an ( expletive ) about the fans ?
FEDOR : “ The last two fights I had really great opponents . ”
VADIM : “ I wonder who Dana White considers to be the best fighters .
The fighter that has their belt has a 4 - 1 record .
Maybe these fighters have become the product of the great PR machine of the UFC .
Also , Brett Rogers is a very good opponent and a much better opponent for Fedor and for fans .
He ’s had 10 fights and no losses . ”
Scott , do you have any plans on when you would like to do a PPV with Fedor ?
COKER : “ With Fedor , we have a great opportunity to have a heavyweight fighter at that level and really the hottest free agent on the market .
We ’ll probably enter the PPV business , but I think that ’s probably going to be six to nine months away .
In the meantime , we will sit down with Ken and everybody and talk about how we get there and what we need to do .
But , the first fight will be live on SHOWTIME and everybody will be able to watch it for free on SHOWTIME . ”
Scott , Strikeforce has had a financially prudent history .
Can you reveal how this is possible for your organization to take on this financial burden ?
COKER : “ We ’ve always been committed to getting the best fighters , and building our roster .
With the partnerships with M1 we ’re just continuing that vision .
Fedor is a great opportunity .
How often does that come along ?
How often does a free agent at that level come along ?
We talked to our partners , who are solid guys and the backbone behind Strikeforce .
We made the decision with SHOWTIME and said ‘ let ’s go make this partnership and let ’s go for it . ’
“ It ’s going to be a great opportunity for everybody .
If we thought is was going to be a situation where we were going to be losing money and going out of business , there would have been no way we would have done it .
We created a formula that we thought worked for everybody .
It ’s really complicated and I ca n’t get into it .
But , we ’re going to be fine and it ’s going to be great for the fans .
It ’s going to be free on SHOWTIME .
I think it ’s a win - win for everybody involved . ”
How did the other companies he fought for not succeed ?
COKER : “ Here ’s the thing .
Those other companies , it was n’t their core business .
All those companies , their core business was n’t the martial arts fight business .
M1 has been around a long time and has been a very successful promotion .
We ’ve been around a long time .
We ’re going to be around a long time .
M1 is going to be around a long time and SHOWTIME is going to be around a long time .
It ’s our core business .
If people stick to their core competency , they ’re going to be fine .
That ’s really the definition of why these companies went out of business . ”
Fedor , do you feel that you know all the ins and outs to the business of M1 and where your money is going ?
FEDOR : “ I have full control of all my contracts and my career .
I get financial reports all the time .
All contracts and all important issues are discussed with me .
Everything that I do n’t like , Vadim tries to fix for me .
I have full control of everything that is going on . ”
Fedor , what did you learn from the decision to sign with Affliction instead of UFC ?
FEDOR : “ From my viewpoint , the UFC does not have the proper attitude to fighters .
The UFC attitude towards fighters is not a good one .
They do n’t treat them like human beings .
And I do n’t like their policy .
The offer that we got was one kind , and then on the Internet they published really different numbers .
The offer they gave us was really miserable . ”
Scott , will Strikeforce ever hold a grand prix tournament in the future ?
COKER : “ That ’s a great question .
It ’s something we ’ve talked about with SHOWTIME , but there are no definite plans right now .
I like the format of the tournament , but we have no plans right now . ”
If Fedor loses , does that affect your strategy ?
COKER : “ Every fighter at some point could possibly lose .
In MMA , a fighter can lose .
Fedor has consistently beaten everybody .
If he loses , it can happen to everybody .
Oscar De La Hoya lost .
Muhammad Ali lost .
All the great boxers have lost .
In MMA , I do n’t think it affects you as much as in other sports . ”
Scott , what does being able to claim the No. 1 fighter in the world do for your company ?
COKER : “ Whoever he fights , it ’s going to be a great fight for the fans and the fighters . ”
Ken , can you explain how involved SHOWTIME was in the process ?
HERSHMAN : “ We were involved enough to lend support and to show everyone how much we valued Fedor .
Beyond that , I really ca n’t say how involved we were .
We ’re really thrilled that this came together .
I have to give props to Strikeforce for doing the heavy lifting . ”
Do you think in general that M1 has been portrayed accurately in the press ?
FEDOR : “ There are a lot of people who take the side of the UFC and there a lot of people who take the side of M1 .
I think that if the numbers that were published on the Internet were real numbers , we would have signed with the UFC .
All the numbers that were published were just rumors . ”
VADIM : “ I do n’t think that M1 ’s interests are shown in the media in an accurate way .
We are a very young organization and we do n’t have a huge PR machine .
Fedor was able to achieve the image that he has right now by fighting in a lot of different organizations .
Fedor ’s name outside of the U.S. is much bigger than the name of the UFC .
If Fedor had come to the UFC , he ’d make the UFC famous outside of the U.S.
All the accusations that were made are false ones . ”
Scott , was the fact that M1 has already broken into the global market a factor ?
COKER : “ They have already promoted fights all over the world .
I think that ’s when partnerships should happen .
They brought a lot to the table , including Fedor , and we brought a lot to the table .
I think we ’re going to have a lot of great fights . ”
Fedor , a lot of fight fans are angry that you ’ve deprived them of a fight with Brock Lesnar .
Does that bother you ?
FEDOR : “ I really feel sorry that the fight could not happen and I feel sorry for my fans .
But , I think I also deserve some respect and I also think my personal interests should be taken into consideration . ”
CLOSING COMMENTS :
COKER : “ We ’re happy to have the M1 partnership and we ’re happy to have Fedor aboard .
Stay tuned , we ’re going to have some great announcements in the future .
A lot of people may say that they are n’t happy with Fedor now , but come fight time you know they ’re all going to tune in . ”
VADIM : “ The contract with Strikeforce shows our big stage ( just got bigger ) .
Fedor managed to step into the hearts of a lot of Japanese people .
With the Strikeforce partnership , Fedor will be able to step into the hearts of a lot of American people as well .
M1 global is a company that makes a lot of deals , not only the deal with Strikeforce .
We conduct a lot of championships all over the world .
Just give us some time .
When you think about Brock Lesnar , nobody knew him a year ago .
Just give us some time and M1 Global and Strikeforce will be able to achieve our goals . ”
FEDOR : “ Thank you very much for the interesting questions .
I would like to clear up all of the questions on the Internet .
All the decisions regarding my fights are made by me , then Vadim makes the public announcement .
I feel really sorry that my fans wo n’t be able to see the fight with Brock Lesnar in the near future .
But , I know that they will be able to see other fights with great opponents .
I would like to stress once again that besides my fans ’ interests , there is my personal interests that the UFC did n’t want to meet . ”
In an unprecedented disclosure , the FDIC has highlighted that it expects the DIF reserve ratio to be negative as of September 30 .
As there are a whopping 48 hours before that deadline , one can safely assume that the DIF is now well into negative territory : as of today depositors have no insurance courtesy of a banking system that has leeched out all the capital of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
Let 's pray there is no run on the bank soon .
Pursuant to these requirements , staff estimates that both the Fund balance and the reserve ratio as of September 30 , 2009 , will be negative .
This reflects , in part , an increase in provisioning for anticipated failures .
In contrast , cash and marketable securities available to resolve failed institutions remain positive .
Additionally , the FDIC has now raised its expectation for bank failure costs from $ 70 billion $ 100 billion .
Feel free to expect this number to continue growing .
Staff has also projected the Fund balance and reserve ratio for each quarter over the next several years using the most recently available information on expected failures and loss rates and statistical analyses of trends in CAMELS downgrades , failure rates and loss rates .
Staff projects that , over the period 2009 through 2013 , the Fund could incur approximately $ 100 billion in failure costs .
Staff projects that most of these costs will occur in 2009 and 2010 .
Approximately $ 25 billion of the $ 100 billion amount has already been incurred in failure costs so far in 2009 .
Staff projects that most of these costs will occur in 2009 and 2010 .
First Mary Schapiro has failed at her task of " regulating " anything on Wall Street , and now Sheila Bair presides over a newly insolvent institution .
Chalk one up to Washington 's success at " containing " the crisis .
Zero Hedge wishes Ms. Bair all the luck in the world in returning the DIF to its statutory minimum requirement of 1.15 % of all insured deposits ( a shortfall of a mere hundred billion or so ) .
Maybe she can convert the FDIC to a REIT and have Merrill Lynch do a concurrent IPO and follow - on offering ( while Goldman raises it to a Conviction Buy which incorporates the firm 's expectations for 10 % GDP growth in 2010 coupled with projections for $ 1,000 per barrel of crude ) ?

No , I Will Not Molest Your Kids
My uncle Sid turned 80 the other day .
He 's a pretty tough old guy , so it did n't surprise me that he made it such a good age ( though I think it surprised him ) .
Naturally , a celebration was in order , so his wife Betty organised a birthday bash for their extended family .
Betty is actually my Grandad 's sister , so although I knew a bunch of people at the party , there were a fair few I had never met before .
When you have a party with a large number of related people , you expect there to be a few kids present .
People get married and have kids with a certain regularity so there always seem to be a few running around at these kinds of parties .
This time was no exception .
Among the guests were a few of my cousins ( aged 11 and 12 ) , my second cousins ( aged 11 , 14 and 15 ) and two younger children , Dylan and Maggie ( aged 2 and 5 respectively ) .
Since I 'm the youngest legal adult in our extended family who actually shows up to these kinds of events , it 's usually expected that I 'll look after any of the kids who are present .
It 's kind of an unspoken agreement between my relatives and I .
Some people might resent that , but I enjoy it because I love being around kids .
Ugh , who would want to be around other people 's horrible snot - nosed brats all the time ?
I would , actually .
Part of it comes from the fact that I have a fairly unique problem ; kids adore me .
Seriously .
I have no idea why , but usually no more than half an hour after meeting me , they 're following me around like they 've known me forever .
My Mum sometimes jokes that " NiceGuy is doing his Pied Piper impression again " , which she finds hilarious .
I do n't have any children of my own , but I really fail to understand how some people can dislike kids so much .
I admit some behave like little horrors , but it 's always seemed to me that they become much more agreeable if they know you wo n't put up with that kind of behaviour .
Anyway , on with the show .
My poor cousins were looking bored out of their brains .
I can't say I blame them .
They really did n't have anyone else to talk to or anything to do , so I decided that I 'd chat to them for a little while .
I 'd probably have stayed talking to them longer , but then lunch was served so everyone made a rush for the food .
When I went to sit down with my lunch at the table my Father and I had claimed earlier , we had a new guest sitting with us .
He was a shy two - year - old dressed in designer children 's clothes called Dylan .
He was sitting with my father 's cousin Bruce , and he spent a lot of time trying to hide behind Bruce 's jacket .
Bruce tried his best to introduce him properly , but Dylan 's only response was to smile and then push his face into Bruce 's jacket again .
Doing silly things is always a good way to attract a child 's attention .
I started sticking the little plastic " 80's " that were scattered around the table on my face and acted like nothing was amiss .
The look of amazement on Dylan 's face was priceless .
Everyone else at the table was chuckling .
I was a hit !
Dylan forgot his shyness and decided that if it worked for me , he 'd give it a try .
His attempts to stick little plastic table decorations on his face were so comical that everyone roared with laughter .
Dylan grinned as he was now the centre of attention .
I was secretly pleased with myself .
After a full lunch , Betty announced that we would have to wait for the cake to be served .
It was n't quite ready yet , so everyone started to mill around again .
I spotted a little girl over in the corner of the yard who looked like she was desperately trying to entertain herself with a small inflateable beach ball .
Emboldened by my success with Dylan , I walked up to her and snapped up the beach ball before she could react .
" Hey ! "
" It 's mine now " , I grinned .
" I want it back ! " she said , stamping her foot .
" Are you sure ? " I asked slyly .
" Yes !
Yes !
Give it back ! "
" OK . "
I bounced the beachball off her head .
She stood there in open - mouthed astonishment .
" You were too slow !
I gave it back to you and you did n't even take it . "
" You cheated ! " she said with an accusing tone .
I bounced the beachball of her head again and smiled mischeviously .
I saw a moment of confusion cross her face , and then a smile slowly appeared .
" You ca n't hit me again !
I 'm too fast ! " she squealed , daring me to throw the beach ball at her again .
We spent the next few minutes trading taunts back and forth as the beach ball flew around the yard .
Her little brother , obviously deciding he did n't want to be left out , rushed to be part of the game .
The little girl told me her name was Maggie , and that her little brother was Dylan ( I already knew of course , but I did n't want to spoil her proud introduction of him ) .
Dylan laughed wildly every time the beach ball bounced off his head .
Maggie was having a great time " hiding " from her younger brother every time he grabbed the ball .
I was having fun too - who would n't ?
I mistimed a throw and managed to stumble .
Feigning injury , I crumpled melodramatically .
" Ow !
She got me ! "
In a flash , Dylan was climbing on me , laughing himself silly .
Maggie took full advantage of the situation to repeatedly bounce the beachball off my head .
They stopped dead a moment later though .
" That 's enough you two ! "
Their mother , Sally , had appeared out of nowhere with a stern expression on her face .
The children did n't move an inch , and I could see that Maggie looked particularly upset .
As I stood up and brushed myself off , Sally gathered the children behind her .
" Dylan likes to climb like that on his father " , she said as she looked at me suspiciously .
She folded her arms , and I could see an unspoken accusation in her eyes .
" I 'll go and talk to my wife . "
Like most women , she just had to try and get in one last dig .
" I think that would be best . "
I was faintly embarrassed by her behaviour .
In the past I probably would have gotten angry , but I just could n't be bothered .
I was here for Uncle Sid 's birthday , not to put some over - protective mother in her place .
I knew the look she had given me , because I 'd seen it before .
I used to teach music , and it was the same look that myself and the other male teachers used to get on a depressingly regular basis .
She had decided ( using her " women 's intuition " no doubt ) that I was going to molest her kids .
There was no point in trying to talk to her any further , or worse , attempting to talk to her children as any further communication would be taken as further evidence that she was right .
I do n't blame people for being protective of their children , but enough is enough .
How on earth was I going to molest her children in front of over 50 adults sitting not 5 yards away ?
I 'm sick of the irrational fear of men that has developed over the last 10 years .
It 's one of the reasons I quit teaching music , in fact .
The risk was just too great that an accusation would be made .
The young guy teaching to a class full of students in the room next to me was dragged through the mud by a hysterical mother who claimed he " touched her daughter " in front of a class of 20 students with a half - dozen parents looking on !
Not one of the parents who were in the room were prepared to stand up and defend him , but all quietly acknowledged to the director of the school that nothing had happened .
Frankly , he got lucky , because the next time that woman accused him , there were no parents watching the class .
Fortunately , she had very little credibility left at that point .
To say he was a nervous wreck after that would be an understatement though .
It is n't pleasant to viewed as a potential child molester .
Those kids were having a great time , and I was no threat to them .
If I had been a perfect stranger , I might have even been prepared to be understanding , but this was a family gathering .
Granted , I had n't met Sally before , but I had met her husband ( who was nowhere to be seen , sadly ) .
There 's a lot I want to say , but it would sound more like an incoherent rant than anything else .
Men , in the general sense , are not a threat to children .
In fact I would suggest that men's increasing absence from childhood activities has caused tangible harm .
Men have been gradually driven out of children 's lives by a moral panic fed largely by the fears of mums like Sally , and I 'm sick of it .
Apparently it 's even official policy for companies like British Airways to separate men and children now .
I sat down and quietly finished the piece of cake my father had grabbed for me .
Ugh .
Just what I need - more sugar .
Now I was going to have to work it off .
I looked over at my cousins Kyle and Mikey .
I pulled myself to my feet and walked over to them .
" Come on guys , let 's go play some dodgeball at the park across the road . "
My aunt looked at me with tangible relief .
" Oh would you darl ?
That would be wonderful .
The boys have been beside themselves with boredom . "
" It 's no problem .
It 'll be fun , and help me work off that cake I just ate . "
Kyle and Mikey perked up right away and set about hunting for tennis balls and other things to take with them to the park .
Sally stood there scowling at me the whole time .
Just to make sure I knew not to try anything funny .
Sorry Sally , nobody is going to molest your kids today , so take your righteous indignation and find a better use for it .

Return to Niceguy 's Land of the Losers Page
Economist Hyman Minsky , who never got much attention while he was alive , has become one of the big celebrities of this financial crisis .
In Sunday ’s Boston Globe , Stephen Mihm has the best account of Minsky ’s life and significance that I ’ve seen so far .
A sample :
Today most economists , it ’s safe to say , are probably reading Minsky for the first time , trying to fit his unconventional insights into the theoretical scaffolding of their profession .
If Minsky were alive today , he would no doubt applaud this belated acknowledgment , even if it has come at a terrible cost .
As he once wryly observed , “ There is nothing wrong with macroeconomics that another depression [ wo n’t ] cure . ”
But did Minsky really have much to add beyond the crucial insight that financial systems are inherently unstable ?
His former student Eric Falkenstein , responding on his blog to Mihm ’s article , is n’t so sure :
I was Minsky ’s TA while a senior at Washington University in St. Louis in 1987 , and took a couple of his advanced classes , which regardless of the official name , were all just classes in Minskyism .
He was a maverick , but perhaps a bit too much , being a little too dismissive of others , as he hated the traditional Samuelson / Solow Keynesians as much as the Friedmanite Monetarists .
He always thought a market collapse was just around the corner .
The S&P was 250 when I took his course , it went to 1500 in 2007 and then back to 735 in 2009 .
Does that prove he was right all along ? …
The problem … is that his top - down theory is rejected by the data .
Aggregate leverage ratios do not closely correspond to business cycles .
If Minsky took microeconomics more seriously he could have made his theory more relevant , by noting that crises tend to occur in specific subsets in the economy : in 1990 , hotels and Commercial real estate , in 2001 , high tech , in 2008 , mortgages .
The mistake is not one made in aggregate , but in different sectors each recession .
By noting these areas , but not the aggregate economy , had too much leverage , and depended on expected future increases in collateral value , he might have been more successful proselytizing his colleagues .
But he was a traditional Keynesian , who liked to look at aggregate equations , like Profits =Investment +
Deficits + Net Imports .
I think the broader point here is that there is no one Theory That Explains Everything in economics .
Neoclassical economics certainly does n’t explain everything .
Neither does Minskyism .
Nor Austrian business cycle theory .
Nor complexity theory .
It seems like the best approach would be an eclectic one that takes lots of different economic models into account .
But eclecticism does n’t get you far in academia .
Iran ’s Imperial Presidency
Taking advantage of the chaos following June ’s civic protests , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is moving to consolidate authority in the executive office — and to wrest it away from the clerical wing of the Iranian government , particularly Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution , Iran ’s revolutionary leader , the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , had established a guardianship of Islamic jurists headed by a supreme leader to oversee the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of Iran ’s government .
Khamenei , who became supreme leader in 1989 , was a mentor to Ahmadinejad and during June ’s protests , quickly endorsed his presidential candidacy to keep their relationship smooth .
Although Ahmadinejad had begun centralizing authority during his first presidential term , he usually deferred to Khamenei if there was a divergence of opinion .
But Ahmadinejad and his cohorts , junior members of the 1979 revolution who are just now coming into their own politically , are not themselves clerics .
And though they claim deep religiosity , they are best described as secularists , as their primary aim is consolidating political power in their own hands .
Since the recent election , members of the executive branch are openly disregarding revolutionary or activist mullahs — knowing full well that most clerics are quietists who prefer not to be directly involved in politics .
Even Ahmadinejad ’s famous incident of kissing Khamenei ’s shoulder or characterizing their relationship as " like that of a father and son " is just etiquette , not a sincere sign of deference .
Ahmadinejad ’s secular political expansionism is made possible by the schisms and weaknesses that have emerged among fundamentalist clerics in the wake of this summer ’s election protests .
Most threatening for Iran ’s religious system of governance , the protesters ’ focus expanded from the rigged presidential election to the more basic question of why Iran needs a faith - based supreme leader .
The idea of cutting out the theocratic branch , while retaining the executive , legislative , and judicial ones , has gained considerable popularity .
Ahmadinejad saw a power vacuum among the clergy , plus the shifting tide of public sentiment against theocracy , and moved pragmatically to fill it — though not in ways that a majority of Iranians desire .
Recently , Ahmadinejad ’s chief of staff , Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , suggested , " The era of religious sovereignty is over " — and to all appearances , he is right .
Ahmadinejad ’s new presidential administration prevented the usual prayers for mercy and salvation at Khomeini ’s mausoleum .
Additionally , he and his cohort canceled Eid al - Fitr , or fast - breaking ceremonies that mark the end of Ramadan , at traditional locations in Tehran .
They even are determining who may or may not address prayer congregations at the clerics ’ home base , the city of Qom .
To mitigate religion - based criticism of his policies , Ahmadinejad convened the first meeting of his new cabinet ministers in the shadow of the tomb of the eighth imam , or spiritual guide , in the northeastern Iranian holy city of Mashhad .
But in fact , Ahmadinejad ’s new cabinet appointments reveal the extent of his power grab .
When thanking parliamentarians for confirming a majority of the cabinet nominees on Sept.
4 , Ahmadinejad laid out his political vision : " We should not leave the burden of administering the country on the shoulders of the [ supreme ] leader , the religious scholars , and other [ clerics ] .
We must administer the country according to Islamic , revolutionary , and pragmatic values . "
Notably , Ahmadinejad has appointed only one cleric , Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi , to a cabinet position ( as opposed to three clerics in his last administration ) , and Moslehi has ties to secular radicals via the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) , where he served as a commissioner , as well as to the supreme leader .
So his appointment is politically safe for the president .
It is also strategically safe because the Intelligence Ministry is packed with Ahmadinejad loyalists , who will stand up to Moslehi if Khamenei tries to use him as a puppet .
Ahmadinejad is also appointing women to his cabinet , in a direct rebuff to fundamentalist ayatollahs who are demanding , on orthodox religious grounds , that women not hold senior positions in Iran ’s government .
He successfully appointed a female loyalist as health minister and is expected to nominate women as ministers of welfare and education , even though his previous female nominees to those cabinet positions were recently turned down by parliament .
Iranian sources have indicated that Ahmadinejad is using the IRGC and its paramilitary wing , the Basij , to centralize power within the executive branch .
The upper ranks of the IRGC and Basij served as training grounds for many of the increasingly secular militants now in power , including the president himself , who was an influential Basij organizer while studying at the University of Tehran .
During Ahmadinejad ’s first term , the IRGC used its presidential connections to acquire major financial stakes in important industrial sectors that were being privatized .
In exchange for helping Ahmadinejad by intimidating clerics and ordinary citizens , the IRGC and Basij are only deepening their hold over the Iranian economy , and it is growing increasingly difficult to untangle the IRGC ’s economic interests from its national security role .
The prospect of ostensibly private companies working closely with the executive branch could strengthen the president ’s hand .
But this is Iran , where politics have become a blood sport ; this game is far from over .
Khamenei will likely seek to wrest back authority via fundamentalist members of the judiciary and parliament .
However , the new judiciary chief , Sadeq Larijani , has political ambitions of his own and so might chart a course between the supreme leadership and presidency .
Likewise , the parliament is headed by Sadeq ’s elder brother Ali , who previously served as Iran ’s nuclear negotiator with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
The Larijani family is known to have its own public base of support independent of both the weakened supreme leader and the autocratic president .
Ali Larijani in particular has been critical of both Khamenei and Ahmadinejad in the recent election fiasco .
Many Iranians expect the 51 - year - old Ali to remain a political moderate in order to emerge as a major candidate for the presidency in 2013 .
So far , however , the supreme leadership , judiciary , and parliament have only mitigated , not prevented , Ahmadinejad ’s growing authority .
Activist mullahs such as Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpayegani , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati ( originally another mentor of the president ) , and Ahmad Khatami have been critical of Ahmadinejad ’s secularist official appointments , elevation of women to high - ranking posts , and disregard of the supreme leader ’s directives .
They and other fundamentalists are coming together , despite past differences , to fight back , and will work through the Guardian Council , the conservative wing of the Assembly of Experts , and hard - line clerical associations to thwart the president if possible .
So too will more moderate clerical politicians like Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , Mohammad Khatami , and Mehdi Karroubi , who once also were part of Iran ’s Islamic Revolution but have gradually united with ordinary Iranians to oppose both fundamentalism and autocracy .
But for now , the president and his supporters are on their way toward creating an imperial presidency bereft of both theocratic and democratic oversight .
The announcement of comprehensive talks between Iran and major world powers in October has only strengthened Ahmadinejad ’s hand , especially given that what the West really wishes to discuss —
Iran ’s nuclear program — is not up for negotiation .
As prominent Iranians like the sociopolitically moderate Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri and activist Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani — daughter of the former president and a former parliamentarian herself — have cautioned fearfully , the Islamic Republic of Iran under Ahmadinejad " soon will be neither Islamic nor a republic . "
Yet Ahmadinejad ’s imperial presidency is far from a done deal .
The competing groups of secular radicals , theocratic fundamentalists , and clerical moderates might end up neutralizing each other ’s influence over Iranian politics .
Consequently , factional struggles within the fragmenting revolutionary hierarchy may very well benefit the re-emergence of democracy in Iran by generating public space for secular , moderate politicians .
Ahmadinejad ’s play for an imperial presidency could end up leading to a very different future for Iran than he imagines .
Internet criminals have long used so - called Trojan software to infect their victim 's computers and launch sneak attacks from the inside out .
But could they now be putting a new spin on the concept by actually planting the hardware too ?
That 's one theory emerging after Joe Manchin , the governor of West Virginia , suddenly had five new laptops delivered to his office .
The computers arrived earlier this month , but diligent bureaucrats checked the records and discovered that they had not been ordered by the administration .
While eternal optimists might hope that some friendly citizen decided their governor would like some new computers , officials suspect that it is unlikely to be an act of altruism .
Computerworld quotes West Virginia 's chief technology Kyle Schafer , who says that " our expectation is that this is not a gesture of good will " .
Although no malicious code has yet been found on the computers , the FBI is now looking into where these mystery machines came from - and the evidence is beginning to point towards something sinister , given that similar incidents have also taken place in Vermont and Wyoming .
It 's quite easy to understand the appeal of this approach for a cybercriminal .
After all , government workers have access to amazing amounts of data , and they are not always careful about safeguarding it .
And if you want to get through the security barriers , what 's better than an inside job ?
Planting hardware is something that almost worked for the attempted £ 220 m raid on the London offices of Japanese bank Sumitomo back in 2004 , where keyloggers were snuck into the bank 's computers .
But that strike was foiled by police - and so far it does n't appear that the provider of the mystery laptops has succeeded in accessing any valuable information either .
The investigation continues .
Joe Thornton has found that evolution 's backward is blocked by mutations .
Credit : University of Oregon
( PhysOrg.com ) -- A University of Oregon research team has found that evolution can never go backwards , because the paths to the genes once present in our ancestors are forever blocked .
The findings -- the result of the first rigorous study of reverse evolution at the molecular level -- appear in the Sept. 24 issue of Nature .
The team used computational reconstruction of ancestral gene sequences , DNA synthesis , protein engineering and X - ray crystallography to resurrect and manipulate the gene for a key hormone receptor as it existed in our earliest vertebrate ancestors more than 400 million years ago .
They found that over a rapid period of time , five random mutations made subtle modifications in the protein's structure that were utterly incompatible with the receptor 's primordial form .
The discovery of evolutionary bridge burning implies that today 's versions of life on Earth may be neither ideal nor inevitable , said Joe Thornton , a professor in the UO 's Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
" Evolutionary biologists have long been fascinated by whether evolution can go backwards , " Thornton said , " but the issue has remained unresolved because we seldom know exactly what features our ancestors had , or the mechanisms by which they evolved into their modern forms .
We solved those problems by studying the problem at the molecular level , where we can resurrect ancestral proteins as they existed long ago and use molecular manipulations to dissect the evolutionary process in both forward and reverse directions . "
Thornton 's team , which included UO research scientist Jamie Bridgham and collaborator Eric A. Ortlund , a biochemist at Atlanta 's Emory University , focused on the evolution of a protein called the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) , which binds the hormone cortisol and regulates the stress response , immunity , metabolism and behavior in humans and other vertebrates .
" This fascinating study highlights the value of studying evolutionary processes , " said Irene Eckstrand , who oversees evolution grants at the National Institutes of Health 's National Institute of General Medical Sciences .
" By showing how molecular structures are finely tuned by evolution , Dr. Thornton 's research will have a broad impact on basic and applied sciences , including the design of drugs that target specific proteins . "
In previous work , Thornton 's group showed that the first GR evolved more than 400 millions ago from an ancestral protein that was also sensitive to the hormone aldosterone .
They then identified seven ancient mutations that together caused the receptor to evolve its new specificity for cortisol .
Once Thornton 's team knew how the GR 's modern function evolved , they wondered if it could be returned to its ancestral function .
So they resurrected the GR as it existed soon after cortisol specificity first evolved -- in the common ancestor of humans and all other vertebrates with bones -- and then reversed the seven key mutations by manipulating its DNA sequence .
' We expected to get a promiscuous receptor just like the GR 's ancestor , but instead we got a completely dead , non-functional protein , " Thornton said .
" Apparently other mutations that occurred during early GR evolution acted as a sort of evolutionary ratchet , rendering the protein unable to tolerate the ancestral features that had existed just a short time earlier . "
To identify the mutations , Thornton 's team prepared crystals of resurrected ancient GR proteins and took them to the particle accelerator at the Advanced Photon Source outside Chicago , where they used powerful X - rays to determine the protein 's atomic structure before and after the shift in function .
By comparing the precise atomic maps of each protein , they identified five specific mutations in the later version of the GR that clashed with the architecture of the earlier protein .
" Suppose you 're redecorating your bedroom -- first you move the bed , then you put the dresser where the bed used to be , " Thornton said .
" If you decide you want to move the bed back , you can't do it unless you get that dresser out of the way first .
The restrictive mutations in the GR prevented evolutionary reversal in the same way . "
When Thornton 's group set the five mutations back to their ancestral state , the protein could now tolerate having the seven key changes reversed , which then transformed it into a promiscuous receptor just like the its ancestor .
Despite their powerful role as a ratchet preventing reversal , the five restrictive mutations had little or no direct effect on the protein 's function when they occurred .
And although they must be reversed before the protein can tolerate the ancestral state , reversing them first does absolutely nothing to enhance the ancestral function .
" This means that even if the ancestral function were suddenly to become optimal again , there 's no way natural selection could drive the protein directly back to its ancestral form , " Thornton said .
GR 's evolutionary irreversibility suggests that the molecules that drive our biology today may not be inevitable products of the evolutionary process .
" In the GR 's case , restrictive mutations erased the conditions that previously opened up the ancestral form as an evolutionary possibility .
It 's likely that throughout history other kinds of restrictive mutations have taken place , closing off innumerable trajectories that evolution might otherwise have taken , " Thornton speculated .
" If we could wind back the clock and allow history to unfold again , different sets of mutations , apparently inconsequential at the time , would almost certainly occur , opening up some potential paths and blocking others -- including the one that leads to the present that actually evolved in our world , " he said .
" If what we observed in GR evolution is a general phenomenon , then the biology we have is just one of many possible rolls of the evolutionary dice . "

WILSONVILLE -- Members of the Brother Speed outlaw motorcycle club rolled into a bloody 26 - bike crash on Interstate 5 north Friday afternoon , south of Wilsonville .
" When we arrived on scene , it was ordered mayhem , " said Lt. Mike Towner of Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue .
" There were ... two dozen motorcycles scattered across the freeway . "
Two bikers with critical injuries were flown by LifeFlight helicopter to Legacy Emanuel Hospital & Health Center and OHSU Hospital in Portland .
Seven other crash victims with less serious injuries were taken by ambulance .
Northbound lanes at Milepost 282 , near the Baldock Rest Area , were shut down at 2:45 p.m. , then remained closed for more than an hour , backing up traffic for more than seven miles .
Southbound traffic also experienced delays .
The bikers were heading north to take part in the Portland chapter 's annual birthday bash and a weekend demolition derby , according to one law enforcement official .
Lt. Gregg Hastings , Oregon State Police spokesman , said 26 motorcycles were traveling north in the left lane , following a car , when traffic ahead began slowing .
The car and the bikers all tried to slow down , but collided , piling up on the road .
A vehicle in the middle northbound lane was reportedly struck by one of the motorcycles , Hastings said .
State troopers rushed to the crash scene , along with crews from the Oregon Department of Transportation , Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue , American Medical Response and fire departments from Canby , Aurora and St. Paul .
Karen Eubanks , TVF&R spokeswoman , said seven crash victims were treated for shoulder and hip injuries and broken bones .
Two others were treated but refused to go to a hospital .
Police estimate membership of the Brother Speed Motorcycle Club at more than 100 in Oregon , Washington , Idaho , Montana and Utah .
The club , founded in 1969 , is one of six in Oregon identified by the state Department of Justice as an outlaw biker gang .
Members of the club wear black and gold colors that depict a grinning , winged skull wearing a helmet and motorcycle goggles .
The bulk of the club 's Oregon membership meets at clubhouses in Portland and Hillsboro , according to law enforcement sources .
" BROTHER SPEED M/C is a club that is serious about brotherhood , respect , riding fast and building choppers , " the club writes on its Oregon Web site .

Forty years ago tomorrow , photographer Iain MacMillan took the photo that would be the cover of the Beatles ’ Abbey Road , spawning Paul McCartney death rumors in the immediate and a Webcam in the Internet - enabled years .
It also inspired a bunch of “ homages , ” one of which sticks out above all the rest :
The tracklisting for Jive Bunny And The Mastermixers Play The Music Of The Beatles would seem to indicate that this album — which was released in 2001 , wow — is not a compilation of mastermixes , but instead some disappointingly straight covers .
This does not swing my mood , Jive Bunny !

Is my understanding correct ? " C. Barker : " Pretty much -- to access the Mac GUI , an app needs to be in a proper Mac application bundle .
The Framework build supplies that . "
Apple Developer Connection : Framework Definition " A framework is a bundle ( a structured directory ) that contains a dynamic shared library along with associated resources , such as nib files , image files , and header files .
When you develop an application , your project links to one or more frameworks .
For example , iPhone application projects link by default to the Foundation , UIKit , and Core Graphics frameworks .
Your code accesses the capabilities of a framework through the application programming interface ( API ) , which is published by the framework through its header files .
Because the library is dynamically shared , multiple applications can access the framework code and resources simultaneously .
The system loads the code and resources of a framework into memory , as needed , and shares the one copy of a resource among all applications . "
Framework Programming Guide : What are Frameworks ?
" Frameworks offer the following advantages over static - linked libraries and other types of dynamic shared libraries : Frameworks group related , but separate , resources together .
This grouping makes it easier to install , uninstall , and locate those resources .
Frameworks can include a wider variety of resource types than libraries .
For example , a framework can include any relevant header files and documentation .
Multiple versions of a framework can be included in the same bundle .
This makes it possible to be backward compatible with older programs .
Only one copy of a framework ’s read - only resources reside physically in - memory at any given time , regardless of how many processes are using those resources .
This sharing of resources reduces the memory footprint of the system and helps improve performance . "
Background
Prior to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard , I had n't thought much about this , as I simply would download and install the Python 2.6.2 Mac Installer Disk Image , which is a framework build , and go about my business using virtualenv , pip , etc .
However , with the changes in Snow Leopard to 64 - bit , gcc , etc. , I 've noticed some issues that have made me want to build / compile Python 2.6.2 + myself from source , which leads me to my question of the differences and advantages / disadvantages of building Python as a MacOSX| Darwin framework .
A rhetorical question for free - market critics :
Do the following policies reflect a laissez - faire economy ?
# 1 – Artificially cheap money – America ’s central bank regularly provide heaps of cash to their member banks , especially when unsustainable rallies stall and sputter .
Liquidity is the cause and the cure .
This is anything but laissez - faire .
Keeping interest rates low mangles the free - market , rewarding reckless borrowers and lenders , and punishing savers .
# 2 – Bailouts – Banks feel safe taking huge risks , and for good reason .
The taxpayer will surely bail them out .
The absolute worst - case scenario for an executive who loses billions is getting fired .
But when you only need a few months to make millions , who cares about getting canned ?
# 3 – Meddling in Housing ; Freddie , Fannie & More –
The housing market has been propped - up too long .
The stated goal of GSE ’s like Fannie and Freddie are to facilitate affordable housing .
Problem is , they ’ve become a significant part of the problem .
They contributed to the housing bubble , and shifted debt to from private to public hands .
Further bailouts seem inevitable .
In short , they are anything - but free - market .
Laissez - Faire Still Takes The Blame
Despite all this , free - markets remain the favored scapegoat of this crisis .
David Leondhart ’s NYT piece titled Greenspan ’s Mea Culpa captured wrong - headed use of laissez - faire perfectly :
Over the last 30 years or so years , the world has been deeply influenced by a laissez - faire economic philosophy , which has shifted the world toward an embrace of markets …
But it certainly seems as if this country , at least , went too far toward laissez - faire economics .
Leondhart goes on to blame the housing bubble on a lack of regulation from Greenspan and the Fed .
We agree on where the fault lies .
The Fed certainly did blow their regulatory duties .
But his argument , like most made by free - market critics , ignores the real causes .
The root of the problem lies in gross government intervention , primarily in two forms :
Bailouts –
As long as bankers can count on taxpayer - funded rescues , any mention of a “ free - market ” is laughable .
As Elizabeth Warren recently stated , “ Until we have a credible liquidation threat , we do n’t have capitalism in America “ .
Such a shame that Mrs. Warren ’s position has no teeth .
I suppose she ’s too honest and sharp to be appointed to a position where she could have some impact .
“ . Such a shame that Mrs. Warren ’s position has no teeth .
I suppose she ’s too honest and sharp to be appointed to a position where she could have some impact .
Loose money – How can we expect banks / lenders to act responsibly when the Fed shovels money to them at below - market rates ?
We can ’t .
Profiting from this spread is irresistible .
It is inevitable that they will churn out bad loans .
No amount of regulation can create artifically - stimulated , yet responsible lending .
This belief that a lack of regulation is to blame for this crash is becoming dangerously widespread .
This Telegraph piece provides another example .
The author blames laissez - faire philosphies for the collapse of Lehman Brothers and its aftershocks .
What is it about moral hazards that these bank - apologists ca n’t understand ?
When you make risky loans , you should expect to take some losses .
Yes , even if that means money - market funds are forced to break the buck .
Spreading losses around only makes things worse , essentially stabbing Adam Smith ’s invisible hand with a rusty screwdriver .
Deregulation , or Decriminalization ?
Like any good myth , there is some truth in the anti-free - market crowd ’s argument – deregulation .
But that word , deregulation , does n’t describe what took place .
Decriminalization is more accurate .
Repealling Glass - Steagall , lowering bank reserve requirements to zero , increasing leverage , loose money , revolving doors .
Regulation hawks do make many valid points .
Clearly we need laws to prevent fraud .
Those who profited should have everything clawed back .
But unless we stem the flow of cheap money and allow companies to fail , such regulation is pointless .
Our first priority should be restoring some version of a free market .
Easy Money and Bailouts
Prior to the Great Depression , banks were forced to borrow money at above - market rates .
Now we shovel it to them freely .
Under the status quo , banks are practically ensured profitability , and bankers fat bonuses .
This should come as no surprise , as bankers largely control the Federal Reserve .
It is critical that Americans realize the role our Central Bank plays in bubbles .
Without Fed - provided liquidity , bubbles would be tame or non-existant .
Growth would be smoother .
Instead of dramatic cycles of boom / bust , we would see small fluctuations and stable growth .
Deflation , the Fed ’s worst nightmare , might even occur .
But that would be a result of increased productivity , and wages would not necessarily follow .
We would also escape rampant dollar destruction shown in the chart below .
These issues are nothing new .
Thomas Jefferson fought against central banks and their loose - money policies almost 200 years ago .
No one has a natural right to the trade of a money lender , but he who has the money to lend .
Let those then among us who have a moneyed capital and who prefer employing it in loans rather than otherwise , set up banks and give cash or national bills for the notes they discount .
Blame the Fed
While a responsible Fed is theoretically possible , we have n’t seen anything close since Paul Volcker left .
For now , it is imperative that we stop blaming laissez - faire policies for our problems , and recognize the real causes of this crisis .
Our economy is artificially stimulated , power - biased , corrupt , and manipulated .
Almost nothing about it resembles true free - market capitalism .
Spread the word .
Until this is widely accepted , necessary economic change will never happen .

It 's one of the golden rules of the natural world – birds live in trees , fish live in water .
The trouble is , no one bothered to tell the mangrove killifish .
Scientists have discovered that it spends several months of every year out of the water and living inside trees .
Scroll down for more ...
Hidden away inside rotten branches and trunks , the remarkable creatures temporarily alter their biological makeup so they can breathe air .
Biologists studying the killifish say they astonished it can cope for so long out of its natural habitat .
The discovery , along with its ability to breed without a mate , must make the
mangrove killifish , Rivulus marmoratus
Poey , one of the oddest fish known to man .
Around two inches long , they normally live in muddy pools and the flooded burrows of crabs in the mangrove swamps of Florida , Latin American and Caribbean .
The latest discovery was made by biologists wading through swamps in Belize and Florida who found hundreds of killifish hiding out of the water in the rotting
branches and trunks of trees .
The fish had flopped their way to their new homes when their pools of water around the roots of mangroves dried up .
Inside the logs , they were lined up end to end along tracks carved out by insects .
Dr Scott Taylor of the Brevard County Environmentally Endangered Lands Programme in Florida admitted the creatures were a little odd .
" They really do n't meet standard behavioural criteria for fish , " he told New Scientist magazine .
Although the cracks inside logs make a perfect hiding place , conditions
can be cramped .
The fish – which are usually fiercely territorial – are forced to curb their aggression .
Another study , published earlier this year , revealed how they alter their bodies and metabolism to cope with life out of water .
Their gills are altered to retain water and nutrients , while they excrete nitrogen waste through their skin .
These changes are reversed as soon as they return to the water .
Previously their biggest claim to fame was that they are the only known vertebrate – animal with a backbone – to reproduce without the need for a mate .
Killifish can develop both female and male sexual organs , and fertilise their eggs while they are still in the body , laying tiny embryos into the water .
They are not the only fish able to breathe air .
The walking catfish of South - east Asia has gills that allow it to breathe in air and in water .
The climbing perch of India can suffocate in water unless it can also gulp in air .

FAT , stupid Americans with no health insurance have attacked plans to stop them dying so easily .
Across the United States poor people who are told what to think by television said President Obama 's plan to give them free healthcare could lead to them being treated in a hospital that was not run by the Chicago Mafia .
Bill McKay , a retired shitkicker and Fox News analyst , from Kentucky , said : " I would rather replace my own hip using a rusty spoon than wait two months to have it done in a communist hospital , by some coffee - coloured faggot doctor who will then eat my unborn child to celebrate the end of Ramadan . "
Barbara Hayes , a God-fearer , from Arkansas , added : " Ah see 'd some woman from England on the Fox News sayin ' her muslim communist doctor would only give her the good medicines if she denounced Jesus .
Ah ai n't denouncin ' Jesus fir nobody , no siree . "
But Dr Tom Logan , head of public health at the Institute for Studies , said : " The key difference between the United States and Britain is that we treat poor people rather than leaving them to die in a skip .
" It may take a few weeks or even months , and not everyone is happy about that , but we do at least all agree that it is marginally better than the skip . "
He added : " Rich people have a thing called ' BUPA ' .
No -one knows what it stands for , though some people say it sounds as if it might be Indian .
But it does mean you get your own room , quick treatment , nice food , and you get fawned over by nurses who were just that bit too sexy for the NHS . "
Meanwhile Conservative leader David Cameron was forced to defend the NHS after Tory MEP Daniel Hannan 's ego told Fox News that Britain 's health system was ' worse than a lifetime of anal warts ' .
A Conservative spokesman said : " We 're not really sure what Daniel Hannan 's problem is with the NHS .
Perhaps they were unable to save his hair . "
Stephen Malley , professor of American History at Reading University , added : " To be fair to Fox News and the Republicans , they do have a principled objection to socialised medicine based largely on the fact that a black man won the election .
" The thing you must always remember about the American right wing is that they are basically the baddies in a film . "

The American Dream is slowly transforming as the world adapts to the digital age .
While people used to dream of obtaining a steady 9 to 5 job that they worked day in and day out until they retired , that life is starting to seem more like a nightmare .
People are realizing that the idea of working 50 weeks a year to enjoy two weeks of vacation is borderline insanity .
We ’re learning that it ’s better to work in order to live , rather than live in order to work .
That ’s why digital entrepreneurship is a massively growing field .
But learning how to make money from a website ca n’t be easy , can it ?
Do n’t you need a physical store or some other business to sell things online ?
It may surprise you to learn just how many options there are to monetize your website .
For example , with third - party storage and shipping companies , you do n’t even need to hold inventory to sell it .
Before we get ahead of ourselves , however , let ’s start from square one .
Keep reading for an in - depth guide on how to make money with a website .
1. Find the Right Niche
Did you know that nearly 50 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years ?
There are several root causes of their downfall , from poor marketing to high operation costs they can’t keep up with .
Being an online entrepreneur wo n’t grant you immunity to failure , but it will allow you some reprieve from costly brick - and - mortar expenses .
However , learning how to make money with a website requires finding a niche that you ’re both passionate and knowledgable about .
It also requires a fair amount of market research to learn how much competition you ’re facing , how much room for growth there is , as well as current market trends and patterns .
Your niche must be unique , so you ’ll stand out from others .
However , it ca n’t be so exclusive that it limits your target audience .
Find the sweet spot between peacocking and alienation .
2. Optimize Your Website Design and SEO
If your main goal is learning how to make money with a website , that means your website has to be pristine .
It must be aesthetically pleasing and user - friendly .
By user - friendly , we mean intuitive and quick .
A slow - loading website can escalate your bounce rate , as people do n’t feel like waiting around for pages to load .
A high bounce rate will kill your SEO ranking .
SEO , or search engine optimization , refers to the complex algorithms search engines use to find your website based on keyword searches .
For example , when someone uses Google to search for products or services , SEO ranking determines what websites come up at the top of the list .
You can maximize your SEO by publishing relevant content such as blog articles , infographics , pictures , and videos .
You also need to make sure you ’re using keywords and other forms of metadata .
Additionally , ensure you ’re using alt tags on visual media such as images and videos .
3. Figure Out What You Can Monetize
A big step in learning how to make money with a website is to figure out what you ’re going to monetize .
There are tons of options out there , but it should coincide with what your particular niche is .
For example , if you ’re all about interior design , it would n’t make sense for you to sell car parts .
Digital Products
There are digital products you can create to make a profit .
However , this means you must offer something people want to pay for .
This can come in the form of e-books , online courses , software , apps , etc .
Physical Products
You also have the option of selling physical products .
As mentioned above , however , this does n’t mean you have to have a physical store .
In fact , you never even have to touch the product you ’re selling .
For example , you could create t- shirt designs online and use a third - party company to provide , print , and ship the t- shirts .
They ’ll receive a large part of the cut , but you can be completely hands - off in terms of handling products .
Review Other Brands ’ Products
Another option digital entrepreneurs use when learning how to make money with a website is product reviews .
Other companies will pay you to review their products on your website , like surfnbuy.com .
Granted , you must build a big enough following to be considered by most companies .
Once you do , however , you ’ll have a ton of companies reaching out to you to review your products , although it pays to be proactive and seek them out yourself .
Be a Consultant or Coach
Finally , if your niche field is something others seek to better themselves , you can always turn to online coaching or consulting .
Depending on what field of coaching you ’re in , you may be required to be licensed or certified .
Regardless , you can host webinars or one - on - one sessions with people for a nominal fee .
4. Use Social Media Direct Traffic to Your Website
Social media is one of the best platforms for any company to build a following .
People have started from the ground up , amassing millions of followers using Pinterest , Facebook , and / or Instagram .
Using social media to learn how to make money with a website is simple .
There are 2.4 billion Facebook users – the audience is already in one place .
Your job is creating engaging content to get them to follow you .
Then , use your posts to encourage followers to click on links to your website .
This can be done by posting articles you ’ve written for your blog , offering great exclusive deals to social media followers on whatever it is you sell , etc .
5. Build an Email List
Another way digital entrepreneurs are learning how to make money with a website is through email marketing .
Email marketing involves building an email list of subscribers , typically through the means of social media , internal and external advertisements , and landing pages .
However , there ’s a little more to it than that .
You also have to create a series of emails to welcome your subscribers and gently seduce them into paying clients or customers .
These email campaigns must be well - thought - out and automated .
This will lower your workload and keep things humming along smoothly , potentially giving you passive sales .
Learning How to Make Money With a Website Has Never Been Easier
Ultimately , there ’s never been a better time to learn how to make money with a website .
There are countless companies out there whose main purpose is to help people like you monetize their websites and make a living digitally .
However , that ’s not to say there wo n’t be plenty of work involved .
But we have faith in you .
Just remember two things :
Consistency is king Knowledge is power
Good luck , and feel free to check out the rest of our articles for more advice and useful information !
The magic words are “ One , Two , Four , Eight : time to exponentiate ! ” .
I could give up laziness tomorrow ... or maybe the day after , but I could n't cope without abstraction at higher kinds .
The Functor class captures notions of superstructure which frame arbitrary substructures in some way : fmap lifts functions on substructures to functions on superstructures — acting on the substructures , but preserving their framing .
For example , lists are superstructures for their elements : instance Functor [ ] where
fmap f [ ] = [ ]
fmap f ( x : xs ) = f x : fmap f xs
The fixpoint construction builds recursive types ( think trees ) from functors by identifying superstructures with substructures : each node frames its children .
The iterator takes an algebra — a method of reducing a superstructure of values to a value — and uses it to reduce a whole tree to a value .
The plan is : unpack the root substructure ; turn its children into values by recursive iteration ; feed result to algebra .
For example , data ListB x xs = Nil | Cons x xs admits instance Functor ( ListB x ) where
fmap f Nil = Nil
fmap f ( Cons x xs ) = Cons x ( f xs ) and you 'll find that Fix ( LIST x ) behaves a lot like [ a ] .
Except that Fix ( LIST x ) is not obviously functorial in x. unfold :: Functor f ⇒ ( t → f t ) → t → Fix f
You can get out of this pickle by considering superstructures parametrized by two sorts of substructure — e.g. , ‘ elements ’ and ‘ subtrees ’ .
These have Bifunctor structure .
We take a parametrized fixpoint , instantiating the second sort of substructure recursively , but remaining abstract in the first .
We get an iterator ( and a coiterator as before ) .
The ‘ P ’ in ‘ PFix ’ is silent , and similarly for ‘ PIn ’ , ‘ pfold ’ , and ‘ punfold ’ — no unintended .
The crucial point , though , is that we also get that the resultant parametrized recursive structure is an instance of the Functor class .
There 's a special place we put people who implement fmap for ( PFix b ) as a pfold : it 's called Oxford .
The rest of us do it like this .
Here 's the ListB example .
Note that there 's a Bifunctor kit which you can use to build lots of your favourite recursive containers .
Jeremy Gibbons wrote some lovely notes about programming in this ‘ origami ’ style for the 2006 Spring School on Data - Generic Programming .
Haskell makes a fair enough start at expressing categorical concepts useful for programming , but sometimes the naming is a bit askew .
By calling the class for things in * →* with fmap ‘ Functor ’ , we implicitly lock ourselves into the category with objects in * and arrows from σ to τ in σ→τ .
The Arrow abstraction begins to undo some of the damage , but we still have n't really broken out of it .
Categorists use the word ‘ just ’ the way lepidopterists use cyanide .
A bifunctor is just a functor from a product category .
What do you mean you do n't have product categories ?
But we can turn this product into an exponential ... ... if only we could find a kind that behaved enough like Bool .
Let 's just pretend that we do .
A morphism s ⊆ t ( in ascii , I write s :-> t ) between s,t :: {ι}→* is an index - respecting map between indexed sets , or Curry - Howardly , an inclusion of predicates .
This TorF thing is kind of ‘ if.. then.. else ..’ for types ( with the condition shoogled to the end , ready to be left out in a partial application ) .
The index - respecting maps TorF u s ⊆
TorF v t are polymorphic functions which can be specialized to
TorF u s { True} → TorF v t { True} ( that 's u→v , up to iso ) , or to
TorF u s { False} → TorF v t { False} ( that 's s→t , up to iso ) .
We 've found the right notion of arrow to express bifunctors as a kind of functor ( but not the * →* kind ) .
( Sorry I wrote a blue ⊆ by mistake — I write defined things ( e.g. , type synonyms ) in green . )
Just revisiting the slide for kinds to add the blue braces of upward mobility which turn types ( inhabitants of kind *) into kinds .
I 'll tell you which expressions get to live at the type level and inhabit these kinds on the next slide , but you can bet we 'll have { True} , { False} :: { Bool} .
I 've left out another thing I know I 'll need : kinds polymorphic in type - level stuff .
∀x ::κ. κ
Note that I do n't get to abstract kinds themselves this way .
I just get to form kinds like this ( list membership , or typed de Bruijn indices from Altenkirch and Reus , CSL 1999 ) data Has :: ∀x : :*. { [x ] }→{x} → * where
Top ::
Has {x:xs} {x}
Pop ::
Has {xs} {y} →
Has {x: xs} {y}
Schäubles " Horrorkatalog " Florian Rötzer
Kurz vor der
Wahl zeigt ein Papier aus dem Innenministerium , wie man hier den Sicherheits - und Überwachungsstaat munter weiter ausbauen will .
Aus dem Haus von Bundesinnenminister
Schäuble ist gerade noch rechtzeitig vor der Wahl eine Wunschliste in die Hände der Süddeutschen Zeitung gelangt , die weiter geht als alles , was man bislang aus dem Mund des Innenministers hörte , aber durchaus glaubwürdig wirkt und das Konzept des Sicherheits - und Überwachungsstaats nur weiter ausbaut .
Ob der Brisanz des Papiers versucht man im Bundesinnenministerium , es herunterzu spielen , wie das auch im Fall des Papiers aus dem von Guttenberg geleiteten Wirtschaftsministerium der Fall war .
Es sei nur ein Wunschzettel der Referate des Ministeriums am Ende der Legislaturperiode , sagte Bruno Kahl , der Büroleiter von Minister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) .
Zur Leitungsebene sei es noch nicht gelangt .
Zudem sei es nur ein " Ministeriums - Internum " , aber kein Papier , das Koalitionsgesprächen zugrunde liegen soll , wie die SZ berichtete .
Allerdings steht auf dem Bericht : „ Vorbereitung Koalitionspapier “ , und beruhigend ist auch nicht , wenn es heißt , dass doch nur im Auftrag von Referatsleitern aufgeschrieben worden sei , was man in der laufenden Legislaturperiode nicht geschafft habe .
Das wiederum heißt dann doch , dass es sich um eigentlich verfolgte Ziele handelt .
Nach dem Papier besteht die Absicht , Die Aufgaben von Polizei und Verfassungsschutz wieder zusammenzufassen , also die strikte Trennung zwischen den Behörden einzureißen , die nach den Erfahrungen im Nationalsozialismus aufgebaut wurde .
Überhaupt sollen die Kompetenzen des Geheimdienstes drastisch erweitert werden .
Auch er soll Computer online durchsuchen oder auf die Daten zugreifen können , die im Zuge der Vorratsdatenspeicherung so praktisch bereitliegen .
Zudem soll er Lausch - und Spähangriffe in Privatwohnungen vornehmen , also heimlich in diese eindringen können .
Dazu würde man gerne möglichst vielen Menschen als " erkennungsdienstliche Standardmaßnahme " Fingerabdrücke abnehmen und speichern können , um ähnlich wie in Großbritannien eine möglichst umfassende Datenbank anzulegen .
Und zudem sollen sich verdeckte Ermittler die Finger schmutzig machen dürfen und nicht bestraft werden , wenn diese zum " szenetypischem Verhalten " gehören .
Die FDP , der Wunschpartner der Union , wird zeigen können , ob sie bei einer etwaigen Regierungskoalition auch glaubwürdig bleibt oder die Bürgerrechte der Macht opfert , was sie in den Länderkoalitionen schon gerne praktiziert .
Noch erklärt die stellvertretende Fraktionsvorsitzende Sabine Leutheusser - Schnarrenberger : " Die Horrorliste aus dem Hause Schäuble ist für die FDP absolut inakzeptabel .
Der Verfassungsschutz darf nicht zur Polizei werden . "
Thomas Oppermann , der Parlamentarische Geschäftsführer der SPD - Bundestagsfraktion , meinte zum Spiegel : " Schäuble hat jedes Augenmaß verloren .
Er überschreitet die roten Linien einer rechtstaatlichen Innenpolitik . "
Der SPD - Innenpolitker Sebastian Edathy hält die Pläne für " vollkommen inakzeptabel " .
Schäuble habe " die Balance zwischen den Sicherheitsinteressen des Staates und den Bürgerrechten vollkommen aus den Augen verloren " .
Allerdings hat die SPD schon unter Schröder und dann in der großen Koalition schon viele Schranken abgerissen und den Überwachungsstaat befördert .
Wolfgang Wieland , der innenpolitische Sprecher der Bündnisgrünen , spricht von einem " Horrorkatalog " .
Die Vermischung von Polizei und Geheimdiensten orientiere sich an Russland und China .
Dem Tagesspiegel gegenüber sagte er , dass er eine Stellungnahme von Schäuble fordert : " Ich erwarte von ihm als Dienstherr , dass er sich entweder hinter die Giftliste aus seinem Haus stellt oder sich von ihr distanziert . "
Ulla Jelpke , die innenpolitische Sprecherin der Fraktion der Linken , bezeichnet den Wunschzettel ebenfalls als " wahren Horrorkatalog " : " Es wird höchste Zeit , Wolfgang Schäuble in seinem Wahn zu stoppen .
Dem Marsch in den autoritären Sicherheitsstaat wird DIE LINKE parlamentarisch , außerparlamentarisch und juristisch Widerstand entgegensetzen " .
With Christmas and New Year 's almost upon us , you may be raising your glass and downing the spirits more than you 're used to — along with many others .
According to a nationwide poll released this year , most adults who attended work holiday parties said drunken bad behavior can often result .
And insulting the boss is the least of it ; nearly 60 percent of the surveyed partygoers saw a coworker drive while drunk .
The poll , by Caron Treatment Centers , a not - for - profit organization for addiction treatment , helps explain some disturbing statistics reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Half of the almost 400 traffic deaths on Christmas 2006 , and more than half of the 456 New Year 's deaths that year , were alcohol - related .
But do n't forget , the risks of heavy alcohol consumption exist year - round .
And heavy drinkers — classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as men who have more than two drinks a day or women who have more than one drink a day — can pose a threat to those around them .
The list below ranks the 10 U.S. metropolitan areas — defined as counties or groups of counties with a population of 10,000 or more — with the highest rates of heavy drinking .
A second list identifies the 10 metro areas with the lowest rates .
Is heavy drinking a problem in your community ?
America 's Top 10 Most Sober Cities
The editors of Forbes have asked me to give them my economic forecast for the next year ( cough , cough , guffaw ) .
Do n’t be impressed .
They sent the same email to the whole financial wackosphere .
I assume that their purpose , as with the entire financial infomercial media , is to poke fun at us wackos so as to minimize their own horrendous shortcomings as financial journalists .
OK , so I ’ll give them an answer since they were nice enough to ask .
But let me preface this for those of you who do n’t know me by saying that I ’m not an economist , thank goodness .
What an embarrassment that would be .
My educational background is in accounting ( undergrad ) and psychology ( grad ) .
My professional career over the past 22 years has been spent mostly in real estate and financial market analytics .
So I ’ve had some exposure to the real economy and the financial economy .
I ’ve had a particular interest throughout my life in manias and their aftermath .
I ’m a self taught technical analyst ( are n’t we all ) , having first become interested in the art of TA at the ripe old age of 13 when I was introduced to point and figure charting .
What I have learned about liquidity analysis , an area in which I specialize , has been through independent research , observation and study .
My ideas are not polluted by the shibboleths of formal education .
My interest in manias brought me back to my current job as an independent self - employed professional analyst and web publisher in 2000 when I founded Capitalstool.com .
I founded The Wall Street Examiner in 2004 .
In my late 20s I worked for several years as a sell side technical analyst for a couple of institutional boutique firms on Wall Street .
Let ’s just say that the Street and I did not mix .
I had morals .
While working on the Street in the early 1980s , thanks to reading people like Joe Granville , Richard Ney ( The Wall Street Jungle ) , and Charles Mackay ( Extraordinary Popular Delusions , etc. )
I realized that the financial media was nothing more than the marketing arm of the Wall Street retail distribution network .
Wall Street ’s job is to distribute paper and transfer wealth from the many to the few , including , most importantly , itself .
The media ’s job is to transmit the sales pitch .
The financial infomercial media plays a crucial and integral role in that system , providing a platform for Wall Street ’s professional shills to reach the masses .
It is the greatest manipulative system in the world since Goebbels , mastering the art of repeating the Big Lie to perfection .
When a shill comes on CNBC and says buy XYZ , his in house traders are the ones doing the selling .
One of the Big Lies is that the stock market discounts the future .
We ’ve had a big rally , so the economy must be about to get a lot better , so the story goes .
But the truth is that the stock market is nothing more than a liquidity meter .
It measures a very particular type of liquidity .
It mostly measures how much cash is burning a hole in the pockets of the dealer community .
Right now , thanks to the Fed , the dealer community , particularly the Fed ’s Primary Dealers who dominate not only the Treasury market but the stock market as well , are rolling in oceans of cash , pumped directly to them by the Fed .
They are using most of it to pay down debt by selling much of their questionable assets to the Fed , particularly mortgage debt and corporate debt , but they are using some of it to manipulate stocks higher .
They do that because , one , it ’s easy for them to do it , and two , because it ’s much easier to get the suckers , oops , I mean the buy side institutions , to take the other side of the trade when prices are rising .
So as long as the Fed pumps this cash to them , stock prices will go up .
It has nothing to do with the economy .
It has nothing to do with discounting the future .
The idea that stock prices discount the future is ridiculous .
Stock markets are comprised of people , or at least the people who wrote the computer programs that do most of the millisecond trading that dominates price action .
People , by and large , are not very good at predicting the future .
That ’s especially true of economists , pundits , and most of all , portfolio managers , whose only real interest is in not doing anything different than what the majority of portfolio managers are doing .
How in the world can a portfolio manager properly manage money when one of the mandates of the industry is to stay fully invested .
The best they can hope for is to do better than their peers .
They can do nothing to protect your assets in the event of systemic collapse , such as we are now facing .
In continuing to spread the lies this time around , the media helps to insure that for the foreseeable future there will be no recovery from this economic and financial mess .
The media continues to feature the same people telling the same idiotic stories , pursuing the same tried and true practices of distributing insider stock , especially their own , at high prices to the masses .
The cash goes right from our pockets to the pockets of the financiers , with the media getting a huge cut in the process .
They are co conspirators in a massive criminal scheme , some of it legal , some of it not , to separate people from their money .
This time they did it a little too well , and therein lies a problem for the economy .
Few have any money left to transfer .
The Fed and Treasury have set up a scam over the past year to make it look as if there ’s still money , but what they have actually done is to transfer risk from the private sector to the public sector , in other words us , current and future generations of US taxpayers .
In the process they ’ve pumped a couple of trillion of new government debt into the economy and the markets over the past couple of months making it look as though everything is gonna be all right .
All right .
All ri-i-ight .
But it ’s not gonna be all right .
In fact , things are getting worse as we speak , and they will continue to get worse for the short term , the intermediate term , and the long term– for as long as the same people are in charge who caused this mess in the first place ; for as long as the media continues to give a platform to those same people who were responsible for all the–let ’s call them what the are–crimes– that put us where we are .
For as long as those in power in Washington give those same people the same power they have always had , rather than punishing them for their “ mistakes ” , we are going to be in this mess .

_______________________________________________________________________
So now we have transferred trillions of bad debt , some of it completely worthless paper , on to the books of the Fed and the Federal Government .
What can the outcome possibly be ?
Ultimately default ?
Devaluation ?
Hyperinflation ?
Slow motion economic collapse such as that which is currently under way ?
Even finally the collapse of government and society ?
Anything is possible , given how insane these policies are and how clueless our policy makers have been and continue to be .
For example , the government has committed to take on $ 1.45 trillion of mortgage debt in various forms .
In most cases the equity has been wiped out .
There ’s no margin of safety in those mortgages .
The government will lose countless billions on its investments .
We , the people , will somehow have to pay for that .
Meanwhile , the financiers in the middle of the mess in the first place are still there .
If they ’re not still running the show , they ’ve run off somewhere with the billions that they have skimmed and scammed off the top .
Now the media reports that , gee !
the government is actually making money from the investments it has made in bailing out the banks .
But the Fed and the Government are just playing the same game the banks played , reporting the “ operating profit ” while not reporting the mushrooming mountain of bad debt on their books .
This is the very same garbage that got us here in the first place , except now the government is taking a page from the banks and financial institutions that mastered the art of hiding bad debt .
It ’s sickening , but no one in the mainstream media questions it .
Where are the real journalists ?
Not working for the mainstream media , that ’s for sure .
They ’re still giving a free pass to the power brokers .
Forbes has asked me what data I like to look at .
One of the things I featured just today in one of my reports to subscribers is Federal tax collections so far in August .
They were down 13 % versus last August to date .
July was down less than 6 % year to year .
Where are the green shoots ?
The government has disbursed $ 227 billion more into the economy this month than it did at the same point last August .
And yet tax collections continue to collapse , indicating that economic activity is doing likewise .

One of the problems is that zero interest rates forces both people and businesses to liquidate principle in order to pay the bills .
So the capital pie shrinks .
A shrinking capital base means shrinking income .
Shrinking income means that people will need to liquidate even more capital .
The system collapses in a chain reaction .
Government programs have done nothing to change that .
They ’ve masked the degenerative process for a time with all that spending , but they ’ve done it only by adding more debt to the government ’s balance sheet .
At the same time , debt in the private sector , and hence money , is being destroyed .
We see it in all manner of lending statistics , from bank loans , to mortgage credit , to commercial paper .
And we see it in the rising tide of mortgage defaults .
People ca n’t pay or wo n’t pay .
So they do n’t .
This is what ’s backing our “ money ” .
Source : Federal Reserve
Meanwhile lending institutions and now the government pretend that the losses do n’t exist , reporting unbelievably , that the money supply has n’t collapsed along with everything else .
They have no choice .
They have to keep the con going , lest there be one final , fatal run on the banks and / or the money market funds .
The Fed ’s zero interest rate policy is causing the very contraction it is seeking to avoid because it does not allow anyone to earn a fair and reasonable return on their investments .
In order to pay the bills people and business must liquidate assets .
At the same time , they are desperately trying to pay off debt .
So the pie shrinks and money disappears .
The media is fond of saying that no one in the mainstream saw this coming except Roubini .
How stupid is this ?
The media is the sole decision maker about who we get to pay attention to .
If they feature only liars and fools , then of course it will seem that no one saw this coming .
And they feature almost entirely liars , fools , and criminal manipulators .
Let ’s consider who got this right in addition to Roubini .
How about Professors Case and Shiller , and Niall Ferguson .
How about Nassim Taleb .
What about Warren Buffet ’s warnings about derivatives ?
How about George Soros ?
Jimmy Rodgers ?
What about Ron Paul , whose warnings fell on deaf ears for years .
Congressional hearings ?
Ron Paul ?
Oops , time to cut to a commercial !
What about Doug Noland of the Prudent Bear Funds ’ Credit Bubble Bulletin who has correctly been chronicling and forecasting this mess for a decade .
What about Bill Fleckenstein and David Tice , and Peter Shiff ?
What about John Hussman ?
What about Robert Prechter ?
Bill Bonner of the Daily Reckoning ?
Mark Faber ?
What about Martin Weiss ?
There were many more like them .
Why did we almost never see these guys on the tube or in print .
And why , when we did see them , was the usual purpose to ridicule and harass them ?
Because the media was and is a co-conspirator , witting or unwitting , with the Wall Street criminal distribution machine .
The media is populated by conformist morons , too fat and lazy , too coddled by their Wall Street sponsors to be bothered by anything so mundane as to search for the truth .
I mean , it ’s not like it was hard to find .
What about all those guys in the wackosphere like my colleague Russ Winter , or Mike Shedlock , or even me for goodness sakes ?
I know I do n’t count because only a few thousand people have ever heard of me , and half of them only know me as Dr. Stepan N. Stool .
But there were dozens , if not hundreds , of bloggers who saw this coming for years .
I was far from alone .
What about all the thousands of ordinary people who have participated on our message boards down through the years ?
They knew .
But again , the media decides what the public gets to see and hear .
The media decided that the “ Cassandras ” were only to be featured on occasion as objects of ridicule .
And now that the economic data has stopped going down for a couple of months and the stock market has been going up , they are once again the subject of scorn .
Then there ’s the 5,000 people surveyed by the Conference Board every month .
Look at how many of them had soured on things in 2006 and 2007 , versus their level of optimism in 1999 and 2000 .
A whole lot of ordinary people “ got it . ”
Only the mainstream infomercial media did n’t get it , because they are , after all , on the payroll of the Wall Street Mob .
The fact is that the economy is not getting better .
It is not healing .
Nothing goes down in a straight line , especially when a government throws a couple trillion in debt at it .
But those trillions are not endless .
The kindness of strangers , namely foreign central banks who buy that debt , is not without limit .
The time will come when the government will not be able to float more debt to pay off the existing debt , when the burden of paying back these wildly reckless bets will fall directly on the back of the US taxpayer .
We are facing a crisis much greater than any we have faced so far .
The Fed will not continue to pump cash into the pockets of the Primary Dealers indefinitely as they have been doing since March .
When that cash gusher stops , or even slows , the stock market will again collapse .
It simply cannot be sustained at these levels without that subsidy .
As for the economy , over the next year , it will get worse , for all the reasons enumerated above .
How much worse , I have no clue .
I ’m not an economist , thank goodness .
What an embarrassment that would be .
Obviously they have no clue either .
They pretend .
That ’s all .
They missed the biggest collapse in the last 75 years .
Knowing what ’s likely to happen is not their job .
Their job is to talk a good game so that Wall Street can continue its game .
Ripping off the rest of us .
So Good Night , and Good Luck .
You ’re going to need it .
Stay up to date with the machinations of the Fed , Treasury , and foreign central banks in the US market in the Fed Report in the Professional Edition , Money Liquidity , and Real Estate Package .
Try it risk free for 30 days .
Do n’t miss another day .

An Israeli researcher is closing in on a vaccine to prevent the development of Alzheimer 's disease , one of the most devastating forms of dementia .
Dr. Alon Monsonego , a researcher in the Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Be'er Sheva and in the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev , innoculated mice with human genes carrying Alzheimer 's disease .
He and his colleagues found that the mice " were able to reduce plaques of beta- peptides , as well as inflammations and neuronal damage associated with the disease . "
The study , conducted together with British and U.S. researchers , was aimed at creating a vaccine that would strengthen the immune system to prevent subsequent development of Alzheimer 's in people with a genetic predisposition to the disease .
Funded in part by the Israel Science Foundation , the Alzheimer 's Association , New York real estate developer Leonard Litwin , and the Aaron Gural family , the findings of the study were published in the September issue of the Journal of Immunology .
Monsonego determined through using the mouse model that introducing A - beta ( amyloid - beta ) into the brain triggers a natural immune response which can be detected in humans .
" Stimulating an immune response to A - beta in these humanized mice not only resulted in a highly efficient clearance of A - beta ( plaque ) from the brain , but also in a markedly reduced inflammatory reaction , " he said .
The team was also able to predict that the characteristics of the immune response in mice were the same as in the human subjects , he added .
The study is particularly important because it forms the basis for developing an individualized treatment approach to the disease , Monsonego pointed out , " since different populations will respond differently to a vaccine based on their genetic background . "
He added that more research will be needed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the model before the vaccine can be marketed .
Alzheimer 's disease is expected to affect approximately 36 million adults in 2010 , according to a report released Monday by Alzheimer 's Disease International , an umbrella organization covering Alzheimer 's groups around the world .
The statistic is literally one - third higher than it was in 2005 .
In 2003 , approximately 8 million adults were estimated to be living with Alzheimer 's disease .
The organization added that it is predicting the incidence of Alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia will continue to skyrocket over the next few decades .
Israeli Company Receives Patent on Alzheimer 's Vaccine
This is not the first attempt at developing a vaccine against Alzheimer 's disease .
In November 2003 , the Israeli Mindset Bio-Pharmaceuticals company received a patent for the first vaccine against Alzheimer 's disease , one year after the Elan Corporation had developed a vaccine , only to find that adverse side effects would make the model impractical .
Mindset announced that it was working on strategies to address the safety issues found during trials of previous attempts by Elan and Wyeth - Ayerst Laboratories in their previous trials .
Mindset CEO
Daniel Chain said the post - trial analysis of the data from the Elan clinical trials had showed that it had been effective , and said his company would continue to work towards developing a safer model .
The Elan Corporation did not abandon its own efforts , however .
In July 2009 , the New Jersey - based Johnson & Johnson mega - biotech company picked up an 18 percent stake in the Irish biotech firm 's efforts to develop its Alzheimer 's vaccine , as well as a treatment for the disease .
J&J is now set to invest nearly $ 1.4 billion through its Centocor division in a collaboration with Elan in the effort .
With increasing depth , geothermal energy offers an almost inexhaustible potential for renewable energy .
The drilling costs however , rise exponentially with depth in the case of conventional rotary drilling .
A thermal drilling method , which will allow for reaching greater drilling depths in a more efficient and more cost - effective way , is currently being developed at the ETH Zurich .
Tobias Rothenfluh , a doctoral student at the Institute for Process Engineering , climbs up a small ladder into the three - story pilot plant .
Pipelines lead through metering and safety valves into the reactor , which is affectionately known as “ Betsy ” .
Inch - thick plates , made of heat - resistant steel , prevent the reactor from bursting , even at a pressure of 300 bars .
“ In our experimental reactor we are able to ignite a flame underwater at a pressure of around 250 bars and 450 degrees Celsius ” says Rothenfluh .
“ Thus we are able to experimentally simulate the temperature and pressure conditions prevailing in a borehole , about three kilometers below the earth ’s surface . ”
He has constructed a first burner prototype over the last few months together with his colleagues Martin Schuler and Panagiotis Stathopoulos .
Laboratory experiments at high pressure
Heated oxygen , ethanol and water are pumped into the reactor burner through various pipelines and valves and mix under temperature and pressure conditions , which correspond to the supercritical state of water ( see box ) .
The auto -ignition of the mixture is being observed through small sapphire - glass windows by means of a camera .
A newly developed sensor plate measures the heat flux from the flame to the plate and records the temperature distribution on the surface for different distances between the burner outlet and the plate .
Based on these experimental results , conclusions are drawn concerning the heat transfer from the flame to the rock .
“ The heat flux is the crucial parameter for the characterization of this alternative drilling method ” , explains Philipp Rudolf von Rohr , professor at the Institute of Process Engineering of the ETH Zurich and supervisor of the three PhD students .
Erosion in fast motion
During the experiment , the flame reaches a maximal temperature of about 2000°C .
Rapid heating of the upper rock layer induces a steep temperature gradient in it .
“ The heat from the flame causes the rock to crack due to the induced temperature difference and the resulting linear thermal expansion ” , explains Tobias Rothenfluh .
The expansion of the upper rock layer causes natural flaws , already existing in the rock , act as origin points for cracks .
Disc - like rock fragments in the millimeter scale are formed in the spallation zone .
These particles are transported upwards with the ascending fluid stream of the surrounding medium .
“ One of the main challenges of the spallation process is to prevent the rock from melting , whilst it ’s being rapidly heated ” , says Tobias Rothenfluh .
“ The lager the temperature gradient in the rock , the faster you can drill . ”

The method is particularly suitable for hard , dry rock , normally encountered at depths greater than three kilometers .
In such depths conventional drilling bits wear out much faster , and their frequent replacement , renders the conventional drilling techniques uneconomic : a 10 km borehole costs around 60 million US dollars .
In the case of the so - called “ hydrothermal spallation drilling ” method , however , the burner - drill bit wear is considerably less , because there is no mechanical contact with the rock .
“ It is expected that the drilling costs will rise linearly with depth in the case of spallation drilling , instead of exponentially , which is the case of the conventional methods ” , says Philipp Rudolf von Rohr .
Simulation and demonstration
In order to test the flame ’s behavior under different conditions , the doctoral student Martin Schuler is developing a tool for the numerical simulation of the reaction and transport processes in cooperation with the master ’s student Karl Goossens .
“ The simulation enables us to change and optimize parameters like fuel mass flow rates , temperature and pressure , as well as the geometry of the burner ” , says Martin Schuler .
The experimental results from the current test set - up are being used to design a pilot plant , on which Panagiotis Stathopoulos is working .
The 1.2 million - Swiss - franc plant should demonstrate that it is actually possible to drill through rock by means of hydrothermal flames .
The project is funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy , the industrial organization swisselectric research , ETH Zurich and the Swiss National Science Foundation .
Research in breadth and depth
The interest of federation and industry confirms the high potential of “ hydrothermal spallation drilling ” .
Some time will pass until the method is industrially applicable , but the feasibility is undoubted so far .
“ It is for sure possible to speed up the project towards the industrial application ” , Philipp Rudolf von Rohr realizes , “ but we still want to focus on basic research at a university like the ETH Zurich ” .

After all , the Institute of Process Engineering is currently worldwide the only group investigating the heat transfer characteristics of a flame in supercritical water .
“ We literally want to research in both depth and breadth ” , says Tobias Rothenfluh .
In the future , the knowledge acquired might be useful not only for geothermal energy , but also for other applications .
Supercritical water
Above a temperature of 374.12 °C and a pressure of 221.2 bars , water vapor and liquid water can no longer be distinguished from each other in terms of their density .
In this supercritical state , water is less polar , has no phase boundaries any more and is a good solvent for non-polar gases like oxygen .
Under these conditions fuel and oxygen can be mixed without any bubble formation and in the case of ethanol as fuel , auto- ignition occurs at approximately 450°C .

For many Germans , deployment in Afghanistan meant delivering aid and reconstruction to the country ’s relatively peaceful north .
But now the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous .
And Germany seems to have found itself unwillingly dragged into a war .
Berlin has just changed the rules of military engagement for troops abroad , giving soldiers more leeway to use lethal force .
This is seen as important in northern Afghanistan , where attacks by Taliban insurgents are becoming more frequent …
In a joint action with Afghan forces , 300 German soldiers used heavy firepower for the first time in a bid to flush out Taliban insurgents who are moving into the region .
Back home , meanwhile , Chancellor Angela Merkel last month awarded four soldiers the Bundeswehr ’s new cross of honour .
It was the first time since the end of World War II that Germany had awarded medals for bravery – a remarkable change in attitude considering post - war Germany ’s traditional wariness of military symbols .
But although the German government looks set to get tough on the battlefield , popular opinion is heading in the opposite direction …
“ The war is so unpopular that politicians wo n’t even call it a war , ” said Alan Posener , political correspondent for the German daily newspaper Die Welt .
“ We are now using armoured personnel carriers and light tanks to fight the Taliban .
But politicians are saying , no , it ’s not a war , it ’s a peace mission .
If they did n’t say that , they would get flayed alive by their voters . ”
RTFA .
It ’s longish – and not conclusive .
It could be four times as long – to wander through the complexities of German history and politics .
This generation has more than enough reason to be contemptuous of warhawk politicians .
They live every day with the heritage of their grandparents who voted “ Yes ” to shock and awe .
But , a significant chunk of the 9/11 terror plot was drafted in Germany .
Just because Al Qaeda felt safe enough to attack America from Hanover is n’t reason enough to expect neutrality to be respected by religious maniacs .
Next month or the month after may be their turn .
There are alternatives to exclusively military solutions just as there are dynamic changes in analyzing how to fight a war in the 21st Century .
The Germans have the right – and responsibility – to choose how they proceed with any of this .
Without “ leadership ” from American and British politicians .
The British Science Festival kicks off tomorrow at the University of Surrey and on Sunday I will be giving a lecture discussing those quirky equations that seem to appear in the press every few weeks purporting to describe everyday phenomena .
For example , you may remember the equations that supposedly calculated the perfect TV sitcom , the best day of the year , or the likelihood of scoring from a penalty .
You can find lots more documented at the blog Apathy Sketchpad .
Despite the fact that these media - friendly formulae have enough variables to make them look as though they are based on proper research , in most cases they are effectively meaningless .
Indeed , I have been approached a couple of times by PR companies who have wanted me to construct similarly cockamamie formulae .
The first time was in 2005 when I was asked to help promote a shopping exhibition by coming up with a formula that predicted the best day to start Christmas shopping .
Of course , the perfect day had to coincide with the start of the shopping exhibition .
I decided to string the company along for a while , to test the elasticity of their integrity .
I told them : " The equation would lead to a graph that gave a value for each day in the run up to Xmas in terms of how good it would be to start shopping on that day , and I would engineer the equation so that the graph peaked on the day you require .
There would be no real science behind the equation , but it would look sensible and convincing . "
I went so far as to suggest some of the factors that might decide the best day to start shopping , and Clare , the nice lady from the PR company , replied : " Your ideas and formulas are perfect and exactly what we are looking for and it would be great to confirm you working with us . "
After I had eventually explained my true feelings about absurd PR equations , the company probably found someone else to invent the formula it required .
There is no shortage of willing volunteers .
One of the most prolific equation inventors is Cliff Arnall , who is responsible for the formulae that describe the best day of the year , the worst day of the year , the perfect weekend and so on .
Unfortunately , as Ben Goldacre has pointed out in his Bad Science column , Cliff has a very poor grasp of maths .
His formula for the perfect weekend is " dimensionally half - cocked " , because a time quantity ends up being added to a time - squared quantity .
This sort of howler is just one of the problems associated with the PR industry 's desire to exploit maths .
It also demeans mathematics and science by giving the impression that academics waste their time on frivolous topics and are willing to come up with the appropriate answer if someone is prepared to pay them enough money .
Moreover , we are reaching a point when it is becoming impossible to separate the good equations from the bad ones .
While the equation for the perfect penalty ( which seems to reappear in a different form every few years ) strikes me as little more than trivial PR , the equation for predicting marital success is actually based on serious research .
The equation was devised by the eminent mathematician and Royal Society fellow Professor James Murray , who gave the Bakerian Prize Lecture at the Royal Society earlier this year .
One way to protect the reputation of serious scientists such as Professor Murray is to highlight and perhaps embarrass those other co-called scientists who manufacture mathematical drivel .
To this end , I am working with Voice of Young Science to find the most appalling equation to appear in the UK national press over the next 12 months .
Towards the end of 2010 we will be giving a prize for the dodgiest equation , but so far we do not have a name for the award , so any suggestions would be much appreciated .
And , of course , please help us by keeping an out eye for pseudo - equations in the media .
You can suggest a name for the prize by adding a comment below , and send links to articles that describe appalling equations to voys@senseaboutscience.org
Atheism is responsible for the deaths of 100 million people in the 20th Century .
Hitler , Stalin , Mao and Pol Pot killed millions of people in the name of atheism .
Atheism is the cause of the most repressive , murderous regimes in history .
OK , everybody , raise your hands if you had one of the above quotes thrown at you by theists when debating the existence of god , or the relative merits of religion .
One , two , three … one hundred twenty two…oh , no use counting .
It looks like everyone has at least one hand raised , some have both up .
OK , put them down .
I personally found myself dealing with this issue at least twice during the past week on different blogs .
Most times it ’s thrown at me as a response to an allegation that Christianity has been responsible for such horrors as the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition ( the latter , a subject near and dear to my heart ) .
Despite how ludicrous those statements are , and how unsupportable they are by evidence and history , theists continue to trot them out time after time .
Sometimes I feel like I ’m in the middle of a schoolyard spat : “ Your mom ’s ugly !
Oh yea , well , your mom ’s uglier ! “ .
It ’s as if they think that the only way to respond to the history of Christianity is by inventing a false history for atheism .
It boils down to just another tu quoque fallacious argument , in an effort to avoid the real issues .
As most people ( other that Christian apologists ) know and understand , atheism is simply a lack of belief in the supernatural or the divine .
It is not an affirmative statement of belief , it is a dis- affirmation of a belief in god(s ) .
It is also not something people can join , like religion , nor is it a movement , though it does have social and cultural connotations when espoused in conjunction with other ideologies .
I can join Christianity by joining a particular Christian church , and by professing belief in the tenets of that church .
There is , by contrast , no “ church ” of atheism for me to join .
Even if there was , there are no beliefs that an atheist can profess , as tenets of this non-existent church .
Atheists can belong to other organizations or ideologies ( such as humanism ) which may or may not have other beliefs , but generally one does n’t join atheism .
One simply makes a decision that he or she does n’t believe in the supernatural .
Additionally , beliefs , being both personal and involuntary , are not something an atheist has much control over .
Sure , outward signs of belief may be acted out by people who fear that not doing so will lead to harm , but their internal , actual beliefs are not changed – just masked .
Atheism , like religious belief , cannot be imposed by others .
A lack of belief in god usually is arrived at after careful scrutiny and balancing of the reasons pro and con , and a rejection of the pro .
One really can’t force one ’s beliefs on oneself , or talk oneself into believing .
You either do or you do n’t .
So when theists bring up famous atheists like Stalin , or Mao or Pol Pot , and then try to link their personal lack of beliefs in gods to the atrocities that are also attributed to them , they are just plain wrong .
Such a link is disingenuous , and frankly assumes a level of ignorance on the listener that is both insulting and condescending .
Atheism is not a movement .
No government or country effectuates policy in the name of atheism .
Atheism is not even a a proper “ ism ” .
It has no guidelines , rules , tenets , or practices .
It has no rituals , dogma , holy books or scripture .
It can not replace religion , because it is merely the vacuum created when religion disappears from one ’s personal beliefs .
Moreover , people do n’t kill because of a lack of belief in something .
If they kill at all , they do it because of a positive belief in something .
If we accept the proposition that people kill because of their lack of beliefs , then by extension , there is more evidence to blame all murders in the entire world ( except those done by children under the age of , say , 10 ) on the failure to believe in Santa Claus , than on any other reason , because that is something all murderers have in common .
Obviously , their lack of belief in Santa drove them to kill , right ?.
Or , instead of blaming the “ troubles ” in Ireland on Catholic / Protestant antagonism , we should blame them on the Irish lack of belief in leprechauns .
That sounds pretty silly , does n’t it ?
The reason for this is that there is a failure of connection , or a nexus , between atheism ( or a - santaclausism or a - leprechaunism ) and acts of brutality .
Yet , Stalin was an atheist .
He was very clear about that .
So should his subsequent actions as the dictator of Soviet Russia be pinned exclusively to his atheism ?
The answer is no .
Why ?
Because there is no evidence for it , and if you are an atheist , evidence is important to belief , unlike the Christian belief system .
Why was he an atheist , and to what use did he put his personal atheism ?
He was a communist first , a devotee of Marxim , who was raised as a Christian , and even studied in the seminary to be a priest .
He realized how important , and how intertwined , religion was in the lives of the Russian people .
He also knew that for the communist state to succeed , it could have no competition for the hearts and minds of the people from any other source .
In Stalin ’s communism , the state was everything .
Religion had to go .
Why ?
Not because he did n’t personally believe in god , but because god ( or more correctly , god ’s institution here on earth ) interfered with his ability to control Russia .
So the state became officially atheistic .
The underpinnings of atheism are freethought .
That ’s FREE THOUGHT .
Thought that is free .
Free thinkers are able to make up their owns minds about their beliefs ; beliefs are not imposed by the state on free thinkers .
Atheism , as we know it and advocate it on blogs such as this one , is anathema to communism , Stalinism , Bolshevism , Polpotism ( OK , I made that word up ) or any other ‘ ism ” that relies on state centered dogma imposed from above .
Atheism in Stalin ’s Russia , then , was a mere tool used by Stalin , for the greater good of the state , imposed on the structure of society .
It ’s effect was to strip away the power of the church to oppose his power .
It was not a mere lack of belief in gods .
Stalin could care less about the individual beliefs of the peasant , his focus was on destroying organized religion .
Religion still flourished unofficially in Stalinist Russia , he actually reopened the churches during WWII in order to motivate the people to fight , and religion continues to this day .
No one died because they refused to embrace atheism .
Many died because they were deemed enemies of the state .
Religious leaders may have been among the executed , but not because they refused to become atheists , but because they were viewed as holdovers of the old order that would try to oppose the state .
However , nowhere near the number of people claimed by theists actually died in Stalinist Russia .
Historians have pored over the records once they were thrown open after the fall of the USSR , hoping to find evidence of mass executions .
So far , the evidence points to about 3,000,000 total deaths by reason of execution , privation and resettlement .
( Of those only about 7 - 800,000 were by execution . )
Another 6 - 8 million died during the Famine in the Ukraine , but historians are unable to say whether Stalin caused the famine intentionally , or whether it was just an ill - conceived agrarian policy gone bad .
In any event , it ’s very hard to justify the claim that a famine was used “ in the name of atheism ” to kill people .
The entire allegation is a red herring .
It is created by theists to divert your attention from the clearly historical basis of Christian horror .
If you are debating theists and it ’s raised as some sort of defense , point out that the issue being debated is not some trumped up historical claim about atheism , but the validity of the real historical religion known as Christianity .
Is it true ?
Is it valid ?
Is it good ?
The ultimate question is , are atheists correct ?
Does god exist ?
( My personal answer is , if he does , he would have stopped Stalin from killing all those alleged victims of atheism .
The horrors of Stalin are very good evidence for the non-existence of god .
I do n’t understand why theists keep pointing us to it . )
And if your theist still insists on his or her belief that Stalin killed 100 million people in the name of atheism , or even just three million , simply shrug your shoulders and understand where Dawkins got the third word in the title of his book , “ The God Delusion “ .

Shaft : 2 " Aquamet 17 new 3/07 Generators : Phasor 21kw ( Star ) Cummins 40kw ( Port ) About the Clipper City The Clipper City was first built as a cargo schooner just prior to the Civil War , then rebuilt from the original plans , on loan from the Smithsonian Institution , and recently refurbished .
The new , restored Clipper City , with a length of 158 feet and a height of 118 feet , can comfortably sail 144 people - the most of any passenger sailboat in the United States .
With her sweeping deck , full bar , and eight sails , this majestic schooner and its attentive crew now sail daily from South Street Seaport , providing guests with a unique way to see Manhattan .
The original 1854 Clipper City schooner came from the shipyard of Manitowoc , Wisconsin , a town soon nicknamed " Clipper City " because of its growing reputation for shipbuilding .
The plans for Clipper City are in the permanent collection at the Smithsonian , and a replica cross-section of the boat is on permanent display at the Wisconsin Maritime Museum .
In 1856 , the U.S. Nautical Magazine & Naval Journal reported that Clipper City could sail from Chicago to Port Washington , Wisconsin , a full 115 miles , in just seven and a half hours .
Built to haul lumber , she was enormously successful in her time .
Clipper City was decommissioned in 1890 , but in 1984 naval architects DeJong & Lebet re-built her , with adaptations to meet modern safety requirements .
The new Clipper City , a steel - hulled schooner carrying six fore - and - aft rigged sails and two square topsails on two steel masts , was operated as a Baltimore charter vessel for 20 years .
She then fell into disrepair , but recently acquired and extensively renovated and rebuilt over an 8 month period .
The ship that sails daily from Pier 17 on South Street has been carefully restored to match the beauty of her Civil War-era ancestor .
She is currently the largest passenger sailboat in operation in the United States .

It sounds like a tinfoil hat nightmare , come to life : tiny electronic homing beacons , guiding CIA killer drones to their targets .
But local residents and Taliban militants in Pakistan 's tribal wildlands say that 's exactly what 's happening .
Tribesman in Waziristan are being paid to " plant the electronic devices " near militant safehouses , they tell the Guardian .
" Hours or days later , a drone , guided by the signal from the chip , destroys the building with a salvo of missiles . "
Ever since 9/11 , locals in Central Asia and the Middle East have spread tall tales about American super - technology : soldiers with x-ray glasses , satellites that can see into homes , tanks with magnetic , grenade - repelling armor .
But small radio frequency or GPS emitters have been commercially available for years .
A veteran spy tells Danger Room that the use of these Taliban - tracking devices entirely plausible .
" Transmitters make a lot of sense to me .
It is simply not possible to train a Pashtun from Waziristan to go to a targeted site , case it , and come back to Peshawar or Islamabad with anything like an accurate report .
The best you can hope for is they 're putting the transmitter on the right house , " says former CIA case officer Robert Baer .
Herndon , Virginia - based defense contractor EWA Government Systems , Inc. is one of several firms that boasts of making tiny devices to help manhunters locate their prey .
The company 's " Bigfoot Remote Tagging System " is a " very small , battery - operated device used to emit an RF [ radio frequency ] transmission [ so ] that the target can be located and / or tracked . "
* The tag has sophisticated power management features to allow use over a long period of time ( months ) ...
Each tag can be installed on a witting or unwitting person , material , vehicle , ship , etc .
Power is supplied by installed battery or host power source .
The tag can be augmented with GPS to allow data logging for later exfiltration or geo-fencing functions ( on / off when inside defined geographic boundaries ) .
Bigfoot provides the warfighter with real - time tracking intelligence on potential adversaries conducting threat activities .

Word of these tiny transmitters has been circulating in militant circles for months .
In early April , the Pakistani Taliban leader Mullah Nazir said he had caught " spies " who were inserting into militants ' phones " location - tracking SIMs " – Subscriber Identity Module cards , used to identify mobile devices on a cellular network .
Ten days later , 19 year - old Habibur Rehman made a videotaped " confession " of planting such devices , just before he was executed by the Taliban as an American spy .
" I was given $ 122 to drop chips wrapped in cigarette paper at Al Qaeda and Taliban houses , " he said .
If I was successful , I was told , I would be given thousands of dollars . "
But Rehman says he did n't just tag jihadists with the devices .
" The money was good so I started throwing the chips all over .
I knew people were dying because of what I was doing , but I needed the money , " he added .
Which raises the possibility that the unmanned aircraft – America 's key weapons in its covert war on Pakistan 's jihadists and insurgents – may have been lead to the wrong targets .
One much - disputed Pakistani media report claimed that the drones have killed hundreds of civilians , just to take out a few militants .
That 's unlikely .
But what 's indisputable is that the robotic planes ( and the innocent deaths they 're alleged to cause ) have become increasingly controversial , both in Pakistan and in America .
" Anti-U.S. sentiment has already been increasing in Pakistan ... especially in regard to cross-border and reported drone strikes , which Pakistanis perceive to cause unacceptable civilian casualties , " Gen. David Petraeus , head of U.S. Central Command , wrote in a secret assessment , obtained by the Washington Post .
" Thirty - five percent say they do not support U.S. strikes into Pakistan , even if they are coordinated with the GOP [ government of Pakistan ] and the Pakistan Military ahead of time . "
But Pakistani and American intelligence officials swear the drones are getting more accurate .
" There are better targets and better intelligence on the ground , " on Pakistani official tells the Post .
" It 's less of a crapshoot . "

Jaswant Singh praised Mr Jinnah in his book
A former leader of India 's opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has challenged the decision by an Indian state to ban his book .
The BJP government in Gujarat banned Jaswant Singh 's book on Pakistan 's founder , Mohammed Ali Jinnah .
Mr Singh has filed a case in the Supreme Court challenging the ban .
He was expelled from the party last week .
The state said it banned the book for " defamatory references " to India 's first home minister Vallabhbhai Patel .
The late Mr Patel is a political icon in his home state of Gujarat .
Described often as the " Iron Man of India " , Mr Patel played an important role in the country 's independence and the integration of the different states in the Indian union .
Jaswant Singh said he was " saddened " by the ban .
" The day we start banning books , we are banning thinking , " he said .
The book examines the role of Congress party leader and the country 's first Prime Minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , and Mr Patel in the partition of India in 1947 .
Mr Singh writes that Mr Patel was " far off the mark " in many ways with his projections about the division and future of India .
The BJP dissociated itself from the book and sacked Mr Singh from the party .
Jaswant Singh is a 71 - year - old party veteran who has served as finance and external affairs minister in BJP cabinets .
The book has been selling well both in India and Pakistan .
COLUMBUS , Ohio —
Lawyers plan state and federal lawsuits and a request to Ohio Gov .
Ted Strickland to stop next week ’s unprecedented second execution attempt of a man whose lethal injection failed on Tuesday .
Cleveland attorney Tim Sweeney said Thursday that he expects lawsuits to be filed no later than Friday in an effort to halt the next attempt to put Romell Broom to death .
Sweeney argues that a second try at an execution is unconstitutional .
At the very least , he said , Strickland should further delay Tuesday ’s execution .
Broom “ sustained both physical and mental injuries , ” Sweeney said .
“ It ’s going to take time for all the psychic trauma to dissipate .
Even if it never goes away , I think it ’s wrong to try to do it again so quickly in these circumstances . ”
Strickland stopped Broom ’s execution after executioners tried unsuccessfully for two hours to find a usable vein .
Broom , who at one point wiped his face with a tissue and appeared to be weeping , told his attorneys he was pricked as many as 18 times .
Broom , 53 , was sentenced to die for the rape and stabbing death of a 14 - year - old Tryna Middleton , a girl he kidnapped in Cleveland in 1984 .
Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason said it was ironic that Broom was complaining about the execution given the nature of his crime .
“ I am absolutely certain that it was Tryna Middleton that suffered from cruel and unusual punishment , ” Mason said .
Broom remains at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility , where the prison system is monitoring how much he ’s drinking , said prisons spokeswoman Julie Walburn .
Officials want to make sure Broom is not dehydrated before the execution , but they ca n’t force him to drink more , she said .
Dehydration could make it more difficult to find veins , however , Walburn said there ’s no evidence that caused Tuesday ’s problems .
Another execution attempt could include the same veins they tried accessing Tuesday or other points on his arms , legs or feet , Walburn said .
Also Thursday , two federal public defenders asked U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frost to order that Broom be made available to them for a legal deposition .
The fact that Broom survived the execution “ creates a singular opportunity to confirm that he , in fact , experienced serious pain in violation of his constitutional rights , not just a ‘ substantial risk ’ of serious pain , ” David Stebbins and Allen Bohnert argued in a court filing .
The only case similar to the Broom execution happened in Louisiana in 1946 , when a first attempt to execute Willie Francis did not work .
Francis was returned to death row for nearly a year while the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether a second electrocution would be unconstitutional .
The court ultimately ruled against Francis 5 - 4 and he was put to death in 1947 .
Broom has a much stronger case than Francis , said Deborah Denno , a Fordham University law professor and death penalty expert .
It was unclear how far the first execution actually went and whether Francis experienced the electric current , she said .
The court ’s uncertainty about that fact played a major role in its decision to return him to the electric chair , Denno said .
In the case of Broom , however , “ There ’s absolutely no question that the execution process started , ” she said .
Justice Felix Frankfurter , a swing vote in the court ’s 1947 decision , also said a different set of facts could have led to a different decision .
Those facts could include “ a series of abortive attempts at electrocution , ” he wrote .
Denno said that ’s clearly the case with the Broom execution attempt .
We are – at the same time – thrillingly close and sickeningly far from solving our planetary fever .
The world 's leaders huddled in New York City yesterday to discuss man-made global warming , in a United Nations building that will soon be underwater if they fail .
They all know what has to happen : their scientists have told them , plainly and urgently .
As man -made warming rises by up to 2.4C , all sorts of awful things happen – whole island - states in the South Pacific will drown , for example – but we can stop it .
If we turn off the warming gases , the temperature will stabilise .
But if we go beyond 2.4C , global warming will run away from us , and we will have lost the " Stop " button .
The Amazon rainforest will dry out and burn down , releasing all the carbon stored in the trees ; the vast amounts of warming gases stored in the Arctic will be belched into the atmosphere ; and so 3C will turn ineluctably to 4C , which will turn to 5C , and the planet will rapidly become a place we do not recognise .
To stay the right side of this climatic Point of No Return , global emissions need to start falling by 2015 – just six years from now – and drop by 85 per cent by 2050 .
Our leaders need to agree this at the climate talks in Copenhagen in December .
The scientific debate is over .
The answer is in sight .
Indeed , each one of the leaders could feel the solution on their skin and in their hair yesterday : it lies in the awesome power of the sun .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Each day , the sun bombards our planet with 9,000 times more power than we need to run every car , warm every home , and power every electrical appliance on earth .
If we can capture just a sliver of one per cent of it , we can kick fossil fuels into the melting dustbin of history .
The technology exists .
It is there , waiting for us .
Professor Anthony Patt has shown that all the energy Europe needs could be provided by lining 0.3 per cent of the Sahara desert – an area the size of Belgium – with concentrating solar power technology .
A consortium of Germany 's leading corporations is raring to go .
They just need the money .
It costs a lot up front – $ 50 bn – but this is nothing like as much we would spend chasing the last dribbles of oil into warzones , and defending ourselves as the planet goes into meltdown .
Every continent has the same option .
The entire energy needs of the US could be met by covering 200 square kilometres of its empty deserts with solar plants : it would cost about 10 years ' worth of oil purchases , with none of the wars , tyrannies , or blowback Islamism .
China and India have similar options .
It is achievable , with the kind of great effort we made to defeat the Nazis .
We too could be a great generation – one that came close to the brink , but then came together in a great collective effort to change course .
We would leave a lean , green civilisation that will run for millennia .
But instead , our leaders are fiddling with the old dirty technologies , too addicted and too addled to move us on and up .
In Britain , we are actually turning back to coal , mining 15 per cent more this year than last .
Professor Jim Hansen , the head of Nasa and the world 's leading climatologist , calls coal power stations " death factories " that condemn millions to drown , or starve , or burn .
Across Europe , solar power is being allowed to wither : Germany 's biggest solar company , Q - Cells , has seen its stock fall from € 100 to € 10 in a year .
The other market - leader , Spain , has seen a similarly disastrous fallback .
The World Bank , which receives £ 400 m of your taxes every year , is promoting this soot - streaked vision across the planet .
They have just spent $ 5 bn helping poor countries to build power plants that will destroy them .
Indeed , it just bankrolled the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in earth – a coal plant in Gujarat , Western India .
How can this possibly be defended ?
US and European governments are engaged in the collective fantasy that coal can be rendered " clean " by " scrubbing " its carbon emissions from the chimney - stacks , and storing them somewhere forever .
In the real world , one of the largest " clean coal " pilot plants in operation , Hazelwood power station in the Latrobe Valley , catches just 0.05 per cent of its carbon emissions .
Professor Howard Herzog , the renowned expert on this technology , was recently asked what the chances of the technology achieving the cuts we need is .
He replied : " Zero . "
But a small number of people make a lot of money on coal and oil and gas .
A shift to reaping power from the sun and the wind and the waves would render the rocks and barrels they have spent a fortune mining worthless – so they are prepared to pay politicians to keep the system working in their favour , and lavish billions on misinformation campaigns to keep us confused .
You can see this process working most clearly in the United States .
Barack Obama is a highly intelligent man who has appointed some of the best scientists in the world to explain to him what needs to happen now .
But he is trapped in a political system soaked in petrol .
The lackey - filled House of Representatives has passed a woefully inadequate " Cap and Trade " bill , which – if it worked perfectly – would cut emissions by six per cent below 1990 levels .
Even that wo n't happen : many of the permits oil companies are supposed to pay for will now be given away for nothing , producing no reductions at all .
And even this feeble , sickly bill may not make it through Congress .
Meanwhile , China has hinted it would agree to more substantial restraint at Copenhagen if the rich world – responsible for 90 per cent of all the warming gases belched into the atmosphere so far – agrees to give one per cent of its GDP annually to poor countries to adjust to clean fuels .
There 's a lot to criticise the Chinese dictatorship for , but this is n't one of them .
It 's a reasonable request for simple justice .
Poor countries have done very little to cause this crisis , but they will feel the worst , first .
They deserve our reparations .
Yet both the EU and US have damned this sane proposal as " totally unrealistic " .
So are we , as a species , condemned to fall into the historical crack between a world powered by fossil fuels , and one powered by the sun ?
Will the fossil record discovered millions of years from now show we were just too irrational and too primitive to make that leap ?
If we despair and wait glumly for the meltdown , we will make it so .
Then we will have little choice but to try to survive as best we can in a radically altered landscape .
But there is still a slim window in which sanity can prevail – and I believe , perhaps madly , that it can .
It will require a global mass movement of extraordinary tenacity , pressuring governments everywhere , and overpowering the fossil fools .
We can still change the tale of the 21st century from one of collapse to one of a species finding a way to live with its ecosystem , rather than against it .
It can be done .
It must be done .
Copenhagen is in three months .
There , and in the years after when the deal must be implemented , we will learn something profound about ourselves .
Are we a great generation – or the worst of all ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States blasted ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya for his “ irresponsible and foolish ” return from exile before a settlement was reached in the Central American country ’s political crisis .
At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States to discuss the Honduran face - off , Lewis Anselem , the U.S. ambassador to the OAS , also criticized Honduras ’ de facto government for its “ deplorable ” action in barring entry of an OAS mission and declaring a state of siege on Sunday .
Anselem also criticized Zelaya for fueling violence by slipping back into Honduras last week and holing up in the Brazilian Embassy , from where he has called on his supporters to take to the streets .
“ The return of Zelaya absent an agreement is irresponsible and foolish ...
He should cease and desist from making wild allegations and from acting as though he were starring in an old movie , ” Anselm said .
Anselem urged the de facto government to handle security with “ restraint and caution ” and called on Zelaya to “ exercise leadership ” and urge his supporters to express their views peacefully .
He said the United States had urged Zelaya on several occasions not to return to Honduras before a political settlement was achieved because of the potential for unrest .
“ Having chosen , with outside help , to return on his own terms , President Zelaya and those who have facilitated his return , bear particular responsibility for the actions of his supporters , ” the U.S. official said .
Anselem said the U.S. government will continue to urge both sides to quickly reach agreement under the San Jose accord proposed by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias , which calls for Zelaya to return to office to finish his term ending in January .
While President Barack Obama has condemned the coup that toppled Zelaya and has cut off some aid to Honduras , conservatives criticize him for helping an ally of Venezuela ’s leftist President Hugo Chavez .
Zelaya was overthrown in a military coup on June 28 .
The de facto civilian government has resisted international pressure to allow the leftist president ’s reinstatement and on Sunday gave Brazil a 10 - day ultimatum to decided what too with Zelaya , threatening to close the embassy .

In short , we have done everything short of poking the bear with a very sharp stick , yet for some reason we act surprised when the Russian navy sends a strategic message :
Commodore Stephen Saunders , a former submarine commander and editor of Jane ’s Fighting Ships , said : “ The arrival of Akula Class submarines off the US eastern seaboard is as much a political move by the Russian Navy as a military one , although these deployments would always have to be approved from high - up .
It ’s unquestionably the Russian Navy trying to raise its profile . ” ( Emphasis mine )
But there are any number of other dynamics at work here : the Russian navy has always been something of a lesser stepchild to their army , for example , so of course the admiralty welcomes the chance for a strategic mission .
The submarines are reportedly their most modern Akula - class , so this amounts to “ showing off ” military technology at a time when the United States dominates the international arms market to the world ’s richest countries .
Nevertheless , the news feeds right - wing hysteria right at a time when “ communism ” and “ socialism ” are returning to their rhetoric :
For $ 23.95 you can buy a T - shirt for your favorite youngster with the words “ Future Lobbyist ” printed on the chest .
It ’s cute , perhaps .
It also serves as a rueful commentary on the state of American democracy .
Is the “ Land of the Free ” becoming the Land of the Moneyed , a plutocracy where the rich and powerful have disproportionate political influence ?
Consider :
• Last year a record $ 3.3 billion was spent on lobbyists , roughly twice the 2001 amount .
This year , despite the worst recession since the ’30s , the total is on track to reach a new high .
• The 2008 presidential candidates raised more than $ 1 billion for the first time .
• In a 2007 global survey of anticorruption measures , the US ranked high in almost all categories except reining in the influence of money on politics .
There it rated a special negative mention along with Canada , Bulgaria , and Latvia .
( The index , by Global Integrity , measures the safeguards in place , not how often or effectively they ’re used . )
“ There is certainly an overwhelming influence of money and corporate power ” in the US , says Gar Alperovitz , a professor of political economy at the University of Maryland in College Park .
The latest example is healthcare reform .
In the second quarter of 2009 , the health industry ( pharmaceuticals , health products , doctors , insurance , hospitals , and nursing homes ) spent $ 133 million on lobbyists , reckons the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington .
That does n’t count lobbying by numerous associations .
The US Chamber of Commerce alone spent $ 26 million on lobbying in the first half of this year , “ a good chunk ” on the health issue , says Dave Levinthal , spokesman for the center .
Earlier this month , the Campaign Media Analysis Group reported $ 52 million has been spent this year on broadcast ads , pro and con , related to reform .
Polls indicate the public wants healthcare reform and a public - insurance option .
So the health - insurance industry is pretending to be in favor of reform while trying to kill it through campaign contributions , ads , and lobbying , says Wendell Potter , who until recently headed corporate communications at CIGNA , a major health - insurance company .
Some 350 health - industry lobbyists , many of them former members of Congress or their staff , are swarming Capitol Hill , he says .
The industry uses “ deception , disinformation , outright lies , and fear mongering ” to peel away reform ’s supporters .
The industry ’s “ mission No. 1 ” is to block any public - insurance option that would compete with private insurance .
After a decade of mergers and acquisitions , the health - insurance industry is now “ a very large cartel , ” he says .
Many nations do n’t want to shed light on the hidden influence of wealth .
“ No other governance reform seems to create greater problems for the vast majority of countries , ” Global Integrity said in its 2008 survey of 92 nations .
Is the influence of money on US politics outsized ?
In other industrial nations , political campaigns tend to be shorter , and usually their financing is regulated in various ways .
Moreover , says Mr. Alperovitz , trade unions provide some balance of power to the might of business and wealth .
In Sweden , 85 percent of the labor force is organized ; in other major nations 35 - 40 percent .
That compares with 7.4 percent of workers in the private sector in the US .
The US is slipping toward plutocracy because of rising inequality of income and wealth , warns Greg Palast , author of “ The Best Democracy Money Can Buy . ”
Business buys Republicans and rents Democrats on each major issue , he adds .

What I 'm offering here is about 300 stuffed penguins of various shapes , sizes , and species ( predominately Emperor , though - - like the kind in March of the Penguins ) to a deserving child .
I 'm going through a pretty weird time in my life right now -- having just gone through a break - up and graduated college and temporarily living in my parents ' house before I move out for good in in the fall , though I remain unemployed because my philosophy degree is at * such * a premium -- and sifting through my room ( which has become a strange amalgam of my adolescence and burgeoning adulthood ) , it 's been brought to my attention that I probably wo n't " catch a man " or have anyone believe I 'm about to turn 23 with 300 penguins and a bunch of purple furniture around , that looking at my current room one might think some sort of 13 - year - old with developmental issues is living here .
I loved penguins as a child -- long before they were trendy and had their own series of CGI movies or the godly voice of Morgan Freeman was involved -- and collected them , often putting on penguin weddings and penguin ballet recitals where I made costumes for individual penguins , all of whom had names that I kept track of on my penguin censuses .
I could recite all 16 species of penguin in alphabetical order ...... so , yes , I feel justified in saying I want a deserving child .
A child that will really , well , love the penguins , and cherish his / her youth with them as it slowly slips away ...
Or , alternatively , some adult who has a great use for them , like if you are making the next big penguin movie ( or play ? ) .
Or , if you are opening some new theme restaurant in town and need my penguins for your decor .
As long as I 'm auctioning off my childhood to the highest bidder , I reserve the right to be a little choosy .
E-mail with your intentions and we will work something out .
Record breaking heist rocks Eve Online guild to the tune of $ 16,500 USD in virtual goods
This was published in September 's issue of PC Gamer UK , a popular video game article magazine .
It is a detailed account of what has to be one of most beautifully executed in - game scams in a MMORPG ever pulled .
It breaks all previous world records for ' virtual crime ' .
The game in question is Eve Online , an open ended sci - fi mmorpg with a heavy emphasis on roleplaying , where developers try to give their players as much freedom as possible , and where corporate espionage and political intrigue have become an integral part of the game .
The perpetrator of the heist was the Guiding Hand Social Club ( GHSC ) corporation ( a corporation being similar to a clan in Eve ) ; a freelance mercenary outfit that offers their services ( which usually involves corp infiltration , theft and assassination ) to the highest bidder .
Over a year in planning , the GHSC infilitrated their target 's corp with their own members and gained their trust , as well as access to the corp hangers , with time .
It all concluded in a perfectly timed climax , with a massive theft in multiple corp hangars synchronized with the in - game killing of the corporation 's CEO , the primary target of the contract .
What 's most interesting and impressive about this operation is that it was entirely ' legal ' and within the game 's own rules , and the mastermind and his agents pulled it off together flawlessly , all the while staying in character .
The estimated real - life value of the items stolen is , according to PC Gamer , $ 16,500 US .
The in - game value of course is much , much higher as the things stolen would take years and years to aquire .
And now , the PC Gamer scans .
I hope you 'll find it as entertaining a read as I have .

Here are some notes on how to work with probability distributions using the SciPy numerical library for Python .
Functions related to probability distributions are located in scipy . stats .
The general pattern is
scipy.stats .< distribution family >.< function >
There are 81 supported continuous distribution families and 12 discrete distribution families .
Some distributions have obvious names : gamma , cauchy , t , f , etc .
The only possible surprise is that all distributions begin with a lower - case letter , even those corresponding to a proper name ( e.g. Cauchy ) .
Other distribution names are less obvious : expon for the exponential , chi2 for chi-squared distribution , etc .
Each distribution supports several functions .
The density and cumulative distribution functions are pdf and cdf respectively .
( Discrete distributions use pmf rather than pdf . )
One surprise here is that the inverse CDF function is called ppf for “ percentage point function . ”
I ’d never heard that terminology and would have expected something like “ quantile . ”
Example : scipy.stats.beta.cdf( 0.1 , 2 , 3 ) evaluates the CDF of a beta ( 2 , 3 ) random variable at 0.1 .
Random values are generated using rvs which takes an optional size argument .
The size is set to 1 by default .
Example : scipy.stats.norm.rvs( 2 , 3 ) generates a random sample from a normal ( Gaussian ) random variable with mean 2 and standard deviation 3 .
The function call scipy.stats.norm.rvs( 2 , 3 , size = 10 ) returns an array of 10 samples from the same distribution .
The command line help ( ) facility does not document the distribution parameterizations , but the external documentation does .
Most distributions are parameterized in terms of location and scale .
This means , for example , that the exponential distribution is parameterized in terms of its mean , not its rate .
Somewhat surprisingly , the exponential distribution has a location parameter .
This means , for example , that scipy.stats.expon.pdf(x , 7 ) evaluates at x the PDF of an exponential distribution with location 7 .
This is not what I expected .
I assumed there would be no location parameter and that the second argument , 7 , would be the mean ( scale ) .
Instead , the location was set to 7 and the scale was left at its default value 1 . Writing scipy.stats.expon.pdf(x , scale=7 ) would have given the expected result because the default location value is 0 .
SciPy also provides constructors for objects representing random variables .
Example : x = scipy.stats.norm( 3 , 1 ) ; x.cdf ( 2.7 ) returns the same value as scipy.stats.norm.cdf( 2.7 , 3 , 1 ) .
Constructing objects representing random variables encapsulates the differences between distributions in the constructors .
For example , some distributions take more parameters than others and so their object constructors require more arguments .
But once a distribution object is created , its PDF , for example , can be called with a single argument .
This makes it easier to write code that takes a general distribution object as an argument .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Iran is not going to produce a nuclear weapon any time soon and the threat posed by its atomic program has been exaggerated , the U.N. nuclear watchdog chief said in a published interview .
International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei attends a board of governors meeting in Vienna June 18 , 2009 .

The West suspects Iran wants to develop a nuclear weapons capability under the guise of a declared civilian atomic energy program .
Tehran rejects the charge , saying its uranium enrichment program is a peaceful way to generate electricity .
Mohamed ElBaradei , director - general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , said there was no concrete evidence that Tehran has an ongoing nuclear weapons program .
“ But somehow , many people are talking about how Iran ’s nuclear program is the greatest threat to the world .
In many ways , I think the threat has been hyped , ” he told the specialist Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists .
ElBaradei said there was concern about Iran ’s future nuclear intentions and that the Islamic Republic needs to be more transparent with the Vienna - based U.N. nuclear watchdog .
“ But the idea that we ’ll wake up tomorrow and Iran will have a nuclear weapon is an idea that is n’t supported by the facts as we have seen them so far , ” said ElBaradei , 67 , who will step down in November after 12 years in office .
The interview was conducted in July but released late on Tuesday .
Last week , an IAEA report lent some weight to Western intelligence reports that Iran had studied ways to make atom bombs although the agency has repeatedly said it does not have concrete proof of a weapons agenda .
Iran has refused to provide documentation , access to sites or to nuclear officials for interviews which the IAEA has requested to reach conclusions about the intelligence materials .
In the interview , ElBaradei said there was an urgent need to follow up on U.S. President Barack Obama ’s proposal for a dialogue between Washington and Tehran , but that resorting to harsher sanctions against Iran if it does not engage would achieve little .
ElBaradei said he had gleaned from experiences dealing with North Korea and Iraq that dialogue was a more effective tool than sanctions .
He was not talking about a specific country .
“ Another lesson is to use sanctions only as a last resort and to avoid sanctions that hurt innocent civilians .
As we saw in Iraq , sanctions only denied vulnerable , innocent civilians food and medicine , ” he said .
Iran ’s chief nuclear negotiator was quoted as saying on Tuesday that Tehran has prepared an “ updated nuclear proposal ” and is ready to talk to world powers .
The West has said it is still waiting for details .
Germany is to host high - level talks on Iran ’s nuclear program on Wednesday with the United States , China , France , Britain and Russia .
Western powers are expected to push China and Russia to back a fourth round of U.N. sanctions which could target Iran ’s vital energy sector .
As a man of science , Doctor Dee wanted to find all out all about the powers and the possibilities of the black mirror .
We now know of the hypnotic effects of looking into a crystal ball of shew stone , and it is possible that the assistant of Doctor Dee , the seer Edward Kelley , driven by his instincts and lowest desires , was visited by hallucinations , projected in the black anthracite dephts of the mirror where he was desperately searching for some light .
Kelley seems to have been dragged along by impulses of which he was not aware , while Dee - seeking knowledge and wisdom - was sitting at his side and taking notes , trying to understand the phenomena occurring before his stunned eyes .
The black mirror was not inhabited by the one superhuman spirit of Uriel , the Angel of the Light .
There lived other inhuman entities in and outside the mirror , which could only be seen by the seer and who spoke through his mouth , while his body was in action or lying lifeless on the floor .
Doctor
Dee neglected his other work and soon was plagued by financial problems .
His inquisitive Patron , Queen Elizabeth , was of the opinion that he must be able to solve them himself , since he was an alchemist .
But unfortunately , Doctor Dee had n't discovered yet the technology that could turn lead into gold .
One day a desperate doctor Dee asked the female angelic spirit Madimi if she could lend him one hundred pounds for a few weeks .
But Madimi said in a previous life she had throwned all her money out of doors and windows , and she got angry when Kelley tried to pry under her skirts .
Uriel refused also refused to help them .
" Silver and gold I have not to give , " he said .
" My blessing is far more valuable than the scum of the earth . "
At that time the Polish Prince Alasco stayed at the English court , and Dee asked him if he would like to be the patron of a number of alchemical experiments the Doctor and his seer wanted to conduct by using the black mirror .
Dee made an appeal to the vanity and ambition of Prince Alasco .
The mirror spirit Galvah predicted that the Prince , whom he called " Laski " , one day certainly would become the King of Poland , provided that he possessed an inexhaustible source of gold .
But of course , in that case he had to pay Dee and Kelley for conducting the alchemical experiments .
Unfortunately , Laski had to return to Poland urgently , and he left a sum of money , so that Doctor Dee , his wife and son Arthur , and Kelley and his wife could travel to Poland .
Dee took his black mirror and a number of books with him , Kelley his " powders of magick " and an alchemical manual .
Before reaching the vast estates of Prince Laski however , the relationship between Dee and Kelley got in a serious crisis .
In May 1584 they found themselves in Krakow , where the spirits of the mirror said to Kelley that he should burn all the books and records Doctor Dee had brought with him .
should burn .
It is not clear how Dee responded to this .
Several other famous and infamous magicians were at one point asked by beings living in higher spheres to burn their own books of magic : Solomon , Simon Magus , Roger Bacon , Nostradamus ...
Every time there was this question of a spiritual crisis , a mysterious necessity , a certain threat .
As they approached the estate of Laski , Galvah began to see Prince Laski no longer as the future King of Poland and the benefactor of the rest of the world , but he predicted the Prince would be destroyed too , just as the good old Doctor Dee , who was nothing more than a miserable beggar .
The spirits of the mirror again insisted that Dee should burn his wicked and blasphemous books .
would destroy , but Dee did n't not succumb to their threats .
All documents remain silent about the events that took place between September 1585 and the end of April 1586 .
Probably it was Kelley who ritually burned the books of Doctor Dee ; apparently he was too afraid of the ghosts of the mirror to resist any longer .
Three of Dee 's books came back to him in what he called " a miraculous way " .
Later , other documents also seemed to have been saved from the fire , but it was not clear who did this , or how and when it was done .
The two magicians left Prince Laski for what he was , and before they reached his castle , they turned and moved on to Prague .
Dee wanted to speak to the Emperor Rudolf II , but Rudolf had just received a message , also from ghosts , and although no one knew what exactly it was they had said , it must have been a very unpleasant message , because when Doctor Dee arrived at the court , he was promptly thrown out the palace .
Meanwhile , the questioning of the spirits in the mirror had led to a new discovery .
The numbers and symbols that appeared together with the ghosts in the mirror , could be reduced to letters and words , and they started to unveil the secrets of the wonderful black mirror .
Dee wrote down , in a code , their statements about life in and out the mirror , the forces of the mirror and its effects on the human spirit .
This document starts as follows :
Logaeth seg lovi brtnc
Dox Larzed ner habzilb adnor
Doncha Larb frog hirobra
EXI Fri zednip taiip chimvane
Cher mach lendix nor zandox
" In these words are the Mysteries of Our Creation , of Eternity and of the End of the World , " the spirits said .
According to Kelley during the experiments not only numbers and symbols were seen , but also dragons and toads .
He tried to stop the sessions , but Dee wanted to go further .
In this book titled " Logaeth " and dictated to him by the spirits in an almost unbreakable code , all the knowledge and wisdom were reflected , of human and superhuman spirits and since the beginning of Time .
Kelley began to exhibit increasingly chaotic behavior , then categorically refused to continue the séances and finally fled from Doctor Dee and his family .
Dee 's wife Jane and his eight year old son Arthur took his place before the Black Mirror of Magick , but Jane only saw some points and figures without any cohesion and in Arthur 's visions there were men with crowns and lions , but no numbers or symbols that could be turned into letters ands words .
Kelley returned and the female spirit Madimi now shamelessly showed herself naked to him , ordering the two magicians to go for " a woman exchange " .
Both the women of the Magi protested vigorously , and ultimately the experiments were stopped .
Some scholars have stated that this was all a trick of Kelley to get Mrs Dee in his bed - but Kelley was speaking in tongues now and seemed to have lost his mind completely .
Nobody knows what finally happened between the two magicians and their wives .
In the autumn of 1589 Dee returned with his family back to England .
Kelley would come after him , but he wanted to go first to Antwerp for some vague reasons .
But Kelley did n't come back and Doctor Dee had to travel through Western Europe again , looking for a new and indispensable assistant .
During his absence , his library and his laboratory in Mortlake , were plundered by a mob that called him " the friend of the hell hounds " .
Kelley would later pop up in Prague , where Rudolf II asked him to carry out a number of alchemical experiments .
When he failed to make gold out of lead , he was imprisoned .
The Emperor only released him to perform the " Great Work " .
Kelley lost his patience and killed a soldier .
He was thrown in prison again and in 1595 , he tied some sheets together and climbed out of the window .
He fell down and broke his neck .
Dee did n't find another seer like Kelley .
Queen Elizabeth gave him occasionally some small sums of money .
He wrote a report , mentioning his triumphs and also his many misfortunes , but not saying a word about the black mirror .
In the year of Kelley 's death , Elizabeth appointed him as a teacher in a school in Manchester .
But the doctor resigned soon after that and retreated to Mortlake , where he earned a living drawing horoscopes for young couples .
Doctor Dee was once called " the companion of the dogs of hell " .
The University of Cambridge dismissed him because he was into the black arts .
The successor of Elizabeth refused him for exactly the same reason a modest pension .
Whatever the nature was of the spirits that Kelley had raised for him , as one had predicted , he died like a beggar in 1608 or 1609 ...

This week Twitter announced changes to its Terms of Service spelling out that you own your Tweets , and that Twitter can place ads next to your content .
What 's more , Twitter wants to crack down on spammers , bots and other bad behavior .
The refreshed Twitter Rules that are a part of the new Terms of Service spell out a number of different reasons why you may find your Twitter account terminated .
Everything from inappropriate content and squatting to selling usernames could be cause for you to get the boot .
Upon closer look we noticed that Twitter is closing the curtain on at least 10 types of Twitter users we see regularly attempt to game the service .
Here are the 10 people we wo n't be hearing from anymore :
1. The Impersonator
You know who you are .
You create Twitter accounts using celebrity names or big brand identities and you hope to fool unsuspecting Twitterers into following you for your namesake .
Good luck with that .
Twitter clearly spells out that " you may not impersonate others through the Twitter service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead , confuse , or deceive others . "
Clearing out impersonators will certainly be an ongoing process , but thankfully the Tony LaRussa lawsuit prompted Twitter to launch Verified Accounts , giving us assurance that those celebrities we follow are who they say they are .
2. The Bot
Robotic
Twitter accounts should live in fear of death by the powers that be at Twitter .
If you 're not human and you 're configured to automatically tweet , reply , and retweet based on Twitter content or RSS feeds then you could be in danger .
The rules express a clear preference for the human touch when it comes to Twitter updates , stating that you could be in violation of the TOS and subject to termination , " if your updates consist mainly of links , and not personal updates . "
This is an area where there might some push back by Twitterers , as some of us use bots for practical purposes .
IMDb's Twitter account , which has more than 45 k followers , is guilty of bot - like behavior , posting auto-updates from the movie database and auto- replying and DMing to Twitter inquiries , but it 's obviously well - received by followers .
We 're hoping Twitter will use discretion here to separate out the good bots from the bad ones ( like these guys ) .
3. The Naked Chick
While Twitter does n't plan to police or censor tweet content of an adult variety , they are going to crack down on inappropriate avatars or images on your Twitter background .
When it comes to porn , the Twitter rules dictate that , " You may not use obscene or pornographic images in either your profile picture or user background . "
Moral of the story : put some clothes on before you smile bright for your Twitter avatar or background image photo op .
4. The Serial Abuser
We 've all seen those Twitterers who are following 30,000 users but only have 4 followers in return .
Then , there are those that open massive quantities of Twitter accounts to retweet their own replies or stories , seeking the limelight of a Twitter trending topic .
It 's all very fishy , and we 're pretty good at sniffing these users out for what they are — spammers - but we could always use a little extra help .
Thankfully , Twitter to the rescue .
Serial accounts will not be tolerated , " You may not create serial accounts for disruptive or abusive purposes .
Mass account creation will result in suspension of all accounts . "
Serial activity could also get you in to trouble , so you might want to avoid these behaviors :
- If you have followed a large amount of users in a short amount of time - If you have followed and unfollowed people in a short time period , particularly by automated means ( aggressive follower churn ) -
If you repeatedly follow and unfollow people , whether to build followers or to garner more attention for your profile ; -
If you have a small number of followers compared to the amount of people you are following -
If a number of spam complaints have been filed against you -
If you post duplicate content over multiple accounts or multiple duplicate updates on one account -
If you send large numbers of duplicate @replies -
If you send large numbers of unsolicited @replies in an attempt to spam a service or link
5 . The Squatter
Domain name squatting has long been practiced by those looking to make money by snapping up desirable names in the hopes of later flipping them for a profit to interested buyers .
Given the value of a good Twitter name , it 's no surprise the practice has rolled to over the micro medium as well .
But Twitter will have none of that .
Name squatting is clearly spelled out as a big no - no .
" You may not engage in name squatting .
Accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may also be removed without further notice . "
Twitter will get suspicious based on any of these behaviors :
- the number of accounts created - creating accounts for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names - creating accounts for the purpose of selling those accounts - using feeds of third - party content to update and maintain accounts under the names of those third parties
6. The Slimy Salesman
We know you 're out there .
You think you can manipulate the Twitter ecosystem and turn Twitter followers into a marketplace for your own profit .
But if you think you can sell Twitter followers and just get away with it , think again .
You 're on Twitter 's bad list , " If you have attempted to " sell " followers , particularly through tactics considered aggressive following or follower churn . "
Does that mean you can't gamble with them either ?
7. The Hashtag Spammer
Due to the popularity of trending topics , opportunistic Twitterers have discovered that they can potentially reach more eyeballs if they append a trending hashtag to their tweet .
The activity is known as hashtag spam , and it 's unfortunately pretty commonplace and often inappropriate , just look at Habitat 's spam tactics as an example .
Thankfully , for those of you who " post multiple unrelated updates to a topic using # , " or " post multiple unrelated updates to a trending or popular topic , " your days may be numbered .
8. The Plagiarizer
The next time you tweet something someone else said or wrote without attributing it to them , you might want to think twice .
There 's now a Twitter code of ethics around content attribution , so " if you repost other user 's content without attribution , " you might find your account in limbo .
This is quite an interesting policy , as plagiarism and the failure to attribute content when appropriate is certainly an issue for the blogosphere as a whole , but not something we expected to see Twitter try to enforce .
Of course we believe attribution to be very important ( even if it 's just in RT form ) , we just think it might be hard to police .
9 . The Über Oversharer or Bully
Oversharing is common place on Twitter , especially if you buy into the thinking that 40 % of tweets are pointless babble .
But there comes a time and place when what you share in the public domain could be detrimental to another individual .
Should that be the case , Twitter is n't afraid to step in and take action .
As spelled out in the section on content boundaries , " You may not publish or post other people 's private and confidential information , such as credit card numbers , street address or Social Security / National Identity numbers , without their express authorization and permission . "
Basically they 're making it easier for themselves to crack down on the bullies of this Twittersphere , especially since threats wo n't be tolerated either .
" You may not publish or post direct , specific threats of violence against others . "
Hopefully Twitter will be a safer place as a result .
10 . The Faker
Given that Twitter has made its seal of approval for Verified Accounts relatively easy to replicate , those looking to add their own guaranteed stamp of authenticity can make something passable with a little ingenuity and a few Photoshop skills .
To impersonate someone on Twitter is one thing , but to fake having a verified account is something different entirely .
That 's why the penalty for faking verification is permanent suspension .
The rules clearly state that , " You may not use the Verified Account badge unless it is provided by Twitter .
Accounts using the badge as part of profile pictures , background images , or in any way implying false verification will be permanently suspended . "
What bad behavior on Twitter annoys you the most ?

AFP - Australia 's Qantas on Friday cancelled an order for 15 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft , citing dramatic changes to the global economic environment .
" Qantas announced its original B787 order in December 2005 , and the operating environment for the world 's airlines has clearly changed dramatically since then , " Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement .
Joyce said the cancellation , which would save Qantas three billion US dollars , had not been influenced by the delay of Dreamliner 's inaugural flight earlier this week due to a design flaw .
The statement said Qantas and Boeing had also agreed to postpone delivery of a further 15 Dreamliners .

Google , Yahoo ! , and MySpace have launched support for the OpenID OAuth Hybrid Protocol , which combines OpenID authentication ( sign in ) with OAuth authorization ( access control ) into a single interface .
Websites that accept OpenID can now let the hundreds of millions of users who already have either a MySpace , Google , or Yahoo !
account sign in and enable two - way data sharing of their profile , contacts , and activities , without having to register a new site - specific account or to share their password .
Plaxo is one of the earliest adopters of OpenID , allowing their users to sign into Plaxo using an OpenID enabled account with just a couple mouse clicks .
Instead of requiring first - time Plaxo users to manually verify their email address by sending a verification email , Plaxo uses OpenID Attribute Exchange to verify Yahoo ! and GMail email addresses without forcing users to wait at their mailbox for the verification email to arrive .
Building on their successful experience with OpenID , Plaxo is experimenting with the Hybrid Protocol : A portion of new users who sign up for Plaxo using either a GMail or Yahoo account can now sign into Plaxo with their OpenID and authorize two - way data sharing of their Contacts and Activities via the Hybrid Protocol .
You can read more about how this works on the Plaxo blog .
“ OpenID + OAuth hybrid onboarding is the state - of - the - art for connecting users and sites across the emerging Social Web , ” says Joseph Smarr , CTO of Plaxo and Board Member of the OpenID Foundation .
“ Google , Yahoo ! , and MySpace all have massive userbases and expertise in consumer - friendly design , along with a rich set of APIs .
So this is a major milestone in making the Social Web more open and interoperable . ”
Another trailblazer in the OpenID space is JanRain , whose RPX service powers the l
ogin and registration flows for their customers , including Qype and MySears .
Using the OpenID protocol , users can sign into RPX - enabled websites with an account that they already have .
Now that RPX supports the Hybrid Protocol , sites integrating with RPX can now let users sign in with one of their existing accounts and share their Profile .
In addition , these sites can also receive massive referral traffic by syndicating their user activities back to their OpenID Provider to be viewed by their friends and contacts at Yahoo ! , Google , or MySpace .
Not only are we making OpenID more powerful , we ’ve been taking steps to make OpenID easier and less confusing to use .
The traditional OpenID “ redirect ” user experience has been criticized for taking a user away from the site during the login process .
The OpenID User Interface Working Group has been chartered to make OpenID more user friendly , and we ’re glad to announce that Yahoo ! , Google , and MySpace now support the Popup UI as defined in the OpenID User Interface Extension .
Sites that want to preserve their context and keep the user on their site can open a small popup window to complete the OpenID authentication flow .
In order to help prevent phishing , the User Interface extension requires that the popup be displayed in an independent browser window with the address bar clearly displayed .
OpenID gives users control over their data and makes it possible for sites to build a single interface that can reach virtually all potential users .
Because OpenID is an interoperable open standard , sites that accept OpenID can reuse the same interface and code to accept identities from a wide variety of OpenID Providers , including Google , AOL , MySpace , and Yahoo !.
This makes it possible for virtually anyone to sign in to a site using an account that they already have .
It ’s been an exciting month for OpenID , with recent news about our involvement in the Open Government Initiative , and now with support for Hybrid and the Popup UI .
Stay tuned for more exciting news as we continue to improve OpenID !
P.S. If you ’d like to meet the folks working on OpenID , OAuth , and the Open Stack , please join us at the Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View , CA this November .

Rallies will be on the saturday prior to the day of his sentencing in Seattle , US , expected in October .
By ( 1 ) refusing to free Marc Emery and ( 2 ) refusing to Re-Legalize the Self - Cultivation of Marijuana , President Obama is well on his way to becoming the most hypocritical President in US history
If he refuses to do these two things immediately the American People should understand that they have been betrayed .
The time for the American People to demand these actions , from President Obama , is right now .
=======================================
You can read the original version of this by going to " www.newagecitizen.com " and then clicking on " MERP Headquarters . "
Once on the MERP page just scroll down to the article " Obama : Free Marc Emery , Legalize Marijuana Or Else "
=======================================
Even before the 2008 election I was very concerned that Obama was nothing less than a puppet for the Global Elite .
While I had hoped I was wrong , on this assertion , his first 8 months in office have confirmed my worst fears as his policy initiatives have consistently favored the globalist interests of " Wall Street " over the working class interests " Main Street . "
His position on refusing to Legalize Marijuana is also consistent with this trend .
In the weeks between the election and the inauguration President Obama created the change.gov website in order to gather policy recommendation from the American People .
To Obama 's surprise the most recommended " change , " from the American People was to Re-Legalize Marijuana for both medical and personal use .
Unfortunately some weeks later Obama made it clear that he did n't care about the opinion of the America people by flatly stating : " I am not going to Legalize Marijuana . "
This betrayal was further punctuated by a Zogby poll which found , for the first time , that a majority of Americans ( 52 % ) now supported the Re-Legalization of Marijuana for both Medicinal and Personal use .
In September of 2009 Obama will have another chance to change course and fulfill the will of the American People .
He can show that he is changing course by stopping the extradition of Canadian citizen Marc Emery .
Marc , editor of Cannabis Culture , was convicted of selling Marijuana seeds to American citizens during the Bush administration .
Of course the real reason that he is being extradited is because he had become one of the most influential global spokespersons for the Legalization of Marijuana .
Simply put Marc has been prosecuted in order to set an example for others that persist in demanding an end to Marijuana Prohibition .
Like John Sinclair , and many other truth tellers , Marc has been targeted as another political prisoner in this senseless War on Marijuana Consumers .
So if Obama wants to redeem himself , before the growing majority of Americans , supporting Marijuana Re-Legalization , he must do the right thing and grant Marc Emery clemency immediately Next he must convene a special session of Congress in order to completely Re-Legalize the untaxed , unregulated " self - cultivation " of Marijuana by all American Citizens over the age of 18 .
Just like the TARP bailout ( October 3rd , 2008 ) he must do this in order to protect our National Security against the invasion of this country by Mexican Drug Cartels that have infiltrated over 230 major American cities .
By doing these two things the Drug Cartels will be destroyed within weeks without the expenditure of any further blood or treasure , on the part of the American People .
And Marc will be free to go back to his wife Jodie , instead of wasting 5 to 10 years in a federal prison at the expense of American taxpayers .
You see each year the Mexican Drug Cartels grow ever more dangerous because Marijuana Prohibition constitutes nearly 70 percent of their annual drug profits : about 27 Billion dollars each year .
So by simply allowing adult Americans to " grow their own " Marijuana the Mexican Drug Cartels will cease to exist and we can focus on other more serious socio-economic issues .
This specific model for Re-Legalizing Marijuana is known as the MERP model and is explained in detail at the following sub web of the " New Age Citizen " website :
MERP Headquarters
The Marijuana Re-Legalization Policy Project ( MRPP ) = " MERP "
http://www.newagecitizen.com/MERP.htm
In a nutshell the MERP model would allow any adult over 18 to grow all the Marijuana they would like without ANY taxation , regulation or other government interference ( e.g. , there would be no control over THC levels etc . ) .
It is very important to understand that MERP absolutely does not preclude the issuance of commercial licensing or commercial taxation and regulation .
But self cultivation is protected as an inalienable sacred right .
The MERP Model is finding growing international support because it is the only model that can achieve the following objectives :
* Destroy the Drug Cartels
* Provide Free Medicine to the Sick and Poor
* Stop giving the police an excuse to kick in your door looking for Marijuana gardens
* Provides a counterbalance to the liberties lost in the wake of 911

Another perplexing space mystery solved by science .
New analysis of the famous “ cold spot ” in the cosmic microwave background reveals , and confirms , actually , that the spot is just an artifact of the statistical methods used to find it .
That means there is no supervoid lurking in the CMB , and no parallel universe lying just beyond the edge of our own .
What fun is that ?
Back in 2004 , astronomers studying data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) found a region of the cosmic microwave background in the southern hemisphere in the direction of the constellation of Eridanus that was significantly colder than the rest by about 70 microkelvin .
The probability of finding something like that was extremely low .
If the Universe really is homogeneous and isotropic , then all points in space ought to experience the same physical development , and appear the same .
This just was n’t supposed to be there .
Some astronomers suggested the spot could be a supervoid , a remnant of an early phase transition in the universe .
Others theorized it was a window into a parallel universe .
Well , it turns out , it was n’t there .
Ray Zhang and Dragan Huterer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor say that the cold spot is simply an artifact of the statistical method–called Spherical Mexican Hat Wavelets–used to analyze the WMAP data .
Use a different method of analysis and the cold spot disappears ( or at least is no colder than expected ) .
“ We trace this apparent discrepancy to the fact that WMAP cold spot ’s temperature profile just happens to favor the particular profile given by the wavelet , ” the duo says in their paper .
“ We find no compelling evidence for the anomalously cold spot in WMAP at scales between 2 and 8 degrees . ”
This confirms another paper from 2008 also by Huterer along with colleague Kendrick Smith from the University of Cambridge who showed that the huge void could be considered as a statistical fluke because it had stars both in front of and behind it .
And in fact , one of the earlier papers suggesting the cold spot by Lawrence Rudnick from the University of Minnesota does indeed say that statistical uncertainties have not been accounted for .
Oh well .
Now , on to the next cosmological mysteries like dark matter and dark energy !

MA'SUM GHAR , Afghanistan – Canadian forces in this sprawling region of grape orchards , opium fields and heavily fortified mud walled compounds have gone from being run ragged to being firmly in control according to Canada 's top soldier .
Despite initial success with the invasion of Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime in 2001 and 2002 , the militants have since regrouped and mounted an increasingly strong insurgency over the past three years .
A surge in American troops has been a godsend for Canadian soldiers here .
U.S. President Barack Obama committed 21,000 new forces to Afghanistan this year , part of a record U.S. commitment of 68,000 by the end of this year .
Canada has been going it largely alone for the past three years and the reinforcements could n't come at a better time .
" It 's been a huge bonus .
When you think three years ago we were covering this massive region with a single battalion and here today in 2009 we 're covering this region with eight battalions , " said Chief of Defence Staff General Walt Natynczyk in an interview with The Canadian Press at Forward Operating Base Ma'sum Ghar , a mountainous area in the heart of the Panjwaii district – the birthplace of the Taliban .
" We also have an entire brigade of Afghan army and hundreds and hundreds of Afghan police .
So the conditions are quite different today and that 's allowed us to make some progress . "
Despite the political instability and constant concerns about security in the area – the population by and large seems to be relying more heavily on government and NATO troops .
Village leaders argue that the location of new schools , community centres and even outdoor bazaars , should be within site of Afghan National Police , Afghan National Army or NATO bases for the sake of security .
Shuras between district leaders and representatives from aid groups such as the Canadian International Development Agency , or CIDA , include long wish lists which usually start out with better roads , irrigation and schools .
The Canadian military has maintained that the ultimate goal of the presence here is to allow the Afghan people to provide their own security and to determine their own path to prosperity .
That is working in some areas and has given hope in some regions .
There is a school for girls close to this armed compound but it remains empty and will do so until the Taliban are gone once and for all .
" You mentioned hope .
The Taliban just represent destruction .
They want to retain power at any cost .
They hide behind a veil of extreme fundamentalism but indeed all they do is destroy and kill , " Natynczyk said quietly .
" What they do n't want is to have that hope .
We are seeing that in the past three months , " he added .
" They really did step up their activity in this region and certainly before the election , the number of attacks and IEDs went up significantly . "
" Yet the Afghan Army , Afghan police with our support and our training was able to support an election in the middle of a war .
To consider that this country was able to hold an election in the midst of a war is really quite spectacular . "
Going it alone in Kandahar has taken a rising toll on Canadian soldiers .
IEDs , the constant favourite of the Taliban insurgency , has claimed the majority of the 129 Canadian soldiers who have died since the mission began .

Despite the technical superiority the threat remains .
" We are using every piece of sophisticated technology that we can get our hands on and each piece is a lifesaver for our soldiers and so we 're not holding anything back , " said Natynczyk .

We 're seeing more and more finds , but again there is tragedy ... when you do n't find all of them , it 's absolutely tragic . "

Exploration Push in British Columbia ’s Horn River Basin Produces Encouraging Results
JULY 10 , 2009
By RUSSELL GOLD
HOUSTON — Exxon Mobil Corp. has been scouring the globe for natural gas locked inside shale formations , and said it thinks it may have a world - class find in Canada .
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal , Tim Cejka , Exxon ’s head of global exploration , said the company has been bullish on shale - gas exploration since 2003 , locating promising gas - bearing rock formations and snapping up leases on them .
Exxon is most encouraged by the exploration of 250,000 acres it has leased in the Horn River Basin , in northern British Columbia .
Mr. Cejka said results from the first four wells lead the company to conclude that each well will produce between 16 million and 18 million cubic feet of gas a day .
That ’s five times the size of average wells in Texas ’s Barnett shale and comparable to big wells in Louisiana ’s Haynesville shale , two major shale - gas fields that already have moved the U.S. natural - gas market from scarcity to abundance .
Though Exxon is better known as the nation ’s largest oil company , “ We are really interested in shale gas , ” Mr. Cejka said , detailing the company ’s push into the energy - exploration business , which was once dominated by scrappy independent companies .
Given that the world is awash with natural gas already , the addition of still more gas from shale fields in Canada and Europe could further depress prices , especially as industrial demand continues to stagnate amid the global economic downturn .
But Exxon is taking a longer view .
“ The industry is going to have to bring on oil , gas , coal , nuclear , hydro , wind and solar to meet the world ’s energy demand , ” Mr. Cejka said .
“ The economies of the world will come back .
Demand will grow again .
We are going to be there for the next 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years . ”
Other energy companies also are excited about the Horn River field .
“ This may be the best shale play in North America , ” said Michael Graham , an executive vice president at EnCana Corp. , a Calgary company that already has a big Horn River presence .
Mr. Graham said EnCana ’s latest wells are approaching Exxon ’s in terms of initial production .
Exxon ’s Mr. Cejka said that his company also has pieced together substantial leases in prospective shale - gas formations in Germany , Hungary and Poland , and is still adding acreage .
Tests on two wells in Hungary , where Exxon and partners hold 400,000 acres , are expected this year .
It will be the first time the shale there has been tested .
“ Depending on how that goes , we ’ll either be patting ourselves on the back or walking away , ” Mr. Cejka said .
The company also plans 10 wells on 750,000 acres it holds in northern German ’s Lower Saxony Basin this year to better study the geology .
Exxon is interested in all these projects because the amount of gas trapped in shales is enormous .
The company estimates there are one quadrillion cubic feet of shale gas world - wide , equal to about a decade ’s worth of global natural - gas demand , though not all of that is currently recoverable .
Shale gas is one of the “ unconventional ” gases that are trapped in dense rocks , rather than in porous rocks that form underground reservoirs .
To reach it , energy companies must crack the rocks open by injecting them with high - pressure liquids .
Improvements over the past few years in the technology to fracture dense rocks and drill vertical wells that turn and run horizontally underground have made it possible to develop unconventional gas .
Before the emergence of the Barnett and other shales , the industry expected the U.S. to become a big net importer of gas by 2009 .
Instead , the U.S. faces a glut that has driven natural - gas prices below $ 3.50 per million British thermal units , down 39 % this year , and kept imports of liquefied natural gas at anemic levels .
Earlier this decade , companies such as Devon Energy Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. , both based in Oklahoma City , were among the first to use the shale - gas extraction technique .
Their success spawned a host of imitators and competition for acreage in Louisiana , Arkansas , Texas , Pennsylvania and elsewhere .
Rather than compete with these smaller exploration companies , Exxon began looking for shale formations that were outside the U.S. , but near major energy markets .
The strategy set it apart from its big globe - trotting competitors , which built up unconventional - gas reserves through acquisition .
BP PLC , for instance , spent $ 3.65 billion on a pair of deals with Chesapeake .
Royal Dutch Shell PLC spent $ 6 billion to acquire Canadian Duvernay Oil Corp. and its acreage in a prospective unconventional - gas formation .
So far , companies are drilling for shale gas only in North America and to a lesser extent in eastern Australia , said Rhodri Thomas , head of consulting firm Wood Mackenzie , in Edinburgh , Scotland .
“ Where we ’ve successfully developed these , the volume of the resource has changed the gas market dramatically , ” he said .
“ The question is : Where else could this happen ? ”

Wow , out of all new shows this season , The Good Wife ranks up there with Flash Forward .
The writing is smart , the pacing is great , and of course the acting headed by Julianna Margulies is top - notch .
The show 's premise is taken from the headlines .
Congrats to me for not using the word ' ripped . '
It just sounds so crude .
We all know the yearly sex scandal by a politician while his dutiful wife stands beside .
There seems to be a lot more of these scandals as of late due to as I suspect a general disrespect for politician 's and their personal lives .
I 'm sure JFK would be skewered in today 's world of investigative journalism and electronic media , but I digress .
The press conference in the beginning is extremely well made from the lighting to the interspersed cuts of the incriminating videotape .
Alicia ( Julianna Margulies ) has the all too familiar blank look signaling she does n't really know what to do .
She tries to look out into the crowd , at her husband 's hands , and finally a thread on his jacket .
That 's the image the media shows us , but what happens behind closed doors ?
The Good Wife tries to portray what may happen and it does not disappoint .
Right after the press conference , she gives him a slap he deserves though I think a couple hundred more would do justice .
Six months later and her husband ( Chris Noth ) is in prison for corruption , charges he insists are n't true .
Without any income , Alicia needs a job , and having practiced law before raising a family , she jumps right back into a law firm .
There is a nice balance between her personal life and the case she is on which is pro bono .
The court case is simple and straightforward , but the pacing is fast and it never got too heavy .
Her client is accused of killing her ex-husband .
She swears someone else shot him , but the surveillance tape does not corroborate her story nor does the eye witness account .
She finds some evidence the police glossed over and caught the lie of a security guard .
Being her first case in years , it starts off rocky , but Alicia finds her footing and manages to get her client off .
Her co-worker Kalinda helps her a lot .
I enjoyed their relationship professionally and personally .
I definitely will be watching this show every week and reviewing it .
There 's some social commentary blended in with all the office politics , and of course the whole point of the show which is the wife .
Score : 9.6
* Illustration : Marc Johns * 1 // They listen to the crowd .
Researchers asked two sets of soccer refs to judge game clips .
One group watched the footage on mute ; the other with sound .
The refs who heard the fans called 15.5 percent fewer fouls against the home team .
So , yeah , screaming like a maniac really does help .
2 // They are n't blind , but they are seeing things .
To compensate for a 100 - millisecond lag in our visual system , our brain creates an illusion that shifts objects in the direction they 're traveling .
So a tennis ball flying toward the baseline may appear to cross it before it bounces just inside .
This , according to vision scientists , explains 70 of 83 bad calls made during the 2007 Wimbledon Championships .
3 // They prefer red .
Tae kwon do officials scoring fighters on film gave more points to those wearing red than blue .
When asked to review the same footage after the uniform colors were digitally switched , they again ruled in favor of red .

Obama asserts power to detain suspects without trial
By Tom Eley
25 September 2009
The Obama administration announced this week that it intends to continue the Bush administration policy of holding terrorism suspects indefinitely without charge or trial .
On Wednesday , the Justice Department said that President Obama may continue to hold “ terror suspects ” indefinitely and without judicial review based on the congressional Authorization to Use Military Force that came in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington — the same rationale used by Obama ’s predecessor , George W. Bush .
The move aims to institutionalize the previous administration ’s assault on habeas corpus — the bedrock principle of democratic rights and the civil liberties laid down in the US Constitution ’s Bill of Rights .
The announcement is a shift from a position Obama outlined in a May 22 speech at the National Archives .
There he said he would go to Congress to obtain legislation to carry on the policy of indefinite detention , which he claimed was the only way of dispersing a section of the Guantánamo prison population too “ dangerous ” to try in civil courts .
In reality , the administration does not want to try these prisoners in normal civilian courts because such trials would expose the use of torture against the defendants , the evidence based on torture would be inadmissible , and civil trials might reveal embarrassing facts about the activities of US intelligence agencies .
“ I want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for Guantánamo detainees , ” Obama said three months ago .
“ [ G]oing forward , my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime . ”
Obama ’s new “ legal regime , ” sources said , would likely have included a special “ National Security Court , ” in which hearsay evidence and testimony extracted through torture would be admissible .
In Wednesday ’s statement , the Justice Department declared the administration “ is not currently seeking additional authorization , ” but would “ rely on authority already provided by Congress ” under the Authorization to Use Military Force .
That resolution was , in fact , proposed and passed as a measure only to provide congressional backing for the invasion of Afghanistan .
Obama has decided to rely on this subterfuge and go around Congress in order to avoid hearings and the public controversy that would be aroused by such legislation .
By simply asserting executive power , the administration is carrying out a fundamental attack on democratic rights without any public debate .
According to one account , the administration ’s decision to carry on indefinite detention would apply only to current Guantánamo detainees .
However , there is nothing in the underlying legal rationale — that the Authorization of Force allows the president to arrest without charge or trial those he declares to be members or supporters of Al Qaeda or the Taliban — preventing Obama from applying indefinite detention to new detainees .
It is noteworthy that this rationalization was explicitly repudiated by the Supreme Court in its 2006 ruling against the Bush administration ’s military commissions in the case Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld .
Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for the majority , declared that there was nothing in the Authorization to Use Military Force that “ even hinted ” at allowing the president to expand his war powers to override due process .
Some civil liberties spokesmen welcomed the announcement from the Obama administration on the grounds that legislation would be even more destructive of democratic rights than the bare assertion of executive power .
In response , ACLU Lawyer Jonathan Hafetz , who represented Guantánamo prisoner Mohammed Jawad in his habeas case , said , “ In fact , Obama is continuing to make the same core assertion Bush did : the right to seize individuals anywhere in the world and deny them a fair trial based on the notion of a global ‘ war on terror . ’ ”
Obama ’s decision marks an intensification of the assault on habeas corpus , the “ great writ , ” which underlays all civil liberties and dates back to the Middle Ages .
Habeas corpus stipulates that the state must produce an arrested individual in an independent court and show just cause for imprisonment .
Failing this , the arrested individual has “ the right to have his body , ” and must be released .
Also on Wednesday , the Justice Department outlined what it presented as a democratic reinterpretation of the executive “ state secrets ” privilege , which allows the federal government to deny certain evidence from court proceedings based on the assertion that it may endanger national security .
Rather than using the privilege to block particular pieces of evidence , both the Bush and Obama administrations have invoked “ state secrets ” as a means of shutting down entire court cases launched by the victims of torture , extraordinary rendition , and warrantless wiretapping .
The new parameters do not restrict the use of the privilege to thwart court cases that challenge government abuse .
Like the Bush administration , Obama has taken the position that US methods in the “ war on terror ” are beyond legal review .
“ They do n’t anywhere say , ‘ we will not seek dismissal on state secrets grounds at the outset [ of a case ] ’ ” said Ben Wizner , an ACLU attorney .
“ They say we ’re going to make an effort to apply it as narrowly as possible .
But that does n’t change what they ’ve been doing all along . ”
Obama ’s reassertion of indefinite detention and an expansive state secrets doctrine underscores the administration ’s deeply reactionary character .
These actions join a long list of antidemocratic policies carried over from the Bush administration .
The Obama administration has declared it has the right to carry on illegal domestic spying operations and the practice of rendition .
It has rejected the habeas corpus rights of prisoners held at the notorious Bagram prison in Afghanistan .
And Obama has declared his determination , in the name of “ moving on , ” to defend the Bush administration and CIA agents who oversaw a global regime of torture and murder .
These are not mistaken policies , as some liberal critics assert .
The antidemocratic abuses of the “ war on terror ” emerge inexorably from the American ruling class ’s turn toward aggressive war as the means of offsetting the erosion in its economic position .
The Obama administration ’s main target is not terrorism .
Instead , the framework of a police state — being prepared under conditions of mass unemployment and deepening social misery — is to be used against political and social opposition within the US .
UFO ' filmed for 40 minutes ' by Chinese scientists during solar eclipse
Could this finally be it - 40 minutes of undisputed proof that we are not alone ?
Scientists at the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing , China believe it is a real possibility that this footage of an unidentified flying object is the evidence we have all been waiting for .
They have confirmed 40 minutes of footage of the object was captured during this summer 's solar eclipse - and that research has already started on a year - long investigation to find out what it is .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
And the scientists were not the only ones to capture the walnut - shaped object on camera .
The clear , daylight sighting occurred over Deqing in Guandong Province .
Dozens of students claimed to have seen the object sailing through the air during a rooftop observation of the July 22 solar eclipse .
At least nine of the students photographed it , producing such incredible images as those here .
The UFO was also seen to change colour and shape , with the students claiming it initially appeared to be a glowing blue colour , but later darkened .
Watch a Chinese news report on the sightings , including images of the object , here :
Yesterday Chinese media outlet Sina.com reported that the Purple Mountain Observatory and Chinese Academy of Sciences claimed :
' China had discovered near the sun , by observation staff , an unidentified object .
Its physical nature remains to be further studied .
' Currently manpower is being organised to deal with this data , complete the data analysis and reveal the scientific results .
This will take at least one year 's time to finalise .
' Purple Mountain Observatory , Chinese Academy of Sciences Fellow Ji Hai- sheng said at present it is impossible to speculate what the unidentified object is .
' However research has started . '
NEW DELHI : An increasing number of countries , including some in Asia , are now reporting Tamiflu - resistant H1N1 virus .
The worrying development , according to WHO , has seen 12 countries , including China and Singapore , reporting a mutation in the virus .
India has not reported the mutation so far .
The changes in the virus reported in samples are making these strains of swine flu resistant to oseltamivir or Tamiflu , the antiviral of choice globally .
Such cases have also been found in Japan , US , Hong Kong , Denmark and Canada .
While India is monitoring these reports closely , it will begin exit screening of pilgrims bound for Saudi Arabia for Haj as the desert nation is refusing entry to anyone with even common cold .
Saudi authorities are insisting on certificates stating that Haj pilgrims are completely free of any influenza infection .
Changes in the virus are also being tracked closely as scientists are concerned that new strains may make the vaccines being developed at a feverish pace infructuous .
As of now , WHO fears Tamiflu resistance may be more widespread than officially reported .
Going by available data , majority of the resistant cases were reported where oseltamivir was given as preventive medication to people exposed to the flu but who had not tested positive themselves .
Some cases were a result of treatment of mild illness as well as ���immuno - compromised ��� patients or persons whose immune systems were working imperfectly .
India has so far not reported such a mutation .
ICMR director general Dr V M Katoch told TOI , ���We have been constantly sequencing genes in H1N1 to mark any form of mutation .�� �
The release of Google Chrome Frame , a new open source plugin that injects Chrome 's renderer and JavaScript engine into Microsoft 's browser , earlier this week had many web developers happily dancing long through the night .
Finally , someone had found a way to get Internet Explorer users up to speed on the Web .
Microsoft , on the other hand , is warning IE users that it does not recommend installing the plugin .
What does the company have against the plugin ?
It makes Internet Explorer less secure .
" With Internet Explorer 8 , we made significant advancements and updates to make the browser safer for our customers , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
" Given the security issues with plugins in general and Google Chrome in particular , Google Chrome Frame running as a plugin has doubled the attach area for malware and malicious scripts .
This is not a risk we would recommend our friends and families take . "
The spokesperson also referred us to the latest phishing and malware data from NSS Labs , the same security company that found IE8 was the most secure browser in August 2009 via two Microsoft - sponsored reports .
Some of the points Microsoft makes in its statement are controversial , though it 's not all simple PR talk .
Plugins and add - ons are definitely a huge security issue ; they usually remain unpatched longer than most and often end up doing more damage than vulnerabilities in the actual browser .
As for IE +
Google Chrome Frame potentially allowing for double the damage because the browser mutant would be open to a wider range of attacks , we 're going to have to call foul .
Somehow we doubt there is a significant amount of malware specifically targeting Chrome , and for whatever exists , we 're pretty sure most would fail when encountering IE + Google Chrome Frame .
These Web attacks would be written to be able to circumvent Chrome 's security measures and would simply not expect Internet Explorer 's security layers .
What about the part about Chrome having security issues in particular ?
Soon after Chrome was first released in September 2008 , vulnerabilities were discovered and loudly trumpeted .
The new browser was quickly labeled insecure days after it was made available , and remained so until a patched version was released .
After that though , Google made sure to stay on top of things , and it has paid off .
In March 2009 , for example , Chrome was the only browser left standing after day one of the famous Pwn2 Own contest , where security researchers competed to exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers , while Firefox , Safari , and Internet Explorer were all successfully compromised .
Microsoft argues that Chrome only remained unscathed because nobody attempted to exploit it , but the fact remains that none of the researchers had vulnerabilities for Chrome in mind before going into the contest .
Also , Swiss security researchers concluded in May 2009 that people who use Firefox or Chrome are more likely to be running the latest version of the software when compared against Safari and Opera users due to their auto - update mechanisms which require less user interaction .
Internet Explorer was n't even mentioned in the study , though we know that it relies on Windows Update and does n't have an automatic built - in updater .
Finally , and possibly most importantly , Chrome has a market share that is easily 20 times smaller than Internet Explorer's .
Even if Google reaches its 10 percent market share goal , Internet Explorer would still be six times more widely used .
Microsoft does n't like to admit it , but the fact is that market share is a disadvantage when it comes to security .
It 's just more profitable for the bad guys aim for the largest crowd of marks .
Google made a point to say that its plugin brings some security features to Internet Explorer .
" Accessing sites using Google Chrome Frame brings Google Chrome 's security features to Internet Explorer users , providing strong phishing and malware protection ( absent in IE6 ) , robust sandboxing technology , and defenses from emerging online threats that are available in days rather than months , " a Google spokesperson told Ars .
While Microsoft 's jabs at Chrome were a bit over the top , its points about Internet Explorer 8 's security are solid .
The browser has great phishing and malware protection built - in , and is overall miles ahead of its predecessors .
That said , even if Microsoft claims that IE8 is more secure than Chrome , and it did in June 2008 , the fact remains that Google did n't just release the plugin for IE8 .
It works in IE6 and IE7 as well .
These old browser versions are much less secure , especially in comparison to IE8 and Chrome 3 .
In August 2009 , Redmond confirmed that while it would continue to push IE6 and IE7 users to upgrade their browsers , it was n't going to make the decision for them anytime soon .
For all these reasons , we do n't believe that Microsoft is in a position to say that Google Chrome Frame is an unsafe choice .
We do , however , understand where the software giant is coming from .
Still , 15 years after that terrible day , I can't help but wonder if we might have achieved more by simply doing less .
In an ambitious attempt to assess how humans are doing as stewards of planet earth , 28 leading scientists have drawn up a list of nine " planetary boundaries " that must not be crossed if we want to avoid drastically changing the global environment and imperiling our own existence .
The only problem is , we 've already crossed three of those thresholds .
The paper , published in Nature ( and available for free ) , aims to define a " safe operating space " for human life on the planet .
It ’s a first - draft users ’ manual for an era that scientists dub the “ anthropocene , ” in which nearly seven billion resource - hungry humans have come to dominate ecological change on Earth [ Wired.com ] .
What follows is a list of the nine environmental factors , and how we 're doing on living within each limit .
1 ) Atmospheric carbon dioxide , the main cause of global warming : Obviously , we have trouble with this one .
The researchers say the CO2 limit is no more than 350 parts per million ( p.p.m. ) in the atmosphere , but we 're already at 387 p.p.m. and rising .
2 ) Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution :
This one is split .
We 're already over the limit with nitrogen , since
industrialized agriculture already has humanity pouring more chemicals into the land and oceans than the planet can process [ Time ] .
On phosphorus , another chemical used in fertilizer , we 're still below the limit .
3 ) Ozone : finally , some good news !
The researchers say that
atmospheric levels of ultraviolet radiation - blocking ozone are safe , thanks to a 1987 ban on ozone - destroying chemicals [ Wired.com ] .
4 ) Fresh water use :
So far , we 're beneath the threshold for water use , but if populations continue to boom we may soon be in trouble .
One water expert even questions the threshold used in this paper , saying that it would
allow further degradation at such environmental disaster sites as the drying Aral Sea in Asia and seven major rivers , including the Colorado in the U.S. , that no longer reach the sea [ Scientific American ] .
5 ) Land use :
We also have n't yet reached the point at which we 'll have converted too much natural terrain , like forests and wetlands , to less biologically useful landscapes , like monocrop agricultural fields and cities .
But again , population growth is a looming factor .
6 ) Biodiversity : Boy , did we screw this one up .
Many biologists argue that the planet is in the midst of a sixth great extinction event because of human actions , and the report finds that we 're way over the limit for species loss .
" Today the rate of extinction of species is estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times more than what could be considered natural , " they report [ Canwest News ] .
7 ) Ocean acidification : Again , we have n't crossed this threshold yet , but the carbon dioxide emitted by our industrialized societies is steadily being infused in the oceans , raising their acidity levels and making it harder for coral reefs to build skeletons and invertebrates to build shells .
According to recent surveys , the ocean is now acidifying 100 times faster than at any time during the past 20 million years [ Yale Environment 360 ] .
8 ) Chemical pollution : Human activity is spreading toxic materials like heavy metals and radioactive waste , and researchers believe these materials are causing genetic damage in all kinds of organisms .
But scientists do n't yet have enough info to establish a safe limit .
9 ) Atmospheric aerosols : Ditto with soot and other particles that cloud our atmosphere , causing smog and provoking heath problems in humans .
Researchers believe that aerosols can have global - scale effects , but have n't yet agreed on a threshold .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said Thursday he opposes proposals to strip the central bank of its bank - regulating authority .
Volcker , who chairs President Obama 's economic advisory panel , told the House Financial Services Committee that removing the Fed 's supervisory authority would be a mistake .
The Fed conducts bank examinations and sets capital and liquidity standards .
" The Federal Reserve Board should not become an academic seminar debating in its marble palace various approaches toward monetary policy without the leavening experience of direct contact with , and responsibility for , the world of finance and the institutions through which monetary policy is effected , " Volcker said .
A proposal under consideration by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , would create one mega - regulator made up of the four national banking agencies including the Fed .
As part of the proposal , supervisory authority over banks would be transferred from the Fed to the new agency .
The Fed , in turn , would be responsible only for monetary policy , such controlling interest rates .
Congress also is considering legislation that would remove the central bank 's consumer - protection authority and place it within a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
The effort by Dodd reflects in part populist frustrations with the Fed for bailing out the banks using hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars .
Efforts to emasculate the Fed were supported by Arthur Levitt , a Clinton - era Securities and Exchange Commission chairman , who cautioned against giving the Fed too much power .
He told lawmakers he opposes the Fed overseeing monetary policy and bank " safety and soundness " supervision , arguing there are conflicts in that approach .
" The Fed has too many conflicts to do this job effectively , " Levitt said .
" Defending the ' safety and soundness ' of financial institutions and managing monetary policy creates inevitable and compromising conflicts with the kind of vigilant and independent oversight a systemic risk regulator requires . "
Separation of commercial banking and risky investments
Volcker , who headed the Fed between 1979 and 1987 , testified that legislators should prohibit commercial banks from engaging in certain risky activities , particularly because they could become the beneficiaries of tax - dollar infusions .
Commercial banks and their holding companies should n't be permitted to own or invest in hedge funds or buyout shops , he said .
He added that commercial banks should also be prohibited from a " heavy volume of proprietary trading , with its inherent risks . "
" I think we have learned enough about the challenges and distractions for management posed by the risks and complexities of highly diversified activities , " Volcker said .
Volcker added that there should be some additional checks and balances when it comes to the oversight of the Fed .
He argued that one Fed board governor should be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as a second vice chairman of the Fed board and that this official would have responsibility for overseeing regulation of systemically significant institutions .
The official would also have a staff to help identify problem sectors or institutions , Volcker said .
Future for taxpayer - funded bailouts
Lawmakers and Volcker clashed over whether the government should continue to be given the flexibility to use taxpayer dollars to prop up institutions in the case of a financial crisis .
Rep. Spencer Bachus , R - Ala. , the committee 's ranking member , argued that taxpayers are tired of paying for Wall Street 's mistakes .
" They see something manifestly and fundamentally wrong with a casino environment in which the high rollers pocket the profits , often measured in millions if not billions , while the taxpayers pay off the losses , " Bachus said .
However , Volcker said that he was opposed to abolishing the Fed 's ability to inject capital into the system in the case of an emergency .
" I am not proposing that the Fed 's emergency powers be abolished , " Volcker said .
" I squirm when it is used , we know if it ever got used it would set a precedent and we did n't want to set the precedent of using it , but now that it 's set , we want to develop attitudes and say it 's extremely extraordinary , but I would n't take it away . "
Resolution authority
Lawmakers and Volcker also debated the usefulness of a White House proposal that would set up a mechanism to unwind a large insolvent institution in a way that it does not cause collateral damage to the markets .
Bachus said such a process masks the fact that the government was identifying a group of institutions it considers too - big - to - fail .
" When we designate 20 institutions to be too big to fail , we endorse a situation where people will assume they will be saved and there is a guarantee , " said Bachus .
" It enshrines the moral hazard issue . "
Volcker said that Wall Street would have a general idea of what institutions are on the list , but even then it actually could be fluctuating at any time , with some smaller interconnected firms included as well .
" It will be difficult to identify in advance who is systemically important , because you may find smaller institutions that have connections with other institutions that create a clog in the system and should be included , " Volcker said .
" However , this dismantling authority will diminish the sense that creditors of big banks will be bailed out . "
Such a resolution mechanism could make payouts but it would require bondholders to lose some of their investments or convert their stakes into equity .
The mechanism could also force certain problem institutions into mergers , or take other steps " that would not require taxpayer - funded infusions , " Volcker said .
He also said that the government should give the Fed responsibility to survey the whole financial system and block transactions in a sector when the central bank said it believes there is a dangerously large amount of trades in that area .
He added that the government should have the ability at any time to say at any time that a particular institution has become too risky and as a result it needs to cap leverage and have a greater amount of capital on hand .
" Somebody should have raised the question that subprime or credit default swaps raised a threat to the markets , " Volcker said .
Financial transaction tax ?
Volcker said that Congress should require a study be conducted about the viability of the idea of having a financial transaction tax that would be used to inject capital into systemic financial institutions at a time of instability , as an alternative to taxpayer - funded infusions .
However , Volcker expressed some reservations .
" If the fee is low enough not to be disruptive to the markets , it wo n't be significant enough to pay for these costs , " he said .
" If it is large enough for what is needed , it likely will have a disruptive impact on the markets . "
( plural
testes
) , 1704 , from Latin
testis
" testicle , " usually regarded as a special application of
testis
" witness " ( see
testament
) , presumably because it " bears witness to male virility " [ Barnhart ] .
Stories that trace the use of the Latin word to some supposed swearing - in ceremony are modern and groundless .
Compare Greek
parastatai
" testicles , " from
parastates
" one that stands by ; " and French slang
témoins
, literally " witnesses . "
But Buck thinks Greek
parastatai
" testicles " has been wrongly associated with the legal sense of
parastates
" supporter , defender " and suggests instead
parastatai
in the sense of twin " supporting pillars , props of a mast , " etc .
Or it might be a euphemistic use of the word in the sense " comrades . "
OED , meanwhile , points to Walde 's suggestion of a connection between
testis
and
testa
" pot , shell , etc . " ( see

) .
Most Americans marry for keeps or , if it does n't last , do n't want to repeat the same mistake , according to new Census data that show 76 % of those who have ever been married have married just once .
Almost 20 % have been married twice and 5 % have been married three or more times , finds data released Monday from the American Community Survey of 3 million households .
The survey also found almost 200,000 fewer same - sex couples than the previous year , which Census officials say resulted from data - processing changes .
The total number of same - sex couples in 2008 was about 565,000 , vs. 754,000 in 2007 .
" We do n't think Census is doing us dirty here , " says Jaime Grant of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington , D.C. , which has been pushing for Census recognition of gay couples .
" They improved the way they designed the form , so they got fewer false reports from opposite - sex partners .
But I still think it does n't mean we 're getting the full picture of LGBT people across the board . "
The new questionnaire format was meant to bring the annual survey more in line with the larger 2010 Census , said Martin O'Connell , chief of the Census ' bureau 's Fertility and Family Statistics Branch .
" It was to promote a greater sense of consistency between the two , " he says , adding that there was " no intention of altering in any way the estimates of same - sex populations . "
The 2008 survey form and the upcoming 2010 Census form includes more detail , breaking down the numbers of those who are legal spouses or consider themselves such ( about 150,000 couples ) , as well as those who call themselves unmarried partners .
For example , if someone chose " husband or wife " and a second relationship , just " husband or wife " would have been counted , suggesting in previous years — mistakenly creating a same - sex couple who said they were in a spousal relationship .
Now , multiple check - boxes will yield a blank result and will be filled in later using a statistical formula based on area households .
The change is a step in the right direction , says is n't a surprise to demographer Gary Gates , of UCLA 's Williams Institute , which studies sexual orientation law and public policy .
" I 've been saying for the last five or six years there was a problem with the data collection — that they were counting different - sex married couples who checked the wrong sex box , " he says .
" It does n't take that many mistakes to really contaminate the same - sex couples data . "
Gates says he 's co-authored several papers suggesting the data issues , with his most recent presented in April at a meeting of the Population Association of America in Detroit .
Grant says she hopes these new numbers will " give us a little bit of a wake - up call for how important it is for people in the community to make themselves visible on federal surveys like the Census and other surveys . " she says .
Carl Haub , senior demographer at the non-profit Population Reference Bureau , based in Washington , D.C. , says the new marriage data reflects trends around the world , including rising numbers of those who have never married .
The 2008 data show the percentage of women 15 and over who have never married was 28.1 % , up from 27.6 % in 2007 and 27.3 % in 2006 .
Marriage duration is another new statistic , with the national average at about 18.2 years .
" Many want to stay married until the children are independent or semi-independent , " Haub says .
" That certainly does make some sense .
Some number people will stay together for the children .
That timing might not be just a coincidence . "

Ext3 and RAID : silent data killers ?

Technologies such as filesystem journaling ( as used with ext3 ) or RAID are generally adopted with the purpose of improving overall reliability .
Some system administrators may thus be a little disconcerted by a recent linux - kernel thread suggesting that , in some situations , those technologies can actually increase the risk of data loss .
This article attempts to straighten out the arguments and reach a conclusion about how worried system administrators should be .
The conversation actually began last March , when Pavel Machek posted a proposed documentation patch describing the assumptions that he saw as underlying the design of Linux filesystems .
Things went quiet for a while , before springing back to life at the end of August .
It would appear that Pavel had run into some data - loss problems when using a flash drive with a flaky connection to the computer ; subsequent tests done by deliberately removing active drives confirmed that it is easy to lose data that way .
He had n't expected that :
Before I pulled that flash card , I assumed that doing so is safe , because flashcard is presented as block device and ext3 should cope with sudden disk disconnects .
And I was wrong wrong wrong .
( Noone told me at the university .
I guess I should want my money back ) .
In an attempt to prevent a surge in refund requests at universities worldwide , Pavel tried to get some warnings put into the kernel documentation .
He has run into a surprising amount of opposition , which he ( and some others ) have taken as an attempt to sweep shortcomings in Linux filesystems under the rug .
The real story , naturally , is a bit more complex .
Journaling technology like that used in ext3 works by writing some data to the filesystem twice .
Whenever the filesystem must make a metadata change , it will first gather together all of the block - level changes required and write them to a special area of the disk ( the journal ) .
Once it is known that the full description of the changes has made it to the media , a " commit record " is written , indicating that the filesystem code is committed to the change .
Once the commit record is also safely on the media , the filesystem can start writing the metadata changes to the filesystem itself .
Should the operation be interrupted ( by a power failure , say , or a system crash or abrupt removal of the media ) , the filesystem can recover the plan for the changes from the journal and start the process over again .
The end result is to make metadata changes transactional ; they either happen completely or not at all .
And that should prevent corruption of the filesystem structure .
One thing worth noting here is that actual data is not normally written to the journal , so a certain amount of recently - written data can be lost in an abrupt failure .
It is possible to configure ext3 ( and ext4 ) to write data to the journal as well , but , since the performance cost is significant , this option is not heavily used .
So one should keep in mind that most filesystem journaling is there to protect metadata , not the data itself .
Journaling does provide some data protection anyway - if the metadata is lost , the associated data can no longer be found - but that 's not its primary reason for existing .
It is not the lack of journaling for data which has created grief for Pavel and others , though .
The nature of flash - based storage makes another " interesting " failure mode possible .
Filesystems work with fixed - size blocks , normally 4096 bytes on Linux .
Storage devices also use fixed - size blocks ; on traditional rotating media , those blocks are traditionally 512 bytes in length , though larger block sizes are on the horizon .
The key point is that , on a normal rotating disk , the filesystem can write a block without disturbing any unrelated blocks on the drive .
Flash storage also uses fixed - size blocks , but they tend to be large - typically tens to hundreds of kilobytes .
Flash blocks can only be rewritten as a unit , so writing a 4096 - byte " block " at the operating system level will require a larger read - modify - write cycle within the flash drive .
It is certainly possible for a careful programmer to write flash - drive firmware which does this operation in a safe , transactional manner .
It is also possible that the flash drive manufacturer was rather more interested in getting a cheap device to market quickly than careful programming .
In the commodity PC hardware market , that possibility becomes something much closer to a certainty .
What this all means is that , on a low - quality flash drive , an interrupted write operation could result in the corruption of blocks unrelated to that operation .
If the interrupted write was for metadata , a journaling filesystem will redo the operation on the next mount , ensuring that the metadata ends up in its intended destination .
But the filesystem cannot know about any unrelated blocks which might have been trashed at the same time .
So journaling will not protect against this kind of failure - even if it causes the sort of metadata corruption that journaling is intended to prevent .
This is the " bug " in ext3 that Pavel wished to document .
He further asserted that journaling filesystems can actually make things worse in this situation .
Since a full fsck is not normally required on journaling filesystems , even after an improper dismount , any " collateral " metadata damage will go undetected .
At best , the user may remain unaware for some time that random data has been lost .
At worst , corrupt metadata could cause the code to corrupt other parts of the filesystem over the course of subsequent operation .
The skipped fsck may have enabled the system to come back up quickly , but it has done so at the risk of letting corruption persist and , possibly , spread .
One could easily argue that the real problem here is the use of hidden translation layers to make a flash device look like a normal drive .
David Woodhouse did exactly that :
This just goes to show why having this " translation layer " done in firmware on the device itself is a _bad_ idea .
We 're much better off when we have full access to the underlying flash and the OS can actually see what 's going on .
That way , we can actually debug , fix and recover from such problems .
The manufacturers of flash drives have , thus far , proved impervious to this line of reasoning , though .
There is a similar failure mode with RAID devices which was also discussed .
Drives can be grouped into a RAID5 or RAID6 array , with the result that the array as a whole can survive the total failure of any drive within it .
As long as only one drive fails at a time , users of RAID arrays can rest assured that the smoke coming out of their array is not taking their data with it .
But what if more than one drive fails ?
RAID works by combining blocks into larger stripes and associating checksums with those stripes .
Updating a block requires rewriting the stripe containing it and the associated checksum block .
So , if writing a block can cause the array to lose the entire stripe , we could see data loss much like that which can happen with a flash drive .
As a normal rule , this kind of loss will not occur with a RAID array .
But it can happen if ( 1 ) one drive has already failed , causing the array to run in " degraded " mode , and ( 2 ) a second failure occurs ( Pavel pulls the power cord , say ) while the write is happening .
Pavel concluded from this scenario that RAID devices may actually be more dangerous than storing data on a single disk ; he started a whole separate subthread ( under the subject " raid is dangerous but that 's secret " ) to that effect .
This claim caused a fair amount of concern on the list ; many felt that it would push users to forgo technologies like RAID in favor of single , non-redundant drive configurations .
Users who do that will avoid the possibility of data loss resulting from a specific , unlikely double failure , but at the cost of rendering themselves entirely vulnerable to a much more likely single failure .
The end result would be a lot more data lost .
The real lessons from this discussion are fairly straightforward :
Treat flash drives with care , do not expect them to be more reliable than they are , and do not remove them from the system until all writes are complete .
RAID arrays can increase data reliability , but an array which is not running with its full complement of working , populated drives has lost the redundancy which provides that reliability .
If the consequences of a second failure would be too severe , one should avoid writing to arrays running in degraded mode .
As Ric Wheeler pointed out , the easiest way to lose data on a Linux system is to run the disks with their write cache enabled .
This is especially true on RAID5 / 6 systems , where write barriers are still not properly supported .
There has been some talk of disabling drive write caches and enabling barriers by default , but no patches have been posted yet .
There is no substitute for good backups .
Your editor would add that any backups which have not been checked recently have a strong chance of not being good backups .
How this information will be reflected in the kernel documentation remains to be seen .
Some of it seems like the sort of system administration information which is not normally considered appropriate for inclusion in the documentation of the kernel itself .
But there is value in knowing what assumptions one 's filesystems are built on and what the possible failure modes are .
A better understanding of how we can lose data can only help us to keep that from actually happening .

I ’ve been involved in open source for a long time - probably what might be considered a ‘ generation ’ in this industry .
I was a fan of open source before I even knew the term existed - during my formative coding years in the early 90’s I was always releasing code for free and encouraging people to tell me why it sucked , and doing the same for them .
Of course , most of the discussion went on over FidoNet , BBS - relayed emails , the very early ( pre- WWW ) internet and code on FTP sites , but the principle was much the same .
It was only when I needed a host for an increasingly large 3D engine I ’d been writing in 2000 ( which later became the earliest version of OGRE ) that I discovered Sourceforge and open - source licenses .
At that stage , I did n’t really care much about the minutae and just went with what seemed the most popular choice - the GPL .
Fairly soon after this was revised to LGPL because it was clear GPL was n’t a flexible choice for a library .
Over the years I formed the opinion that the LGPL was a good balance for what I was doing - it allowed use in proprietary applications but required that modifications to the open - source part were passed on ; and this also , I thought , encouraged contributions back to the core since it ’s simpler to have your changes promoted .
The downside was that the license is pretty long and full of legalese , and frequently needed explaining & clarifying .
Still , I considered that a necessary cost of a license that ‘ protected the interests ’ of the open source project .
I had considered more permissive licenses like zlib and MIT to be too weak - giving everything away with no conditions encouraging reciprocal contributions or participation .
I only really started to seriously question this long - held opinion recently , shortly after I had to deal with a license violation issue .
The details of this are irrelevant ( and will not be discussed here ) , the important thing is that after all the dust had settled , it really made me sit down and take a long , hard look at what open source licenses actually achieve in practice , and which bits I felt were the most important for sustaining my projects .
Purist free software advocates subscribe to the view that all software should be ‘ free ’ ( as in speech ) , which is , when you boil it down , a philosophical principle .
While the intention is often genuinely altruistic - enablement for all developers and users of software - in a practical sense it is also a highly prescriptive , black - and - white approach .
Free software licenses like the GPL restrict as much as they enable , on the basis that not to do so would deny future users of the flexibility to alter the software .
It ’s an understandable point of view , if very hacker - oriented , but it ’s not one that I personally sign up to .
I ’m not involved in open source as a ‘ movement ’ , in order to ensure that all users have access to all the source code of every application they use .
Instead , I ’m involved in open source because I think it ’s a damn good way to get good software written for the benefit of the many , particularly infrastructural elements that can then be used to innovate faster , by smaller teams , to challenge incumbents , and generally shake things up .
I ’m a firm believer that open source and proprietary software can be good bedfellows , and that each can benefit the other - open source providing solid foundations for proprietary innovation , and proprietary software contributing to the open source projects underpinning it , in terms of code and funds .
In that context , the restrictive elements of the LGPL seemed well - placed - the LGPL allows proprietary use , but modifications had to be passed on .
But , after much consideration and hard self - questioning in recent weeks I realised something important .
Of all the people that have contributed to OGRE over the years , I ca n’t think of a single good code contribution that has come about because the license conditions encouraged it .
All of the people who have made a significant positive contribution to OGRE have done so because they chose to do so .
Either because they wanted to do it for fun , or because they saw that it was in their own interests as users , they sent patches in , created new add - ons , joined the team etc .
None of these people required any coersion from a license to do what they did , and all the better for it - because they chose to do it , they tended to be more forthcoming in terms of adhering to standards , answering questions about their contribution , and generally participating in the community rather than just doing a minimal code - dump .
The other thing I considered was the impact of someone modifying OGRE and not publishing their changes .
On the one hand , this is a potential for a lost contribution , but in practice the LGPL conditions are only to pass on the source to others , not to contribute back to the core project ( which requires a contributor agreement anyway ) , and as mentioned we ’ve already established that the best contributions are from willing sources anyway .
Then comes the principle of whether it matters that the end user is not guaranteed to see the modified source of OGRE - free software principles say this is not right , but I have to say that in practice , most end users do n’t care and in practice it ’s of little consequence for OGRE .
Obviously many people in the free software camp would disagree strongly with this .
It ’s more of an issue in enterprise apps where a customer who receives a significantly customised application from a vendor , and needs to keep maintenance in mind ; IMO regardless of whether the software is based on open source the customer should be insisting their vendor delivers source anyway - that ’s what contracts are for .
But I digress .
So , after much thought I concluded that the most useful pay - backs to an open source project , and thus its community , from a user ( in my opinion ) were :
Code & documentation contributions - which based on my experience come from voluntary sources Community participation - forum support , bug reports etc Publicity .
The ‘ restrictive ’ elements of the LGPL ( and GPL ) , to which so much confusing license text is dedicated , did n’t seem to contribute to any of those except number 3 , and then really just as a side - effect .
It was at this point that I realised that my previous opinions about permissive licenses not providing enough safeguards against exploitation for an open source project were off - base .
In practice , open source projects do n’t really need protection , because their best contributors are going to be there regardless ( yes , I realise the GPL provides more protection to end users who want to get at the source code , that ’s not what I ’m considering here ) .
‘ Freeloaders ’ - people who use or modify the open source project for their own ends but give no code or community contribution back - are always going to exist ; even under the GPL it ’s easy to freeload , if you make your money from hosting services for example , and thus license choice has little impact on the scale ( if not the nature ) of the freeloading .
Besides the annoyance of ‘ that guy took my work and made some money out of it ’ - which you have to accept as an inevitable outcome of going open source , so stick to making proprietary software if that bugs you - freeloaders have little negative effect on an open source project , and actually their use can contribute positively to item 3 ( publicity ) .
The key is to recognise that in practice you can really just ignore freeloaders , and instead concentrate on maximising the positive contributors in your community .
So , if we acknowledge that the people whose contributions we actually want are those who contribute voluntarily , regardless of license , we quickly come to the conclusion that all that really matters is the size of the community .
It ’s a fair assumption that for a given project there is a relatively stable percentage of users who will choose to contribute back ( the percentage itself varies per project , but is fairly stable per project in my experience ) , therefore the easiest way to increase your contributors is to just increase your user base .
Forget about trying to coerce people into being ‘ good ’ members of the community , just trust that the percentage will be there and will track your overall numbers .
One way in which to attract more users is to make the licensing simpler and more easier to understand .
Programmers hate legalese , and a simple , clear license is bound to be more attractive than our LGPL ( with static link exclusion ) , plus OUL option .
It ’s for this reason that from OGRE 1.7 we ’re switching to the MIT License .
I ’d like to thank Matt Asay for his post on the subject , which really jump - started my thought processes on this subject in the last few weeks .
This whole process has been a reminder to me that it ’s always good to re-examine your previous assumptions and opinions in the light of practical experience , and to be prepared to reach different conclusions than you did before .
The whole open source landscape is constantly changing and maturing , why should those of us immersed in it be any different ?
Two black bounty hunters ride into a small town out West in pursuit of an outlaw .
They discover that the town has no sheriff , and soon take over that position , much against the will of the mostly white townsfolk .
They raise hell , chase women , and milk the locals for cash , while waiting for the opportunity to get their man .

In British gardens they are welcome visitors , stopping off to sing and snack on the caterpillars .
But in a remote cave in Hungary they are exhibiting some unusual behaviour .
There , great tits have turned into predators who search out and eat roosting bats .
Scarcity of normal dietary staples is believed to have led the birds to prey on the creatures , the first time the extraordinary behaviour has been seen .
A team of scientists , led by Peter Estók at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany , reported that on hearing the pipistrelle bats squeak the great tits entered the cave in north - east Hungary and started to peck at them as they sheltered in crevices .
Whether the birds are an isolated group who have learned to prey on these bats in the cave , or whether great tits in Europe are altering their eating habits in a similar way , is uncertain , the scientists say .
The researchers staked out the cave and spent 22 days observing over two winters .
On hearing the bat calls the birds flew slowly along the roof of the cliff where the animals nestled .
The birds were recorded killing bats 16 times .
" We found several carcasses and one was in what I would call a terminal state , " said Estók .
" A great tit had pecked away all of the muscle , fat and intestines and even the brain .
All that was left was skin and bones .
This is the first time these birds have been seen capturing and eating bats . "
The researchers found that when offered sunflower seeds and bacon scraps the tits stopped flying into the cave .
A report on the behaviour appears today in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters .
The cave is well served by natural light , so the tits can see to home in on their prey .
To investigate whether they came across the bats by accident or were truly hunting them , the scientists broadcast bat sounds from speakers close to the mouth of the cave .
On hearing the calls almost all of the great tits flew up to the speaker to take a look .
The researchers speculate that the great tits may be taking advantage of food available in their immediate environment – as blue tits in Britain have done , opening doorstep milk bottles to drink the cream .
Glenn Beck went on a tirade against President Obama , calling him a racist .
Several public figures and web sites , including ColorOfChange.org and FoxNewsBoycott.com , call for a boycott of Glenn Beck ’s sponsors .
Over 45,000 ColorOfChange.org members called on advertisers to pull their ads from Glenn Beck ’s show .
LexisNexis - owned Lawyers.com , Procter & Gamble and Progressive Insurance listened .
This is what they had to say :
LEXISNEXIS : Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention .
We have suspended further advertising during Mr. Beck ’s program .
We have no plans to continue advertising on Mr. Beck ’s show .
PROCTER & GAMBLE : No P&G ads should have appeared on this program in the first place .
To be clear , if any of our advertising appeared on the Glenn Beck show , it was in error and we appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention .
We will do what we can to see that it does n’t happen again .
PROGRESSIVE : Our ( advertising ) order specifies no Glenn Beck .
We have confirmed with the network that our spots should not be running there .
Original Story
Share this article
In Part 1 , I argued that the skewed distribution of wealth in the United States has been produced under conditions of unequal opportunity and therefore must be considered unfair .
Further , a lack of sufficient protections – such as guaranteed health care and higher education – keeps the risks of inequality intolerably high .
In this second installment , I will show that rising inequality is a predictable byproduct of U.S. economic policy choices , which actively pursue advantage for elites – at the necessary disadvantage of laborers .
The Great Compression
According to Paul Krugman , a Nobel Prize - winning economist , the middle class society “ was created in a very short period of time between the late 1930s and the end of World War II . ”
He cites “ equalizing policies ” in President Roosevelt ’s New Deal that placed higher taxes on the wealthy , supported unions , guaranteed a minimum wage , granted unemployment insurance and instituted social security .
The evidence is in the Gini coefficient ( which measures national inequality on a .00 - 1.00 scale , .00 being perfect equality and 1.00 being perfect inequality ) .
Gini peaked above .50 during the Great Depression in the 1930s .
But , by 1947 , after the New Deal and the end of WWII , it had dropped to .38 .
Krugman argues that the New Deal – and not the war - time economy alone – closed the gap between rich and poor , but , more importantly , he says it cemented equalization as the norm .
Peak
Indeed , the trend persisted well after 1945 , up through President Johnson ’s own attempt at New Deal - style economics – the Great Society .
Equality peaked in 1968 .
It was a year dominated by anti-authoritarian challenges , which were funneled through movements for peace in Vietnam , African - American equality and women ’s liberation .
Together , these stirrings represented the strongest uprising in the U.S. since the Civil War .
But they also represent the end of shared economic prosperity in America .
Trough
Equality has decreased ever since the near insurrection of the late 1960s , and now , at Gini .45 , it barely even resembles the distributions seen in other advanced industrial democracies .
For comparison ’s sake , France and Germany come in at .28 ; Canada is at .32 , Italy is at .33 and the U.K. is at .34 .
Rollback
Reaganomics represented the most significant subversion of FDR ’s equalization policies – subversion that continues to the present , but which reached notorious depths under Bush II .
Instead of supporting public works , Reagan gutted social spending .
Academics Joel Rogers and Thomas Ferguson point out that “ the deepest social spending cuts ” came in “ low - income benefits and jobs and services programs . ”
Instead of progressive taxation , he reduced the top tax bracket ’s rate from 70 % to 28 % .
Instead of market controls , he favored market de-regulations ( a policy with familiar effects in 2009 ) .
Union membership – which correlates positively with equality – shrank under Reagan , who famously waged a union - busting campaign throughout his administration .
In the early 1980s , more than 20 % of the workforce was unionized .
Now only 12 % of workers belong to a union , and most of them are in the public sector .
These policies have had a predictable effect .
Since 1980 , economic growth has been overwhelmingly relegated to the richest fraction of American elites – even during the Clinton years .
Since Reagan , “ real ” wages for Americans have stagnated , and the minimum wage is actually less than the adjusted minimum wage from 1968 ( more than $ 9 ) .
Conclusion
Economic inequality in the U.S. is unjust .
It is not the result of chance , nor of autonomous market forces .
Rather , it is the necessary and predictable by - product of economic policies that favor elite Americans .
These policies , instituted by Reagan but continued ever since , include tax breaks for the wealthiest , drastic cuts in social spending and impediments to unionization .
( Interestingly , they also include extreme protectionism and increases in national debt . )
While official rhetoric suggests otherwise , the motive for this economic agenda can be ascribed to self - interest .
The social movements of the late 1960s challenged fundamental power structures in the U.S. – structures that feature control by a concentrated elite .
Economic equality , normalized by the New Deal / Great Society programs , created expectations and ( relatively ) shared prosperity that lead to these movements .
Thus , it ’s no surprise that elite sectors would support a redistribution of wealth toward the top .
Now , with inequality near its peak and the economy in crisis , it ’s time for another rollback .
Americans do n’t deserve lower wages and longer hours .
They do n’t deserve to have the profits from their labor diverted to the top of the tax bracket , while they struggle to hold on to increasingly - insecure employment , afraid nothing will support them should they fall .
It ’s time for a new deal .

Ever wonder how war photographers survive out there ?
We 've enlisted Teru Kuwayama — a photographer who has covered conflicts in Iraq , Afghanistan and other hotspots for Time , Newsweek and Outside — to explain the perils of working in a war zone .
Advertisement
Among military planners , there 's an aphorism that states : " Amateurs talk tactics , professionals talk logistics . "
The daily mechanics of photographing in a " war zone " do n't have much to do with photography — mostly it 's about getting from point A to point B without getting your head cut off , then finding a signal and an outlet .
Advertisement
I 'm probably not the right person to be give advice on war photography , since I do n't even count myself as a war photographer — but for one reason or another , I 've spent the better part of the last decade in places like Iraq and Afghanistan .
I was a young photographer when these wars began — I 'm not anymore , and from all indications , the " long war " is just getting started .
For what it 's worth , here 's some advice for first timers heading out to the badlands .
Wear Your Seat Belt
I get questions on a daily basis from journalists heading for Afghanistan — most of them are about body armor — but it 's the traffic that 's most likely to kill you .
The stretch of Islamist insurgency that arcs from Southern Philippines to Somalia has n't produced exceptional snipers , but it 's home to some of the most lethal drivers on Earth .
On my last trip to Pakistan , I flipped a car four times within 72 hours of arrival .
My bulletproof vest is still wrapped in plastic somewhere in Islamabad .
Learn How To Say " Hello " and " Thank You " and To Count To Ten
Most tourists would n't go to France or Italy without packing a phrasebook , but a surprising number of photographers set off to Iraq or Afghanistan without learning how to make the most basic conversation .
I recently found myself explaining to an " experienced war photographer " that Afghans do n't speak Arabic .

Stop Looking
For the " Front Line " —
It 's a Mirage
The awkwardly named " global war on terror " might be the undeclared World War III of the 21st century , but it does n't play out like WWI and WWII , and counterinsurgency is n't done in trenches .
In modern military parlance , the " battlefield " has been replaced by the " battlespace , " an all - encompassing realm that includes not just the landscape , but also the " hearts and minds " of a " human terrain , " and the airwaves and webspace across which an " information war " is being waged .

Equip Yourself With the Right Gear
War zone propeller - heads can talk endlessly about their toys , so here , in bullet points , are a few tips :
• Avoid the faux - commando stuff -
An entire paramilitary equipment industry has emerged , selling " special operator " products ranging from " tactical flashlights " to mercenary - chic cargo trousers .
Private military contractors love this overpriced war - schwag , but since you are not a highly paid , heavily armed , former Navy SEAL , it 's probably best that you avoid dressing up like one .
When you 're on the side of the road , getting shaken down for your money and / or your ID , you really do n't want to pull it out of a camouflage passport holder that says " Operation Iraqi Freedom " all over it .
( It wo n't make you especially popular in the airport in Paris or Dubai either ) .

• Bring plastic ( not your credit cards ) -
In places like Iraq and Afghanistan , you will encounter an unimaginable variety of dirt , dust , sand and , in the rare event of rain , mud that falls from the sky .
These abrasive , corrosive , gear - choking forces are probably more destructive than any known insurgent militia , and they will eat you and your expensive toys alive .
Zipties , ziplock bags , crazy glue and plastic packing tape will help you patch it together .
Skip the army - navy outfitter , and go to Home Depot and the 99 - cent store .
• Pack your go bag - AKA , your grab bag , jump bag , snatch bag , bug - out bag , etc .
Since you 're out there looking for trouble , be prepared to find it .
Your go bag is the essential kit , packed in advance , that you head for the door with when things get hectic .
Beyond your go bag , keep an ultra - light bare - bones survival pack — and keep it strapped to your body .
When things go bang , you may be semi-conscious , crawling out of a destroyed building or a wrecked vehicle , and even your go bag may go sideways .
Military bases and hotels with foreign guests are natural magnets for missiles and explosives , so expecting to be blown out of bed is not necessarily an irrational thought .
Similarly , you are exceptionally vulnerable when traveling by road , and in the event of an accident or an ambush that you are lucky enough to survive , you wo n't get a time - out to collect your stuff .

Embedding Has Both Perks and Consequences
For better , and for worse , the military has provided training wheels for rookies .
On the upside , embedding takes care of the serious logistical challenges of transportation , shelter , security and food and water .
There 's not a lot of bed - and - breakfasts to be found in Fallujah or Kandahar , so that 's not a small consideration .
On the downside , embedded reporters operate on a very short leash with ever - increasing restrictions from their military handlers .
Independent reporting is critical for getting an accurate view from these places , but it 's dangerous , difficult , expensive , and it 's being done less and less by the international press .
Embedding provides a particular but extremely limited view of the battlespace .
You can spend an entire deployment embedded with the US Marines in Diyala or Helmand , but do n't fool yourself that you know anything about Iraq or Afghanistan — what you 've seen is the inside of an armored bubble .

Get In Shape Before Deploying
If you 're going to hang out with the war jocks , get in shape .
No one expects you qualify for Special Forces school , but if you 're an overweight chain - smoker , you 're not going to inspire a lot of confidence in the infantry unit you want to tag along with , and you 're likely to get left back at base ( for your own good , and theirs ) .
I 'm 5 ' 6 " , 140 lbs , and 38 years old , which means I should probably be behind a desk somewhere , but somehow ended up living in mountains and deserts with soldiers and marines who are literally twice my size , and half my age — while I 'm hauling a backpack that 's more than 50 % of my body weight .
Those are unsympathetic mathematics that destroy knees , spines and ankles .
Do whatever you can to rebuild your most basic equipment — running , lifting , swimming , wall - climbing , yoga , whatever — just do it , and do n't wait till the week before you ship out .

Fixers : The Tour Guides of War Reporting
Sometimes they 're local journalists , sometimes they 're taxi drivers or doctors who speak English and know how to get things done .
If they were American or European , they'd have more glamorous titles like " field producers " or " media consultants . "
But in Iraq and Afghanistan , they do journalism 's heavy lifting for a $ 100 a day , and they 're left back in the shit when their clients are telling war stories back at home .
Respect them , their knowledge , and the risk they face to make your work possible — but do n't trust them blindly .
Some of them are shady , and all of them are winging it , just like you are .
I avoid fixers because so many of the ones I 've worked with are dead now .
Do n't Follow the Pack
For most of the last eight years , Afghanistan was the " Forgotten War " , and Iraq was the " Central Front " .
The US government has now reversed gears , and the US media is now falling over itself to relocate all the balls it dropped .
As mainstream journalists are beginning to grapple with the complexity of Afghanistan - plus - Pakistan , special operations are quietly moving on to the Horn of Africa .
Try to think outside the extremely cramped box — by the time it's " news , " it 's pretty old .

The manuals have become known around the world In 1987 as I bought my first Haynes instruction manual , I was quite unprepared for the look of respect that I got from the mechanic who sold it to me .
At the age of 18 I was only used to looks ranging from disinterest to hostility from engineers , but buying the Haynes instruction manual for my car - an old Morris Minor 1100 - suddenly marked me out as someone with credibility .
So five cars later , five Haynes manuals later , and many years of spotting Haynes manuals in people 's houses and giving them that look of respect , it was with tremendous anticipation that I found myself making a Radio 4 programme on instruction manuals and about to meet the man himself , the godfather of instruction manuals , John Haynes .
We tracked down the man in the Somerset headquarters of his publishing company , which looks like a cross between a dairy farm and rural village complete with pub , small paths between the out - buildings and orchards , and reassuringly , plenty of vintage cars in the car park ( I spotted my beloved Morris Minor ) .
Early start John Haynes himself was ensconced in a large shady office , emerging from behind a huge desk full of models of cars and stacked with instruction manuals ; he looked like Father Christmas but with the twinkle in the eye of Willy Wonka .
He is the man whose love of cars started him on the road to produce the first instruction manuals on how to repair and care for cars in the 1950s .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Haynes manuals are the most famous instruction manuals in the world , having sold 150 million copies worldwide and will mark their 50th anniversary in 2010 .
To this day , the Haynes manual for a particular make of car is the last word on the subject .
The practical , hardback books came into being when a young Mr Haynes , tinkering with his first car , realised he could improve on the instruction manuals given out by car manufacturers .
At the age of 16 while still at school , he bought an Austin Seven Saloon , dismantled it , and built a lightweight , open two - seater sports car .
Then he had an idea .
" I thought to myself if I produce a booklet about how I built this Austin Seven Special , because there was nothing published in those days , I might sell a hundred copies in a couple of months . "
But it only took 10 days to sell all the copies , which made him realise that there was a gap in the market for car instruction manuals that gave detailed instructions on how to repair and maintain different models of car .
Listen to the programme How to Write An Instruction Manual is presented by Dr Mark Miodownik , an engineer from King 's College London
It will be broadcast on Radio 4 on 21 August at 1100 BST
The programme will be available to download as a podcast from Friday 21 - Thursday 27 Aug via the Radio 4 Choice webpage John Haynes 's ethos is " above all be honest , tell them how it really is , step - by - step " .
The manuals have since become the archetype of a technological reference manual for home use , designed for non-experts to become more acquainted with machines : every car is completely stripped down , rebuilt and photographed in the course of making each manual .
Haynes manuals now cover many subjects including motorcycles , computers , spacecraft , and there are even manuals with titles such as Man , Woman and Cancer , which come under the Family series .
' Cars are cars '
Yet , despite this wave of popularity , Haynes does not produce manuals for all the menagerie of modern gadgets that now surround us .
Neither have device manufacturers chosen to fill the void and produce a range of simple " how - to "s for taking apart everyday gadgets .
The manuals have branched out from their original subject matter
The reasons for this are perhaps two - fold .
The first is that society has become less curious in how machines work - they are no longer a novelty .
We are surrounded by complicated machines and if we had to understand how each worked and how each could be repaired it would take up much of our leisure time .
Secondly , the economic reward for looking after things is growing smaller .
Increasingly the manufacturers of machines do not design them to be repaired , and so it is often cheaper and easier to throw the mobile phone , fridge or toaster away rather than repair it .
The increased use of electronics in cars has led many to suggest the same process is now happening to cars and that they will soon be irreparable , making Haynes manuals mere relics of a bygone age .
But Mr Haynes is not worried ; cars are cars , he says .
" Underneath the electronics you have got all the same mechanical functions , " he said .
" You have got valves going up and down , you have got pistons going up and down , you have got bearings wearing out , so basically all the work is still there to be done . "
It was n't just John Haynes , but all his staff and family , which impressed me .
I came away with the feeling that I had visited the nexus of a powerful force in the world , a place filled with the guardian angels of cars .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Communications Commission will open an inquiry to examine the various technologies to block children from watching programs with sex and violence , the agency ’s chief said on Monday .
“ Parents must have access to control technologies that can appropriately limit their children ’s exposure to unsuitable material , ” FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in releasing an agency report detailing the technologies available to parents .
The report concluded that no single parental control technology works across all the media platforms , such as over - the - air , cable and satellite television ; wireless services and the Internet .
In July the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing during which Genachowski said the existing rules governing television programing for children will be reviewed in light of the proliferation of online videos and other technological changes .
Committee chairman John Rockefeller , a West Virginia Democrat , said more must be done by lawmakers , industry and the government to help parents block inappropriate content from children .
“ We must offer the tools and policies that make it easy for people to be good parents and oversee the viewing that goes on in their homes . ”
Rockefeller said in a statement .
“ We must do more than simply gather information and hope this alone protects our children . ”
Honduran forces are preventing Mr Zelaya 's supporters from protesting A top US diplomat says deposed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya was " irresponsible and foolish " to return before a settlement had been reached .
Lewis Amselem , US ambassador to the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , said Washington had asked Mr Zelaya not to return because of potential unrest .
He called on him to urge his supporters to keep their protests peaceful .
Earlier , Honduran troops raided two media outlets that had been critical of the interim government .
Radio Globo and Cholusat Sur TV were closed after authorities issued a state of emergency suspending key civil liberties for 45 days .
The measures were in response to a call by Mr Zelaya for his supporters to stage a protest exactly three months since he was deposed .
Mr Zelaya is holed up in the Brazilian embassy in the capital Tegucigalpa after his dramatic return last week .
' Wild allegations '
" The return of Zelaya [ without ] an agreement is irresponsible and foolish .
He should cease and desist from making wild allegations and from acting as though he were starring in an old movie , " said Mr Amselem at an emergency meeting of the OAS .
" Having chosen , with outside help , to return on his own terms , President Zelaya and those who have facilitated his return , bear particular responsibility for the actions of his supporters , " he added .
Police and troops cordoned off the Radio Globo offices in Tegucigalpa Mr Amselem also criticised the decision of the interim government to block an OAS mission and to declare a state of emergency .
He said the US would continue to urge both sides to reach agreement under the San Jose accord proposed by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias .
The proposal calls for Mr Zelaya to return to office and finish his term , which ends in January .
The interim government 's decree - broadcast on national television - allows unauthorised public meetings to be banned and news media to be temporarily closed down .
Radio Globo journalist Carlos Lopez said soldiers had " confiscated everything " , including cameras and the keys to vehicles when they raided the station early on Monday .
Hundreds of soldiers and riot police are surrounding the Brazilian embassy .
Despite the tight security and regular curfews , Mr Zelaya had urged his supporters to converge on Tegucigalpa on Monday in what he called a " final offensive " .
Brazil warned
The interim government warned Brazil on Sunday that its diplomatic credentials would be revoked in 10 days if it did not grant Mr Zelaya asylum or hand him over .
Mr Zelaya was forced from office at gunpoint after announcing plans to hold a non-binding public consultation on whether people supported moves to change the constitution .
His opponents said the move was unconstitutional and was aimed at removing the current one - term limit on serving as president , so paving the way for Mr Zelaya 's possible re-election .
He has denied this .
A presidential election is planned for November .

At first light last Friday , in the Chardarah district of Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan , the villagers gathered around the twisted wreckage of two fuel tankers that had been hit by a Nato airstrike .
They picked their way through a heap of almost a hundred charred bodies and mangled limbs which were mixed with ash , mud and the melted plastic of jerry cans , looking for their brothers , sons and cousins .
They called out their names but received no answers .
By this time , everyone was dead .
What followed is one of the more macabre scenes of this or any war .
The grief - stricken relatives began to argue and fight over the remains of the men and boys who a few hours earlier had greedily sought the tanker 's fuel .
Poor people in one of the world 's poorest countries , they had been trying to hoard as much as they could for the coming winter .
" We did n't recognise any of the dead when we arrived , " said Omar Khan , the turbaned village chief of Eissa Khail .
" It was like a chemical bomb had gone off , everything was burned .
The bodies were like this , " he brought his two hands together , his fingers curling like claws .
" There were like burned tree logs , like charcoal .
" The villagers were fighting over the corpses .
People were saying this is my brother , this is my cousin , and no one could identify anyone . "
So the elders stepped in .
They collected all the bodies they could and asked the people to tell them how many relatives each family had lost .
A queue formed .
One by one the bereaved gave the names of missing brothers , cousins , sons and nephews , and each in turn received their quota of corpses .
It did n't matter who was who , everyone was mangled beyond recognition anyway .
All that mattered was that they had a body to bury and perform prayers upon .
" A man comes and says , ' I lost my brother and cousin ' , so we gave him two bodies , " said Omar Khan .
" Another says I lost five relatives , so we gave him five bodies to take home and bury .
When we had run out of bodies we started giving them limbs , legs , arms , torsos . "
In the end only five families went away without anything .
" Their sons are still missing . "
Omar Khan 's small eyes narrowed and his mouth formed a disgusted circle .
" The smell was so bad .
For three days I smelled of burned meat and fuel . "
Omar Khan was one of 11 villagers the Guardian interviewed about the airstrike .
We arrived in the region early this week with the intention of visiting the site of the attack , but the kidnapping of a New York Times journalist and the firefight that preceded his rescue , leaving four people dead , meant the journey there was too difficult .
Instead the villagers came into the city to tell us their stories .
We sat around a table in the basement of a hotel , and one by one their accounts of the airstrike – which killed 70 - 100 people , making it one of the most devastating of the war – spilled out .
The villagers said the Taliban had hijacked the fuel tankers at 7 pm on Thursday evening and driven them off the main road to Kabul , through Ali Abad district , into their stronghold of Chardarah , to the south - west of Kunduz .
To reach Chardarah they had to ford a shallow river to avoid a bridge garrisoned by the Afghan army .
But when they drove the trucks into the water they became stuck , so the Taliban summoned the people in the nearby villages to help .
Jamaludin , a 45 - year - old farmer , had been praying in the mosque when he heard the sound of a tractor .
" I went home and found that three of my brothers and my nephew had left with my tractor , " he said .
" I called my brother to ask him where they had gone .
He said the Taliban had asked him to bring the tractor and help them pull a tanker . "
Jamaluddin was alarmed .
" I asked him what tanker ?
It was n't our business , let the Taliban bring their own tractors .
I called him back an hour later .
He said they could n't get the trucks out and the Taiban would n't let him leave , so I went back to sleep . "
Realising the tankers were stuck , the Taliban decided to siphon off the fuel and asked people to come and help themselves to the ghanima , the spoils of war .
There would be free fuel for everyone .
Assadullah , a thin 19 - year - old with a wisp of black hair falling on his forehead , got a call from a friend who said the Taliban were distributing free fuel .
" I took two fuel cans with me , I called my brother and a friend and we went .
There was a full moon and we could see very clearly .
There were a lot of people already there .
They were pushing and shoving , trying to reach the tap to fill their jerry cans .
We are poor people , and we all wanted to get some fuel for the winter .
" I filled my cans and moved away while my brother was pushing to fill his .
I walked for a hundred , maybe two hundred metres . "
It was about 1 am on Friday that the aircraft attacked and incinerated the stolen fuel tankers .
" There was a big light in the sky and then an explosion , " Assadullah said .
" I fell on my face .
When I came to , there was thick smoke and I could n't see anything .
I called , I shouted for my brother but he did n't answer .
I could n't see him .
There was fire everywhere and silence and bodies were burning . "
He pulled up his long shirt to show me four small shrapnel bruises and two burns on his neck .
Jamaludin woke up at about 1 am to start making food .
It was Ramadan , and he had to prepare Sehur , the last meal before sunrise .
" I called my brother again and told him I could hear lots of aeroplanes in the sky , why was n't he back ?
He said he was bringing some fuel and would be home soon .
I hung up and went into the courtyard , and then there was a big fire , like a big lamp in the middle of the sky .
I called my brother again and his phone was off .
I left home and ran towards the river .
The smell of smoke was coming from there .
" When I got there I could n't see my brother .
I shouted for him .
I saw some people carrying injured on their shoulders , then I went back home to pray and wait for the light . "
Jan Mohammad , an old man with a white beard and green eyes , said angrily : " I ran , I ran to find my son because nobody would give me a lift .
I could n't find him . "
He dropped his head on his palm that was resting on the table , and started banging his head against his white mottled hand .
When he raised his head his eyes were red and tears were rolling down his cheek : " I could n't find my son , so I took a piece of flesh with me home and I called it my son .
I told my wife we had him , but I did n't let his children or anyone see .
We buried the flesh as it if was my son . "
He broke off , then shouted at the young Assadullah , who had knocked at the old man 's house and told his son to come with them there was free fuel for everyone , " You destroyed my home " , Assadu - llah turned his head and looked at the wall .
" You destroyed my home , " he shouted again .
Jan Mohammad dropped his head again on his palm and rolled it left and right , his big gray turban moving like a huge pendulum , " Taouba [ forgiveness ] , " he hissed .
" People lost their fathers and sons for a little bit of fuel .
Forgiveness . "
Omar Khan , the village chief , was crying now and looking at the ceiling .
Fazel Muhamad a 48 - year - old farmer with seven deep lines creasing his forehead and a white prayers cap , threw two colour passport pictures in front of me , one of a thickly bearded man and the other a young boy .
" My cousin and his son , " he said .
" Around 10 pm , my cousin told me the Taliban were distributing fuel to the people and he was going to get some for the winter .
I asked him to stay and not go , there were planes and it was dangerous at night , but he went anyway .
" At one or two in the morning we heard a big explosion and I saw fire coming form the sky .
My cousin's wife came running , she said go look for your cousin , but I waited until I had finished my dawn prayers , no one could eat anything .
" I arrived there and I saw dead bodies , some were in the middle of the river , I walked around looking for him and his son but I could n't find him .
I went back home and his wife asked me did you see him , is he dead , where is he ?
I said I could n't find him .
She was wailing and crying .
" I went again looking for him .
There was light now , I picked through the bodies , the Arbabs [ village elders ] were distributing the flesh , but I did n't go there .
I looked through the ground and I could only see his two feet and his son's feet .
I recognised them because he and his son had henna on their toes . "
Islamu - ldin , a 20 - year - old from Issa khail village with tufts of hair sprouting from his cheek , took his turn to speak .
He said he ran for three hours to get to the riverbed to look for his brother .
" Our village is far from the river , I searched a lot through the dead , and I found my brother .
I recognized him from his clothes .
But we only found his upper body , maybe someone took the legs , maybe it just burned to ashes . "
Omar Khan was weeping openly now .
A few other men resisted , but their eyes were as red as those of Jan Muhamad , who was babbling and shouting at the young Assadullah again and again .
Saleh Muhamad , a 25 - year - old man with thick beard , wanted to get some fuel but no one would give him a lift .
His brother and brother - in - law went and he went to sleep , then he heard the explosion .
" I waited till darkness ended , then went there .
I did n't find anyone I knew , so I waited for the elders .
They gave me two bodies , they looked like my relatives and I came back with them . "
Another village elder said that at least a dozen of the dead were from the Taliban .
Although most of them had already left when the explosion happened , the rest stayed trying to keep some order while the villagers shoved and pushed .
" At midnight my brother and nephew went to get fuel .
I also wanted to go but I did n't have a car , " said Saleh Muhamad .
" At one in the morning I went to bed .
When I heard the explosion I called my brother but his phone was off … when I arrived at 3 am there were dead everywhereI was searching for my brother and nephew but I could n't find anyone .
" I had a torch with me and I could see well , but I still could n't recognise anyone . "
His eyes looked straight through me as he said : " I found one body and took it home and we buried it .
It was a full body , with arms and legs .
We buried it well . "
I submitted a bug to the wordpress development team and I now see that the fix I submitted along with it has been included in the official source .
It ’s uncredited ( I accidently submitted anonymously , and I have no idea if they ’d have credited me even if I had remembered to put my name down ) , but that does n’t matter to me in the slightest .
It was such a minor little tweak , that I can remain happy in my anonymity .
Not that I ’d be chagrined if I submitted something more important and was left uncredited .
To take the highground ( and the soapbox ) , being able to use such high - quality open source software is enough for me .
A shout - out through the ether to the people at wordpress .
UPDATE
I spoke too soon – it turns out it was n’t my code , it was the exact same code generated , I presume independently , by someone else .
No matter , at least I know it was a good idea .

The Consultative Council for tripartite cooperation will discuss next week various ways to finance the social security system , given the decrease in the budget of the National Social securities Institute because of the economic crisis .
For this and for next year , though , there will be no increase in the pension age , declared the Bulgarian minister for labour and social policy Totyu Mladenov .
" You know that at the moment 50 % of the revenues in the Social Securities Institute come from the state .
This is an enormous problem which was discussed couple of days ago in the Economic and Social Council and we will continue the discussion " , the minister added .
He also said that the discussion next week will be very broad .
Representatives of the trade unions , the employers , the NGOs , pensioners ' organisations and associations of private pension funds will take part .
Asked by euinside , exactly given the crisis how the state will finance the system , minister Mladenov responded : " In a state of a crisis , the budget will finance the shortage of money in the social security " .
Mr. Mladenov added that the money will come from taxes .
After being asked by euinside whether this might mean an increase of taxes , the minister said he cannot answer this question in this very moment but reminded : " You know what we are doing at the moment - we are doing everything possible to block all holes , leaking inefficiently money from the budget so that we could secure enough money to allow us from the beginning of next year and from 1st of July 2010 to have a new incomes and pensions policy .
This is our target for the moment " .
The Consultative Council will also discuss what impact the promised decrease of the social security installment by 2 points from next year will have over the social security system .
Totyu Mladenov took part in the public hearing , organised by the Single Market Observatory of the European Economic and Social Committee , called " Bulgaria and the single European market " .
In his speech he announced that Bulgaria had already filed documents to receive money for the European Globalisation Funds to compensate the laying off of workers at the closed " Kremikovtsi " steel plant and for the workers in the Lom port .
The state has asked for 5 mn lv ( 2.56 mn euro ) .
It is expected the state soon to file documents for money from the Fund to compensate the laying off workers in the state railway company .
But still it is not clear how many workers will lose their job and how much money this will cost .
USC running back Stafon Johnson underwent more than seven hours of throat surgery Monday after he was injured in a weight - room accident on campus .
Johnson , a senior , was in “ critical but stable ” condition , a California Hospital Medical Center spokeswoman said .
His post - surgical prognosis is good , she added .
Johnson , who starred at Dorsey High , was just starting a set of bench - press lifts near the end of a midmorning workout when he apparently lost control of the bar and it landed on his neck , Coach Pete Carroll said .
Johnson reportedly spit up blood through his mouth and nose .

Reserve quarterback Garrett Green and fullback Stanley Havili did not see the accident , but both said they saw Johnson sitting quietly as he awaited the paramedics .
Carroll said Johnson ’s neck had been stabilized with a brace before he was transported by gurney to an ambulance .
“ This is a guy who ’s been an integral part of our program for years , ” Carroll said .
“ Everybody loves Stafon . . . .
When you ’re as connected as we are , we feel every bit of this .
. . .
We all feel a bit damaged today and injured .
. . .
It ’s a bad deal . ”
Surgery began about 2 p.m. , according to family friend John Eatman , a former high school teammate of Johnson’s .

Eatman was among about a dozen friends and family members gathered at the hospital Monday evening .
“ Right now we do n’t know anything , ” Eatman said outside the hospital .
“ We ’re just hoping he ’s all right . ”
Johnson ’s mother , Kim Mallory , was at the hospital but declined to comment through a family spokesperson .
Another source close to the family , who asked that they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak on their behalf , said surgeons had planned to realign Johnson ’s larynx and they were hopeful that he would regain his voice .

The hospital spokeswoman said the doctor said while it is unlikely Johnson will be able to complete the season , he is expected to make a full recovery .
Carroll said incidents such as Monday ’s were rare .
“ With all of thousands of reps that guys take , for the most part , guys do n’t get injured , ” Carroll said .
“ Unfortunately , this one happened today . ”
USC did not make strength and conditioning coach Chris Carlisle available to the media .
However , a news release posted on the school ’s website said Carlisle was within feet of Johnson when the accident occurred .

Carlisle also said that such a weightlifting accident was rare .
“ I ’ve seen players have the bar slip and fall onto their chest , but never in my 25 years of coaching have I heard of someone dropping a bar on their throat , ” Carlisle said on the website .
Carlisle also said an assistant strength and conditioning coach was acting as a “ spotter ” for Johnson at the time , but he did not identify the staff member .
Johnson led the team in rushing in 2008 and has been something of a goal - line specialist this season .

He leads USC with five touchdowns and has rushed for 157 yards in 32 carries , a 4.9 yards - per-carry average .
Carroll said junior C.J. Gable would probably move up the depth chart to augment juniors Joe McKnight and Allen Bradford .
“ C.J. steps up more and it ’ll just call on everybody to share the duties a little bit differently , ” Carroll said .
USC running backs coach Todd McNair said he had not begun to think about the future .
Advertisement
“ We ’re a man down , but I have n’t looked at it like that , ” McNair said .
“ I ’m just concerned about him and waiting to hear that he ’s good . ”

There are two things I ’m a total sucker for : great IPAs and bad puns .
Luckily for me , the two are found together more often than you ’d think .
Hop to it , Hop - a - doodle - do , Hop- ocalypse , and my perennial favorite , Hoptimus Prime , to name a few .
Needless to say , when I saw yet another cleverly named bitter , I could n’t help but pick some up .
But enough English , let ’s get pissed !
The History
Blue Point Brewing Company was born in 1998 in Long Island by friends Mark Burford and Pete Cotter .
Still relatively new and relatively small - producing around 10,000 barrels annually - Blue Point offers around 15 standard beers plus the occasional one - off .
Brewing is done both at the original brewery in Patchogue , NY and at a larger bottling facility in Maryland ( one of the reasons I ’m able to find a variety of Blue Point down in Washington DC ) .
For those in the Long Island area , or if you ’re ever vacationing nearby , Blue Point has a tasting room in their Patchogue brewery .
It ’s open 3 - 7 pm on Thursday & Friday , and 12 - 7 pm on Saturdays .
Head on down and enjoy a drink .
The Style
Typically , India Pale
Ales are bitter , with citrus or pine flavors , and a low malt profile .
This is from the higher than normal amount of hops added to the beer .
You might ask yourself , why India Pale Ale ?
Well , the style was born when British troops were stationed in India .
Breweries in England found that when they added more hops to their Pale Ale , the beer was able to survive the long voyage to India ( due to the higher alcohol content , as well as preservative properties in the hop ) .
When soldiers returned from India , they had acquired a taste for this new kind of ale .
Thus , the IPA became a mainstay of English beer culture .
Fast forward a couple centuries and you have the American IPA , which relies on the same principal , but is far more bitter / hoppy than it ’s ancestor across the pond .
Hoptical Illusion is a classic American IPA .
Classic - not double or imperial - because although it ’s a majorly hoppy beer , it ’s a classic 6.8 % ABV and only 60IBUs .
By comparison , Dogfish Head ’s 120 - minute IPA is 120IBU , Southern Tier Unearthly IPA is 153 , and the absolutely ridiculous Mikkeller X Hop Juice dominates the competition with a whopping - I ’m not making this up - 2,007 IBU .
Unlike those dubbed ‘ extreme ’ , Hoptical Illusion provides some perhaps welcome moderation to the world of hop - head IPAs .
Hoptical Illusion also boasts “ a rare variety of hop grown exclusively on a farm in Oregon . ”
According to their website , Blue Point bought the whole crop .
They do n’t give the variety a name , so let ’s just call it the Mystery Hop .
The Tasting
The beer pours a pale copper with a thick , soapy , sticky white head .
Aroma is citrusy , particularly a slight grapefruit .
Obviously , it ’s all hops up front .
A piney , evergreen sweet , followed by a bitter sting on the front of the tongue .
Overall , it ’s more of a harsh bitter than the sweet floral and citrus I ’m used to from big hop - bomb IPAs .
Malt is there , but it ’s hard for me to pick out a specific flavor .
It ’s just very well in tune with the hops , providing a balancing sweet bread ( not sweetbread ) that really rounds out the main bitterness .
Aftertaste is dry and soapy - and much cleaner than that makes it sound .
Increasing sweetness as the beer warms , more of a sharp grapefruit and less of the initial spruce .
Light on the mouth .
Crisp , very easy to drink .
Far less syrupy than your average big IPA , yet it retains the full punch - in - the - face hop flavor of IPAs twice its strength .
On the other hand , it ’s a bit light , weak , and watery once the carbonation dies .
The flavor holds , but the feel definitely thins a tad too much at the end .
The Verdict
I really really like this .
At first I was kind of skeptical about the “ Mystery Hop ” gimmick , but I ’m honestly impressed enough to conclude that buying the entire supply of a whole variety of hops was n’t just a cheap gimmick .
It has the full flavor and hop profile of a 9 or 10 % alcohol double IPA , but a thinner body and less than 7 % ABV puts Hoptical Illusion comfortably into the session beer category .
Not the best IPA ever , but I would happily recommend it .

OAK BLUFFS , Massachusetts ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama nominated Ben Bernanke to a second term as Federal Reserve chairman on Tuesday , aiming for continuity at a time when the U.S. economy is breaking free from a deep recession .
The decision , while widely expected , was welcomed by financial markets and policy makers around the globe .
Economists said it removed uncertainty at a delicate juncture in the economy ’s recovery .
Obama interrupted his vacation on the Massachusetts island of Martha ’s Vineyard to make the brief announcement with Bernanke , 55 , at his side .
“ Ben approached a financial system on the verge of collapse with calm and wisdom ; with bold action and outside - the - box thinking that has helped put the brakes on our economic freefall , ” Obama said .
Bernanke ’s four - year term expires in January and the president had not been expected to make an announcement until later this year .
Critics said the announcement had been timed to deflect attention from less market - friendly news on the government ’s budget deficit , but an Obama aide denied this .
“ There has been a considerable amount of speculation in the marketplace , both in the market and among observers of the Fed , and going into the fall the president wanted to end that speculation , ” Austan Goolsbee , a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , told Reuters Television .
The White House raised its 10 - year cumulative budget deficit projection by $ 2 trillion on Tuesday to approximately $ 9 trillion .
That would push the national debt up from more than $ 11 trillion now to more than $ 20 trillion in 2019 .
With polls showing Americans deeply worried about the deficit , the new data will make it more difficult for Obama to push through his ambitious economic and healthcare overhaul .
U.S. stocks were slightly higher in afternoon trading , buoyed by news of Bernanke ’s nomination and strong housing and consumer confidence data .
OBAMA MADE DECISION LAST MONTH
Before the president began a week - long vacation on Sunday , Obama administration officials repeatedly stressed that he would not be making news .
Analysts said the timing of the announcement was shrewd .
“ We entered the financial crisis two years ago with an untested Fed chairman .
Bernanke has been through the crucible since then , ” said Lou Crandall , chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in Jersey City , New Jersey .
“ Moving into the clean - up phase with another new and untested chairman would have just compounded the uncertainty in the outlook . ”
With growing signs the U.S. economy is slowly recovering , thanks in large part to Bernanke ’s efforts , the Fed chairman should have little difficulty winning confirmation from the Senate again .
Obama decided to nominate Bernanke a month ago , after consulting Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , an administration official said .

Lawrence Summers , Obama ’s top White House economic adviser and a former U.S. Treasury secretary who had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the top job at the Fed , also recommended Bernanke ’s nomination , the official said .
Bernanke was told in the Oval Office last Wednesday .
Obama is counting on Bernanke to nurse the economy back to health at a time when unemployment , home foreclosures and bank failures are still mounting .
The Fed chairman has pushed U.S. interest rates to near zero and flooded financial markets with hundreds of billions of dollars to stem a credit crisis and turn back recession .

Bernanke , appointed by President George W. Bush and widely respected as a top scholar on the Great Depression , now faces the challenge of pulling back the Fed ’s extraordinary support for the economy without setting back hopes for a recovery .
“ PROBABLY THE RIGHT CHOICE ”
Joining Obama in a school hall in the town of Oak Bluffs , Bernanke shook hands with the president before praising his support for a strong and independent Federal Reserve .
“ We have been bold or deliberate as circumstances demanded , but our objective remains constant : to restore a more stable economic and financial environment in which opportunity can again flourish , and in which Americans ’ hard work and creativity can receive their proper rewards , ” Bernanke said .
After the announcement , Obama headed to a golf course for a second straight day on the links .
Obama ’s Democrats control the Senate , but Bernanke , a Republican , has faced criticism from lawmakers in both parties who say he has gone too far in extending Fed support that will be difficult to unwind , threatening future inflation .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd vowed a “ thorough and comprehensive ” hearing to consider Bernanke ’s nomination .
But he appeared to endorse a second term for the Fed chairman , saying he was “ probably the right choice . ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Bernanke ’s renomination sent the right signal to financial markets and he expected the Senate to reconfirm him .
Mitch McConnell , the Republican leader in the Senate , said the confirmation hearings would be an opportunity to question Bernanke about the cumulative impact of the administration ’s trillions of dollars in new spending and borrowing .
Killer groupies an unexplained mystery PSYCHOLOGY

Even in his death row cell , satanic serial killer and rapist Richard Ramirez , the " Night Stalker , " receives bags of mail .
And of the dozens of people who try to contact him each year , officials say , about 90 percent are women .
It 's not just Ramirez who gets the attention , nor is Scott Peterson alone in the way he attracted admiring women even after he was sentenced to die for killing his wife and unborn child .
Death row prisoners often join the horde of grooms married in group ceremonies such as the one planned Saturday at San Quentin State Prison .
It 's a phenomenon that 's little understood and seldom studied : Women who fall hopelessly in love - or at the least become wildly infatuated - with the most feared killers .
" Our high notoriety inmates get the most interest , " said Lt. Sam Robinson , a San Quentin spokesman .
" I have tried to figure this out , but I do n't have an answer . "
Ramirez was convicted in 1988 of 13 murders and 30 other felonies , among them rape and sodomy .
He had terrified Southern California in the mid-1980s and was called " the Night Stalker " because he killed his victims in their beds .
After he was caught and arrested , he met freelance editor Doreen Lioy .
In 1988 , the year he was convicted , he proposed .
They married in the San Quentin visitor waiting room in 1996 .
Ramirez had a choice .
Other women had proposed to him , and today there are a handful of women who regularly maintain contact .
Some of them write to him or visit him , including a 30 - year - old woman from Washington .
The woman , who did not want to be identified by The Chronicle , said most relatives do n't know about her relationship with Ramirez , although her disapproving husband does .
She said she started writing to the Night Stalker - a habit that sometimes exceeded 20 letters a week and frequent visits - because she was fascinated with his case .
" He is good looking and I loved his big hands , " she said of Ramirez .
" The thrill of danger of going up to a state penitentiary made it all worth it because to me it was like a dream come true to face one of the world 's most feared men .
" Like my mom used to say , you can love someone but you do n't have to like them , " she says .
And Ramirez , despite being her " best friend , " deserves to die for his crimes , she said .
The women
Sheila Isenberg , who wrote " Women Who Love Men Who Kill " in 1991 , still hears from women who are mesmerized with murderers .
Some meet the killers through their work as nurses , teachers or social workers .
Others have never met the men .
" We Americans romanticize the guy with the gun , whether he 's good or bad , " Isenberg said .
" Their relationships are predicated on the lack of contact .
The intensity comes from the fact that the men behind bars have all the time to respond to those letters . "
Jack Levin , a professor of Sociology and Criminology at Northeastern University in Boston , said there is little scientific research on the phenomenon of so - called killer groupies .
Some have low self - esteem and get a boost from writing to notorious criminals .
" If they had written to a rock star , they would have been lucky if they had gotten a computer - written postcard , " Levin said .
" Now they even get proposals . "
Others are smart , intelligent and good - looking , he said .
That the groupies even exist may say more about the inmates , Levin explained .
In many cases they are " manipulative , socially screwed sociopaths " who take advantage of the women falling for them .
Another group of women is driven more by charity than fascination .
They befriend death row inmates because they oppose capital punishment and feel that even convicted murderers should have someone with whom to communicate .
A handful of organizations aim to establish pen pal contacts for death row inmates .
Kay Murphy , a spokeswoman for the British group Human Writes , said the organization has 1,300 members , many of whom write to more than one U.S. pen pal .
But romantic relationships only occasionally develop .
" You have to feel sorry for these people as it is always going to end in death , " Murphy said .
Gabi Uhl is a member of the German Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and has had several contacts with U.S. death row inmates .
" I think some of the women writing to prisoners are indeed naive or strange , but that 's the exception rather than the rule , " said Uhl .
" No choirboys "
" You have to be aware of the fact that there are no choirboys in there , " she said .
Uhl , a teacher , traveled to Texas three times to visit convicted murderer Clifford Boggess .
She watched his June 1998 execution at his request .
" From the beginning I was clear about the end , " Uhl says .
" I am glad that I always kept clear of any romantic relationship .
That 's just an emotional roller coaster . "
It ’s been a bit over two weeks since the last WNiER ( “ winner ” ? ) post and in the time since our last visit , Ruby on Rails 2.3.4 was released to fix some reported security issues .
It is important that you try to upgrade your applications as soon as possible , or even just apply the provided patches if a full upgrade is n’t easily accomplished in your situation .
Along with this release , you ’re also going to see several bug fixes and enhancements to the Rails framework , coming from many contributors , that have been discussed here over the previous weeks and even a few that are mentioned just below .
Michael Koziarski posted fixes ( here and here ) for cleaning and verifying multibyte ( unicode ) strings .
The problem was reported by Brian Mastenbrook and Manfred Stienstra provided input for the fix .
These changes should disallow malformed unicode strings from getting past the HTML escaping logic provided by the form helpers .
Coda
Hale reported and also added a patch to Rails , fixing a timing attack vulnerability in ActiveSupport :: MessageVerifier .
Although not likely to be exploited in the wild , the vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge the signatures which encode your application ’s cookie store .
If successfully broken , an attacker could modify their session objects without altering your application to the change .
There have been some issues reported around the Rails 2.3.4 release , specifically with regard to Ruby 1.9 support .
While they have not all yet been fully substantiated , this certainly underscores the importance of having proper test coverage and both a staging and production environment for your applications .
Down to the metal
Yehuda Katz and Carl Lerche put in quite a bit of work around ActionController : : Metal and Rack ’s Middleware , recently .
ActionController :: Metal now acts as a Rack middleware and at the same time , there is a new ActionController : : Middleware class that operates as normal Rack middleware .
And , if that was n’t enough , Yehuda went on to add ActiveModel : : Lint .
ActiveModel :: Lint allows you to determine whether or not an object is compliant with the ActiveModel API , via :
ActiveModel::Compliance.test ( object )
The output is similar to a Test :: Unit output and will indicate with which portions of the ActiveModel API the given object is - or more importantly is not - compliant .
If Metal is your thing , you may want to take a look at Yehuda Katz ’s recent blog post , How to Build Sinatra on Rails 3 .
Pour some sugar on me
Quite a few changes , small and large , occurred around ActiveRecord and friends .
Most of these cleaned up some existing functionality , either making it easier to use , perform more closely to what would be expected , or even adding some new features that will soon feel like old friends .
Taryn East added a little ActiveRecord - like love to ActiveResource .
In this patch , ActiveResource received the familiar first , last , and all shortcut methods for wrapping the basic find method .
Proc and symbol support was added to the validates_numericality _of ActiveRecord validation , by Kane .
For those of you who use the : anchor option when generating URLs , you may notice that after this patch by Jeffrey Hardy , Rails will now execute the to_param method on the object provided as an :anchor .
@post = Post.first @comment = Comment.first post_url ( @post , :anchor => @comment ) # =>
http://www.example.com/posts/1#comment-1
Well , something similar to that , anyway . :)
This updates the : anchor options to follow a similar functionality as the other options provided when generating URLs .
José Valim cleaned up some bits in the Rails scaffold .
The generated new and edit views will now reference a new _form partial .
This is a much DRYer way to go about it , and more closely follows what would likely happen if you were to code it yourself .
Also , while he was there , he removed a bit of inline CSS ( specifically , a green flash message ) , in favor of a CSS class and updating the default scaffold stylesheet .
And , probably the most interesting change in this group is the addition of a new ActivRecord # previous_changes method , by Scott Barr .
previous_changes allows you to see what changed before the last save in your local ActiveRecord object instance .
This is particularly useful when calling after_save methods which might need to know what exactly had changed .
I ’ll let him give you a code sample :
person = Person.find_by_name( ' bob ' ) person.name = ' robert ' person.changes # => {' name ' => [ ' bob , ' robert ' ] } person.
save person.changes # => {} person.previous_changes # => {' name ' => [ ' bob , ' robert ' ] } person .
reload person.previous_changes # => {}
Okay , let ’s do it your way
While a lot of us prefer US English , we ( begrudgingly ) recognize that we are n’t always the center of the universe .
As such , there are some more localization updates to report in Edge Rails :
Sven Fuchs added localization support to the ActiveRecord : : RecordInvalid exception ’s error message .
Then , Akira Matsuda followed Sven with support for localizing the SELECT tag helper ’s prompt text ( the default being , “ Please select ” ) .
Finally , this is certainly a welcome addition and potentially a major player in localization support within Rails : Antonio Tapiador del Dujo added a patch which allows Rails plugins to define and maintain their own locale files .
All that is necessary for the plugin developer to do is to provide a config / locales / directory within their plugin and then create their own .rb or .yml files ( i.e. en.yml ) .
That means that plugins can now be much more responsible for their own localization support and do not have to modify the application ’s locale files after installation .
Food for thought
Finally , just a small note that the default , preferred table collation for MySQL has been changed .
Previously , Rails defaulted to utf8 _general_ci when either the database or the table creation script did not dictate otherwise .
Now , that has been changed to utf8_unicode_ci .
Certainly worth a note with so many Rails applications using MySQL in their back - end .
Update :
Set the attribution of previous_changes to Scott Barr .
Sorry , Scott !
Opening the meetings of various governmental bodies with prayer is inappropriate , exclusionary , and blatantly unconstitutional .
It represents an abuse of power and is a transparent attempt to advance a religious agenda , even if it is only one of pushing some generic god belief .
This practice is even worse than the National Day of Prayer nonsense because government meetings are where important decisions are made .
No person present at such a meeting is prohibited from silently praying ( as the Christian bible would seem to endorse ) , and so there are no viable reasons to formalize prayer by making it part of either the official agenda or a required custom .
Atheists across the U.S. should be prepared to challenge this practice , not to stamp out religion but to separate it from the halls of power .
We could select many reasons why prayer does not belong at government meetings , but the one I 'd like to mention here is the impact of this practice on everyone present who does not believe in whichever gods are being referenced or even to the god concept itself .
Prayer in this context communicates many things , including a clear sense that anyone who lacks god - belief is an outsider to the process .
Government officials , whether they like it or not , are supposed to represent all of us .
It is okay for them to be religious ; it is not okay for them to use their positions to promote their religion or even religiosity in general .
As Austin Cline wrote ( update : link no longer active ) ,
There is ultimately only one reason for such prayers : to have the government endorse , support , promote , and / or encourage the religious beliefs of one group of citizens over and above the beliefs of all other citizens .
Apparently , some religious believers — and they always turn out to be Christians , do n't they ? — are unable or unwilling to keep their religion a matter of personal faith .
Instead , they need for their religion to be sponsored in some way by the government .
He 's right , and that is one of the things the Establishment Clause is supposed to prevent .
Just how widespread is the practice of including prayer at official government meetings ?
From what I have been able to gather , it seems to be far more common than most of us probably realize .
We see it at the federal level in the U.S. Congress itself , at state legislatures across America , and in too many local government meetings to count .
It is pervasive , and too many of our courts have looked the other way .
I suppose that is what privilege buys .
I do not buy the claim that some of our courts have made that these prayers are somehow symbolic and void of any religious significance .
If that was the case , those who insist upon them , would not fight so hard to maintain the practice .
I also reject the claim from some atheists that this is a trivial issue not worthy of our attention .
I 'd agree that it is not the most important issue facing us , but it is a practice that needs to stop and most of us are capable of paying attention to more than one thing .

It 's the biggest offshore wind farm to be project - financed , it 's the first to be financed that way since the credit crisis ( and the third only altogether ) , and it's the first time the European Investment Bank ( a multilateral financial institution , and the EU 's official tool to finance large projects in and around the zone ) is involved in taking project risk in the sector , following the clear push from EU governments over the past year .
This is the transaction I have been working on for over a year and a half and , between my bank 's bailout , the credit crunch or my client 's bankruptcy , it 's been a rather stressful process - and an altogether too busy one , as may have attested my lack of presence on the Oil Drum in recent months .
The deal , one of the most encouraging pointers so far that the worst of the credit crunch may be easing for clean energy , sees the European Investment Bank agree to lend EUR 300 m towards a EUR 482.5 m ( USD 686.4 m ) , 15 - year debt package for Belwind .

Offshore wind finance has been hit particularly hard by the financial crisis , for two separate reasons :
the closure of debt syndication markets has hit all large projects .
Traditionally , large transactions would be negotiated with a small number of banks , which would commit to providing all the debt ( what 's called underwriting the financing ) and then would syndicate the risk , ie share it with a wider group of banks in a second step .
This allowed clients to negotiate with a only a few parties , and to have certainty , once the underwriters committed , to have the funds .
Now , with little or no syndication capacity , banks will only commit to the amounts that they are willing to keep , as they wo n't be able to sell down their share afterwards .
For large transactions ( and offshore wind farms are typically going to cost the better part of a billions euros or more , and debt finance would be expected to cover two thirds or three quarters of that ) , that means you need to bring together a much larger group of banks before signing the deal .
That makes negotiations a lot more complicated , as a lot of parties need to approve any changes , and subject to potential blackmail from banks that know they are indispensable and can dictate their terms ;

That makes negotiations a lot more complicated , as a lot of parties need to approve any changes , and subject to potential blackmail from banks that know they are indispensable and can dictate their terms ; the second problem for offshore wind finance is that it is a new sector of activity .
While wind project finance is now a mature , well - understood , competitive sector to which many banks participate , it is not the case for offshore : only two transactions had been done so far , and thus the universe of banks with understanding of , let alone familiarity with , the associated risks , is still very small .
Now , one of the consequences of the financial crisis is that banks have narrowed their activities - to preferred clients , core countries and strategic sectors , and more generally to well - accepted risks .
Offshore wind is not a strategic sector , and it is largely unknown .
So few banks are able to deliver commitments , even if key clients are now pushing them in that direction .
So an offshore wind farm financing is basically a big pile of unfamiliar risk that needs to be swallowed in many simultaneous small bites by reluctant banks .
: : ::
So how did it happen this time , especially given the unauspicious context and the dire situation of some of the key parties ?
Quite honestly , I 'm still stunned that it actually happened .
I took up a big role , by default , in keeping it alive throughout : the client has excellent engineers , had done all the early work and had the permits to a great project , but with no money and management in chaos , it was not really in a position to keep the project alive on its own .
I never gave up , but at times the odds seemed overwhelming and it took its toll on my morale and energy .
It 's going to take more than a bit of time to stop obsessing about clauses of the financial documentation , or the conflicting conditions imposed by the various parties , and it 's going to be hard to forget the past several months , toiling away day and night in desperate efforts , but at least now I can think it was worth it .
: : ::
A project financing , as I explained in earlier diaries is a stand alone operation that must live without the financial support of its owners once they have put in all the agreed equity .
Which means that all the tasks ( building it , then operating and maintaining it , and selling the power ) must be allocated to the party best able to do them under binding contracts , and the various risks and potential downsides must be similarly allocated clearly to the various parties .
Offshore wind farms ' enjoy ' particular challenges as they must be built in difficult environment ( where do you find a crane able to hoist a 100 ton nacelle 100 meters in the air , and where do you put it when the " ground " you need it to stand on is , well , waves ?
How do you bring people to make even basic repairs when it's a 4 - hour boat trip to get there , and it can only be done when the weather 's not too rough ?
Who carries the burden of lost production in the meantime ? etc... ) .
So the job is first , naturally , to understand the risks and find who can best solve them , then agree on a tentative allocation between the parties , as well as a remuneration for each , and then draft detailed contracts to formalise each party 's role .
The difficult part is that all parties must agree on the same thing at the same time , and to negotiate extraordinarily detailed contracts that must meet the approval of each party 's decision bodies , legal departments and various specialised advisors ( for technical issues , tax , insurance matters , etc ... ) .
In this case , it took coordinating 6 banks ( including a multilateral institutions and two quasi- public bodies ) , 6 equity investors , 2 large contractors and the bankruptcy administrator of the original developer .
At my count , at last 10 different law firms were involved , and last week 's final negotiations probably had 50 people present non stop almost day and night .
Given the difficult circumstances , each participant was basically indispensable to the deal , they all knew it and all too often were tempted into brinkmanship to get a better seat at the table ( always in the name of fitting with internal approvals or following procedures that could not be deviated from ) .
But it happened .
And I like to think that I played a large role in making it happen .
I bullied and pushed and pissed off everybody involved , imposed unpleasant compromises on all , while trying to protect the red lines of each party .
When there 's only a narrow path to survival of the deal , each party needs to focus on its key requirements and move on the rest , and the only way I could see to have a chance to find such key requirements was to be bluntly honest all along - including about one 's own must - haves .
It worked in the end , somehow .
: : ::
And so I helped save a windfarm ( a collapse of the financing this month would have delayed the project by at least another 2 years , could have caused other bankruptcies amongst the participants and would have led in any case to messy recriminations ) .
I helped give a significant , and much needed , boost to the nascent offshore wind project finance market by bringing about a highly visible precedent ( as the article from a specialised project publication quoted above confirms ) .
It brings my bank ( much needed ) good publicity .
It helps , in a small way , to save the planet .
I hope it can give " investment banking " its real meaning back .
I 'm quite proud .
Downright giddy , in fact .
And I very much intend to use that experience to participate to the financing of offshore projects in the US in the very near future .

The power elite are also in the business of creating illusions .
They use their politicians and the mass media to try to create a perception of reality they would like us to see .
I ’m getting very upset by what I ’ve been seeing since this health care issue has come to the fore .
I ’m becoming really angry by how much my intelligence has been insulted .
I ’m beginning to feel like the man who has to explain to his friends that Criss Angel is not really defying the laws of physics .
He ’s in the business of creating illusions .
He does not really float above buildings , pull ladies in half , climb through closed , solid windows without breaking the glass , walk on water , or do any of the things one might see him do .
These are illusions .
They are parlor tricks .
They are elaborate , complicated , well designed , well executed , likely expensive illusions , but they are nothing but illusions nonetheless .
The power elite are also in the business of creating illusions .
They use their politicians and the mass media to try to create a perception of reality they would like us to see .
The illusions they create are elaborate , complicated , well designed , well executed and likely expensive , but they are illusions nonetheless .
The difference between the illusions the power elite create and those of Criss Angel is that Mr. Angel creates his illusions strictly for entertainment purposes , the power elite are creating theirs so that they can control mass consciousness and hence make it easier to control the population in general .
The problem for them is that many people are beginning to realize exactly what ’s been happening .
One of the ways to create a good illusion is to get the audience to look over there while something is happening over here .
Another is to keep things hidden and produce them when you want them seen .
Still another way is to make the audience believe something is n’t what it appears to be , or that something is what it does n’t appear to be .
Or any combination of these things can help produce a good illusion .
Of course , if the audience looks where the action is and detects the slight of hand , or if they see the hidden element before it is produced , or if they are not convinced that something is or is not something else , then the illusion is ruined .

It appears that Microsoft 's glowing track record with Windows 7 is about to come to an abrupt and unceremonious end .
According to various
Web sources , the RTM build 7600.16385 includes a potentially fatal bug that , once triggered , could bring down the entire OS in a matter of seconds .
Bug Details
The bug in question -- a massive memory leak involving the chkdsk.
exe utility -- appears when you attempt to run the program against a secondary ( that is , not the boot partition ) hard disk using the " / r " ( read and verify all file data ) parameter .
The problem affects both 32 - and 64 - bit versions of Windows 7 and is classified as a " showstopper " in that it can cause the OS to crash ( Blue Screen of Death ) as it runs out of physical memory .
[ Read the Test Center review of Windows 7 RTM .
Follow these seven steps to better Windows 7 security . ]
I tested for the bug against three different Windows 7 OS configurations on two different hardware platforms : an Intel Atom - based netbook running the 32 - bit version , an Intel Core 2 Duo notebook running the 64 - bit version , and a VMware Workstation 6.5.2 virtual machine running the 32 - bit version .
What Happens
In each case , the utility executed the first three stages of the test correctly using modest amounts of memory ( several hundred megabytes ) .
Then , when it entered the fourth stage ( a read test ) , the chkdsk.exe utility 's memory consumption started to climb rapidly until several gigabytes had been allocated to its process and the test systems in question began to run out of memory .
Note : I did not succeed in causing the systems to " blue screen " as others have reported .
However , I did observe chkdsk.exe consume up to 90 percent of the available physical memory on a 2GB VMware virtual machine .
After that , the utility appeared to hang while all other operations in the OS slowed to a crawl for lack of RAM .
I also verified that the problem exists with the integrated disk check utility in Windows Explorer .
When you use this function , explorer .
exe starts consuming RAM like it 's going out of style , pushing my test system to 98 percent memory utilization in just a few seconds .
Worse still , explorer .exe failed to release the RAM when I canceled the disk check and grew even more despite the fact that the check was now deliberately aborted .
My only recourse was to either reboot the system or try to manually kill and restart explorer .exe .

High - school seniors tend to hold romantic notions of college life : newfound freedoms , enlightenment , keg - fueled free - for - alls .
But the last attraction has lately achieved a new prominence : at one major university , student visits to the emergency room for alcohol - related treatment have increased by 84 percent in the past three years .
Between 1993 and 2001 , 18 - to - 20 - year - olds showed a 56 percent jump in the rate of heavy - drinking episodes .
Underage drinkers now consume more than 90 percent of their alcohol during binges .
These alarming rates have life - threatening consequences : each year , underage drinking kills some 5,000 young people and contributes to roughly 600,000 injuries and 100,000 cases of sexual assault among college students .
The way our society addresses this problem has been about as effective as a parachute that opens on the second bounce .
Clearly , state laws mandating a minimum drinking age of 21 have n’t eliminated drinking by young adults — they ’ve simply driven it underground , where life and health are at greater risk .
Merely adjusting the legal age up or down does n’t work — we ’ve tried that already and failed .
But federal law has stifled the ability to conceive of more creative solutions in the only place where the Constitution says such debate should happen — in the state house — because any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its federal highway funds .
This is called an “ incentive . ”

Floodwaters have carved out a huge trench across a 25 - acre barley field in County Durham .
The trench - dubbed the Grand Canyon of Durham - measures 24 metres at its widest point , is 4 metres deep and several hundred metres in length .
It appeared at Houghall College , near Durham City , after the area was hit by torrential rain at the weekend .
Laura Bicker reports .
The Adam Smith Institute today urges the next government to rethink policy from first principles .
Its book , Zero Base Policy , will nowhere be more controversial than on narcotics .
It suggests that Britain 's drug policy is " one of the most spectacular failures in history .
Dozens of initiatives spread over many decades have left Britain with more addiction , more drug use , more drug - related crime , and more drug - induced health problems . "
Dealing with drugs costs money .
The Department of Health and the Strategy Unit put the costs of drug use at £ 15 bn - £ 20 bn per year .
Although ministers and police officers have uttered tough phrases such as " zero tolerance " , drug crime has steadily increased , not diminished .
When a policy achieves the opposite of what was intended , rarely is more of it needed .
The ASI urges a different approach , recognising that addicts need medical help , not punishment .
Many who could be helped medically avoid seeking it because drug - taking is illegal .
When drugs were decriminalised in Portugal , drug addicts chose to undertake treatment .
Drug addiction should be viewed as a medical problem .
Doctors and nurses , rather than police , should handle it .
There should be high - street clinics , staffed by medical personnel , where addicts can receive supplies to be consumed on the premises .
Subject to medical examination and counselling , they should receive a free supply to use within the building .
The medical examination required as a condition of supply would enable monitoring of their health , and counselling could help dependent users to better control the adverse physical effects of drug use .
Such a policy would eliminate the crime associated with hard drugs such as heroin .
Users who currently fund their habit by criminal behaviour would not need to , since the supply would be free , costing the state very little .
This would work for some narcotics , but not recreational drugs .
Addicts might take their fix of heroin in a clinic , but not social users of recreational drugs .
Few people would want to enter a high - street clinic to take an ecstasy tablet – this is something used in clubs .
Similarly , few people would want to snort a line of cocaine in clinical and antiseptic conditions .
Neither would people want to smoke cannabis in a clinic .
They would shun the medical conditions envisaged for supervised use .
The cafes in the Netherlands in which cannabis use is tolerated are rather more social and relaxed than medical clinics .
The policy that could succeed would be to medicalise hard drugs , and to legalise the production and sale of recreational drugs such as ecstasy , cocaine and cannabis .
They would no more be without controls than alcohol and tobacco are without controls , but no longer criminal .
The street price would collapse without the need for illegal supply .
Quality could be controlled and subject to regulation and labelling .
Advice could be given on packages warning of associated dangers , and alerting users to the early signs of adverse health effects .
Would their use increase ?
Many people choose not to smoke , even though they could .
They rate the costs and health hazards of smoking higher than any pleasure it brings , and most people are moderate drinkers , even though binge drinking is legal .
The same could be true of drugs .
Drugs are currently out of control and widely available .
Without illegality , the criminal culture they sustain would disappear , creating a far preferable situation .
Top 10 Pound for Pound MMA Fighters in the World 8/15
One month ago I had a lot of debate as to who is the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world .
After UFC 101 , my questions were answered .
Long have I felt Fedor Emelianenko was the best in the world no matter the weight class , but that honor I now give to Anderson Silva following his absolutely flawless win over Forrest Griffin .
The Silva victory combined with Emelianenko opting to sign with Strikeforce puts Silva at No.1 in my book .
When making this list I am considering the fighters as they are today , not as they were five years ago .
Emelianenko looked a little sloppy in his last fight and is now going to have much easier competition as a whole in Strikeforce , whereas Silva and Georges St. Pierre have fought the best and looked impressive doing so .
So , here is my list .
As always , I encourage healthy discussions .
1. Anderson Silva ( 24 - 4 ) – Middleweight / Light Heavyweight – UFC
If you really look at , the Silva vs. Griffin fight was every bit as big as St. Pierre vs.
Penn from a standpoint that you had a champion from one weight class facing a bigger fighter that was one fight removed from being the champion in that weight class as well .
Silva made Griffin look like Glass Joe from Mike Tyson Punch
Out and basically made Griffin quit out of embarrassment ( which has caused me to stop reading Forrest ’s book , as he know seems to look like a hypocrite ) .
After that display , I truly feel that Silva could not only be Light Heavyweight champion , I have serious beliefs that he is the kind of guy that could actually beat a guy like Brock Lesnar .
His accuracy and power while backing up would be a problem for Lesnar in more ways than one .
Brock would n’t be able to get a takedown without eating a solid knee or punch that could put him down .
I know many of you think I am crazy probably , but that is the way I feel .
2. Georges St. Pierre ( 19 - 2 ) – Welterweight – UFC
I used to think GSP could give Silva a fight , but I do n’t feel so good about that now .
If Silva was to move to Light Heavyweight on a permanent basis , I would like to see GSP move up to middleweight for a new set of challenges .
Guys like Mike Swick and Martin Kampmann do n’t seem to present much of a challenge and nobody is going to be excited to see rematches with Jon Fitch or Thiago Alves .
Middleweight could present some intriguing fights and would really test GSP .
3. Fedor Emelianenko ( 30 - 1 -1 ) – Heavyweight – Strikeforce
Well , again this is all about present day and Fedor has n’t done anything as of late to keep his top ranking while guys like Silva and St. Pierre are beating some of the best .
Fedor had no control over what happened with Affliction : Trilogy , but the option to sign with the UFC was there and he turned it down .
He has to know that UFC has better overall talent and hosting an exhibition sparring match with Gegard Mousasi is not going to get me excited .
I think Fedor ’s career is probably the best of anyone , but in terms of best fighter in the world today , I do n’t see him as No. 1 .
4. Lyoto Machida ( 15 -0 ) – Light Heavyweight – UFC
Machida is on his way to building an argument for the No. 1 spot after his quick finishes of Thiago Silva and Rashad Evans .
Machida has a unique style like Anderson Silva that has been hard for opponents to figure out .
Machida vs. A. Silva is the fight people would love to see , but alas , it will not happen as both have stated they wo n’t fight each other due to their close bond .
Machida is another fighter that seems to be able to transcend his weight class and I think could pose a great challenge to the heavyweight division .
5. Brock Lesnar ( 4 - 1 ) – Heavyweight – UFC
People hated the idea of Lesnar being on this list , but which fighter in the heavyweight division has looked better than him in the last couple years .
Lesnar disposed of Randy Couture and Frank Mir and dominated Heath Herring .
His speed , power , and agility are equal to any smaller - weight fighter , but he applies it all to a 285 - pound frame .
Lesnar is still learning but has clearly looked better in his last three fights than other heavyweights like Couture , Mir , Nogueira , CroCop , and Arlovski .
Other up and comers like Shane Carwin , Cain Velasquez , and Brett Rogers still have to sustain wins over big names to surpass Brock .
6. BJ Penn ( 14 - 5 - 1 ) – Lightweight – UFC
Penn showed why he is the best lightweight in the world with his submission win over Kenny Florian at UFC 101 .
Diego Sanchez in up next for Penn , but I still feel the Hawaiian would rather be fighting at 170 , where he thinks he can be the best there too .
Perhaps with a few more wins at 155 , Penn can take another crack at the 170 - pound weight class .
7. Jake Shields ( 23 - 4 -1 ) – Welterweight / Middleweight – Strikeforce
Shields is another fighter that has had success in multiple weight classes , but he is not higher on the list because his competition is not as deep as other fighters .
I think Shields could be a great challenge for St. Pierre in the UFC , but for now he is set at Strikeforce , where the organization seems locked into to making him their marquee fighter .
8. Mike Thomas Brown ( 22 - 4 ) – Featherweight – WEC
Not much new on Brown , but he does have an upcoming fight with Jose Aldo , which may be a tougher fight than his two with Urijah Faber .
Aldo is explosive , but a win for Brown would push him higher up the list .
9. Miguel Angel Torres ( 36 - 2 ) – Bantamweight – WEC
I know many will cry foul here , but I am not going to write off Torres .
His loss to Brian Bowles was clear cut , but Torres had Bowles hurt prior to getting caught .
I still look at Torres and see him as the best 135 - pounder in the world .
Bowles will have a chance to show the win was no fluke in the near future , but for now , I look at this loss like St. Pierre ’s loss to Matt Serra .
We all know then that Serra was not the best in the world , and I do n’t see Bowles as the best yet either .
10 . Rashad Evans ( 13 - 1 -1 ) – Light Heavyweight – UFC
Rampage Jackson held this spot a month ago , but based of Griffin ’s loss at UFC 101 , I think that hurt Jackson ’s stock , as he was unable to really damage Griffin much in their fight last summer .
Evans made shorter work of Griffin and seems to be more of a multi-dimensional fighter than Rampage , who has n’t changed up his game much over the years .
When Evans and Rampage fight in December , that will answer the questions as to who should be in this final spot .
Honorable Mention : Thiago Alves , Rampage Jackson , Dan Henderson , Gegard Mousasi , Jon Fitch , Shinya Aoki , Diego Sanchez
– On a side note , give me Gina Carano in an upset and Mousasi in a quick win at tonight ’s Strikeforce card .
Immer mehr Politiker nutzen Twitter , um ihre Wähler zu erreichen .
Doch das schnelle Medium birgt auch Gefahren .
Was bei der Bundespräsidentenwahl passierte , befürchten viele jetzt auch bei der Bundestagswahl .
Eine Veröffentlichung der Wahlprognosen noch vor Schließung der Wahllokale könnte die ganze Wahl gefährden .
Es ist der 27 .
September 2009 .
Bundestagswahl .
Es ist 16 Uhr. Noch zwei Stunden bevor die Wahllokale schließen .
Ein Blick aufs Handy zeigt die eingegangene Nachricht .
Es ist Twitter .
140 Zeichen mit der ersten Wahlprognose .
Innerhalb von Sekunden erreichen die Zahlen über Twitter Zehntausende .
Zahlen , die eigentlich nur für eine ausgewählte Zahl von Politikern und Journalisten bestimmt sind , die sie frühestens um 18 Uhr - mit Schließung der Wahllokale - veröffentlichen dürfen .
Für den Bundeswahlleiter ist dieser Moment der " GAU " .
Denn nach dem Bundeswahlgesetz ist es verboten , die Prognosen vor Schließung der Wahllokale zu veröffentlichen .
Grund ist die Angst , dass Unentschlossene noch mobilisiert , das Wahlergebnis so verfälscht und der Bundestag am Ende nicht mehr demokratisch legitimiert sein könnte .
Die Wahl könnte angefochten werden , im Ernstfall müssten die Wähler noch einmal an die Urnen .
Spätestens seit der Bundespräsidentenwahl scheint diese Angst real .
Als Horst Köhler am 23 .
Mai zum Bundespräsidenten wieder gewählt wurde , war das Abstimmungsergebnis schon Minuten vor der offiziellen Verkündung bekannt - getwittert von der CDU - Bundestagsabgeordneten Julia Klöckner und dem SPD - Politiker Ulrich Kelber .
Auch die ersten Prognosen zur Europawahl waren für die Twittergemeinde schon vor der offiziellen Bekanntgabe kein Geheimnis mehr .
Dieses Mal kam die Nachricht von einem Journalisten .
Die Gefahr , dass Wahlprognosen vorab an die Öffentlichkeit kommen , ist nicht neu .
Neu ist die Technik , mit der Informationen in Sekunden Zehntausende erreichen können .
Seit April haben sich die Nutzerzahlen bei Twitter mindestens verdoppelt .
Schätzungen gehen davon aus , dass rund 80.000 Deutsche twittern , darunter ca. 100 Bundestagsabgeordnete .
In den Parteien wurde deswegen diskutiert , ob es für die Bundestagswahl Sicherheitsvorkehrungen geben muss .
Der SPD - Innenexperte Dieter Wiefelspütz dachte offen über „ ein Verbot der Wählerbefragungen “ nach .
Die stellvertretende CSU - Generalsekretärin Dorothee Bär forderte , alle Eingeweihten auf einen „ Kodex des Stillschweigens zu verpflichten “ .
Ulrich Kelber selber ist sich heute sicher , dass niemand auf die Idee kommt , die Prognosen vorab zu twittern .
Das Gesetz werde jeden davon abhalten , sich ordnungswidrig zu verhalten .
Nach dem Bundeswahlgesetz kann die Vorabveröffentlichung mit bis zu 50.000 Euro bestraft werden .
Auch Kristina Köhler von der CDU , die selbst viel twittert , ist optimistisch .
" Natürlich kann man nicht ausschließen , dass jemand die Wahlprognosen twittert .
Aber jeder ist sich bewusst , dass er danach so enorm in der Kritik stünde , dass allein das einen gewissen Schutz bietet . "
Mark Seibert , der bei den Linken für die Online - Kampagne zuständig ist , sieht das anders : " Vermutlich wird jemand der Versuchung nicht widerstehen können , exklusive Nachrichten vorab zu twittern . "
Zehn Minuten Berühmtheit in der Twitter - Community könnten seiner Meinung nach für einige wichtiger sein , als das Versprechen stillzuschweigen .
Auch Internet - und Twitter - Kenner sind pessimistisch .
" Ich würde darauf wetten , dass die Exit Polls vorab bekannt werden .
Wenn nicht über Twitter , dann über Facebook oder sonst ein Netzwerk " , sagt Klas Roggenkamp , der Entwickler der Seite wahl.de .
Nur ein paar Zahlen unterm Tisch heimlich ins Handy getippt sollen ausreichen , um den Wahltag durcheinander zu bringen ?
Die Chance für eine mit dem Wahlausgang unzufriedene Partei , noch einmal abstimmen zu lassen ?
Der Chef von Infratest - dimap , Richard Hilmer , ist nicht sonderlich beunruhigt .
Schließlich seien es nur eine Handvoll Leute , die die Wahlprognosen vorab bekämen , und die wüssten um ihre Verantwortung .
Trotzdem will Hilmer " die Schotten dieses Mal noch etwas dichter machen " .
Auch Juristen raten zur Gelassenheit .
Selbst wenn die Wahlprognosen vorab an die Öffentlichkeit geraten sei es extrem unwahrscheinlich , dass ein Gericht die Wahl für ungültig erklären würde .
" Für die Anfechtung der Wahl braucht man den Nachweis , dass der Bundestag nicht mehr demokratisch legitimiert ist " , erklärt der Fachanwalt für Strafrecht und Inhaber des " law blog " , Udo Vetter .
Dafür reiche die Twitteröffentlichkeit nicht aus , auch weil die Anzahl der Twitternutzer insgesamt in Deutschland noch relativ klein ist .
Ginge es nach Vetter , könnte man das Verbot der Vorabveröffentlichung einfach aus dem Bundeswahlgesetz streichen : " Vielleicht könnten Nichtwähler noch zu Wählern werden , wenn die Prognosen vorab allen bekannt gegeben würden . "
Jens Seipenbusch , Bundesvorsitzender der Piratenpartei , will lieber die Wählerbefragungen am Wahltag verbieten .
Denn sie seien das Problem , nicht Twitter .
Kristina Köhler hält ein Verbot der Exit Polls für Unsinn .
Und auch , wenn sie keine Angst vor Twitter am Wahltag hat – aus Sicherheitsgründen wird sie kurz vorher alle Passwörter ändern , um sicher zu gehen , dass niemand ihren Account missbraucht , um in ihrem Namen ein ( vermeintliches ) Ergebnis zu veröffentlichen .

Take The World 's Fastest IQ Test
Click on a frog and try to move all the frogs to the opposite side ?
( Newser ) – A steady stream of over - 35s have been joining the Army since the age limit was raised to 42 , and both sides have had plenty of adjusting to do , the New York Times reports in a look at the 3,800 older recruits , whose numbers , though small , have surged this year along with the rise in unemployment .
Basic training can be tough on their creaky joints , but commanders see them as more committed than their teenage cohorts , and often expect them to be unofficial disciplinarians .
Younger soldiers make it though basic training at a somewhat higher rate , but many older recruits successfully learn to deal with the rigors of training , the absences from their families — and with being called " Gramps . "
" I 've just tried to keep my head down , keep my mouth shut and not wring necks , " said one 38 - year - old recruit , who has gotten used to doing push - ups and being chewed out by drill sergeants in their early 20s .

" With an expansive code library that works with all major television manufacturers such as Samsung , Sony and Sharp "
Universal remotes allow you to control a whole host of different devices with one controller .
From TVs and sound systems to cable boxes and streaming devices , we have a lot of technology to keep track of .
Maybe you ’ve started putting all those remotes in a box , or maybe they ’re slowly covering your coffee table — why not just replace them with a single controller ?
When buying a universal remote , it ’s important to consider features like device compatibility , smart home support , and the ability to create custom device configurations and combinations of settings .
We ’ve researched and tested the best universal remotes from different brands and price brackets to find most ideal options available .
The Sofabaton U1 is a cheaper alternative to a lot of the expensive remotes on this list .
But it does make some compromises .
For example , it only works with infrared and Bluetooth devices .
This includes most TVs , sound systems , and gaming systems , but does not include Wi-Fi connected devices like the Roku streaming stick and the PlayStation 4 .
Before you buy this remote , it ’s important to check the manufacturer 's specifications to make sure your devices are compatible .
If you ’ve ever owned a universal remote , you know that setting it up can be one of the most frustrating steps .
The Sofabaton U1 is our pick for best setup because it actually streamlines this process .
Instead of entering a bunch of device codes and struggling to pair your remote , you simply download the Sofabaton companion app and connect your devices from there in a matter of minutes .
This remote is compatible with hundreds of thousands of devices and that list continues to grow .
With a comfortable ergonomic design , the Logitech Harmony 700 reduces the need for multiple remote controls while working with six different devices simultaneously .
The 23 programmable channel icons for selecting your favorite stations makes it simple to rapidly find your favorite channels .
Past programming , the backlit controls allow for easy nighttime remote navigation that ’s powered by AA batteries for months of activity before requiring replacement .
All totaled , the Harmony 700 works with more than 225,000 devices from 5,000 plus brands ( and more are always being added ) .
Updating with new brands and devices is easily done through a connection to both PC and Mac computers and , while it wo n’t connect to smart home appliances , the Harmony 700 is an easy to use remote that wo n’t break the bank .
Another advantage to the screen : it includes step - by - step troubleshooting help .
If you have a problem , you can follow instructions right on the Harmony 665 to resolve it .
In terms of customizability and user - friendliness , this remote is hard to beat .
If you have lots of devices from lots of different brands , you ’ll want one universal remote that can rule them all .
The Logitech Harmony 665 is compatible with a growing list of over 6,000 brands , which means it works with more than 270,000 different devices .
From TVs to audio systems to gaming consoles and more .
This remote is also great for saving your favorite channels and device configurations .
There are buttons at the top for “ Watch TV ” or “ Watch a Movie ” that automatically change your input and switch to your preferred settings for that activity , i.e. changing over to your streaming device and turning on your soundbar .
You can also create shortcuts to your favorite channels and easily access them from the remote ’s screen .
Available in a multitude of colors , the GE 33709 four - device universal remote is so budget - friendly you might just want to purchase it as an extra remote around the house .
It can control up to four different audio and video components , including TVs , Blu-ray and DVD players , as well as streaming media players and soundbars .
The expansive code library works with all major television manufacturers such as Samsung , Sony and Sharp .
Powered by two AAA batteries , the GE can work for months on end before requiring battery replacement .
Furthermore , the inclusion of features such as master volume control allows the GE to control the volume on every device that ’s connected to the remote .
One last highlight are the multicolored A , B , C and D buttons that let you easily access hardware favorites .
Controlling a total of eight devices , the Logitech Harmony Companion universal remote is a top pick for buyers looking to add monitoring of smart devices , too .
Our reviewer did n't like its lacks a touchscreen or backlit buttons , however , the Harmony Companion does include Amazon Alexa certification .
Beyond Alexa , the Harmony Companion works fantastically with other smart home devices such as Philip ’s Hue lighting or Nest ’s learning thermostat .
The included Harmony Hub allows for even more device control , including those gadgets hidden between cabinet doors or walls ( read : video game consoles ) .
After a simple setup on the computer , the Harmony Companion is ready to work with more than 270,000 devices , including Apple TV , Roku and Sonos audio players .
" The Inteset 422 - 3 is a bargain at $ 27 , especially compared with more expensive smart remotes on the market . " — Yoona Wagener , Product Tester
When it comes to connecting directly to the television itself , the Inteset features a worldwide database of device codes for connecting to all the top television manufacturers by completely replacing their default remote controls .
Our reviewer especially liked how easy it was to program different commands with one button .
Inteset takes its unique feature set up another level with macro programming that allows you to program up to 32 commands to a single button , so you can turn on / off all devices , switch inputs or change to a favorite channel .
Pre-programmed right out of the box for Apple TV , Xbox One , Media Center and Roku , the Inteset INT - 422 four - in - one universal remote is well worth a look .
While streaming is the Inteset ’s claim to fame , added features such as volume and channel lock allow an added layer of security from children , roommates or spouses who might want to change things around .
" If you ’re okay with not having a touchscreen and spending some dedicated time to programming this device , it could be exactly what you ’ve been looking for . " — Yoona Wagener , Product Tester
Gone are the days of irritating on - TV keyboards .
Instead , voice control is handled directly from your smartphone or tablet and speech recognition will help find your content faster .
Beyond voice control , the Harmony excels at working with devices that are hidden in closed cabinets through its IR ( infrared ) and Bluetooth connectivity .
Our tester did point out however , that while overall performance and software was good , it was n't always consistent .
Featuring control of up to eight devices , the Logitech Harmony smart control works with over 270,000 devices from 6,000 brands , including cable TV boxes , Apple TV and Roku .
The connectivity does n’t stop there since the Harmony Smart offers a smartphone app for both Android and iOS that offers up to 50 favorite channel icons , volume control and media playback .
" Once we cleared the initial connectivity and setup hurdles , we experienced generally fast and responsive performance from the Harmony Elite . " — Yoona Wagener , Product Tester
Options such as “ one touch activity ” allows for automatic power on and switching to the right devices with the right settings .
Additionally , features such as closed cabinet control let the Harmony Hub assist in controlling devices that are stored behind closed doors in cabinets .
The Harmony smartphone app ( Android and iOS ) doubles as a separate universal remote , which is convenient in case you are charging the Harmony Elite in its charging station .
While the pricing might turn some potential buyers away , if you want the most feature - rich universal remote on the market , the Harmony Elite is the one to own .
For most people , the very best universal remote is the Logitech Harmony Elite and , while it may be the most expensive , it ’s well worth the price .
Essentially , the Harmony Elite connects to a base station that is connected to your entertainment console , which allows the use of the remote anywhere in your home ( even without direct line of sight ) .
Our reviewer was able to use it with Amazon ’s Alexa devices , and there ’s full voice control for up to 15 home entertainment and connected home devices .
The full - color touchscreen allows easy swipe and tap for control of volume , movies , 50 favorite channels and even smart home devices such as LED lighting for automatic dimming when a movie starts .
Final Verdict
If you 're someone with tons of smart home devices , TVs , air conditioners , and other appliances at home , the Logitech Harmony Elite will best suit your lifestyle .
It offers compatibility with Alexa and Google Assistant for voice commands , can work with up to 15 connected devices , and works with devices outside of line of sight .
If you want the same features for a lower price and with support for a smartphone app , the Logitech Harmony is a good choice .
It can support up to 8 devices , is slim and lightweight , and can work with the Harmony app and Hub .

What to Look for When Buying a Universal Remote
﻿ Compatibility - Before purchasing any piece of technology , it ’s essential to make sure that it ’ll work with the gadgets you already have at home .
Some remotes offer built - in controls for services such as Netflix , others only have a general control layout , and some wo n’t work at all .
Be sure to check your remote ’s compatibility before making a purchase .
Automation -
The majority of universal remotes you find will merely allow you to switch between controlling different devices , but some solutions such as Logitech ’s Harmony lineup offer automation .
Just hit a single button to turn on your TV and receiver , switch to the correct input , and even dim the lights .
﻿ Smart home support - Going beyond standard automation , some universal remotes are beginning to support virtual assistants such as Google Home and Amazon Echo .
If you wish to tune to your favorite game on ESPN or launch a game on your PlayStation with the command of your voice , be sure to look for a remote that supports smart home devices .
Every game has a PR campaign behind it , ranging from videos and screenshots to interviews , demos , and free items given out to those who write about games .
Some are better than others , but EA has given its campaign for Dante 's Inferno a hellish tint , and the results have been both controversial , and highly effective .
The first showpiece took place at E3 , where a number of " Christian " protesters showed up holding signs telling showgoers to trade their PlayStations in for " Pray Stations " and other catchy slogans .
Our favorite ?
" EA = Electronic Anti-Christ . "
A few gaming blogs ran the story of Christians upset over the content of the game , but it was quickly revealed EA had in fact staged the protest via a viral marketing agency .
The gaming press rolled its collective eyes , but Christian bloggers were n't amused .
" The institutional acknowledgement that these kinds of protests are the best possible publicity for their target is something Christians might want to bear in mind when the next Dan Brown film rolls around , " Margaret Cabaniss of InsideCatholic.com wrote .
CatholicVideoGamers was likewise indignant .
" Gamers of all varieties will buy this product if it's , well , actually a good game , " they explained .
" So instead of engaging in a shamelessly anti-Christian stunt to promote your poor excuse of a product , maybe you ought to work on making this game , you know , something better than a blatant God of War rip - off and make it , ya know , something worthwhile ? "
Please harass our booth babes
It gets even better .
During Comic - Con , EA ran a contest where show attendees were invited to " commit acts of lust " by taking a picture with one of their booth babes .
The best image will be rewarded by a " date " with two models , a limo , and an awkward night of strained conversation .
When our coverage of the story hit Twitter , the meme #EAFail was born , and the response was swift and negative .
" You lost a customer who was actually excited about the game , " one woman complained .
" Next time , no objectifying women . "
Destructoid had similar thoughts .
" ... there ’s something repulsive about offering people up as prizes in your PR stunt , especially given game culture ’s bad habit of over - sexualizing its female characters , " they wrote .
In an ironic twist , a writer from GayGamer was " randomly " chosen as a winner after sending in an image standing next to a male booth " babe . "
He confronted EA in a long letter on the site .
" I think the contest was somewhat sexist , misogynist , and exploitive , especially since you were sending fans upon ANY booth babe at SDCC ; however , as a gay man , I also saw this PR stunt as missed opportunity that resulted in what appears to be a narrow minded view as to what your game 's audience can truly be , " he wrote .
" While I 'm not sure if it was intentional or not , this stunt projected a view of your target demographic as lustful heterosexual males , when in reality a larger and larger portion of the gaming population are women and LGBT people . "
He also points out that the rules meant that anyone was fair game .
" I know booth babes ( and guys ) get paid to man those booths and deal with gawkers , but there are also PR , production , and development people at those booths caught in the crossfire of dealing with people trying to do ' acts of lust ' with them to win your contest . "
Even more ironically , this occurred just as EA held an event with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , where the publisher argued that the industry needed to escape the image of its audience as a boy 's club of adolescent males .
Saying the industry needed to be more friendly to a wider audience while creating a contest the rewarded men panting over models is something of a mixed message .
The easiest path to coverage : payment
In the latest chapter of this fun tale , EA has finally decided to simply send editors of prominent gaming sites checks for $ 200 .
The point ?
If the checks are cashed , the gaming press is greedy .
If they 're not , the gaming press is wasteful .
" By cashing this check you succumb to avarice by harding filthy lucre , but by not cashing it , you waste it , and thereby surrender to prodigality .
Make your choice and suffer the consequence for your sin , " the included note stated .
" And scoff not , for consequences are imminent . "
The sin theme remains , if nothing else , on - topic .
This has to be one of the first times money has been sent directly to reviewers and editors with the hope that the story is broken publicly , and that 's what makes the stunt so devious ; of course it 's going to be written about .
Joystiq cashed the check and donated the money to charity , Kotaku posted video of their check burning .
Without having a list of sites that received the faux bribe , it 's impossible to tell if anyone actually cashed the check and kept the money .
Cheapy D , who runs the popular deals site CheapAssGamer , weighed in on the check .
" Kotaku charges an $ 8 CPM ( cost per 1,000 banner impressions ) for their standard advertising banners .
Their news post about this PR stunt will likely surpass 40,000 views , " he explained .
" To err on the safe side , let 's say the total cost of the check and fancy box is $ 300 .
Since [ the post 's author ] burned the check , EA basically spent the equivalent of a $ 2.50 CPM for a front page news post on Kotaku .
That is an incredible value .
Nice job , EA Marketing ! "
In a final twist , some commenters on the Kotaku story pointed out the site could have also donated the money to charity , or auctioned off the check and donated the proceeds .
" Instead , you disavowed Greed and instead took on Pride , yet another just as evil sin , and wasted the opportunity to help others , " one reader wrote .
EA may have been more clever than we had at first assumed .
Kyle Orland , staff writer for Crispy Gamer , seemed disgusted by the stunt .
" The line between ' clever promotion ' and ' blatant journalist bribery ' has officially been crossed , " he wrote on his Twitter feed .
" Congrats , EA . "
Of course , the plan is working
Like a reality show contestant , EA is n't here to make friends ... it just wants to be talked about .
The reaction to these stunts and promotions have have been overwhelmingly negative , but they 're being written up , discussed , and the game 's theme of hellish temptations is being preserved .
Outraged Christian bloggers , complaining female and LGBT gamers , editors being sent checks made out directly to them — all of this makes for delicious copy , and much of the gnashing of teeth seems to be centered on the fact that the gaming press continues to fall for the contrived controversy to give the company exactly what it wants : coverage .
The campaign has been childish , daring , and borderline tasteless .
Writing checks directly to game writers is cheaper than advertising on a site , with a much better result .
No matter how upset a few groups may get , this has been a successful way to market the game ; we 're very much aware we 're falling into the trap ourselves .
The question is a simple one : are we sinking to EA 's level , or is it the other way around ?
Congress and the Obama administration are now putting together an education bill that tries to deal with the problem .
It would cancel about $ 9 billion in annual government subsidies for banks that lend to college students and use much of the money to increase financial aid .
A small portion of the money would be set aside for promising pilot programs aimed at lifting the number of college graduates .
All in all , the bill would help .
But it wo n’t solve the system ’s biggest problems  the focus on enrollment rather than completion , the fact that colleges are not held to account for their failures .
“ Crossing the Finish Line ” makes it clear that we can do better .

The first problem that Mr. Bowen , Mr. McPherson and the book ’s third author , Matthew Chingos , a doctoral candidate , diagnose is something they call under - matching .
It refers to students who choose not to attend the best college they can get into .
They instead go to a less selective one , perhaps one that ’s closer to home or , given the torturous financial aid process , less expensive .
About half of low - income students with a high school grade - point average of at least 3.5 and an SAT score of at least 1,200 do not attend the best college they could have .
Many do n’t even apply .
Some apply but do n’t enroll .
“ I was really astonished by the degree to which presumptively well - qualified students from poor families under- matched , ” Mr. Bowen told me .
They could have been admitted to Michigan ’s Ann Arbor campus ( graduation rate : 88 percent , according to College Results Online ) or Michigan State ( 74 percent ) , but they went , say , to Eastern Michigan ( 39 percent ) or Western Michigan ( 54 percent ) .
If they graduate , it would be hard to get upset about their choice .
But large numbers do not .
You can see that in the chart with this column .
In effect , well - off students  many of whom will graduate no matter where they go  attend the colleges that do the best job of producing graduates .
These are the places where many students live on campus ( which raises graduation rates ) and graduation is the norm .
Meanwhile , lower - income students  even when they are better qualified  often go to colleges that excel in producing dropouts .
“ It ’s really a waste , ” Mr. Bowen says , “ and a big problem for the country . ”
As the authors point out , the only way to lift the college graduation rate significantly is to lift it among poor and working - class students .
Instead , it appears to have fallen somewhat since the 1970s .
U.S. Dollar Entering Free Fall Crash Territory
Martin ’s off this week .
So I ’m writing you today from Asia with a passionate plea to our country — to its citizens and especially to our leaders in Washington .
We are now the laughing stock of Asia .
Our dollars are no longer respected ; our ambitions , no longer mimicked .
Our way of life , often based on consuming far beyond our means , is being flat - out rejected .
I ca n’t even exchange a $ 100 bill on the street here anymore :
Most of the street money changers will take euros , Singapore dollars , even Chinese yuan .
But fearful of losing their shirt with sinking exchange rates , they do n’t want U.S. dollars .
Not long ago , I never traveled without my American Express card .
Now , it sits in my office safe .
Many in Asia no longer accept the card anymore .
MasterCard and Visa are still OK , but they ’re also losing market share to locally grown cards like Aeon .
The running joke in Singapore , Hong Kong , Bangkok , and Kuala Lumpur is that the U.S. is the place where even your pet could get a credit card or a home mortgage .
So to Asians , the crisis we ’re going through is our own fault .
And although it was also caused by blunders in Western Europe and other regions , truth be told , they are mostly right .
The message is clear :
We need to immediately stop living beyond our means .
But can we ?
Consider the facts :
Through August , the federal deficit has already hit $ 1.38 trillion , or TRIPLE last year ’s all - time record deficit of $ 454.8 billion .
And in September alone , the administration expects another $ 200 billion in red ink , bringing the total for the year to $ 1.58 trillion .
The U.S. government ’s official debt is now at an all - time high of $ 11.8 trillion .
That ’s over $ 100,000 for each and every household in America .
Both the administration and its opponents agree that , over the next 10 years , the cumulative federal deficit will be another $ 9 trillion , bringing the burden per household up to $ 177,000 .
The Federal Reserve is also in hock up to its eyeballs , with more than $ 2 trillion in liabilities on its balance sheet .
That brings the total burden up to $ 194,000 per household .
Perhaps worst of all , the unfunded government IOUs that are now starting to come due on Social Security , Medicare , and Federal pension payments are also ballooning higher and now stand at an estimated $ 104 trillion , or $ 886,000 per household .
Grand total : Each and every household in America is indirectly responsible for a debt burden of over 1 MILLION DOLLARS !
Bottom line :
Even assuming they can save 5 percent of their income year after year … and even assuming every single penny of their savings is thrown into the pot … in order to pay off the U.S. government ’s debts and obligations , each American family — and descendents — would have to toil for the next 429 years .
Problem is , we have n’t borrowed all that money from ourselves .
We ’ve borrowed more than half of the outstanding national debt from overseas investors , who now fund fully 50 percent of our debt addiction .
But now …
America ’s foreign creditors are haunted by the spectacle of Washington ’s spending binge and are starting to recoil in horror .
That ’s why in April , U.S. bond purchases by foreign central banks plunged 41 percent from the month before , while purchases by foreign private investors dropped 7 percent .
All in a single month !
Yet even as investors flee in increasing numbers , our government continues to ramp up spending — trying to hawk even more U.S. debt to foreign lenders .
The Obama administration largely ignores the fact that overseas investors are getting tired of footing the bill for our borrow - and - spend addiction … and are also becoming increasingly skeptical of our ability to pay our debts .
The result : More foreign central banks , overseas fund managers , and investors flee , leaving the U.S. government with no choice but to pump out more and more unbacked paper dollars and dump them into the economy — further eroding their value .
Central banks over the last year have been actively replacing portions of their dollar reserves with the euro , the Canadian and Australian dollars … and gold .
China alone recently announced it has quietly increased its gold reserves by more than 75 percent over the last seven years .
So it should come as no surprise that the widely watched U.S. Dollar Index , a measure of the dollar ’s performance against a basket of six of the world ’s major currencies , has plunged 15.1 percent since its high of March 4 .
As you can see from the accompanying chart , that now puts the greenback in free - fall territory .
It ’s plunging against the euro , the Japanese yen , the British pound , the Swiss franc , the Canadian dollar .
It ’s even sliding against the currencies of lesser - developed economies like the Thai baht , the Philippine peso , the Indian rupee , the Malaysian ringgit , the Indonesian rupiah , and the Vietnamese dong .
And it leaves …
The U.S. and All Americans Between a Rock and a Hard Place
Either …
U.S. consumers and the U.S. government must slash spending drastically , accepting a deeper economic decline or …
They will perpetuate the borrow - and - spend cycle , destroying the U.S. dollar and , ultimately , our standard of living .
I ’d like to hear your thoughts on how we might get out from under this mess we find ourselves in — and , more importantly , what YOU are doing to protect yourself , your family , and your retirement from the dollar ’s demise .

Rendering particles in realtime with py-lepton
Last Update : 24.09.2009 .
By azarai in game development | pyglet | python
Last time i made a small demo using prerendered particle effects .
Today i’ll show another way of doing particle effects with python and pyglet .
Instead of animating prerendered graphics i am going to use a particle system to create effects in realtime .
The one i am using is [ py - lepton ] ( http://code.google.com/p/py-lepton/
“ link to py - lepton site ” ) :
Lepton : A high - performance , pluggable particle engine and API for Python
Lepton is designed to make complex and beautiful particle effects possible , and even easy from Python programs .
Here is the demo of a simple explosion effect without using any premade texture .
I made comments in the code that should explain everything .
The video :
Controls :
Left Mouse click : spawn new effect at center of the window
The Code :
from lepton import Particle , ParticleGroup , default_system from lepton .
renderer import BillboardRenderer , PointRenderer from lepton .
texturizer import SpriteTexturizer , create_point_texture from lepton .emitter import StaticEmitter from lepton.controller import Gravity , Lifetime , Movement , Fader , ColorBlender , Growth import pyglet from pyglet.gl import * # create pyglet window window = pyglet .
window .
Window ( visible = False ) window .
clear ( ) #enable alpha blending glEnable ( GL_BLEND ) glBlendFunc ( GL_SRC_ALPHA , GL_ONE ) def get_color ( r , g , b , a ) : " " " converts rgba values of 0 - 255 to the equivalent in 0 - 1 " " " return ( r / 255.0 , g / 255.0 , b / 255.0 , a / 255.0 ) # Setting up particle group for all explosion particles with some controllers # ColorBlending is from white to yellow to red / orange #
For visuals us a Pointtexture generated by py-lepton explosion = ParticleGroup ( controllers = [ Lifetime ( 4 ) , Movement ( damping = 0.93 ) , Growth ( 30 ) , Fader ( fade_in_start = 0 , start_alpha = 0 , fade_in_end = 0.5 , max_alpha = 0.4 , fade_out_start = 1 , fade_out_end = 4.0 ) , ColorBlender ( [( 0 , get_color ( 255 , 255 , 255 , 255 ) ) , ( 0.75 , get_color ( 255 , 255 , 0 , 255 ) ) , ( 1.5 , get_color ( 255 , 0 , 0 , 255 ) ) ] ) ] , renderer = PointRenderer ( 64 , SpriteTexturizer ( create_point_texture ( 64 , 5 ) ) ) ) #
The explosion emitter , the thing actually creating the particles # each particle starts at window center and add some variation ( start position , size and # life time ) explosion_emitter = StaticEmitter ( template = Particle ( position = ( window .
width / 2 , window .
height / 2 , 0 ) , size = ( 20 , 20 , 0 ) , ) , deviation = Particle ( position = ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) , size = ( 10 , 10 , 0 ) , velocity = ( 100 , 100 , 0 ) , age = 2 ) , ) # if left mouse button is clicked a new explosion will be started @window .
event def on_mouse_press ( x , y , button , modifiers ) : if ( pyglet .
window .

emit ( 400 , explosion ) # clear screen and draw particles @window. event def on_draw ( ) : window .
clear ( ) default_system . draw ( ) # setup scheduler for particle updates and start pyglet if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : window .

clock .
schedule_interval ( default_system .

set_fps_limit ( None ) pyglet . app . run ()
Now spice up the explosion without using any premade texture and share it .
Happy hacking :-)

When have TV aliens been more popular than magic ?
Do shows featuring time travel fare better than those about space exploration ?
We chart the popularity of television 's most common themes , and see how scifi television has changed since 1970 .
Advertisement
We looked at over 300 science fiction and fantasy television shows from 1970 , the year after the original Star Trek series ended , to the present .
In this chart , we list a few of the most iconic shows , but those are just a sampling of the hundreds we surveyed .
Advertisement
Then we looked at which shows on the air in any given year featured any one of the most common science - fiction themes : aliens , space travel , robots , time travel , and magic .
( Shows that contain multiple themes were counted once in each category , so Star Trek : The Next Generation would add one point each to aliens , space travel , robots and time travel . )
One thing the graph tells us is that the popularity of the different themes are increasingly linked as time goes on .
Space travel and aliens are closely linked throughout the graph , since shows about space travel almost always include aliens , but as the graph transitions from the 1970s into the 1980s , shows with robots are increasingly linked to shows with aliens .
This is in part because the more recent shows featuring robots and more recent shows featuring aliens are more likely to be one and the same , whereas in the 1970s , shows like Batman and The Bionic Woman would feature artificial intelligence but not extraterrestrials .
But it 's interesting to note the way magic trends as well .
In 1970 , the gap between shows featuring magic and shows featuring more science - based themes is fairly wide , which may be related to the relative cost of producing the different types of shows ; Captain Kirk required pricey sets and a makeup crew while Samantha Stevens just needed a film editor and the ability to wiggle her nose .
But as audience expectations for shows involving magic become analogous to their expectations for science fiction shows , magic 's peaks and valleys start to correspond to those of other themes , though supernatural shows may be a bit more resilient to overall drops in television spending .
Advertisement
The time - travel line is especially interesting , less for what it indicates about the popularity of time travel than for what it says about the variety of stories being told .
Although time travel is sometimes the focus of a show ( as in Quantum Leap or Seven Days ) , it more frequently appears in a handful of episodes of a show that tells a diverse set of science fiction or fantasy stories .
Shows like the various Star Trek series , Lois and Clark , and even Xena feature the occasional obligatory time travel episode .
But the graph 's most striking feature is the boom all the themes apparently experienced in the 1990s , and which now seems to be on the decline .
It seems to suggest a huge investment in genre television shows ( and perhaps in television in general ) that we simply are n't seeing any more .

Interestingly , space travel shows were the first to go as circumstances changed , and although shows about managed to hang on longer , they , too are on their way out .
Does this indicate that science fiction and fantasy shows are on the decline ?
Or does it represent a shift to less expensive , near - future science fiction with different speculative priorities , shows like Dollhouse , Chuck , and Fringe ?
Here is a full list of all the shows we surveyed to create this chart .

Reducing carbon emissions remains the prime solution , the authors write A UK Royal Society study has concluded that many engineering proposals to reduce the impact of climate change are " technically possible " .
Such approaches could be effective , the authors said in their report .
But they also stressed that the potential of geo-engineering should not divert governments away from their efforts to reduce carbon emissions .
Suggestions range from having giant mirrors in space to erecting giant CO2 scrubbers that would " clean " the air .
Such engineering projects could either remove carbon dioxide or reflect the Sun 's rays away from the planet .
Geo-engineering and its consequences are the price we may have to pay for failure to act on climate change
Professor John Shepherd , University of Southampton
Blog : Plan B for Planet Earth Ambitious as these schemes seem , the report concluded that many of them potentially had merit , and research into them should be pursued .
The authors stated , however , that some of the technology was barely formed and there were " major uncertainties regarding its effectiveness , costs and environmental impacts " .
One of the technologies considered " too risky " was pouring iron filings into the ocean to grow algae which , the authors said , could cause " substantial damage " to marine life and freshwater , estuary and coastal ecosystems .
Buying time
The study stressed that engineering approaches would only have a limited impact , and that efforts should continue to be focused on reducing CO2 emissions .
" ( Governments ) should make increased efforts toward mitigating and adapting to climate change and in particular agreeing to global emissions reductions of at least 50 % on 1990 levels by 2050 and more thereafter , " the authors wrote .
But , they continued , there should be " further research and development " into geo-engineering options " to investigate whether low - risk methods can be made available if it becomes necessary to reduce the rate of warming this century " .
Injecting sea salt into the clouds could cool the planet
Of the two basic geo-engineering approaches , the report concluded that those involving the removal of carbon dioxide were preferable , as they effectively return the climate system closer to its pre-industrial state .
But the authors found that many of these options were currently too expensive to implement widely .
This included " carbon capture and storage " methods , which require CO2 be captured directly from power plants and stored under the Earth 's surface .
Current proposed methods also work very slowly , taking many decades to remove enough carbon dioxide to significantly reduce the rate of temperature rise .
Of the carbon removal techniques assessed , three were considered to have most potential : 1 . CO2 capture from ambient air :
This would be the preferred method , as it effectively reverses the cause of climate change .
2 . Enhanced weathering :
This aims to enhance natural reactions of CO2 from the air with rocks and minerals .
It was identified as a prospective longer - term option .
3 . Land use and afforestation :
The report found that land - use management could and should play a small but significant role in reducing the growth of atmospheric CO2 concentrations .
CO2 capture and storage is still " too expensive " , the report says
So - called solar radiation management methods do not take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere , and , according to some climate models , may be ineffective in altering shifts in rainfall patterns and storms , the report said .
But the authors said that the door should not be shut to the approach , which could be a faster way to reduce the rate of increase in global temperatures .
Some suggestions include : a giant mirror on the Moon ; a space parasol made of superfine aluminium mesh ; and a swarm of 10 trillion small mirrors launched into space one million at a time every minute for the next 30 years .
The study also said that many of these approaches had huge logistical demands , and it could take several decades for them to be implemented .
But if temperatures rose to such a level where more rapid action needed to be taken , three techniques were considered to have most potential : 1 . Stratospheric aerosols : Previous volcanic eruptions have effectively provided case studies of the potential effectiveness of this method .
2 . Space - based methods :
These were considered to be a potential technique for long - term use , but only if major problems of implementation and maintenance could be solved .
3 . Cloud albedo approaches :
These include " cloud ships " which would send sea water into the clouds to make them more reflective .
The report also highlighted an inadequate international legal framework for cross border projects .
Afforestation could play a small role in reducing atmospheric CO2 " The greatest challenges to the successful deployment of geo- engineering may be to social , ethical , legal and political issues associated with governance rather than scientific issues , " it pointed out .
The authors urged an appropriate international body , such as the UN Commission for Sustainable Development , to establish a method for developing treaties to determine who would be responsible for research that might have global risks and benefits .
Professor John Shepherd , a researcher from the University of Southampton , chaired the Royal Society 's geo-engineering study .
He said : " It is an unpalatable truth that unless we can succeed in greatly reducing CO2 emissions , we are headed for a very uncomfortable and challenging climate future .
" Geo-engineering and its consequences are the price we may have to pay for failure to act on climate change . "

Editor 's note :
All interviews with parents were conducted in Spanish and translated to English .
When Alfonso Uribe was 2 years old , he started banging his head against a wall .
Alarmed , his mother took him to a doctor .
The doctor did n't speak Spanish , and Eulalia Uribe did n't speak English .
There was no translator .
The pediatrician told Uribe that nothing was wrong with her son .
It would take another five years before Alfonso would finally be diagnosed with autism .
That 's the kind of thing social worker Alberto Serpas sees every day .
There was the father who abandoned his family when he learned his 13 - year - old daughter had autism , leaving his stay - at - home wife and two kids to fend for themselves .
The wife was undocumented , with little education or money , and no car .
Now she works a series of low - paying jobs at fast - food restaurants and supermarkets to put food on the table .
She 's been fired repeatedly because she often has to leave work early to take her daughter to therapy .
When she 's not working , she 's on the phone with the state or her daughter 's school , attempting to fight for services in a language she does n't speak .

Yet another family did n't realize their son could go to school .
He had severe autism — the ear - clutching , rocking - back - and - forth variety — but the family did n't know it .
They just knew that he could n't function outside the home .
So they kept him inside .
They had no health insurance , so he never got a referral to anyone who could offer a diagnosis .
It would be many years before anyone who could help would even learn that the child existed .
There 's a saying that if you 've met one child with autism , you 've met one child with autism .
That 's because autism is n't a clear - cut , easily identifiable disability — it 's a spectrum disorder .
Not all children will have the same symptoms , and those who do will exhibit them to different degrees .
The one trait that all children on the spectrum share is a difficulty communicating and interacting socially with others .
Coming to terms with a diagnosis of autism can be challenging for any family .
There is no cure ( the issue of whether autism is a " disorder " to be " cured " at all is extremely controversial ) .
The best families can hope for their children is to provide them with intervention and therapy .
The earlier , the better .
Learning how to navigate the bureaucratic world of disability services and special education in Arizona — the mountains of paperwork , referrals , insurance issues , doctor visits , and qualifying exams — is enough to drive a parent mad .
Now try navigating that bureaucracy in a foreign land , in a language that you do n't understand , without the cultural knowledge it often takes to understand unfamiliar medical and educational systems , lacking health insurance — possibly even citizenship status — on a minimal income and with no car .
These are just a few of the common obstacles that lower - income , Spanish - speaking immigrant families face when attempting to care for children with autism , says Serpas , a social worker who volunteers with GALA , a Phoenix - based , Spanish - speaking support group for the families of children with autism .
" It 's heartbreaking , " he says .
" And inspirational .
These families love their children so much .
They 'll do anything to help them .
But there are so many harsh obstacles .
It 's tremendously difficult . "
A tiny woman with bright eyes and a brilliant smile , Eulalia Uribe sits daintily on the edge of a beige couch next to her husband , Alfonso , in their small Mesa apartment .
In a room directly off the kitchen , three of their four children watch The Disney Channel and giggle .
Aelin , a shy girl with long black hair , sits apart in the corner , intently playing with a Bratz doll .
She does n't look up to see what the other children are laughing at , nor does she seem to care whether they play with her .
The Uribes say that is just how she is .
Aelin has autism — as does her older brother , Alfonso .
And although the Uribes noticed differences with both of them when they were quite small , Alfonso , the oldest ( now 12 ) , was n't diagnosed until he was 7 .
Aelin was diagnosed a few months ago — at the age of 11 .
Alfonso and Aelin Uribe are victims of a nearly silent perfect storm .
The United States is in the midst of an autism epidemic .
Twenty years ago , only one child in 100,000 was diagnosed with autism .
That number 's jumped to one in 150 , according to a 2007 study from the Centers for Disease Control .
Twenty years ago , the only exposure most people had to autism was through Dustin Hoffman 's role in the movie Rain Main .
Now , autism has broken into popular culture .
Bill Gates , the richest man alive , has been informally diagnosed with it .
Some online autism forums claim Vincent van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci .
There are bestselling memoirs and movies .
Celebrity Jenny McCarthy , whose son was diagnosed with autism , debates the causes and treatments with doctors on primetime television .
But chances are you still wo n't be seeing a Lifetime special on a Latino family 's struggle with the disability .
That 's because despite the fact that Latinos make up the fastest - growing minority population in the United States , Latino children are half as likely to be identified and served in the education system as Anglo children , according to 2007 U.S. Department of Education statistics .
And most are identified only after they 're enrolled in school — long after the critical window for early intervention has closed .
It 's a national problem .
One California researcher who published a study in the 2002 Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders actually thought Latinos might be less at risk for autism than other kids .
Her data showed Latinos to be the least likely of any ethnic group to use Department of Developmental Services in the state of California .
And then there 's a 2004 CDC report ( based on self - reporting from parents ) that found autism rates for Latinos to be roughly half that of non-Latinos .
But as it turns out , Latinos are n't less at risk for autism at all .
Most parents simply do n't realize their children are autistic , so it often goes overlooked .
This story is n't necessarily about all Latinos — it 's about lower - income Spanish - speaking immigrant parents of children with autism .
These parents face a double whammy when it comes to communication .
Because of their autism , the children often can't express their needs .
Parents need to become their children 's advocates and translators .
But for parents unable to speak English or navigate the medical system , getting adequate help can seem next to impossible .
There 's also the fear factor — in the past two years , Phoenix has been the target of immigration sweeps by the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office .
Now , social workers report that many parents living in Arizona illegally are too scared to seek the services their citizen children so desperately require .
Then there are the cultural complications .
According to Serpas , some families mistake autism for a mental disorder , which is often stigmatized .
Many of the social workers , therapists , and doctors interviewed for this story note that fathers tend to have particular trouble accepting the diagnosis of their sons , who are four times more likely to have autism than daughters .
Less - sensitive dads see their sons ' disabilities as reflections upon themselves — some even abandon their families , experts say .
" When you have a child that is not what they consider to be ' normal ' they get outcast by family members and society , " says Dilcia Yanez , a social worker and GALA volunteer whose clients are all Spanish - speaking immigrants .
" It comes from their culture .
If you have someone with mental retardation , others might feel that the whole family is the same . "
Because Phoenix is home to three Spanish - speaking support groups for the parents of children with autism — Grupo de Apoyo para Latinos con Autismo ( GALA ) , Gane , and another through the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center ( SARRC ) — the situation here has improved over the past seven years .
But many families are still falling through the cracks .
" Incidence of autism is on the rise , and the Latino population is growing faster than any population in the United States , " says Emily Iland , a California - based education consultant with a masters in special education focused on Latino issues in autism .
She 's also the author of the bilingual reference book Autism A to Z .
" Yet they have half the chance of getting recognized as other children .
It 's a crisis . "
And it 's not letting up .
Celia Sanchez and her family live in Mesa .
All three of her children have been diagnosed with autism .
A friendly woman with a ready laugh , she 's eager to talk about the progress they 've made — especially her middle son , Pedro .
As a baby , his symptoms were severe .
He cried constantly and would n't allow himself to be picked up .
He 'd bang his head against a wall , refuse food , and rip at his clothes .
Now he 's a chatty boy of 14 who loves Pokémon cards and joking around .
And he 's so smart , she says .
But when she talks about her oldest daughter , Rosillo , 15 , Celia 's enthusiasm wanes .
There 's a long silence , and she sighs .
" Rosillo . . . , " she says .
" I should have seen it earlier . "
Perhaps because Pedro's autism is much more severe than Rosillo's , he was diagnosed early , at the age of 2 , and started receiving therapy almost immediately .
Sanchez just assumed that Rosillo was quiet .
And she was so busy with Pedro that it was easy to miss the milder symptoms in her daughter .
But when Rosillo never learned to talk , Sanchez became worried .
Finally , Rosillo was diagnosed with autism at 7 .
Her doctors and teachers all missed it for years — and so did Sanchez .
She was devastated .
" I feel responsible , " she says .
Daniel Kessler , a developmental pediatrician with the Arizona Child Studies Center at Saint Joseph 's Hospital in Phoenix says that despite the growing number of autism cases , many pediatricians are missing autism in small children .
When parents tell doctors about a child 's unusual behavior , many pediatricians chalk it up to the parents ' over - protectiveness .
" Pediatricians say a variety of things : ' Do n't worry , he 's a boy , we 'll watch this and see how it goes ; it 's because he has three older sisters , and they always speak for him , ' " says Kessler .
" We hear this continuously from both English and Spanish - speaking families . "
But there is a difference .
For Anglo families eligible for Medicaid , it usually takes three or four doctor 's visits to get a diagnosis for their children , according to a 2002 article in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry .
For the Latino families studied , it took more than eight .
The tragic part is that many of these families do notice unusual behavior in their children when they are young — as early as 12 months , in some cases .
These are behaviors that can't be mistaken for anything typical .
Children who repeatedly beat their own heads against a wall , who scream inconsolably , clutching their eyes and ears because they are terrified of flies , loud noises , or light .
They wo n't allow themselves to be held or touched by anyone but their parents .
As they get older , some wo n't talk at all .
If these children had English - speaking parents , they'd be more likely to get early intervention .
Such clear - cut symptoms should n't be falling through the cracks , but they are .
Kessler points his finger at the language barrier .
" In a primary - care office , you 're already dealing with a fairly quick visit , " says Kessler .
" If there are language issues and you 're not really communicating you might miss their concerns . "
Even having a translator is n't a sure bet .
Sanchez says that after years of fighting with Rosillo 's school to get her daughter the services she desperately needs , she 's attempting to learn English , in part , because she 's had so many experiences with bad translators .
Often , she complains , they do n't repeat what she says .
Sometimes translators drop the last sentence — other times they change it entirely .
And sometimes there are n't trained translators available at all .
Doctors and parents are forced to communicate through one of the families ' other children ( imagine how your 7 - year - old would explain complicated medical symptoms ) .
Or they use the janitor , or the woman at the front desk .
For the latter , " Spanish might not even be their native language — usually they do n't know all the scientific words , " says Alberto Serpas , the social worker .
" A lot gets lost in translation . "
Then there 's the insurance issue .
About a third of Latino families in the United States do n't have insurance .
Many go to free clinics , and take their children to doctors only in emergencies .
This is an even bigger problem in rural areas and border towns , where there may only be one or two doctors available .
Because these children do n't have primary - care physicians , there is n't always someone parents can bring their concerns to — and many parents do n't think they need to .
Autism is n't like other disorders .
Unlike Down syndrome , which results from chromosomal abnormalities , autism is n't correlated with distinctive physical characteristics .
Many parents figure that it 's just a phase their child will grow out of .
Even so , language issues — even combined with insurance problems — are n't enough to explain the gap .
There 's something else going on here .
Part of the barrier has to do with culture — and with class .
Lower - income immigrant families are n't always fighting for their children .
Some do n't know that they should .
Others simply do n't know how .
Like the Uribes .
Originally from the Mexican state of Hidalgo , the family moved to Phoenix in 1994 .
A petite , pleasant woman , Eulalia cleans houses .
Her husband , Alfonso , a stocky man with neatly trimmed black hair and a goatee , is a day laborer .
As a baby , Alfonso — the Uribes ' first child — seemed normal .
A baby with big brown eyes , he seemed to enjoy being held and kissed by his parents .
When he started talking and walking later than other children his age , his mother figured he was just a late bloomer .
When , at 2 , her son began to repeatedly beat his head against the wall , the Uribes took him to the doctor immediately .
Eulalia says that the doctor told her nothing was wrong with her son .
There was no translator , so she was n't able to clearly explain her concerns .
Still , when the doctor said Alfonso was fine , she did n't question it .
Serpas says this happens a lot .
" Many of these parents are people with very humble backgrounds from rural areas , " explains Serpas .
" What the doctors or teachers say . . .
[ The parents ] do n't feel they are anyone to contradict them , so they do n't always seek other sources of information . "
And , of course , there 's always denial .
No parents expect their child to have autism , and some do n't want to accept that there 's something wrong with their kid .
So when the doctor says a child is fine , many parents do n't want to question them .
But they have to .
Because there is no cure for autism , it 's vital that families provide " intervention " — speech and occupational therapies — to their children as early as possible .
Because young children 's brains are still developing so rapidly , there 's an ideal window in which to start therapy — between about 18 months and 5 years ( though therapists prefer to start working with kids around 2 ) , says Daniel Oppendum , vice president and clinical services director at the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center .
With an average diagnosis made at 5 or 6 , Spanish - speaking immigrant families are missing that window .
Even families lucky enough to get services run into roadblocks .
A sociable 5 - year - old , Javier Acosta has mild autism that 's combined with other developmental disabilities .
Though he attempts to make eye contact and enjoys the company of others , he has trouble putting coherent sentences together and engaging others in play .
During a recent session , he and his speech therapist , Joanne McIntyre , sit on the faded blue carpet in a small , windowless white room full of toys — play ovens , Legos , a dollhouse , and a pirate ship .
Javier instantly gravitates toward the pirate ship .
Giggling , he reaches assertively for a gray - and - yellow pirate figurine held by his therapist .
" Say , ' Will you give me the pirate ? ' " she instructs patiently .
Javier babbles a string of words that do n't make any sense .
McIntyre listens intently , shakes her head then repeats herself slowly , gesturing at the figurine .
" Say , ' Will you give it to me ? ' "
" Da me lo ! " says Javier , correctly responding to her request , but in Spanish .
Not understanding , she repeats her request .
And again .
Finally , Javier says it in English .
From her perch on an indigo preschool - size chair in the corner of the room , his mother Thelma attempts to keep her 8 - year old daughter entertained during Javier 's therapy session .
When Javier says " Da me lo , " she laughs , delighted at her son 's progress .
Acosta does n't speak English .
And McIntyre does n't speak Spanish .
Javier and his sister are the only ones who speak both languages .
The fact that Javier and his therapist can communicate in English only wo n't necessarily affect his therapy — Javier understands English , so he 's still benefiting .
McIntyre 's inability to communicate with Javier 's mother , Thelma Acosta , however , is a bigger problem .
She can't ask Acosta about Javier 's typical behavior , or about potential scheduling conflicts , or explain to her the techniques she 's using with Javier and why .
More importantly , she can't teach Acosta how to work with Javier at home .
She has no idea whether or not Acosta even understands the techniques she 's using during Javier 's sessions .
Pretty much all communication between McIntyre and Acosta is filtered over the phone through Javier 's bilingual third party .
If McIntyre has notes or questions for Acosta , she 'll tell the translator , who will eventually call Acosta .
If Acosta has questions — though McIntyre says there have n't been any so far , which also concerns her — she 'll do the same thing .
" I have no idea if the activities are being done at home , " says McIntyre .
" Working with some children — trying to make sure that they 're understanding me — can be a real challenge . "
As it is , there simply are n't enough speech therapists in the Valley to go around .
Finding one who speaks Spanish is next to impossible , according to people in the community .
" I can count the number on one hand , " says social worker Yanez .
Many therapists hesitate to work with families they can't talk with directly , Yanez says .
A few weeks ago , Yanez contacted a speech - therapy company on behalf of several of her clients .
One of the therapists called the family but could n't communicate with the mother .
After only one phone call , she gave up .
" She called me back and requested that I only refer her to English - speaking parents , " says Yanez .
So much of the progress of a child depends on how well their parents incorporate their treatments into everyday life .
The language barrier makes things much more difficult .
But it 's just as frustrating for therapists willing to work with such families .
Marti Baio , a speech therapist and the owner of Baio Enterprises Inc. — where Javier goes for treatment — says they do the best they can to work around the language barrier .
" Sometimes parents will bring translators , " she says .
" If they can't , we 'll call a translator who will then talk directly to the parents . "
Still , such a game of " telephone " is hardly optimal when it comes to working with autism .
Some therapists think that working with families is unethical if family and therapist do n't speak the same language , McIntyre says .
If a child 's Spanish is delayed but his English is fine , then it's a language issue — not something that requires a therapist .
And if both the child 's primary and secondary languages are delayed ?
" It 's hard for children to progress beyond their primary language , " says McIntyre .
" And my Spanish vocabulary is so limited — I know Javier 's sometimes speaking Spanish , but I can't always tell . "
Most Latino children with autism are not identified until they go to school .
Under Arizona law , all children are required to go through a screening within the first 45 days of their beginning school .
Teachers must fill out questionnaires that evaluate the behavior and development of each child .
It 's an imperfect process .
Teachers are still getting to know kids in the first few weeks of school and wo n't always catch the difference — at least not initially — between a child who is painfully shy and one on the autism spectrum .
Thanks to the recently passed budget , schools are expected to suffer staggering funding cuts .
Neda Shafir , a spokeswoman with Roosevelt School District , says that many schools have been forced to reduce programs and staff .
" What 's happening with the Legislature is nothing less than brutal , " she says .
" We 're looking at significant funding cuts , which means that class sizes are going up and schools have to reduce services . "
School districts with high volumes of illegal immigrants are hit even harder , because undocumented families often go unreported in the census — which means the schools might not get complete funding for those kids .
" Teachers are committed to giving kids the best education , " says Shafir .
" But when you have a classroom with 35 kids , you can't give attention to every child .
We might be looking at a lot of teacher burnout . "
The process is additionally complicated by language .
Since the implementation of Proposition 203 in 2001 , all second - language learners are required to take four hours of intensive English every day .
All other classes are also taught in English .
Teachers sometimes have trouble telling whether a child 's speech delay is simply because they 're a second - language learner or due to a disability .
A study conducted in California by autism expert Emily Iland found that of the 108 Spanish - speaking mothers of children with autism surveyed , 44 percent reported that the teacher or staff at school thought their children 's problems were caused because they were an English - language learner , or because they spoke Spanish at home .
Teachers do their best to identify kids .
Even so , not all children are getting the services they need .
It took Celia Sanchez nearly a year and a half to get her daughter 's school to provide special education services to Rosillo .
She had a doctor 's diagnosis , but the school would n't recognize it .
Even after she resubmitted her daughter 's medical records — including a diagnosis of autism from a licensed doctor — the school kept Rosillo in normal classes .
Rosillo 's doctor had to threaten to take the school to court for challenging his diagnosis before they 'd finally give Sanchez 's daughter the services she was entitled to .
By then , Rosillo had already lost more than a year of school .
Joanne Phillips , the former director of special education for the state Department of Education , says Rosillo 's the exception .
Now a private education consultant and owner of the company CADRE , which helps train schools and teachers to identify and work with children with special needs , Phillips says that most children do eventually get identified and served in schools .
But she acknowledges that the process is far more challenging for the children of monolingual , Spanish - speaking parents .
Phillips says that anyone trained to look for autism should be able to easily identify the children who have it , regardless of their linguistic and cultural background .
" When I meet the children , it 's the autism that shines through .
It transcends culture , " she says .
To a trained eye , she says , there are certain telltale universal signs .
For example , children with autism will often look at a person 's mouth rather than their eyes , because that 's where the sound is coming from .
Or she looks to see if children follow " joint attention . "
If the child is walking down the street , and a stranger suddenly looks up , will the child look up , too ?
Such behaviors are universal to typical human behavior , but not to people with autism .
The big problem , according to Phillips , is that teachers and staff at schools are n't being adequately trained to identify kids .
In some schools , funding cuts are so severe that much - needed staff vacancies have been open for months — jobs like special education teachers , psychologists , etc .
" School districts need training and staff , " she says .
" They do n't know how to work with kids with autism , and they do n't know how to evaluate the skills of the children to know where to intervene . "
Even more concerning are the children who never make it into the classroom .
" Sometimes if the child has a disability , the family will view it as an embarrassment , so they do n't bring the child out , " says Phillips .
In such cases , the child may never be identified .
Phillips knows it happens , because such children have been found , by chance , on her watch .
Schools have conducted home visits to another child in the family only to discover a sibling who was not enrolled in school .
This has been improving as the community has become more educated , she says .
But with recent immigration sweeps , Phillips fears that the situation may be getting worse again .
" I would say with the anti-immigrant activities , it 's probably getting more common than what it 's been in the past , " she says .
" The pendulum may be swinging back . "
Getting diagnosed is just the beginning .
Sandra Catalan first noticed problems with her third child , Leonardo , when he was about 10 months old .
A beautiful , chubby baby with soft , downy hair and long black lashes , he did n't like to be held or touched — not even by his parents .
He 'd cry and throw tantrums when she tried to kiss him .
Catalan remembers those days with a shudder .
" There was nothing I could do to help him .
I felt so helpless , " she says .
Still , she tried .
Catalan lost track of the number of doctor visits before Leonardo was finally diagnosed with autism .
She guesses they must have gone at least 10 times .
" Every time we went to the doctor for a routine visit , I 'd tell them that there was something wrong with my child , " she says .
" They never listened . "
When Leonardo was finally diagnosed at 4 , she was relieved .
Finally , her son could get help .
From here , she figured things would just get easier .
She was wrong .
Few families — even those in the middle - class income bracket — can afford to pay for therapy out of pocket .
The price tag for speech and occupational therapies alone can run well above $ 50,000 per year .
For Catalan , whose day job was cleaning office buildings in downtown Phoenix , it was out of the question .
For lower - income families with children with disabilities , there 's AHCCCS , a state program that administers Medicaid , designed to pay for all the services required by a child with special needs .
The maximum salary a family can make in order to qualify is $ 1,200 per month .
The first time she applied , Catalan was denied — her income was too high by $ 5 .
So she got her company to dock her hours for two months .
The next time she applied , she qualified .
Language barriers can impede the application process , which also requires a child to pass a screening .
Steve Meissner , public information officer for the state Department of Economic Security , which runs the Division of Developmental Disorders , says that all screeners sent to test Spanish - speaking children either speak the language or bring a translator .
But some of the families interviewed for this story had different experiences .
Several say that the screeners did n't speak their language — a big problem when part of the screening tests speech delay .
Some of the mothers reported that they were unable to communicate with the tester at all .
For one family , it took several screenings before their child would finally qualify .
Nor does the DDD always do a good job of walking families through the process of finding the services they need once the families finally qualify to get them .
Catalan 's first visit to DDD was overwhelming .
She says they told her how many hours of music , occupational , and speech therapy her son qualified for and gave her a thick packet of papers with the contact numbers for local companies that provided therapy .
No one walked her through the steps .
They also told her not to hope for too much : Leo , they said , would never go to the bathroom on his own .
He would never play with toys , hold a fork , or dress himself .
He would probably never talk .
He would never hug her , never want to be touched or kissed .
Catalan refused to believe them — she says she clung to the hope that one day her son would let her hold him .
That one day , he might even hug her back .
Armed with the list of therapy providers and not much else , Catalan estimated that she initially called close to 20 programs .
Many of the companies did n't even have Spanish - speaking receptionists ; sometimes they 'd hang up on her .
Even fewer had Spanish - speaking therapists .
The few that did had waiting lists of as many as 100 children .
Several weeks and dozens of calls into the process , Catalan remembers walking through one of the office buildings she works in , making sure the lights were turned off and everything was clean .
She began to cry .
She could n't stop .
" I felt desperate , " she says .
" I did n't know where to go .
I did n't know how to start .
I did n't know what to do . "
She persisted — all while working full time and taking care of her husband and four other children .
In what little free time she had , she took English classes , hoping to acquire enough of the language to persuade English - speaking therapists to take on her son .
At the worst of it , she was sleeping two to three hours a night .
And — at least for the first four months after Leonardo was diagnosed — she did it all alone , without the support of her husband .
" At first he did n't want to believe it , " she says .
" My husband did n't think anything was wrong with Leo .
He said I was crazy . "
Dilcia Yanez , a social worker affiliated with the support group GALA , says that she sees that sort of thing a lot :
Lots of more traditional dads have trouble coming to grips with their children 's diagnosis .
" There are fathers who abandon their families — it 's part of their macho , " says Yanez .
" When a father realizes that their child is not typical they struggle with it to the point that they can't cope .
They leave the home . "
Others blame their wives for being unable to control the child .
The situation is improving with education , says Yanez , adding that now most fathers do stick around .
Even so , many of the therapists , doctors , and social workers interviewed for this story still find that immigrant fathers are rarely as involved as mothers in their child 's treatment ( this is often true of most fathers as well ) .
" I let them know that I really recognize that they are so involved and that it is so important for their child , " says Yanez .
" Running away is not going to make their child better . "
After several months , Catalan 's husband finally did accept his son's diagnosis , and began to support his wife 's efforts to get Leo therapy .
He even went to educational seminars to learn more about his son's diagnosis .
Still he rarely attends therapist appointments — partly because of his work schedule — and generally leaves interacting with the therapists to his wife .
Things eventually got better .
Catalan found Jump Start — a bilingual program offered though SARRC to teach parents of newly diagnosed children how to work with their kids .
Through SARRC , she was also able to get habilitative services — therapists who come to the home an hour per week to help autistic children meet self - help goals .
The first year of therapy was the hardest , she says .
Despite all that she had done to fight for therapy for her son , he was n't improving .
She did all the exercises taught to her by SARRC at home religiously , but nothing seemed to reach him .
" It was like he was closed up in a box , " she says .
" He did n't want to learn .
It was so difficult . "
She cried a lot .
Then — after nearly a year of therapy — Leo had a breakthrough .
One day , he began to play with a variety of toys in a therapy session .
He responded to people .
It was as though someone had flipped on a switch , and suddenly he wanted to learn .
Now a lively 7 - year - old , Leo has proved many of DDD 's initial predictions wrong .
He can go to the bathroom on his own , dress himself , and play with toys .
He 's even learning to prepare his favorite foods .
Although he still can't talk on his own , he communicates quite well through a speech device — a computer that talks for him .
And he hugs and kisses his parents .
" That first day I cried , " says Catalan .
" I just thanked God because finally my child is starting to discover the world . "
By Michael Barone - September 14 , 2009
The dwindling number of readers of The New York Times were treated Wednesday to a column by Thomas Friedman extolling China 's " one- party autocracy , " which , he told us , " is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people . "
China 's leaders , he reported , are " boosting gasoline prices " and " overtaking us in electric cars , solar power , energy efficiency , batteries , nuclear power and wind power . "
All , of course , in the cause of reducing carbon emissions , which so many luminaries assure us are bound to produce global warming and environmental catastrophe .
As Jonah Goldberg , author of the scholarly bestseller " Liberal Fascism , " notes , " This is exactly the argument that was made by American fans of Mussolini in the 1920s . "
Mussolini , we were told then , made the trains run on time .
He drained the Pontine marshes .
He got things done while Americans , with their chaotic democratic politics , dithered .
Most of the Mussolini fans of the 1920s did n't really want a dictatorship in America , and any fair reader of Thomas Friedman 's oeuvre knows that he does n't want an authoritarian government here , either .
The word limit of his column apparently left him no space to regret the Chinese one - party autocracy 's Internet censorship , forced sterilizations , imprisonment of political dissenters and the like .
Even so , Friedman declares that " our one - party democracy is worse " than the Chinese model .
He is upset that the minority party , the Republicans , wo n't go along with Democrats ' plans to raise the price of carbon emissions and pass a government health care plan -- though , perhaps wisely , he refrains from praising the Chinese health delivery system .
But he does get an essential bit wrong :
It 's our two - party system he 's complaining about , and the fact that the current minority party wo n't act like it 's just one wing of the majority .
China 's one - party autocracy has acted decisively on two issues , which can be summed up in the phrases population explosion and global warming .
The media , university and corporate elites of not just America but most of the world have been of one mind about these two issues , and in my opinion are being proven wrong on both .
Each of them is used by the elites as an excuse to prevent ordinary people from behaving as they would like to .
Back in the 1970s , when the elites were convinced that overpopulation would destroy the Earth , the Chinese acted as only a one - party autocracy or totalitarian state could :
It limited women to one child .
The result was that millions of female fetuses were aborted so that China now has about 120 males to every 100 females -- a potentially destabilizing imbalance -- and a slow - growing population that means China will get old before most of its people grow rich .
Meanwhile , the population bomb has turned out to be a dud worldwide , as birth rates declined , and the real demographic problem , as Ben Wattenberg and Phillip Longman have pointed out , is population decline .
Warren Buffett , who planned to leave his fortune to population controllers , wisely decided to leave it to Bill and Melinda Gates to spend as they think best .
The verdict is n't in on global warming yet , but some alarmist predictions have proved false .
The world has been getting a little colder in the last decade , and climate models have been failing to predict the recent past .
Moreover , as global warming believer Bjorn Lomborg points out , it 's economically much more sensible to spend money on pending problems ( like lack of safe drinking water ) and on mitigating possible future effects of climate change than it is to reduce carbon emissions , which choke off the near - term economic growth needed to address environmental needs .
China 's one - party autocracy can ignore such arguments .
Our two - party democracy can't .
Thomas Friedman may lament what Barack Obama on Wednesday night called " bickering . "
But in a democracy , citizens do n't always take the advice of their betters , even that of Friedman and the three experts he quotes -- a climateprogress.org blogger , a former Clinton budget official and a " global trade consultant who teaches at Baruch College . "
The lesson I take from the overpopulation scare is to be wary when media , university and corporate elites warn that we must change our ways or face disaster 50 years hence , and when they insist , as Al Gore does and as Tom Friedman seems to , that the time for argument is over .
In our two - party democracy , it never is .
And should n't be .
The U.S. debt of $ 57 trillion in unfunded liabilities , according to common sense , is compelling reason for federal governors conspiring with special interests to murder 100 million Americans this fall using poisonous vaccinations .
According to federal deficit calculators at USDebtClock.org , more than $ 57 trillion is currently owed , including $ 39 trillion ( T ) in medicaid / medicare debt , $ 10T in social security payables , plus $ 8T in prescription drug liabilities , levying $ 189,210.00 in servitude upon every American citizen .
The mafia kills people for a lot less .
Do you really think your debt collection is proceeding differently ?
Consider current White House science czar John Holdren 's published affection for population reduction , nuclear industry promotion , biological weapons distribution , and vaccination sterilization through intoxication advancing under the guises of " national security , " " biopreparedness , " " flu prevention , and " health care reform . "
The fact is , you are worth more dead than alive to Obama 's ilk , because in reality , there is a WARRANT FOR YOUR DEATH THAT CARRIES A REWARD OF $ 189 K , and rising .
Now you would never believe this is true .
But do your " homework " and learn the FACTS : 1 ) Washington , DC is a " district , " not a " state " in the Republic .
Legally , it is an offshore or " foreign " corporation .
2 ) U.S. Federal employees , including Capitol Hill legislators , are legally contracted to perform on behalf of the " foreign corporation . "
3 ) The " foreign corporation " in now unable to pay its debts .
4 ) The " foreign corporation " is now calling in its notes .
5 ) Under Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC -- global economic administrative banking and accounting law ) a liquidity account called a " bond " was created for you at birth .
6 ) This " bond " secures every American citizen with a birth certificate and social security number against debtor obligations administered through the IRS and Justice Department .
7 ) Your " bond , " ( private trust - like account created when your birth certificate was filed with the state , then sent to the federal corporation ) is worth millions of dollars based on expert legal testimonies and insurance industry actuarial projections of your net worth -- gross personal production -- from birth to grave .
8 ) Considering your gross personal productivity over your lifetime carries this economic value , you might call this your " gross personal product . "
9 ) The " foreign corporation " assays America 's " gross national product , " and your " gross personal product " as well .
10 ) Assets of the " foreign corporation " may be liquidated to pay debts ; and you may be liquidated , likewise , for available currency in your " transaction account , " to pay the corporation 's debts through the international bank - serving IRS " balance sheet " provisions that have been secreted from the public , but heralded legally by expert witnesses in tax courts .
The aforementioned FACTS EVIDENCE . . .
THE SINGLE , MOST IMPORTANT , FUNDAMENTAL MOTIVE DRIVING DECLARATIONS OF WAR , WAR ECONOMIES , AND CURRENT INCESSANT POLITICAL IMPOSITIONS , INCLUDING WARS ON TERRORISM , BIOTERRORISM ; WAGING BIOLOGICAL WARFARE AGAINST PEOPLE AND MICROBES THROUGH MODERN MEDICINE , VACCINATIONS , AND DEADLY PHARMACEUTICALS .
So you probably never realized you are worth more dead to our current " legal guardians " than alive .
This best explains why : 1 ) Throughout history , global economic collapses have fueled major wars .
2 ) Hideously harmful , scientifically proven killers are often certified for use by the FDA and " fast - tracked " to markets , 3 ) The FDA incessantly advances Big Pharma 's Codex Alimentarius plot to terminate over - the - counter access to vitamins , minerals , herbs , homeo - pathics , the healing natural sweetener stevia and energizing ginseng , but grants deadly addictive aspartame , even caffeine , free distribution everywhere .
4 ) Safe methods of water decontamination , such as inexpensive ultraviolet light and ozonation , or even nano - silver disinfection , is grossly excluded from municipal water purification methods in favor of totally toxic carcinogenic chlorine .
5 ) Fluoride , a mind - numbing bone - mottling intoxicant , is forced upon nearly everyone as a replacement for education and motivation for dental caries prevention .
6 ) Mercury in vaccines and dental fillings is still approved after extensive research proving toxicity and substantial morbidity and mortality linked to the heavy metal poison .
7 ) John Holdren became Obama administration " science czar " given his voracious appetite for population reduction through intoxication of water and food supplies , and the previously conducted mass vaccination causing sterilization as endorsed in his book Ecoscience .
8 ) US officials plan to administer 3 toxic immune system destroying squalene injections this fall under the guise of swine flu " biodefense , " despite substantial scientific evidence proving this is a deadly immune - intoxicating substance .
9 ) CDC and NIAID officials lie about HIV / AIDS , in many different ways , quashing safe and effective low - to - no - cost treatments while partnering with private companies advancing profitable drug sales .
10 ) The new additional federal $ 1 billion contract for swine flu vaccines include Baxter corporation 's provisions despite the company 's history of genocidal operations .
Federal officials were well aware the company spread HIV / AIDS in contaminated blood products AND spread H5N1 allegedly " accidentally " in time for this " biodefense " season .
11 ) Hillary Rodham Clinton , Obama 's Secretary of State , overseeing CIA , FBI and Foreign Policy , was politically positioned to dictate " health care reform , " " national security , " and " national health insurance policy , " 12 .
12 ) Mrs. Clinton went to Mexico precisely when the mysterious Mexican swine flu outbreak occurred to persuade government officials there to stop supporting drug traffickers whose WAR killed more than 7,000 people the previous 12 months .
This just proves the " WAR on Drugs " is a profitable security investment for Big Pharma , political liars , and inside traitors ( Ref ) ; and why . . .
13 ) Every one of the deadliest pandemics throughout history has come when severe socioeconomic / political upheaval occurred .
Suffice it to say , knowing all of the above , you would have to be a complete idiot to accept flu vaccinations this fall , or any intoxication through " immunization " ever again .
It ’s time for the release of Vala 0.7.6 .
Tarballs are available from the GNOME FTP servers .
This release includes a couple of new features worth explaining in a bit more detail .
Closures
While Vala has lambda expressions for a long time , they have n’t supported accessing local variables from the outer method .
With the release of Vala 0.7.6 this has changed , and you can access and set any local variable from lambda expressions .
One place where I ’d expect this to be convenient is in signal handlers :
void main ( string [ ] args ) { Gtk .
init ( ref args ) ; var window = new Gtk .
Window ( Gtk .
WindowType .
TOPLEVEL ) ; window .
set_default_size ( 300 , 50 ) ; window .
destroy .
connect ( Gtk . main_quit ) ; var button = new Gtk .
Button .
with_label ( " Click me ! " ) ; button .
clicked .
connect ( ( ) => { window .
title = " Closures in Vala " ; } ) ; window .
add ( button ) ; window .
show_all ( ) ; Gtk . main ( ) ; } void main ( string [ ] args ) { Gtk.init ( ref args ) ; var window = new Gtk. Window ( Gtk.WindowType.TOPLEVEL ) ; window.set_default_size ( 300 , 50 ) ; window.destroy.connect ( Gtk.main_quit ) ; var button = new Gtk.Button .
with_label ( " Click me ! " ) ; button.clicked.connect (( ) => { window. title = " Closures in Vala " ; } ) ; window.add ( button ) ; window.show_all ( ) ; Gtk.main ( ) ; }
You can even write recursive lambda expressions :
delegate int Func ( int i ) ; void main ( ) { Func fib = null ; fib = ( i ) => ( i <= 1 ) ?
i : ( fib ( i - 2 ) + fib ( i - 1 ) ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i ++ ) { message ( " %d " , fib ( i ) ) ; } } delegate int Func ( int i ) ; void main ( ) { Func fib = null ; fib = ( i ) => ( i <= 1 ) ? i : ( fib ( i - 2 ) + fib ( i - 1 ) ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; i++) { message ( " %d " , fib ( i ) ) ; } }
Asynchronous methods
The idea of integrating async methods into the language is to make it easier to write code that calls or implements async methods .
Async methods are frequently used in I/O API such as GIO and in D - Bus clients and servers .
Traditionally , writing async code has beeen quite painful as you often end up writing callback chains and completely lose track over the control flow in the process .
Experimental support for async methods has been implemented in Vala almost a year ago .
However , the implementation was rather a proof of concept than a finished solution .
While I still expect a few bugs in that area with 0.7.6 , it ’s a lot more robust and complete than it used to be a short time ago .
So how does it look like ?
It ’s not unlike Alex ’s AsyncRunner in JavaScript except that it ’s even more concise as it ’s fully integrated into the language .
The following code defines an async method list_dir that asynchronously enumerates all files in the home directory :
async void list_dir ( ) { var dir = File .
new_for_path ( Environment .
get_home_dir ( ) ) ; try { var e = yield dir .
enumerate_children_async ( FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_NAME , 0 , Priority .
DEFAULT , null ) ; while ( true ) { var files = yield e .
next_files_async ( 10 , Priority .
DEFAULT , null ) ; if ( files == null ) { break ; } foreach ( var info in files ) { print ( " %s
" , info .
get_name ( ) ) ; } } } catch ( GLib .
Error err ) { warning ( " Error : %s
" , err . message ) ; } } void main ( ) { list_dir .
begin ( ) ; var loop = new GLib .
MainLoop ( null , false ) ; loop .
run ( ) ; } async void list_dir ( ) { var dir = File.new_for_path ( Environment.get_home_dir ( ) ) ; try { var e = yield dir.enumerate_children_async ( FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_NAME , 0 , Priority . DEFAULT , null ) ; while ( true ) { var files = yield e.next_files_async ( 10 , Priority .
DEFAULT , null ) ; if ( files == null ) { break ; } foreach ( var info in files ) { print ( " %s
" , info.get_name ( ) ) ; } } } catch ( GLib. Error err ) { warning ( " Error : %s
" , err.message ) ; } } void main ( ) { list_dir. begin ( ) ; var loop = new GLib.
MainLoop ( null , false ) ; loop.run ( ) ; }
As you can see , it ’s very easy to call the async methods enumerate_children_async and next_files_async in try - catch blocks and loops .
There is no need for manually creating structs for user_data or similar inconveniences .
Async methods in Vala can also be used to implement D - Bus servers that can process multiple requests at the same time .
Using it could n’t be easier , just write an async method such as the above example , add it to a class annotated with [ DBus ( name = “ org.example . Test ” ) ] , and register an instance of that class with the D - Bus connection .
Vala also supports async methods on client - side D - Bus interfaces .
We ended up writing our own web server and framework after looking at existing servers and tools like Twisted because none matched both our performance requirements and our ease - of - use requirements .
I can't imagine there is much of a performance difference [ between Twisted Web and Tornado ] .
The bottom is not that complex in my opinion .
In general , it seems like Twisted is full of demo-quality stuff , but most of the protocols have tons of bugs .
Given all those factors , it did n't seem to provide a lot of value .
Our core I/ O loop is actually pretty small and simple , and I think resulted in fewer bugs than would have come up if we had used Twisted .
What To Do Now
FriendFeed has released its web server , Tornado .
It seems like everyone 's blogging about it , and it 's obviously relevant to my interests , so I feel like I should say something .
Let me start with the good stuff .
First of all , I think it 's great that we have yet another asynchronous contender in the Python world .
Every time something like this comes out , it means that Twisted has to fight that much less hard to get over the huge hump of event - driven programming being too hard , or too weird , or whatever .
It 's good to have an endorsement of the general message " if you need a web server to handle COMET requests , it needs to be asynchronous to perform acceptably " from such a high - profile company as Facebook .
Unfortunately I think the larger picture here is a failure of communication in the open source community .
In the course of developing Tornado , there are several things that FriendFeed could have done to move the Twisted community forward , at no cost to themselves .
I do n't want to rag on FriendFeed , or Bret Taylor , or Facebook here ; they 're not the first to re-write something without communicating .
In fact I recently had almost this exact same discussion with another project that did the same thing .
Since Tornado is such a high - profile example , though , I want to draw attention to the problem so that there 's some hope that maybe the next project wo n't forget to communicate first .
My main point here is that if you 're about to undergo a re-write of a major project because it did n't meet some requirements that you had , tell the project that you are rewriting what you are doing .
In the best case scenario , someone involved with that project will say , " Oh , you 've misunderstood the documentation , actually it does do that " .
In the worst case , you go ahead with your rewrite anyway , but there is some hope that you might be able to cooperate in the future , as the project gradually evolves to meet your requirements .
Somewhere in the middle , you might be able to contribute a few small fixes rather than re-implementing the whole thing and maintaining it yourself .
This is especially important if you are later going to make claims about that project not living up to your vaguely - described requirements , and thereby damage its reputation .
Bret Taylor claims in his blog First and foremost , it would have been great to hear from Bret when he started off using Twisted about any performance problems or ease - of - use problems .
I 'm guessing that Twisted itself had only ease - of - use problems , and other " tools like Twisted " were the ones with performance problems , since later , in a comment on the same post , he says
It would also be great if he had explicitlythat Twisted did n't have performance problems rather than making me guess , because I 'm sure that is what lots of developers will take away from this .
When you have the bully pulpit , off - the - cuff comments like this can do serious damage to smaller projects .
More to the point , what is the problem with " ease of use " , exactly ?
The fact that he found Deferred tedious , in particular , seems very strange to me , given that it is sotedious that it has become a de-facto standard even in the JavaScript community .
We had no opportunity to help him or anyone else out , because as far as I can tell from searching our archives , we never heard from him or from anyone else at FriendFeed when they were trying out Twisted at first .
Even as he 's saying that Twisted is hard to use and ( maybe ? ) performs poorly , he is n't pointing to any particular example of what about it is hard to use , or what performs poorly .
There 's still nothing we can do to address this criticism .
And there 's still not much we can do to make sure that future potential Twisted users wo n't have this problem .
Later , in yet another comment , Bret points out the root problem :
This is true .
However , as I frequently like to note , Twisted is starved for resources .
Reconciling the chaos described on the page about web development with Twisted is an ongoing process .
For a tiny fraction of the effort invested in Tornado , FriendFeed could have worked with us to resolve many of the issues creating that chaos .
This is the main thing I want to reinforce here .
If half a dozen occasional contributors with a real focused interest in web development showed up to help us on Twisted , we'd have an awesome , polished web story within a few months .
If evenperson really took responsibility for twisted .
web , things would pick up .
But if everyone who wants an asynchronous webserver either uses twisted .
web ( because it 's great ! ) without talking to us or decides not to use it ( because it does n't meet their unstated requirements ) without talking to us , it 's going to continue to improve at the same sluggish pace .
Even at the current rate , by the time we have an excellent HTTP story , I somehow doubt that Tornado will have a good SSH v2 protocol story ;-) .
In his comment , Bret also takes a couple of pot-shots at Twisted that I think are unnecessary , and I 'd like to address those too .
We 're not talking about " most " of the protocols here , Tornado is only concerned with HTTP .
And the HTTP implementation (s ) in Twisted do not have " tons of bugs " .
They are production quality , used on lots of different websites , and have lots of automated tests .
While much of the code in twisted .
web does n't havetest coverage , since it 's old enough to predate our testing requirements , I note that Tornado appears to have zero test coverage
There 's a kernel of truth here — of the older , less frequently used protocols have a few problems — but in most cases the " bugs " are really just a lack of functionality .
Twisted overall has very few protocol - related bugs , and again , our test policy makes sure that new bugs are introduced very rarely .
I must respectfully disagree .
Again , I do n't want to rag on FriendFeed here , but here are several features that Tornado would have , and bugs that it would n't have , if it used Twisted for the event loop and none of the HTTP stuff : and this is a very short list , based on a cursory reading of the source code , not actually running tornado and not a particularly deep audit .
Some of these bugs might not be as serious as I think , and there might be plenty of other bugs .
But I can't really be sure what works for sure , since again : there are no automated tests .
This list is a great example of why projects like Tornado reallyuse Twisted .
Tornado implements some innovative web - framework stuff , but absolutely nothing interesting that I can see at the level of async I/O. Using Twisted would have allowed them to focus exclusively on cool web things and left the never - ending stream of incremental surprising platform - specific , only - happens - in - weird - situations bugfixes to a single , common source .
I hope that someone at FriendFeed will be a little heavier on detail and a little lighter on FUD in some future conversation about Twisted .
However , I 'm sure they 're going to have their hands full maintaining their own code , so I do n't have high expectations in this area .
I 'm sure Bret was n't intentionally slamming Twisted , either ; it was n't like he wrote a big screed about it , he just dropped in a few unsubstantiated comments into a much larger post about Tornado .
So I just want to be clear : I do n't have sore feelings , I do n't need anybody to apologize to me or to Twisted .
If any of you out there are fans of both Tornado and of Twisted , it would be great if you could contribute a patch to Tornado which would allow it to at least optionally use Twisted as an I / O back - end .
It would be great , of course , if lots of people interested in web stuff would help us out with our web situation , but supporting the Twisted event loop would be good regardless .
It would mean that when people wanted to speak multiple protocols , they would n't need to re-write or kludge in their existing Tornado application , so it would increase the chances that we could get some help with our SSH , FTP , IRC , or XMPP code instead .
It would also open up a much wider multi-protocol landscape to users of Tornado , even if Tornado 's default mode of operation still used ioloop .
py .
Even better would be to hook up something that made a Tornado IResource implementation , so that Tornado applications and twisted .web and Nevow applications could all be seamlessly integrated into one server .
The whole point of Twisted is to have a common I/O layer that lots of different libraries can use , share , and build on , so that we can solidify the common and highly complex abstraction required of a comprehensive , cross- platform , event - driven I /O layer .
In order to realize that vision , we need help not just with the code ; we need more Twisted ambassadors to go out into the community and help us integrate these disparate applications , help us find out where real users are finding the documentation inadequate or the organization confusing .
Tornado could be an excellent opportunity for those ambassadors to go out and introduce others to the wonders of Twisted , because its endorsement from FriendFeed guarantees it an audience of a tens of thousands of developers , at least for its first few months of life .
If you 've shied away from contributing to Twisted itself because of our aggressive testing and documentation requirements , well , Tornado apparently does n't have any , so it would be a great place for you to start :) .

Advertising ?
it 's the easiest job in the world .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again , but coming up with a successful advert is not exactly brain surgery .
Bit of sex , a lot of humour and a cracking song and you could sell vomit - coloured shoes to even the most discerning of fashion shoppers .
We like to think we are immune to such obvious marketing tricks , but we 're not .
Tampons are not exactly a regular on my shopping list .
But give me an ad featuring Anna Friel in a skimpy top dancing to the Pixies or some cracking Motown track and it wo n't be long before I 'll be queuing up for my sanitary towel fix .
That 's because good music works ?
it can make even the most insufferably tedious and boring things appear cool .
Just look at Michael Stipe .
But which are your favourites ?
Which advert tracks had you rushing to the shops , only to come away scratching your head over why you actually bought the crappy item ?
The kind that leaves you scouring the iTunes just so you did n't have to endure countless more advertising breaks in the hope of hearing it again .
But getting the right track can be sometimes troublesome .
Trying to flog any old piece of crap by sticking a half - decent track from The Beatles or Rolling Stones on the advert is not a guaranteed win , which kind of disproves my earlier point , but whatever .
Anyway , here at hecklerspray we have compiled our favourites .
Just to clarify , we do n't mean advert ditties ?
we are talking about proper song tracks .
Feel free to let us know what you think ?
not that you need any encouragement !
Enjoy !
20 . A Minha Menina by Os Mutantes
Advert : McDonald?s
Great song by one of the world ’s greatest ever bands , and an important message as well – gorging yourself silly on mechanically - reclaimed meat is better than exercise .
That is the point of the ad , is n’t it ?

Advert : Levis Sta -Prest trousers
Yes , it got annoying quickly .
But that was only because everyone else loved it as much as you did .

Although we ’re legally required to tell you that you must never , ever , try it .
Ever .
10 . Strange and Beautiful by Aqualung
Advert : Volkswagen
The answer to the question ‘ What song should advertise our advert now that Radiohead have repeatedly turned us down ? ’

Something tells us they ’re barking up the wrong tree .
5. Venus in Furs by The Velvet Underground
Advert : Pirelli
Annoyingly , this advert does n’t seem to be anywhere on the internet .
But it was excellent and the song was good and the man who directed it also made American History X , so shut up .

Advert : Levi jeans
Very possibly the most dated thing in the universe .
But , God , that song …
3. Tame by Pixies

1. Heartbeats , by The Knife
Sony Bravia
The perfect marriage of audio and visual .
The end .

The Creation Museum ’s founder Ken Ham has been visiting Japan this past week .
He made a trip to a Buddhist temple , and it ’s very strange to see him discussing the faith .
He sounds remarkably like the rest of us do when visiting his museum … :
We were able to visit a Buddhist Temple .
I took photographs of a couple of their “ gods ” — I notice they were not very powerful , as they could n’t even get out past the netting wire that “ protected ” them !
It was so sad to see people praying to the “ god ” behind the curtain — what a reminder they need the gospel to free them from the bondage of this false religion that gives them no hope for the future !
To rephrase : I visited a religious space and took pictures .
How ridiculous that anyone could believe in these things !
Do n’t they know how crazy they look ?
These stories are ridiculous !
These people have no hope !
If only they could see things from my point of view , they would see the light .
Somehow , I think I just bonded with Ken Ham .

A new decision from the Washington Court of Appeals , Roe v. Telletech Customer Care Management LLC , provides a victory for employers who resist employees ’ requests to accommodate their medical marijuana use .
The case involved an employee who , after only two weeks of work , was terminated once she informed management that she was authorized by the State of Washington to use marijuana to treat her migraine headaches .
The company was unwilling to make an exception to its substance abuse policy , and terminated her when the results of a standard pre-employment drug test came back positive for marijuana .
The court answered two questions on appeal .
First , did the Washington State Medical Use of Marijuana Act ( MUMA ) imply a civil cause of action to sue an employer who refuses to accommodate employee use of marijuana ?
Second , for purposes of Washington ’s wrongful discharge tort , does MUMA express a strong public policy in favor of medical marijuana use such that an employer who terminates an employee for off - duty medical marijuana use can be liable ?
The Court answered , “ No ” to both questions .
On the first question , the court found that although MUMA contains language suggesting that its intent was broader than merely protecting Washington citizens from criminal prosecution for medical marijuana use , it was not so broad as to protect an employee from discharge for being a medical marijuana user .
In particular , the employee argued that language in MUMA stating that , “ Nothing in this chapter requires any accommodation of any medical use of marijuana in any place of employment , ” should be construed to mean that an employer is required to accommodate the medical use of marijuana by an employee off - site and off - duty .
The court disagreed with this overly technical interpretation , and found that the statute did not create a right for an employee to file suit against her employer .
For essentially the same reasons , the court rejected the plaintiff ’s wrongful discharge theory .
This is a good decision for Washington employers , but , the state of the law on accommodation of medical marijuana use in Oregon is in flux .
Because marijuana remains illegal under federal controlled substances law , there is no duty to accommodate medical marijuana under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act .
For Oregon employers though , there is conflicting authority on whether employers have an obligation to accommodate medical marijuana use under the Oregon disability statute .
The Oregon Supreme Court and the Oregon Court of Appeals have each had the opportunity to address the question in the past three years , but have declined to do so .
The Bureau of Labor and Industries ( BOLI ) , however , has taken the position that a temporary employee who sought to be hired on a permanent basis but was not because of his medical marijuana use , presented substantial evidence of disability discrimination and failure to reasonably accommodate when there was evidence that he had performed his assignments capably .
The Court of Appeals ’ review of the BOLI determinationwhich declined to reach the merits of the reasonable accommodation claim and instead held that the employer had waived any objection to BOLI ’s findingis presently on appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court .
Until the Oregon Supreme Court provides more guidance on an employer ’s duty to accommodate medical marijuana use , BOLI is likely to continue with its past interpretation .
If you ’re an Oregon employer , and an employee requests that you accommodate his or her “ disability ” by making an exception to your substance abuse policy to allow the use of medical marijuana , what should you do ?
Follow your usual procedures for considering reasonable accommodations .
Is the employee disabled ?
Is there another accommodation that would be reasonable and effective ?
Does the employee work in a safety - sensitive position ?
Would accommodating the applicant or employee using medical marijuana create an undue hardship ?
Although addressing medical marijuana issues presents employers with challenges , the reasonable accommodation process still allows the employer to choose the accommodation , as long as it is effective .

Longer lifespans means in 20 years there will be nearly twice as many people suffering from dementia in the world as there are today , experts have warned .
In 2010 there will be 35.6 million people across the world with dementia and Alzheimer ’s disease , which will almost double to 65.7 million in 2030 , according to British researchers .
They estimated that the number would nearly double again 20 years later , to 115.4 million in 2050 .
Currently about 700,000 people in the UK have dementia , more than half having Alzheimer ’s .
Earlier predictions said that number would touch a million in less than 20 years , and hit 1.7 million by 2051 .
The work was published by Alzheimer ’s Disease International ( ADI ) in the World Alzheimer ’s Report 2009 .
Leader of the research , Professor Martin Prince from the Institute of Psychiatry at King ’s College London , said the findings highlighted pressure on dementia carers .
He said : ‘ In all parts of the world , carers , who are most commonly female and the spouses or children of the persons with dementia , often experience high levels of strain .
‘ Studies reviewed in the new report suggest that half to three - quarters of carers have significant psychological illness , while up to a third have clinical depression . ’
The science writing in “ The Strangest Man ” is n’t glib , but neither does it require problem - solving on the part of the reader .
In most cases , Farmelo presents the technical matter clearly and efficiently , and in all cases — one of the great joys of the book —
Dirac ’s scientific insights are placed within the circumstances in which they were born : e.g. , the “ sweltering July ” of 1926 when Dirac , sitting at his college desk , produced his paper on what became Fermi - Dirac statistics .
In a prologue , Farmelo describes a visit to the elderly Dirac paid by his biologist colleague Kurt Hofer .
Through the eyes of Hofer , we see Dirac suddenly break out of monosyllables to talk for two hours with increasing vehemence about his monstrous father .
This represents the author ’s careful decision to keep the tale Dirac told about his childhood separate from — even as it overshadows — the rest of the book , and it ends with Hofer ’s thoughts , not Dirac ’s : “ ‘ I simply could not conceive of any childhood as dreadful as Dirac ’s . ’ . . .
Could it be that Dirac — usually as literal - minded as a computer — was exaggerating ?
Hofer could not help asking himself , over and again : ‘ Why was Paul so bitter , so obsessed with his father ? ’ ”
The conflict between this prologue ( which gives ample reason for Dirac to be bitter about his father ) and the seemingly warm family life that emerges in the first chapter casts a tension over the rest of the book very similar to that felt when reading a mystery .
And as in a mystery , the penultimate chapter sheds new light .
There Farmelo delves into a sensitive exploration of the possibility that Dirac was autistic , and of the ways in which his lack of facility in reading the emotions of others affected their perceptions of him and his perceptions of them .
The emphasis on Dirac ’s childhood as a story — one Farmelo ( along with me ) believes to be true — usefully reinforces the importance of point of view .
In a memorable episode , Dirac and his wife visit their closest friends , Peter and Anna Kapitza , in Russia .
In 1934 , the long arm of the Soviet state had wrenched Kapitza , despite his devoted long - distance fellow - traveling , away from his lab at Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford and back into the Soviet Union .
In 1937 the friends reunited at the Kapitzas ’ summer house in the piney woods of Bolshevo , “ with wild strawberries ripe for gathering and a fast - flowing river close by . ”
They arrived only “ days before Stalin authorized the torture of suspected enemies of the people , ” Farmelo writes .
“ On the roads around Bolshevo , some of the trucks marked ‘ Meat ’ and ‘ Vegetables ’ hid prisoners on their way to be shot and buried in the forests to the north of the city which Dirac admired through his binoculars . ”
Farmelo handles such scenes with a refreshing , cleareyed understanding of how complicated the world actually is .
Dirac did not — probably could not — know what the Soviet Union really was ; he also could not know who his father really was , and his father could not really know him .
These complexities and unresolvably cubist perspectives make , paradoxically , for the most satisfying and memorable biography I have read in years .
The affections of a woman have to be won through the peacock dance of success and refinement , or through the deceit of lies .
And then sustained for years through many strange virtues , or more lies .
The price of love , above all , is monogamy .
One man decided to break free .
And he slept with over 1,300 women paying them over £ 115,000 .
This is his story .
Having slept with more than 1,300 prostitutes , at a cost of £ 115,000 , kindly allow me my convictions .
I remember the first time I had sex — I still have the receipt .
The girl was alive , as far as I could tell , she was warm and she was better than nothing .
She cost me £ 20 .
I was 16 then and I ’m 47 now .
I have spent 25 years throwing my money and heart at tarts .
I have slept with every nationality in every position in every country .
From high - class call girls at £ 1,000 a pop to the meat - rack girls of Soho at £ 15 , I have probably slept with more than 1,300 prostitutes , at a cost of £ 115,000 .
I am a connoisseur of prostitution : I can take its bouquet , taste it , roll it around my mouth , give you the vintage .
I have used brothels , saunas , private homes from the Internet and ordered girls to my flat prompt as pizza .
While we are on the subject , I have also run a brothel .
And I have been a male escort .
I wish I was more ashamed .
But I ’m not .
I love prostitutes and everything about them .
And I care about them so much I do n’t want them to be made legal .
In English brothels you shuffle into a seedy room so dim you can only meet the girl by Braille .
But in New York last year I sat on a four - poster bed while 10 girls paraded in front of me one by one , like bowls of sushi on a carousel .
“ Hi , ” they would say , “ I ’m Tiffany ” , “ I ’m Harmony ” , “ I ’m Michelle ” , and I would rise and kiss them .
It was so touching , so sweet , so kind .
There should always , no matter what , be politeness .
It is the way the outside world should work , selfishly but honestly .
The great thing about sex with whores is the excitement and variety .
If you say you ’re enjoying sex with the same person after a couple of years , you ’re either a liar or on something .
Of all the sexual perversions , monogamy is the most unnatural .
Most of our affairs run the usual course .
Fever . Boredom .
Trapped .
This explains much of the friction in our lives — love being the delusion that one woman differs from another .
But with brothels there is always the exhilaration of not knowing what you ’re going to get .
The problem with normal sex is that it leads to kissing and pretty soon you ’ve got to talk to them .
Once you know someone well the last thing you want to do is screw them .
I like to give , never to receive ; to have the power of the host , not the obligation of the guest .
I can stop writing this and within two minutes I can be chained , in the arms of a whore .
I know I am going to score and I know they do n’t really want me .
And within 10 minutes I am back writing .
What I hate are meaningless and heartless one - night stands where you tell all sorts of lies to get into bed with a woman you do n’t care for .
The worst things in life are free .
Value seems to need a price tag .
How can we respect a woman who does n’t value herself ?
When I was young I used to think it was n’t who you wanted to have sex with that was important , but who you were comfortable with socially and spiritually .
Now I know that ’s rubbish .
It ’s who you want to have sex with that ’s important .
In the past I have deceived the women I have been with .
You lie to two people in your life ; your partner and the police .
Everyone else gets the truth .
Part of me used to enjoy the deception .
There was something about the poverty of desire with one ’s girlfriend .
Sex without betrayal I found meaningless .
Without cruelty there was no banquet .
Having a secret life is exhilarating .
I also have problems with unpaid - for sex .
I am repulsed by the animality of the body , by its dirt and decay .
The horror for me is the fact that the sublime , the beautiful and the divine are inextricable from basic animal functions .
For some reason money mitigates this .
Because it is anonymous .
What I hate with women generally is the intimacy , the invasion of my innermost space , the slow strangulation of my art .
The writer chained for life to the routine of a wage slave and the ritual of copulation .
When I love somebody , I feel sort of trapped .
Three years ago , I was saved .
I found a girl whom I could fall in love with … and sleep with prostitutes with .
She sends me to brothels to sleep with women for her .
I buy her girls for her birthday and we go to whorehouses together .
I am free forever from the damp , dark prison of eternal love .
A prostitute exists outside the establishment .
She is either rejected by it or in opposition to it , or both .
It takes courage to cross this line .
She deserves our respect , not our punishment .
And certainly not our pity or prayers .
Of course , the general feeling in this country [ the UK ] is that the man is somehow exploiting the woman , but I do n’t believe this .
In fact , the prostitute and the client , like the addict and the dealer , is the most successfully exploitative relationship of all .
And the most pure .
It is free of ulterior motives .
There is no squalid power game .
The man is not taking and the woman is not giving .
The whore fuck is the purest fuck of all .
Why does a sleazy bastard like me like whores so much ?
Why pay for it ?
The problem is that the modern woman is a prostitute who does n’t deliver the goods .
Teasers are never pleasers ; they greedily accept presents to seal a contract and then break it .
At least the whore pays the flesh that ’s haggled for .
The big difference between sex for money and sex for free is that sex for money usually costs a lot less .
But it is more than this .
What I want is the sensation of sex without the boredom of its conveyance .
Brothels make possible contacts of astounding physical intimacy without the intervention of personality .
I love the artificial paradise ; the anonymity ; using money , the most impersonal instrument of intimacy to buy the most personal act of intimacy .
Lust over love , sensation over security , and to fall into a woman ’s arms without falling into her hands .
Having an instinctive sympathy for those condemned by conventional society , I wanted to cross the line myself .
To pay for sex is to strip away the veneer of artifice and civilisation and connect with the true animal nature of man .
Some men proudly proclaim that they have never paid for it .
Are they saying that money is more sacred than sex ?
But one of the main reasons I enjoy prostitutes is because I enjoy breaking the law — another reason I do n’t want brothels made legal .
There is a charm about the forbidden that makes it desirable .
When I have dinner every evening in Soho I always think : is n’t scampi delicious — what a pity it is n’t illegal .
I ’m sure I am not alone in this .
Even Adam himself did not want the apple for the apple ’s sake ; he wanted it only because it was forbidden .
As for the girls , the argument is that making it legal will somehow make it safer , but Soho has one of the lowest crime rates in the country .
Anyway , crime and risk are part of the texture of life .
Indeed , Freud tells us : ‘ Life loses interest when the highest stake in the game of living , life itself , may not be risked . ’
Risk is what separates the good part of life from the tedium .
I decided to ask my Claudia , my favourite prostitute .
I first spotted her in the street in Knightsbridge ten years ago and was so taken by her haunted beauty that I decided to follow her .
There was an air of great quality about Claudia .
The faces of English girls look as if there is not enough material to go round .
They have thin lips and papery eyelids , box jawbones , prominent Adam ’s apples and withered hearts .
Claudia looks Mediterranean — her lips are full and curly , her nostrils flared , her eyes black and as big as saucers .
She walked and I stalked all the way to Soho and down Brewer Street .
No .
No way .
She could n’t be !
She turned , and walked into a brothel .
I could n’t believe it .
I could fuck Raquel Welch for £ 25 .
When I ask if she wants prostitution legalised , she reacts violently : “ No way !
I tried to take a regular job a few months ago .
After tax and national insurance I was left with practically nothing .
So I came back here .
On a good day here I can take £ 500 .
I do n’t have a pimp , so after paying the overheads and the maid I ’ve got more than enough . ”
There you are .
Income tax has made more liars out of the British people than prostitution .
I know a little bit about the business side .
Some years ago I became a madam and a male escort .
I turned one of the rooms in my flat in Shepherd Market into a knocking shop and joined an escort agency .
I went into prostitution looking for love , not money .
That said , I always took cash .
The women wanted company , someone willing to please at the midnight hour , and straight sex .
It was nerve - wracking wondering if I was going to be able to get it up or get on , but at least I had a valid reason for liking my lovers — they paid me .
I did n’t care if someone called me a whore and a pimp .
So you see , I have always been a prostitute by sympathy .
As for the rest of society , prostitution is the mirror of man , and man has never been in danger of becoming bogged down in beauty .
So why do n’t we leave it alone ?
Or learn to love it , like me ?
Sex is one of the most wholesome , spiritual and natural things money can buy .
And like all games , it becomes more interesting when played for money .
And even more so when it is illegal .
Hookers and drunks instinctively understand that common sense is the enemy of romance .
Will the bureaucrats and politicians please leave us some unreality .
I know what you are thinking .
That it ’s all very well for people like me to idealise whores and thieves ; to think that the street is somehow noble and picturesque ; I have never had to live there .
But so what ?
One day I will .
Until such time , I have to pay for it .
How else would someone young , rich and handsome get sex in this city ?
Yes , yes , I know .
Prostitution is obscene , debasing and disgraceful .

No one is perfect .
We could all do some good by doing a little more of this and a little less of that .
That is why personal development is a never - ending process .
If you want to change a behavior you could always go see a Cognitive - Behavioral Therapist .
But that can be an expensive option , and most people do n’t have severe behavior disorders like what you may find in some cases of post - traumatic stress disorder , builimia nervosa , OCD , clinical depression , autism , and schizophrenia ( those who would most warrant a visit to a professional therapist ) .
But just because we do n’t have a mental illness does n’t mean we should n’t intend on improving our habits .
And why not become a better person everyday ?
This is why I constantly recommend people learn the art of mindfulness ; just a couple weeks ago I wrote an article that discusses how to apply mindfulness of both body and mind during everyday chores like showering , cleaning , and eating / cooking .
Once you develop the fundamentals to mindfulness you can apply your practice to almost anything .
Over time it is not uncommon to notice that when you apply mindfulness to an activity you are also changing the way you react and interact with it – psychologists could call this a certain kind of observer effect ( although this is n’t how the term is commonly used ) .
Usually when we raise awareness on an issue ( whether it is a personal or even political one ) we become more motivated to correct it .
In the same way we can correct bad habits by becoming more aware of them , especially as they happen .
In many ways this is the cornerstone and purpose of Right Mindfulness , as the Buddha lays out in his Noble Eightfold Path .
Start by choosing a bad habit of yours .
Some of the most common habits people wish to correct are :
1. Cigarette smoking
2. Unhealthy eating
3. Alcohol and drugs
4. Short temper
5. Wasteful spending
6. Cheating
7. Nail biting
8 . Talking on phone while driving
9. Procrastination ( actively choosing to put off work in order to do something else )
10 . Sleeping late
Try to recognize the desire to do these bad habits when it arises .
At first , you will probably miss it – so just be mindful of your mental and physical state while you are actually performing the bad habit .
What type of satisfaction do you get ?
Is it long lasting or short lasting ?
Do you feel good after you have completed the act ?
Or is there a component of guilt or shame to it ?
These types of observations will better prepare you to be mindful of the whole process of your actions .
Once you spot the initial arising of desire , then you are put in a position to make a change .
For an example : let ’s pretend you like to enjoy a cigarette after you eat a meal .
You are already going to have a good clue as to when the desire to smoke a cigarette will arise .
But after you finish your meal do n’t go right towards a cigarette .
Just sit there and watch how your body and mind react to the situation .
Is it really that urgent to have a cigarette , or can it wait ?
You may continue sitting and find that you actually do n’t want a cigarette .
Your awareness of your situation may have already somewhat dissipated that “ autopilot - like reflex ” to smoke after every meal .
Of course it will take much practice before you actually instill this behavior into your psyche .
It is more likely that your desire to smoke will eventually arise , especially if it is a bad habit you have had for years .
But instead of reacting to it as if it were an impulse – just sit there and watch desire .
Watch how your body and mind try to convince you that you need a cigarette .
The longer you can suspend the action – and sustain your attention on desire itself – the more you will come to know about how you are motivated to do certain behaviors .
This can become very useful knowledge when you want to quit bad habits and even pick up good ones .
What does desire feel like ?
Does it slowly intensify overtime until you feel like you ca n’t bare it any longer ?
Or does the feeling pulsate ?
Perhaps one moment you really want a cigarette , but as you wait longer the feeling seems to dissipate and you can go on without one .
Keep watching .
Does the desire then re-arise even stronger ?
Or does it begin to mellow out ?
While you watch this feeling of desire remain mindful of the thoughts in your head as well .
Are they trying to persuade you that this is a stupid idea , or that you should just smoke anyway ?
Ask yourself , “ Do I really want to change this behavior ?
Do I have enough good reasons to quit ?
Do I have the strength of will to do it ? ”
Do n’t let your ego bend your will .
Keep the mind sharp .
Ask the right questions , and try your best to suspend action and sustain attention towards this process of desire .
If you know in your heart that you need to change this detrimental habit then put the energy into being mindful of desire as often as you can .
Only by being mindful of your body and mind can you truly know yourself and what motivates your actions .
Know the types of situations that trigger the bad habit .
And know desire – its impermanence – and the tricks it tries in order to feed the ego .
My best advice is to watch desire whenever you can .
Dissect it like a scientist .
Break it up into parts .
Watch how it changes .
Watch how it affects both the body and mind .
And most importantly , watch how it comes and goes .
Whether you decide to continue doing the bad habit or not – desire almost certainly never lasts forever .
Be especially mindful of that .

Three - dimensional images are expected jump out of movie theaters and into living rooms by next year .
Panasonic demonstrates 3 - D television at a recent technology expo in Atlanta , Georgia .
Sony and Panasonic say they will release home 3 - D television systems in 2010 ; Mitsubishi and JVC are reported to be working on similar products .
" TV finally becomes real " in three dimensions , said Robert Perry , an executive vice president at Panasonic .
" You 're in it .
It 's the next frontier . "
Perry compared the 3 - D transition to the switch from black - and - white to color television and the shift from standard - to high - definition images .
See what 3 - D TV demos look like »
ESPN is test - recording some sporting events in 3 - D , using cameras with two sets of lenses , which would make football players appear to jump out of home television screens during live 3 - D broadcasts .
And , although television makers have n't released specifics , the price of 3 - D TV -- which requires a new television , broadcasting content and 3 - D glasses -- is not expected to be substantially higher than some high - definition televisions on the market now .
Still , there are skeptics who say that 3 - D is not ready for prime - time home viewing .
There are concerns that 3 - D broadcasts , which require twice the data , will gobble up an unworkable amount of television bandwidth .
And some worry that 3 - D glasses and graphics wo n't make a smooth transition to American living rooms .
Shane Sturgeon , publisher of HDTV Magazine , said some of the glasses give him a headache and will block some people from buying the new technology .
" From what I 've seen from most of the manufacturers , it 's just not there yet , " he said of 3 - D TV technology .
" I think right now , the technology -- whether you 're talking about the refresh rate or the strobing or the glasses -- there are too many things right now that get in the way of enjoyment of the film for it to kick off . "
All 3 - D technology relies on the idea that if separate images are presented to the left and right eyes , the human brain will combine them and create the illusion of a third dimension .
TV makers go about this in different ways , though .
Panasonic and Sony , which demonstrated their products for CNN at a recent tech expo in Atlanta , Georgia , use " active glasses " and TVs with high refresh rates to achieve the effect .
Two images , one for the right eye and one for the left eye , alternate quickly on the TV .
Shutters on the 3 - D glasses swap the viewer 's vision from right eye to left eye at the same rate : 120 hertz , or 240 hertz for the images together .
The TV connects with the glasses through a sensor that 's placed between the lenses on the glasses .
" It 's like a little Venetian blind : open , close , open , close , open , close , " John Wyckoff , a Sony content manager , said of the glasses .
The effect moves so quickly that it tricks the brain into merging the images and creates the perspective needed to see images in 3 - D , he said .
Glance away from the TV , though , and you can see the lenses opening and closing , which irritates some people .
Those who saw the technology at the recent Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association Expo seemed wowed by Panasonic 's 3 - D footage of Olympic events and skiers who appeared to send snow flying into the laps of the audience .
David Lesch fidgeted with his 3 - D glasses during Panasonic 's demo but said the 3 - D picture on the company 's 103 - inch plasma screen was excellent .
However , it may not be effective for all TV programming , he said .
" I cannot imagine that I will watch CNN in 3 - D , " said Lesch , sales director at AV Media , which sells electronics .
" But for sports , yes .
To watch soccer and ice hockey -- anything -- that would be great . "
These next - generation televisions would be able to play shows in 2 - D or 3 - D .
They also would be able to show video games in 3 - D , which Sony demonstrated at the expo in Atlanta .
Sturgeon , of HDTV Magazine , said JVC is working on a type of 3 - D technology that 's different form the strobing glasses used by Panasonic and Sony .
JVC 's version uses polarized glasses to separate the right - eye image from the left - eye image and is more pleasing to the eye , he said .
Aside from the kooky glasses , people who want to watch television that jumps off the screen will need something to watch .
The process of making live television work in 3 - D probably would involve a major conversion of broadcast equipment .
Also , Blu-ray is said to be working on a product that would play three - dimensional movies at home .
Panasonic and Sony said they 're still working out some kinks in their 3 - D entertainment systems .
The TV makers hope to ride the wave of popularity of improved stereoscopic 3 - D movies , such as recent hit " Up , " that are being shown in theaters .
Perry , of Panasonic , said he expects 3 - D TV to be common in homes within five to 10 years .
Technology that will make 3 - D TV possible without glasses should be ready in 10 to 15 years , he said .
Michael Bridwell , spokesman for Digital Projection , a company that makes high - end 3 - D home theaters , said 3 - D is the biggest technology coming to television and home movies in the foreseeable future .
Well , at least " until we get to holograms , " he said .

Enlarge By Bolonchen Regional Archaeological Project
This is one of the exceptionally well preserved buildings discovered at Kiuic .
This building dates to the Late / Terminal Classic ( A.D. 800 - 1000 ) and is part of the later major royal Palace discovered at the site .
Ringing two abandoned pyramids are nine palaces " frozen in time " that may help unravel the mystery of the ancient Maya , reports an archaeological team .
Hidden in the hilly jungle , the ancient site of Kiuic ( KIE - yuk ) was one of dozens of ancient Maya centers abandoned in the Puuc region of Mexico 's Yucatan about 10 centuries ago .
The latest discoveries from the site may capture the moment of departure .
" The people just walked away and left everything in place , " says archaeologist George Bey of Millsaps College in Jackson Miss. , co-director of the Labna - Kiuic Regional Archaeological Project .
" Until now , we had little evidence from the actual moment of abandonment , it 's a frozen moment in time . "
The ancient , or " classic " Maya were part of a Central American civilization best known for stepped pyramids , beautiful carvings and murals and the widespread abandonment of cities around 900 A.D. in southern Mexico , Guatemala , Belize and El Salvador .
They headed for the northern Yucatan , where Spanish conquistadors met their descendants in the 1500s ( 6 million modern Maya still live in Central America today ) .
Past work by the team , led by Bey and Tomas Gallareta of Mexico 's National Institute of Archaeology and History , shows the Maya had inhabited the Puuc region since 500 B.C.
So why they headed for the coast with their brethren is just part of the mystery of the Maya collapse .
New clues may come from Kiuic , where the archaeologists explored two pyramids and , most intriguingly , plantation palaces on the ridges ringing the center .
Of particular interest : a hilltop complex nicknamed " Stairway to Heaven " by Gallareta ( that 's " Escalera al Cieloa " for Spanish - speaking Led Zeppelin fans ) because of a long staircase leading from Kiuic to a central plaza nearly a mile away .
Both the pyramids and the palaces look like latter - day additions to Kiuic , built in the 9th century , just as Maya centers farther south were being abandoned .
" The influx of wealth ( at Kiuic ) may spring from immigration , " Bey says , as Maya headed north .
One pyramid was built atop what was originally a palace , allowing the rulers of Kiuic to simultaneously celebrate their forebears and move to fancier digs in the hills .
When the team started exploring the hilltop palaces , five vaulted homes to the south of the hilltop plaza and four to the north , the archaeologists found tools , stone knives and axes , corn - grinder stones called metates ( muh - TAH - taze ) and pots still sitting in place .
" It was completely unexpected , " Bey says .
" It looks like they just turned the metates on their sides and left things waiting for them to come back . "
" Their finds look very interesting and promising , " says archaeologist Takeshi Inomata of the University of Arizona , who is not part of the project .
" If it indeed represents rapid abandonment , it provides important implications about the social circumstance at that time and promises detailed data on the way people lived . "
Inomata is part of a team exploring Aguateca , an abandoned Maya center in Guatemala renowned for its preservation .
" I should add that the identification of rapid abandonment is not easy .
There are other types of deposits — particularly ritual deposits — that result in very similar kinds of artifact assemblages , " Inomata cautions , by email .
Bey and colleagues presented some of their findings earlier this year at the Society for American Archaeology meeting in Atlanta .
The team hopes to publish its results and dig further at Kiuic to prove their finding of rapid abandonment there .
" I think you could compare it to Pompeii , where people locked their doors and fled , taking some things but leaving others , " Bey says .
So far , what drove people to leave the site remains a mystery , as it is for the rest of the ancient Maya .
The only sign of warfare is a collection of spear points found in the central plaza of Kiuic .
There are signs that construction halted there — a stucco - floored plaza sits half - complete , for example .
" Drought seems more likely , that would halt construction , " Bey says .
Having climbed the " Stairway to Heaven " a few times , Bey can answer one minor mystery , however .
Why were n't the palace sites looted as so many other Maya sites have been ?
" The hills are a good climb , " he says .
" People just did n't bother to climb the hills to search the rooms . "

AS THE fight over US health reform heats up , an analysis has emerged showing that the crippling cost of not changing the existing system will force people ’s spending on non-medical services to fall even as the country becomes richer overall .
Fears over rising costs have been a critical factor in kick - starting the reform debate .
The US spends around $ 7400 per person per year on healthcare , twice the health costs in Canada , the next highest spender .
This increase is outstripping the nation ’s ability to pay .
Over the past decade the rise in health spending has been more than 2 percentage points …
China 's government and the domestic market are calling for greater spending .
Economic growth may be maintained , writes Huo Weiya , but US - style living may mean we need another two Earths .
From ChinaDialogue , part of the Guardian Environment Network
To maintain an 8 % economic - growth target through the current global financial crisis , the Chinese government has launched an investment stimulus package worth four trillion yuan ( US $ 585 billion ) and eased bank - lending restrictions .
But another important measure is the increasing of individual consumption .
In 2008 , the Chinese government launched " village appliance " schemes nationwide , with subsidies used to increase sales of televisions , refrigerators , washing machines and mobile phones in rural areas .
Another two billion yuan ( nearly US$ 300 million ) was invested in 2009 in a " new - for - old " policy that will see individuals and businesses sell old appliances back to the state and receive a 10 % subsidy on new purchases .
Besides this , the automobile market is benefiting from subsidies and tax breaks , and many cities have handed out shopping vouchers to local people .
The export - oriented economy has been hard - hit by the economic turmoil , increasing the government 's determination to make the domestic market the engine of growth .
" Increase domestic demand , maintain growth " is seen as the secret to guiding the economy through hard times .
But there are dangers hidden in this strategy , and there will be considerable environmental consequences if a long - term approach is not taken .
First , there is the issue of reusing resources .
In China , it is not just rubbish that gets buried in landfill ; many materials that could be reused also end up there .
And once products have been used , they are treated as rubbish and thrown away .
Any recycling that takes place is often the result of scrap collectors sifting through rubbish for the more valuable items ; the rest goes to scrap or compost .
Increasing amounts of rubbish mean that many cities – including Beijing – are at risk of being surrounded by landfill sites and are turning to power - generating incinerator plants .
This is controversial , with environmental bodies saying China should be sorting and recycling its rubbish .
But China does not have a system for sorting rubbish .
When explaining the " new - for - old " policy , a National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) spokesperson said that it would see five million appliances replaced , while 90 million of the types of appliances mentioned above would be discarded annually .
But the pervasive presence of scrap collectors throughout China 's cities demonstrates that standardised collection and disassembly companies are not yet common .
The sector is dominated by small , informal traders , and the environmental consequences of this already have already been covered in our earlier article " Low - carbon living begins at work " .
The authorities released guidance alongside the " village appliances " and " new - for - old " policies , but with the recycling sector just getting started , it is unclear if the measures will be effective and if they will reach out into the rural areas .
In February , the State Council issued Regulations on Recovery Processing of Waste Electrical and Electronic Products , setting out the direction for the sector .
But this only comes into effect in 2011 .
Until then , those small scrap merchants will be the main channel for recycling .
They will purchase discarded appliances and then sell them on to companies unable to process them properly or to small , unregistered workshops .
The inadequate processing of waste does n't just create pollution ; it 's also the cause of significant waste .
According to the same State Council spokesperson , the new - for - old policy would see 2.3 million tonnes of resources collected for reuse .
But without systems in place , much of that will be treated as garbage .
Another risk is the inflation of consumer expectations .
A special feature on a well - known Chinese website , 21cn.com , recently described white - collar workers as the killers of the environment .
The white - collar lifestyle involves high levels of consumption , and consumption is the natural enemy of the environment .
In a poll on the website , the vast majority of those surveyed said that it is everyone 's duty to protect the environment .
But despite these views , what actually happens is different .
From July 1 , hotels in the city of Changsha were no longer supplying items such as disposable toothbrushes and single - use tubes of toothpaste for free ; they will be charged for .
A survey on People.com.cn found 77 % of respondents opposed the move , complaining of inconvenience .
These two surveys demonstrate the clash between ideas of consumption and environmental protection .
Environmental awareness was non-existent three decades ago .
Today , the environment is often the focus of public debate .
But the Chinese seem to be becoming ever more like the Americans they so often point fingers at – happy to protect the environment , as long as they do n't need to change their lifestyles .
The " 3R " principles of waste - management strategy are " reduce " ( to minimise energy and resource use ) , " reuse " ( to use an item more than once ) , and " recycle " ( to process used items into new products ) .
Reduction and recycling have been put into political and economic practice , but reuse -- the concept at the heart of the circular economy – has been given the cold shoulder .
Most consumers seem to have left environmental matters to environmental groups .
As long as they can afford to , they 'll consume as much as possible that is new .
China is placing more emphasis on its domestic market , with a range of methods applied to increase consumption and boost the economy , thereby making consumption seem ever more natural .
With both the government and the market calling for greater spending , will China 's potential consumption be realised ?
The Chinese did not use to be heavy consumers , either because they did not have the funds or the lack of a welfare system meant they saved their money for a rainy day .
But 30 years of economic growth have given us ample material desires – a lifestyle of keeping up with the rich , keeping up with the Americans , has taken root .
As soon as we are able to consume , we do so – no less than the citizens of developed nations do .
Economic growth may be maintained , but as the environmentalists warn , we may need another two Earths to meet the new US - style consumption of the Chinese nation .

The practical , fuel efficient Chevrolet Aveo can save you money both on the purchase price and the gasoline it sips in use .
The four - door sedan seats four , and the hatchback offers easily accessible load space for canvas sacks stuffed with banknotes .
But if you 're going to use it for a getaway , hang onto your car keys after you rob that bank .
Neglecting that handy hint landed a gang of four robbers in the clink in the town of Bear , Delaware , yesterday , after one of them locked the keys to his Chevrolet Aveo in the bank they had just robbed .
Three men wearing wigs , along with one woman , entered the Artisans Bank yesterday morning just after 9 am .
They fired a shot into the ceiling , tied up two employees with duct tape , and herded six others into a bathroom .
After forcing an employee to get money from the vault and teller drawers , they fled -- leaving the car keys inside .
Once they realized they could n't get back inside , the female getaway driver pulled up in a Ford Escort and sped them away .
Police stopped the Ford soon thereafter , and arrested Olman Mencia , 21 , of Atlantic City , New Jersey ; his brother Marvin Mencia , 22 , of Egg Harbor , New Jersey ; and brother and sister Jeffrey Johnson , 21 , and Ciara Johnson , 20 , also of Atlantic City .
The four racked up six counts of robbery , eight kidnapping offenses , and further charges of aggravated menacing , conspiracy , weapons offenses and wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony .

Quantitative easing in the US , UK and Eurozone ...
BY END - JULY 2009 , sales of new US Treasury bonds had already outstripped full - year sales in calendar 2008 .
Creating money from nowhere , the Fed 's asset - purchase scheme – better known as quantitative easing – bought bonds equal to more than 18 % of that 7 - month record , effectively financing $ 224bn of the total $ 1.2 trillion in new government bonds .
No , the Fed did n't simply hand that cash straight to the government .
But it funded the national debt via the primary dealers who did buy the bonds ... only to sell them onto the Fed ... and thus stumped up 32 % of the net cash flowing to Treasury from its bond sales ( gross issuance minus maturities ) .
Which was handy .
Because the sums raised by personal taxation fell by one - fifth in the second quarter compared with April - to - June 2008 .
Federal spending rose 6.4 % regardless .
Money from nowhere sure helped .
What of the queasing itself , however ?
Quantitative Easing had a marked effect when the Fed announced its plan in mid-March .
But easing longer - term rates with quantity has n't yet worked as advertised .
The market 's looking queasy instead .
Bond yields are now higher from before the Fed 's March announcement .
More critically still for whatever " exit strategy " the central bank has in mind ( or not ... ) , bond holders seem keener to quit Treasuries than to buy them .
New Treasury bond sales this year have attracted bids for around 2.5 times as much debt as was on offer .
The Fed 's bond purchases , in contrast , have drawn offers of four times as much government debt as it wanted .
Compare and contrast with the Fed 's buying of mortgage - backed bonds – the ostensible source of the entire financial crisis .
There , the bid-cover ratio averages 1.8 times so far in 2009 .
And then , take a glance across the Atlantic ...
The Bank of England has now bought UK gilts equal to all of 2009 's issuance to date .
Buying nearly £ 135 bn - worth inside six months ( $ 220bn ) , it 's financed the equivalent of nearly a quarter of the UK 's outstanding government debt .
But that 's not enough apparently .
Because governor Mervyn King voted at the central bank 's August meeting to raise the money - creation to £ 200 bn .... fully one - half of the outstanding gilt market .
Besides financing the state , however , this phenomenal queasing ... greater by far than anything Weimar Germany tried ... has seen residential mortgage rates charged to consumers rise 0.5 % on average , hitting 4.4 % this summer .
Money - supply growth continues to boom for the financial sector , of course , but the money is n't trickling through to households .
For non-financial businesses , the broad M4 money supply shrank in July by three pence in the Pound compared with a year before .
Bottom line ?
According to BCA Research , " It will likely be at least until the end of next year before growth conditions in the US and UK are robust enough to withstand a reduction in stimulus . "
What all of this money - from - nowhere might mean for the Gold Price – that historic refuge from debt monetization and hyper- inflation – who can say ?
So far , it 's doing little to kick - start a self - sustaining recovery , dumped instead into Anglo - America 's fast - cratering state finances .
But if a flight from queasy economies should slip into a panic , note that the Eurozone is n't safe from this flood of money ex nihilo either .
Back in June , the European Central Bank handed out 12 - month loans to commercial banks at a cost of just 1 % – its current overnight target rate .
No , they 're not financing government debt directly .
But that flood of € 442 billion , equal to well over half - a- trillion dollars , pulled down 12 - month rates in the capital markets by pushing bond prices up .
One - year German Bunds now yield just 0.40 % .
Cheap money parked in government debt was n't perhaps what chief central - banker Jean - Claude Trichet intended .
But the ECB will repeat its offer – unlimited quantities of 12 - month loans , charged at just 1 % – later this month .
Hence Monsieur Trichet 's piece of pure Greenspanese in a speech on Friday :
" Note that an exit strategy is not identical to a particular course of action .
Rather , it lays out a framework and set of principles to govern actions in the face of circumstances in whatever form they take . "
Got that ?
Feeling queasy ...?
" If there 's an easier way to Buy Gold , I 've yet to find it , " says one Bullion Vault user .

So Senator Max Baucus , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , has released his “ mark ” on proposed legislation  which would normally be the basis for the bill that eventually emerges from his committee .
And serious supporters of health care reform will soon face their long - dreaded moment of truth .
You see , it has been clear for months that whatever health - care bill finally emerges will fall far short of reformers ’ hopes .
Yet even a bad bill could be much better than nothing .
The question is where to draw the line .
How bad does a bill have to be to make it too bad to vote for ?
Now , the moment of truth is n’t here quite yet :
There ’s enough wrong with the Baucus proposal as it stands to make it unworkable and unacceptable .
But that said , Senator Baucus ’s mark is better than many of us expected .
If it serves as a basis for negotiation , and the result of those negotiations is a plan that ’s stronger , not weaker , reformers are going to have to make some hard choices about the degree of disappointment they ’re willing to live with .
Of course , those who insist that we must have a single - payer system 
Medicare for all  wo n’t accept any plan that tries , instead , to cajole and coerce private health insurers into covering everyone .
But while many reformers , myself included , would prefer a single - payer system if we were starting from scratch , international experience shows that it ’s not the only way to go .
Several European countries , including Switzerland and the Netherlands , have managed to achieve universal coverage with a mainly private insurance system .
When I next get around to teaching philosophy of science again I think I ’ll have my students watch an episode or two from Feynman ’s Messenger series of lectures .
With the possibility of having studied only humanities subjects from the age of 16 it ’s no surprise that there ’s many a student with only the sketchiest idea of physics .
Last time around when I asked the class to name any of Newton ’s laws of motion , a long wait ensued before someone finally proffered an approximation to the first .
I was watching the second lecture yesterday , towards the end of which Feynman distinguishes between what he calls a ‘ Babylonian ’ approach and a ‘ Greek ’ one .
His idea here is that mathematicians have a tendency to arrange their theories in the Greek style on an axiomatic basis , while this ca n’t work in physics , at least in a time of theoretical growth , because it is never clear which approach is basic .
For example , one may view a physical theory in terms of forces or field potentials or conservation laws or paths of least action , and unpredictably any one of them might provide new insight as to how to link together physical facts .
I found myself torn between responding in two different ways :
The difference is only apparent .
Multiple ways of thinking about the same piece of mathematics play the same role of allowing insight into the best way to proceed there .
The difference is real , but mathematics can be done in the same ‘ Babylonian ’ way , and this should be encouraged .
As representatives of these two responses , let ’s take a look at passages by William Thurston and Pierre Cartier .
In On proof and progress in mathematics Thurston writes :
People have very different ways of understanding particular pieces of mathematics .
To illustrate this , it is best to take an example that practicing mathematicians understand in multiple ways , but that we see our students struggling with .
The derivative of a function fits well .
The derivative can be thought of as : Infinitesimal : the ratio of the infinitesimal change in the value of a function to the infinitesimal change in a function .
Symbolic : the derivative of x n x^n is n x n − 1 n x^{n −1} , the derivative of sin ( x ) sin(x ) is cos ( x ) cos(x ) , the derivative of f ∘ g f \circ g is f ′ ∘ g * g ′ f ' \circ g * g ' , etc. Logical : f ′ ( x ) = d f'( x ) = d if and only if for every ϵ \epsilon there is a δ \delta such that when 0 < | Δ x | < δ 0 \lt | \Delta x| \lt \delta , | f ( x + Δ x ) − f ( x )
Δ x − d | < ϵ . \ left| \ frac{f( x + \ Delta x ) − f( x ) }{ \Delta x} - d \right| \lt \epsilon .
Geometric : the derivative is the slope of a line tangent to the graph of the function , if the graph has a tangent .
Rate : the instantaneous speed of f ( t ) f( t ) , when t t is time .
Approximation :
The derivative of a function is the best linear approximation to the function near a point .
Microscopic :
The derivative of a function is the limit of what you get by looking at it under a microscope of higher and higher power .
This is a list of different ways of thinking about or conceiving of the derivative , rather than a list of different logical definitions .
Unless great efforts are made to maintain the tone and flavor of the original human insights , the differences start to evaporate as soon as the mental concepts are translated into precise , formal and explicit definitions .
I can remember absorbing each of these concepts as something new and interesting , and spending a good deal of mental time and effort digesting and practicing with each , reconciling it with the others .
I also remember coming back to revisit these different concepts later with added meaning and understanding .
The list continues ; there is no reason for it ever to stop .
A sample entry further down the list may help illustrate this .
We may think we know all there is to say about a certain subject , but new insights are around the corner .
Furthermore , one person ’s clear mental image is another person ’s intimidation : 37 .
The derivative of a real - valued function f f in a domain D D is the Lagrangian section of the cotangent bundle T * ( D ) T^{ * } ( D ) that gives the connection form for the unique flat connection on the trivial ℝ \mathbb {R} - bundle D × ℝ D \times \mathbb{R} for which the graph of f f is parallel .

Now for Cartier , where in Mathemagics ( A Tribute to L. Euler and R. Feynman ) he writes
The implicit philosophical belief of the working mathematician is today the Hilbert - Bourbaki formalism .
Ideally , one works within a closed system : the basic principles are clearly enunciated once for all , including ( that is an addition of twentieth century science ) the formal rules of logical reasoning clothed in mathematical form .
The basic principles include precise definitions of all mathematical objects , and the coherence between the various branches of mathematical sciences is achieved through reduction to basic models in the universe of sets …
My thesis is : there is another way of doing mathematics , equally successful , and the two methods should supplement each other and not fight .
This other way bears various names : symbolic method , operational calculus , operator theory …
Euler was the first to use such methods in his extensive study of infinite series , convergent as well as divergent .
The calculus of differences was developed by G. Boole around 1860 in a symbolic way , then Heaviside created his own symbolic calculus to deal with systems of differential equations in electric circuitry .
But the modern master was R. Feynman who used his diagrams , his disentangling of operators , his path integrals …
The method consists in stretching the formulas to their extreme consequences , resorting to some internal feeling of coherence and harmony .
They are obvious pitfalls in such methods , and only experience can tell you that for the Dirac δ \delta - function an expression like x δ ( x ) x \ delta( x ) or δ ′ ( x ) \ delta '( x ) is lawful , but not δ ( x ) / x \ delta( x ) / x or δ ( x ) 2 \ delta( x ) ^2 . ( p. 3 )
On reflection , the Thurston response is the more relevant .
Feynman ’s thought about the dangers of the ‘ Greek ’ approach was n’t so much about concerns of rigour excluding ways of calculating , as about obstructing ways of thinking by ordering concepts as more or less basic , so reducing heuristically valuable ways of thinking to derivatives of more basic reasoning and thereby neglecting them .
But this is just what Thurston warns against within mathematics itself : “ Unless great efforts are made to maintain the tone and flavor of the original human insights , the differences start to evaporate as soon as the mental concepts are translated into precise , formal and explicit definitions . ”
Renault and Fernando Alonso have been cleared to compete in the European Grand Prix in Valencia after winning an appeal against a one - race ban .
The French team were punished after allowing Fernando Alonso to leave the pit lane with a loose wheel , which then came off , at the Hungarian Grand Prix .
However , Alonso will now be able to race at his home grand prix this weekend after the ban was overturned .
Motorsport 's governing body ( FIA ) will instead fine Renault £ 30,000 .
Alonso 's right front wheel came off and bounced across the track at the race four weeks ago , race stewards subsequently ruling that the team 's pit crew knew the wheel was not properly secured and failed to tell the driver .
But Renault team manager Steve Nielsen had said he was confident the team 's suspension would be lifted .
" I 've been optimistic since we got the penalty .
We feel it 's unjust , " he said .
The stewards said Renault 's pit crew " knowingly released car number seven from the pit stop position without one of the retaining devices for the wheel - nuts being securely in position . "
606 : DEBATE
It seems like Renault are the fall guys of the recent events and a point HAS to be made of it
mintroyalle
They also determined that " being aware of this , Renault failed to take any action to prevent the car from leaving the pit lane ... and failed to inform the driver of this problem or to advise him to take appropriate action given the circumstances , even though the driver contacted the team by radio believing he had a puncture . "
However , Nielsen insisted his team did not realise there was a problem with Alonso 's car .
" We admit we did some stuff wrong , but we do n't think that the penalty fits the crime , " added Nielsen .
To argue their case Renault used comparative footage from races where drivers breached safety rules - but either went unpunished , or were punished less severely .
One example was German driver Sebastian Vettel racing at the Australian Grand Prix in March with a loose wheel hanging by the side of his car after colliding with BMW 's Robert Kubica .
Vettel was fined £ 30,000 - the maximum amount that race stewards can levy - for continuing on three wheels and Renault said their punishment - at worst - should be a similar fine .
But Whiting said that incidents such as Vettel 's had not occurred when leaving the pits , but during the race itself .
Renault engineering director Pat Symonds attended the hearing Renault were represented at the hearing by engineering director Pat Symonds and technical director Bob Bell , while F1 race director Charlie Whiting represented the FIA .
With the ban overturned Alonso will now race at his home grand prix while Renault test driver Romain Grosjean is likely to take Nelson Piquet Jr 's seat .
Frenchman Grosjean should be asked to step in after Piquet Jr was told by Renault he will not continue driving for them in F1 this season .
The decision to allow Alonso and his Renault team to race is also likely to delight the Spanish crowd .
" The reason there are two races in Spain is largely because of Fernando 's involvement , " said Nielsen .
" People in Spain were not so interested in F1 until he got involved , and now it 's a big sport there . "
The incident was particularly pertinent as it happened the day after Brazilian Felipe Massa was hospitalised with life - threatening injuries suffered while racing .
The Ferrari driver was struck by an object dislodged from the Brawn GP car of Rubens Barrichello car during qualifying at the Hungaroring .
Massa had surgery on his skull and is recovering .
The previous week , 18 - year - old F2 driver Henry Surtees - the son of former F1 champion John Surtees - was killed after losing consciousness and crashing into the barrier after a stray tyre hit him .

Enlarge By Kin Cheung , AP Sarah Palin 's memoir , Going Rogue : An American Life , will be released Nov. 17 .
NEW YORK  Sarah Palin finished her book quickly and became a best seller even faster .
Just two days after HarperCollins announced that the release of Palin 's memoir , Going Rogue , had been moved up from the spring to Nov. 17 , preorders for the former Alaska governor 's book have made it No. 1 on Barnes & Noble.com on Wednesday and at No. 2 on Amazon.com , trailing only Dan Brown 's The Lost Symbol .
Palin , in collaboration with author Lynn Vincent , completed her 400 - page book just four months after agreeing to terms with HarperCollins , which plans a first printing of 1.5 million copies .

Kebony ASA
Kebony 's product is furfuryl
ONE of the reasons tropical forests are being cut down so rapidly is demand for the hardwoods , such as teak , that grow there .
Hardwoods , as their name suggests , tend to be denser and more durable than softwoods .
But unsustainable logging of hardwoods destroys not only forests but also local creatures and the future prospects of the people who lived there .
It would be better to use softwood , which grows in cooler climes in sustainably managed forests .
Softwoods are fast - growing coniferous species that account for 80 % of the world 's timber .
But the stuff is not durable enough to be used outdoors without being treated with toxic preservatives to protect it against fungi and insect pests .
These chemicals eventually wash out into streams and rivers , and the wood must be retreated .
Moreover , at the end of its life , wood that has been treated with preservatives in this way needs to be disposed of carefully .
One way out of this problem would be an environmentally friendly way of making softwood harder and more durable — something that a Norwegian company called Kebony has now achieved .
It opened its first factory in January .
Kebony stops wood from rotting by placing it in a vat containing a substance called furfuryl alcohol , which is made from the waste left over when sugarcane is processed .
The vat is then pressurised , forcing the liquid into the wood .
Next the wood is dried and heated to 110ºC .
The heat transforms the liquid into a resin , which makes the cell walls of the wood thicker and stronger .
The approach is similar to that of a firm based in the Netherlands called Titan Wood .
Timber swells when it is damp and shrinks when it is dry because it contains groups of atoms called hydroxyl groups , which absorb and release water .
Titan Wood has developed a technique for converting hydroxyl groups into acetyl groups ( a different combination of atoms ) by first drying the wood in a kiln and then treating it with a chemical called acetic anhydride .
The result is a wood that retains its shape in the presence of water , and is no longer recognised as wood by grubs that would otherwise attack it .
It is thus extremely durable .
The products made by both companies are completely recyclable , environmentally friendly and create woods that are actually harder than most tropical hardwoods .
The strengthened softwoods can be used in everything from window frames to spas to garden furniture .
Treated maple is also being adopted for decking on yachts .
The cost is similar to that of teak , but the maple is more durable and easier to keep clean .
Obviously treating wood makes it more expensive .
But because it does not need to receive further treatments — a shed made from treated wood would not need regular applications of creosote , for example — it should prove economical over its lifetime .
Kebony reckons that its pine cladding , for example , would cost a third less than conventionally treated pine cladding over the course of 40 years .
Saving money , then , need not be at the expense of helping save the planet .
It 's a story that will send a chill down your spine , a story of a 60 - year - old father , who locked , beat and starved his wife and daughters for 7 years .
( Watch Video )
Francis Gomes , a 60 - year - old unemployed man , living in Mumbai along with his wife and 3 daughters had confined his family in the house since 2002 .
The father allegedly kept them locked up as he was convinced that his girls would be raped if they even stepped out of home .
It is believed that every morning before Francis left home he would lock the door giving the impression that the family was away .
The women were often denied food and fresh clothing .
The windows had been boarded , denying them sunlight ; they were prohibited from watching television , so much so that when the youngest daughter failed her college exam , the father hit her so hard that she suffered severe neck injuries .
A few months ago , Francis ' second daughter along with the help of an NGO managed to escape the clutches of her father .
While the social workers managed to rescue her , the other 3 women were too scared to leave the house with them , fearing that Francis would successfully hunt them down .
Fortunately , on Tuesday morning social workers belonging to the NGO Anand Rehabilitation Centre along with the police rescued the three women from the house , while Francis was away .
The police now have Mumbai's psycho dad Francis Gomes in their custody , after local resident in Vasai , Mumbai informed the police about his whereabouts following reports in the media .
While the girl , who suffered neck injuries , is being treated in a government hospital , the other two daughters , who are malnourished and traumatised , are under psychological care .
The wife too is under medical care .
Spare a thought for the 130 + individuals who lost their sense of smell after taking various zinc - containing Zicam intranasal products .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned users to stop using said cold remedies , and advised its manufacturer – Matrixx Initiatives – that these products cannot be marketed without FDA approval .
But they were .
Why ?
Because of homeopathy , as this great Associated Press piece by Jeff Donn explains .
Royal Copeland , a New York Senator , homeopath , and principal author of the 1938 Federal Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , discreetly amended said law so that homeopathic remedies were granted the same legal status as regular pharmaceuticals .
But here ’s the sinister part : as long as a remedy is listed by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia Convention of the United States , it is granted full FDA approval .
Proof that it works and is safe ?
Not needed .
Just a place on HPUS ’s list will do .
The AP also reports : Active homeopathic ingredients are typically diluted down to 1 part per million or less , but some are present in much higher concentrations .
The active ingredient in Zicam is 2 parts per 100 .
The FDA has set strict limits for alcohol in medicine , especially for small children , but they do n’t apply to homeopathic remedies .
The American Academy of Pediatrics has said no medicine should carry more than 5 percent alcohol .
The FDA has acknowledged that some homeopathic syrups far surpass 10 percent alcohol .
The National Institutes of Health ’s alternative medicine center spent $ 3.8 million on homeopathic research from 2002 to 2007 but is now abandoning studies on homeopathic drugs .
“ The evidence is not there at this point , ” says the center ’s director , Dr. Josephine Briggs .
At least 20 ingredients used in conventional prescription drugs , like digitalis for heart trouble and morphine for pain , are also used in homeopathic remedies .
Other homeopathic medicines are derived from cancerous or other diseased tissues .
Many are formulated from powerful poisons like strychnine , arsenic or snake venom .
Key to the matter is how homeopathy is defined .
We may know it as being medicine devoid of medicine , but to define it as such would be fallacious : a 30C solution may indeed bear no active ingredient , but one diluted to 2 parts per hundred most certainly does .
But Zicam ’s products do not stand alone : the AP identified up to 800 homeopathic ingredients potentially implicated in health problems reported last year .
I see little point in commenting on the obvious federal legal implications regarding improperly labeled drugs , not to mention the harm caused by trading objectionably on an already objectionable concept , but in my last post , I brought forward the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ’s decision to licence Nelsons Arnicare Arnica 30 c homeopathic pillules .
Well , ladies and gentlemen – assuming you can still hear me as I shout through this gaping chasm of a loophole , if ever there were confirmation that allowing medicines to be sold without any proof of their efficacy or safety is a monumentally stupid idea , this story is undoubtedly it .

World War II games .
Everybody 's played them , everybody 's sick of them .
Unless they 're very easily pleased .
The vast majority of us have stormed the beaches and liberated the cities so many times that we 're very much over the idea of bringing sweet Allied retribution to Fritz and his cackling Nazi chums .
Yes , the World War II " genre " is overdone and killing Germans just is n't as fun as it used to be .
This is n't helped by the volume of WWII games that simply are n't very good .
If you make a World War II game these days , you have to stand out , you have to provide a memorable experience and , most importantly of all , you have to not suck .
Luckily , if you 're a budding developer hoping to make the next big war game , Destructoid is here to help .
Read on ( and be careful of a boob screenshot ) to learn how to make a World War II game that doe n't suck .
Choose a unique setting :
Normandy ?
Done it .
Stalingrad ?
No thanks .
Berlin ?
It 's been done so many , many times .
A World War II shooter benefits from a setting not typically seen in a dozen other games of the same ilk .
The fighting did n't just take place in Russia , France and Germany , guys .
Even if the game must be set in those three countries , at least try and shake things up a little by choosing places you just do n't see very often .
A little French countryside , perhaps , or a small German village as opposed to Berlin .
There are all sorts of locations that can be picked , and you do n't always have to make the main character a soldier during a big battle .
Pandemic 's upcoming WWII game
The Saboteur is one such game that is trying a more unique setting .
It 's set in Paris during the Nazi occupation , and players have to sneakily screw up German operations around the city .
It 's a significant departure from the same old " guns n ' glory " battlefields that make up so many other war games .
Simply changing the setting within the setting can make all the difference in the world .
Alter the perspective :
You know , not every WWII game has to be a first - person - shooter .
It seems to me that third - person- action games are severely under- represented within the WWII setting .
We have a few , with the aforementioned Saboteur being among them , but it seems that -- barring the occasional strategy game -- nearly every WWII game feels the need to be some sort of first - person affair .
The FPS market has , itself , become incredibly saturated and I 'm sure that the gameplay perspective is helping to make players feel sour about WWII titles .
When I even say " World War II " game , what do you imagine first ?
Most of you surely think of Call of Duty , or Medal of Honor , or any number of other FPS games .
Very much like the setting , a simple alteration of perspective can make a dramatic difference to how a game is received .
More Hitler :
What 's the deal with not having Adolf Hitler in WWII games ?
If the original Wolfenstein taught us anything , it 's that shooting Hitler is always good .
Not enough games allow us to shovel bullets into the arse of one of history 's greatest monsters , and I want to know why .
As far as I 'm concerned , there 's nothing tasteless about repeatedly killing Hitler .
Shooting simple Nazis , who were mostly just oblivious soldiers , really is n't as satisfying or righteous as taking out Himmler , Mengele , or any of the other truly evil shits who were manipulating the Nazi war machine .
Why are we always punishing the faceless German soldiers when we could be shooting De Führer in the face with rockets ?
Any game that promotes the varied and brutal mutilation of Germany 's worst chancellor would instantly be hailed as a classic .
At least by me .
It 's a shame that most WWII games pussy out and make up some fictional German general who we 're supposed to hate more than Adolf bloody Hitler !
At least reference the Holocaust and / or other Nazi oppression :
Now hear me out , because I know that you 're instantly assuming this will be a tasteless and facetious suggestion .
I 'm being serious , though .
It 's so easy to throw Nazis into a videogame and simply say , " These guys are evil , shoot them please ! "
However , we never see Nazis actually being very oppressive and evil in the games themselves , preferring instead to simply fulfill pre-packaged villain stereotypes that any other type of bad guy is capable of .
While I 'm obviously not suggesting we have massive interactive gas chamber sequences and scenes full of emaciated Jewish prisoners , I do think that WWII games would have a bit more weight and importance if they actually tried to touch upon some of the most horrific issues involving the Nazi regime .
For everything terrible that time - traveling shooter Darkest of Days did , it at least had one sequence that almost approached interesting .
Late in the game , you 're taken prisoner by German soldiers and are led through a stark , isolated POW camp , full of barbed wire , searchlights and snapping dogs .
It was truly oppressive and , had the game not looked like shit and been simply awful , it may have been a fantastic videogame moment .
More games need to have these sorts of moments if they want to make a truly compelling World War II title .
At the moment , the only real difference between a WWII game and any other generic shooter is that the enemies shout , " Schnell ! "
The real Nazi regime was founded on racial hatred , resentment and the sense that some lives were more valid and worthy than others .
It was an evil , brutal , twisted institution and that 's something that videogames do n't even try to capture .
Perhaps it 's because it takes more effort than developers care to put into their games .
That 's a real shame .
Remember that Nazis did n't call themselves Nazis :
This always annoys me when it happens .
The Germans never actually called themselves Nazis , so having a maniacal German general scream that " Ze Nazis vill finally conquer ze vorld , " really takes the immersion out of the moment .
Germans referred to themselves as National Socialists after Hitler took power , and the word " Nazi " was almost completely wiped out from territories ruled by the Third Reich .
In fact , in Austria the term was used only by opponents of the National Socialists and became a derogatory term .
So yeah , Germans should n't be calling themselves Nazis .
In fact , I do n't think I 've ever heard the term " National Socialist " used in a WWII videogame .
It displays a very blatant lack of basic research .
Occult Nazism always works :
Ever since that evil German had his face melted off by the Arc of the Covenant in Indiana Jones , Nazism and Occultism have gone hand in hand .
There 's just something very interesting about the idea of Nazis dabbling in the black arts , and adding a supernatural element to your average World War II game helps to keep things interesting .
One perfect example would be Bloodrayne , a game that merged demons , vampires and the Third Reich in one of the stupidest , most ludicrous , shittily fun games of the last generation .
We 've fired far too many sniper rifles and flamethrowers in WWII games .
Wolfenstein manages to keep things fun with electric cannons and magical powers .
Plus they throw in a few Nazis skellingtons as well .
Say what you will about the latest Wolfenstein , it was far more interesting than the average World War II game .
Nazi frigging skellingtons !
Protip : America did not single - handedly win the war :
Just saying .
Make the main character a German soldier :
Now , this is a bold move and one I would n't actually expect any developer to ever have the balls to do , but if one were to successfully make a game where the player takes on the role of a German soldier as opposed to the typical American , gum - chewing hero , then I feel there would be potential for an amazingly impressive World War II videogame .
It 's just so incredibly easy to make a game where the Germans are the baddies and the Americans are the saintly heroes , and I 'd love to see a studio actually be creative enough to make a compelling Nazi campaign in anything that is n't a disconnected and impersonal RTS .
Obviously you do n't have to be playing as a laughing SS officer who performs execution attacks on Jews and guns down gypsies .
Perhaps a naive young German soldier who starts the game as an avid believer in the Hitler myth and slowly grows to learn how monstrous the regime is .
The game could explore the " banality of evil " theory and the moral obligation of those soldiers who served Germany during the war .
The wealth of themes that could be examined through such a game is staggering .
Sadly of course , this is one thing that will probably never happen .
It 's not realistic to assume that any publisher would risk the controversy and backlash from a general public that often has severe difficulty issues when it comes to understand a different artistic approach .
Most people seem ill - equipped to grasp the concept of unique and adult themes in videogames without jumping to conclusions .
It 's really very sad , and while I am idealistic enough to believe a Nazi - focused videogame would work , I 'm too realistic to believe that anybody would ever dare attempt it properly .
I guess unless that ever changes , it 's your typical , America - centric , beach - storming FPS affair for World War II games .
Remember , your boss can see what you put on your Facebook page !

Businesses , schools , health authorities and government departments have all outlawed “ la bise ” in the belief it can spread the killer disease in seconds .
Social kissing has always been popular in France with male and female colleagues alike greeting each other with a peck on each cheek every day at work .
Teenagers kiss when they meet at school and the pavement cafes of every town and city are littered with people exchanging kisses at all hours of the day and night .
France ’s health ministry is urging everyone to avoid the popular ritual while experts also recommend citizens to avoid other kinds of direct contact , including shaking hands .
Officials are recommending that people should keep a “ three - foot buffer zone ” between themselves and others or wear a face mask .
Paris company director Guy Girard said : “ It will take some getting used to , as French people kiss each other on both cheeks all the time usually .

Kirkosta eroaminen on Kotkassa laskenut jyrkästi .
Eroakirkosta.fi - palvelun kautta syyskuun puoliväliin mennessä eronneita oli 200 , kun vuotta aiemmin luku oli hieman yli 300 .
Isommista kaupungeista juuri Kotkassa eroaminen on vähentynyt eniten .
Toinen selvästi erolukujaan vähentänyt seurakunta löytyy Porista .
Lähes viimevuotiseen tapaan sen sijaan erotaan esimerkiksi Lahdessa .
- Langinkosken seurakunta irtisanoi nuorisotyönohjaajat , jotka eivät osallistuneet naispapin pitämiin jumalanpalveluksiin .
Kaiketi tämä on hillinnyt eroamista , arvelee tiedottaja Heikki Orsila .
Nuorisotyönohjaajat Jukka ja Marja - Leena Laaksonen irtisanottiin maaliskuussa .
Laaksoset olivat jo aiemmin saaneet huomautuksen ja varoituksen toiminnastaan .
Myös Vammalassa eroaminen vähentyi selvästi , kun jyrkästi naispappeutta vastustava kappalainen Jari Rankinen siirtyi toisiin tehtäviin .
Koko maan tasolla eroaminen on vähentynyt noin 15 % .
Viime vuonna eroaminen kasvoi syksyllä talouskriisin vuoksi .
Ainakaan vielä ei tänä vuonna ole nähty samansuuruista nousua .

When we think of our favorite pink puffball , we think of great platforming and interesting attacks you can harness by inhaling enemies .
When Kirby ’s Dream Course came onto the scene back in 1996 , it decided to change that up completely and gave Kirby a new mechanic to have fun with .
In Dream Course the player handles Kirby by treating him like a golf ball on the craziest mini - golf courses around .
I remember being a kid and just thinking , “ What ?!
How could they go for something so offbeat ? , ” but the truth is that it totally works .
Kirby ’s Dream Course may have been a bit overshadowed by the mammoth Nintendo 64 about to be released .
It ’s a shame I do n’t hear too many people go on about this game , it ’s just as great and charming as Kirby Super Star in my book .
Enough about nostalgia , let ’s get into the actual mechanics of this superb golf title .
While many Kirby games can be labeled as easy , I would say the same does not go for Dream Course .
The challenge is that you must knock out every enemy , and in turn , the final enemy turns into the hole .
Everytime you miss an enemy , you lose one of four hit points you are assigned , once all four are lost you must replay the entire course … sounds simple , right ?
The game is simple to play , yet hard to master ; you have control over the height , spin , and power of your hit , so with all of these factors it can be very tough to land the perfect shot .
You will find yourself trying to perfect the art of bouncing Kirby off a wall at just the right angle to make him hit an enemy and then fall into the hole …
I have never been addicted to a golf game in my life , so this was a first .
Single player wo n’t last you a long time , since there are only eight courses to play through ( eight holes per course ) , but I think that the pick - up - and - play nature of the game will keep you coming back .
Do n’t let the somewhat short length scare you off ; if you are a perfectionist like myself , you wo n’t quit until you get gold medals on every course .
If you are good enough to score silver or gold medals on all of the normal courses , you are rewarded with an extra course , as well .
Again , may not be much , but I have always thought “ quality over quantity ” , and this game is bursting from the seams with quality .
The gameplay is solid , and I think the addition of items adds some depth .
I think my favorite power - ups were Parasol and Super - Jump , since they helped when I hit Kirby a bit too hard or in the wrong direction .
Tornado could be seen as quite useful , but it can be somewhat hard to control , as Kirby gets quite a boost , and you find yourself overshooting the hole .
While the single player was lots of fun , I think it shines just as brightly in the multiplayer mode , as well .
It ’s a bit of a letdown to see only four playable courses .
Everything is the same from single player , but now you have to change up your strategy a bit .
Every time you hit an enemy you get a star , and sinking it in the hole gives you two stars , problem is , your friends can hit your old stars and obtain them .
Many times I found myself spending time just figuring out how to steal stars , rather than thinking about getting to the hole .
Stealing stars becomes a real game changer ; in the course of one hole , you can go from a good lead to dead last , if your friend is a bit sneaky .
Apart from that , the item system is still intact and actually is even more important this time around .
I made some awesome comebacks in Multiplayer by just knowing the right time to use an offensive attack .
At the same time , I had instances were I would use a Super Jump too late , and end up flying off the edge of the stage .
Simply put , these items can be your friends or your enemies , so be patient and learn when to use them , this will make it hard for you to be defeated .
This game falls into a genre that is a bit odd ; it ’s not a platformer , and also comes off as an offbeat sport title … if anything , it would best be described as “ unique . ”
While it may have been forgotten by many , I am hoping that with the virtual console it finds a new audience or have us SNES fans remembering “ the good ol ’ days . ”
Overall , everything from the bright graphics to the upbeat music are the definition of “ charming ” .
Just as fun as it was back in ’ 96 , and I actually appreciate it more now than ever , since it seemed to have aged fairly well .
For just 800 points on the Wii Virtual Console , this is something that I think everybody should check out , even if mini - golf is n’t your thing .
At the very least , play it at a friends house , because just one course on this charming little title and you ’ll be hooked .
Or it might have been intended as a signal that Israel would continue to build as Israel saw fit , no matter what Washington said .
Either way , it is “ unhelpful , ” as Condoleezza Rice said as secretary of state in 2005 about other unilateral steps taken by Israel in East Jerusalem .
That was her polite , and not very effective , way of telling Israel to hold off .
The Obama administration ’s call for a freeze on new settlement construction has been unambiguous .
The United States “ wants to see a stop to settlements — not some settlements , not outposts , not ‘ natural growth ’ exceptions , ” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on May 27 .
She could have added “ not in East Jerusalem , ” which was the point of a message about the Shepherd Hotel project delivered this month to the new Israeli ambassador to the United States .
Israel ’s reaction was just as clear :
An undivided Jerusalem is and will always be the capital of Israel .
“ Our sovereignty over it cannot be challenged , ” Mr. Netanyahu said at a July 19 cabinet meeting .
No one , he added , has the right to tell Jews where they can live in their own capital city .
Mr. Obama , as a candidate , promised to support Jerusalem ’s status as the undivided capital of Israel .
What the boundaries of the city will end up being depends on negotiations .
The Israeli government has tried to change the issue : Dan Meridor , an Israeli government minister , accused the Obama administration of breaking with an agreement made in 2004 with President George W. Bush .
But the Israelis themselves have “ not fully ” lived up to that agreement , in the words of Elliot Abrams , a National Security Council adviser in the second Bush administration .
One of the four brokered points called for a halt to government subsidies for settlers .
Those have in fact continued .
New numbers from the Federal Reserve show that American households * were $ 2 trillion richer at the end of June they were at the end of March .
That ’s a 4 % jump over three months — and the first time household net worth has risen since the second quarter of 2007 .
What accounts for the good fortune ?
First , people are continuing to pay down their debt — or they ’re having it written off .
Household debt , which is mostly mortgages but also includes things like credit cards and bank loans , fell by a third of a percent for the quarter .
The bigger boost , though , came from the increasing value of assets .
For the first time in more than two years , households saw the value of their real estate holdings increase .
The value of stocks , mutual fund shares , life insurance and pension funds all grew , too — for the first time since the third quarter of 2007 .
So to keep the momentum we simply need to keep paying off our obligations and use our will power to keep the stock and real estate markets heading upward .
* Technically this data series is for households and non-profit organizations , but households overwhelmingly make up what ’s being measured , so I ’ve joined in the generally accepted practice of collapsing the discussion down to just “ households . ”

A robbery gone wrong ended when the victim upped the ante on the would - be robber by pulling a sword .
Police say that the suspect and the victim , who are believed to have been friends , went to a check cashing store near the victim 's house on Thursday .
The two men in their thirties , according to police , returned to the victim 's home , where the suspect hit the victim in the shoulder with a bat in an attempt to rob him .
Little did he know he was dealing with an apparent ninja who keeps swords just laying around the house .
After being hit with the bat , the victim ran to a bedroom , grabbed a sword , and had himself a " Kill Bill " moment .
According to police , the victim hit the suspect several times with the sword , and caused what authorities call " serious injuries . "
Police say that after being attacked with a sword , the suspect fled the scene , and was discovered four miles away at his apartment complex near the Black Canyon Freeway and West Camelback Road , after another resident of the complex called police to report seeing a bleeding man .
The suspect is expected to be released from the hospital in the next few days , and faces charges of armed robbery and aggravated assault .
Perhaps Don Corleone 's famous quote from " The Godfather " needs some revision : " Keep your friends close , especially if they own swords . "

The first hurricane of the Atlantic season became a major storm on Tuesday as it continued to gain strength .
The U.S. National Hurricane Center upgraded Hurricane Bill to a Category 3 storm after reconnaissance aircraft found the storm had sustained winds whipping up to 205 km/h , with higher gusts .
The storm was located about 895 kilometres east of the Leeward Islands at 11 p.m. AT , and was moving west - northwest at about 24 km/h .
The hurricane centre said in a statement that Bill is expected to make a gradual turn to the northwest on Wednesday , and the core of the storm is predicted to pass well to the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands late Wednesday and early Thursday .
Bill could possibly gain more strength , and Todd Kimberlain , a forecaster at the centre , said the most significant threat is to the island of Bermuda .
The storm could pass by there in three or four days , although forecasts suggest it may also miss land entirely and pass between Bermuda and the eastern U.S. coast .
" We are keeping an eye on it for sure , " said Nick Camizzi , a forecaster with Bermuda 's weather service .
Hurricanes are categorized on the Saffir - Simpson scale from one to five , indicating the storm 's intensity at a given time .
Heading north
CBC meteorologist Peter Coade said the storm is tracking north , but it 's expected to weaken and curve away from Nova Scotia .
" At this time , I would say the people to benefit from Bill might just be the surfers because we should get a surf along the Atlantic coast by Monday and Tuesday as it passes by , " Coade said .
The two other named storms of the Atlantic hurricane season , Ana and Claudette , have had little effect on any mainland communities .
Tropical storm Ana was weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated before reaching land .
But heavy rain from the storm did cause some flooding in Puerto Rico , resulting in some closed roads and schools on Tuesday .
There were also some evacuations in the Dominican Republic related to flooding and mudslide risks caused by the rain .
Tropical storm Claudette also quickly weakened after making landfall on Monday along the Florida Panhandle .

Updated , Sept. 3 , 5:30 p.m. | Rowen Jacobsen , author of “ Fruitless Fall : The Collapse of the Honey Bee and the Coming Agricultural Crisis , ” discusses how honeybee health is linked to the health of the entire environment .
The first alarms about the sudden widespread disappearance of honeybees came in late 2006 , and the phenomenon soon had a name : colony collapse disorder .
In the two years that followed , about one - third of bee colonies vanished , while researchers toiled to figure out what was causing the collapse .
A study published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences surmises that there may not be a single pathogen involved but a collection of culprits .
What have entomologists and beekeepers learned in the last few years of dealing with the crisis ?
We asked May R. Berenbaum , an author of the study , and other experts for an update .
Getting Off the Crisis Treadmill
Rowan Jacobsen is author of “ Fruitless Fall : The Collapse of the Honey Bee and the Coming Agricultural Crisis . ”
Thanks to the terrific gene sleuthing of May Berenbaum and others , it looks like the pieces of the colony collapse disorder puzzle are starting to fit together .
And we can stop arguing about who was right :
The virus camp , the fungus camp , the pesticide camp , the varroa mite camp , or the nutrition camp .
It turns out everybody was right .
( Well , everybody except the cell - phone and microwave - tower camps . )
Colony collapse disorder and swine flu are manifestations of the same underlying issue : the global diaspora of organisms .
The viruses compromise bees ’ ability to manufacture proteins , and proteins are the tools bees use to fight off pathogens , to detoxify pesticides , to repair their cells , and to meet all the world ’s other challenges .
If bees lived in an utterly non-stressful world , they could go on despite the viruses .
But of course they do n’t live in a world anything like that .
Even if we have at last identified the root cause of colony collapse disorder , it should n’t give us any comfort .
Just as knowing the source of “ swine ” flu does n’t help us cure it , identifying CCD will not make it go away .
In fact , both diseases can be seen as manifestations of the same underlying issue :
The global diaspora of organisms .
Honeybees are just one of the many species we depend on that are struggling mightily to withstand a steady stream of novel parasites and pathogens they have never encountered before , and have no tools to defend against .
As the honeybee geneticist Tom Rinderer put it , “ What has happened to our bees ?
Jet planes have happened . ”
Even if we miraculously come up with solutions for varroa mites , IAPV and the latest threats to honeybees , there will simply be another “ black swan ” that nobody could have predicted .
Read more …
If anything , this latest news about CCD makes the problem more relevant to the future , because it confirms what every holistic systems thinker has been telling us .
Honeybee health is inextricably linked to the health of the entire environment , including our own .
If we can create systems of domestic food production that take their cues from the cycles of nature , and let honeybees play the roles they evolved to play , then the system will take care of itself .
But if we continue to push the system farther and farther out of equilibrium by relying on chemical shortcuts and fossil fuel intervention to fix the inevitable breakdowns , then we will never get off the crisis treadmill .
Profound Changes
Kim Flottum is the editor of Bee Culture magazine and the author of “ The Backyard Beekeeper ” and “ The Backyard Beekeeper ’s Honey Handbook . ”
Pesticides , bacterial diseases and varroa mites have been implicated in the search for the causes of colony collapse disorder .
Plus , viruses in conjunction with environmental stresses are suspects , and University of Illinois scientists have discovered what occurs at the genetic level of CCD .
I suspect it is only a matter of time before the pathogens are known .
Meanwhile , individual beekeeping operations have been damaged , some beyond repair because of this malady .
Others have been able to recover .
The overall picture is , however , not quite as bleak as the press and the blogosphere might lead you to imagine .
Colony numbers in the U.S. show the resiliency of American beekeepers .
But beekeepers know that changes are necessary .
The changes involve effective and efficient management of varroa mite populations .
A beekeeper ’s obvious first choice is to manage honeybee lines that are resistant to or tolerant of these mites .
But there is a very limited quantity of these bees , and they are expensive .
Or beekeepers can choose a line of bees that tolerates mites to a great degree , but differ in behavior from the bees they are familiar with .
Russian bees are resistant to the mites , but their seasonal timetable is much different from that of the bees most U.S. beekeepers are used to .
Read more …
In particular , Russian bees require extra work in late fall and early winter to accommodate the mid-winter almond crop in California .
Almonds bloom in February and March , much earlier than any other major pollination crop .
More than half of the bees in the U.S. are used to pollinate almond orchards , and many , if not most , migratory beekeepers depend on the crop for pollination income .
The migratory beekeeping industry goes as the almond crop goes , and the crop is suffering from water shortages , price fluctuations — and beekeeper availability due to CCD and other forces .
The only alternatives to the use of resistant honeybees are chemical miticides that effectively and efficiently control varroa mites while they are in the hive .
Newer products using essential oils are safe , effective but labor - intensive , while traditional choices require less labor but are less effective .
Reducing the insidious use of pesticides on everything honeybees eat has been a priority .
But for the longer term commercial beekeepers have concluded that if they are going to succeed in the migratory pollination business , they need to change and attend to the discoveries made in the search for clues to colony collapse disorder .
High on beekeepers ’ lists , besides controlling Nosema ceranae , is reducing the insidious pesticide barrage applied to everything honeybees eat , and insuring that bees ’ nutritional needs are met by feeding them better food more often .
These management changes have been rapidly accepted and have lead to profound improvements in honeybee health .
The benefits ?
The pesticide abuse debacle in this country may have finally come to a head , and discussions among beekeepers , the Environmental Protection Agency and agricultural pesticide companies have begun ( but is the new E.P.A. better than the last , and are chemical companies on the level ? ) .
Plus , honeybee health has gained more attention and made more progress in the last two years than the last three decades .
Better resistant bees are next in line .
But most important ?
Awareness of the value of the beekeeping industry in the production of the food we need is better understood now than perhaps ever before .
Bias Against a Non-Native Species
Joe Traynor is a bee broker for apiarists and almond growers .
His company , Scientific Ag , is based in Bakersfield , Calif .
The current consensus is that bee problems are caused by multiple stressors .
Bees , like us , carry viruses and harmful microbes all the time .
When we ( and they ) get run down , these nasties can take over , making us sick .
Colony collapse disorder peaked during 2007 , which was also a year , due to drought conditions in many areas of the U.S. , that good bee forage was in short supply ; as a result , honeybees suffered nutritionally , making them more susceptible to viruses ( carried and transmitted by varroa mites ) and to a new ( to the U.S. ) fungus , nosema ceranae , believed to have been introduced here in 2007 .
Possible culprits : developers , second - home buyers , corn producers — and conservation purists .
Bee forage was more plentiful during 2008 and as a result there were less incidences of CCD ( we wo n’t know for a while how 2009 will turn out ) .
Beekeepers that have kept their bees in top shape nutritionally have had lower than normal problems with colony collapse disorder .
There is no question that annual bee losses are far greater today than they were 20 years ago .
Twenty years ago , before virus transmitting varroa mites were found in the U.S. , 10 percent winter losses were normal ; now 20 percent losses are normal and losses hit 36 percent in 2007 ( around 30 percent in 2008 ) .
Beekeepers have to work much harder to keep their bees in good health than they did 20 years ago .
This means paying close attention to nutrition , via supplemental feeding of both proteins and carbohydrates , and controlling both varroa mites and nosema ( easier said than done as there are limited means of controlling these two pests ) .
Read more …
Natural bee forage , including some agricultural crops , is better for bees than artificial supplements .
Bees , like us , require a varied diet to remain in top health .
The ethanol boom has caused corn , a poor pollen source for bees , to replace clover and alfalfa , relatively good bee plants , in some parts of the U.S. Increased urbanization , especially here in California , has resulted in the loss of excellent bee pasture .
When baby boomers build a second home in the foothills of California ( or in Montana ) they do n’t want any bees near their homes , so the first thing they do is evict beekeepers from long - held locations .
Nature Conservancy removes honeybees from its land because they originally came from Europe .
Counterintuitively , the Nature Conservancy has also contributed to bee problems .
The group purchases large tracts of undeveloped land for the laudable purpose of preserving these tracts in their native state for future generations .
Unfortunately it has a policy of evicting all non-native species from the property it acquires .
This includes honeybees since they are an introduced species , brought over from Europe by early settlers .
The conservancy recently took over a large tract of land in San Diego County that provided sustenance for many commercial bee colonies .
The bee colonies were evicted and are now competing for ever diminishing bee pasture in the San Diego area ( there are probably 100,000 commercial bee colonies competing with each other in San Diego County alone ) .
Evicting commercial ( European ) bees from Nature Conservancy holdings is shortsighted as it creates a vacuum that allows Africanized honeybees , which are prevalent in Southern California and are becoming more prevalent in other parts of the U.S. , to establish themselves on the group ’s property .
The recent finding of fossilized honeybees in the U.S. ( thousands of years old but now extinct ) may cause the conservancy to change its policy , but beekeepers are n’t holding their breath on this .
The costs of keeping bees in good condition to ward off colony collapse disorder have increased dramatically over the past two years .
A main reason CCD has decreased this past year is that beekeepers are spending much more time and money keeping their bees healthy .
Increased pollination fees for agricultural crops requiring honeybees are paying for these increased bee maintenance costs .
A Viral Overload
May R. Berenbaum is a professor of entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
A few things have changed with respect to colony collapse disorder in the past year .
First , whereas surveys conducted by the Apiary Inspectors of America estimated CCD losses in America ’s managed honeybee colonies during the winters of 2006 - 2007 and 2007 - 2008 at 36 percent and 32 percent , over the winter of 2008 - 2009 losses dipped to 29 percent , possibly indicating a decline in severity .
Patrick Pleul / European Pressphoto Agency
Secondly , an extensive survey conducted by researchers from two land grant colleges , the U.S. Department of Agriculture and two Belgian universities examined adult and larval bees and hive products from almost 100 colonies for parasites , pathogens , pesticides and nutritional factors .
Although no single diagnostic difference was identified , one consistent finding was that colony collapse disorder bees were infected with multiple pathogens ; over 50 percent of CCD colonies , e.g. , were infected with three or more viruses , almost twice the percentage of healthy colonies .
Most recently , a whole - genome honeybee microarray analysis allowed investigators from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and the U.S.D.A. to examine differences in patterns of expression of all 10,000 + genes in the honeybee genome , the sequencing of which was completed in 2006 .
Multiple comparisons of hives varying geographically , temporally , and in CCD severity winnowed the list of genes whose expression was most closely associated with the disorder down to a handful representing fragments of ribosomes , the “ protein factories ” of the cells , thus implicating ribosome breakdown as a “ root cause ” of CCD .
Read more …
Genetic material from common bee pathogens also on this microarray revealed , as before , that CCD bees were infected with a greater number of viruses , specifically picornalike viruses , all of which cause infection by hijacking the ribosome , reprogramming the “ factory ” to make viral proteins instead of honeybee proteins .
Thus , viral overload may lead to ribosome breakdown , which is manifested as CCD .
Together these studies may explain why so many explanations of colony collapse disorder seem plausible ; in the absence of functional ribosomes , bees would be hard - pressed to respond to any of the multiple stresses to which they are subjected in 21st century apiculture — pathogens , pesticides or nutritional deficiencies .
Detecting the ailment early might give beekeepers a chance to provide supportive care .
As for practical applications of these findings , the most immediately useful product of the microarray study is an objective genetic diagnostic indicator of colony collapse disorder — the ribosome fragments .
Such a diagnostic indicator would be useful in determining whether other CCD - like disappearances in England , Spain and elsewhere are in fact colony collapse disorder or entirely different in origin .
Early diagnosis of the ailment might not be directly useful — there are no vaccines to combat bee viruses and no known ways to patch up broken ribosomes — but beekeepers who detect this breakdown early on may be able to provide supportive care to help their bees recover .
Living With a Crisis
Marla Spivak is a professor of entomology and social insects at the University of Minnesota .
All bees — honeybees and native bees — are still in decline , and it is a serious issue .
It is true there is less news coverage of bee health issues , but bees are not faring better .
Over 30 percent of our honeybee colonies die every year , from colony collapse disorder or other causes .
Some native bumblebee species have become nearly impossible to find , and we do n’t know how many other native bees are threatened .
Beekeepers are treading water , replacing as many colonies as economically feasible for their operations .
Researchers are hard at work using cutting - edge methods to determine why honeybee colonies are collapsing and how we can mitigate the decline of all bees .
While bees may have faded from the news , they have not faded from the public eye .
In fact , the opposite has occurred .
People are more aware than ever about bees .
The crisis has helped us understand the importance of pollinators to our diet and environment and many people want to know how they can help .
What can we do to help bees ?
Plant lots of flowers that provide nectar and pollen for bees , and reduce pesticide use .
These two tangible and relatively easy actions , when implemented by many people , can save our bees and restore health and diversity to our agricultural and urban landscapes .
Needed : More Disease - Resistant Bees
Diana Cox -Foster is a professor of entomology at Pennsylvania State University .
In the almost three years since the plight of honeybees caught the public ’s attention , we have learned that bees are faced with many different obstacles , some naturally occurring ( such as diseases ) and others that are byproducts of human activity .
The honeybees in the U.S. have been in trouble since the introduction of parasitic mites ( Varroa and tracheal mites ) in the late 1980 ’s .
Varroa has continued to be the major problem , in part because the mites have become resistant to the acaricides used for control .
Our study of hundreds of pollen samples showed on average six different pesticides .
Do chemicals impair bees ’ immune systems ?
Colony collapse disorder has severely affected many beekeepers in the United States and caused some to go bankrupt .
We have learned much about CCD , but we are still a long way from determining its exact causes and how to mitigate this disease .
Of major worry is that these same causes may be affecting native insect pollinators .
This translates into concerns not only for security of our food crop production but also for the overall health of the ecosystems that we depend upon for survival .
Central Park looked like a war zone yesterday after a storm packing 70 mph winds ripped through the lush grounds , knocking down hundreds of stately trees and damaging thousands of others .
The Central Park Conservancy , which runs the park , said it was the worst destruction seen by the group since it was created 29 years ago .
Tuesday night ’s storm uprooted or snapped in half at least 300 large trees and knocked the limbs off thousands of others in a “ swath of destruction , ” mostly between 90th and 110th Streets , said Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe .
“ We have never seen damage this extreme in Central Park , ” he said .
“ Central Park looks like pictures I ’ve seen of heavy artillery zones in World War II .
“ The tragedy is that we lost many large mature trees close to a century old .
We lost some 100 - year - old American elm trees that are irreplaceable . ”
Some workers mounted cherry pickers or used 30 - foot pruning polls to cut hanging branches off damaged trees .
“ The hangers can fall at any time .
That ’s the real concern , ” one worker said .
“ Some are 15 inches wide and 15 feet long .
If it fell on someone , they ’d be a pancake . ”
On July 31 , a Google engineer walking to work through the park was nearly killed when a dangling limb fell and hit him on the head .
There had been severe thunderstorms the night before .
Yesterday , workers used chainsaws to cut apart the fallen trees so they could be more easily removed .
Benepe said it would take two days to assess the damage and a week to carry out the cleanup — at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars .
He urged people to avoid the park between 96th and 110 streets , but many people ignored him .
The park ’s East Drive was blocked at 95th Street by a tree 40 inches diameter .
The storm , which struck at about 10 p.m. Tuesday , flooded roadways and downed power lines .
About 1,000 Con
Ed customers lost power , but it was mostly restored by afternoon .
Riverside Park on the West Side also suffered tree damage .
Agnes Mueller , 44 , of the Upper East Side , who was in Central Park yesterday , said , “ In some ways , it ’s sad these big , beautiful trees are lost , but they will grow again . ”
Patrick Donovan , 38 , who lives on the Upper West Side , said that when he saw the devastation , “ I just picked my jaw up off the floor .
I ’m shocked .
Do n’t mess with Mother Nature . ”

US Envoy George Mitchell has reportedly asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to commit to a one year freeze on settlement construction as a “ deposit ” on the peace negotiations .
Mitchell said the move would lead to concessions from Arab states toward Israel .
Sources however say that while the Israeli government did not reject the call out of hand , as it has so many other US requests in recent days , they had disagreements over the details and would accept a suspension of six months , at most .
Unclear is what would happen after the year is up .
The Obama Administration has been seeking a permanent halt to all settlement expansion pending the creation of a Palestinian state , while Israel is hoping to win “ understandings ” from the administration similar to those it claims to have had with the Bush Administration .
The fact that the US is seeking only a one year freeze now , instead of a permanent cessation of expansion , is likely to be seen as a serious concession from the Obama Administration and a political victory for Prime Minister Netanyahu ’s government , amid concerns that their hardline position would harm US ties .

The best thing to do for dry wall holes is to tape over the entire hole with strips of duct tape , and then paint over the duct tape .
If you have wallpaper , I could just put wallpaper over the hole .
That would be even easier .
After the repair , nobody should lean up on the wall or it will probably tear again .

Here is a collection of 10 DIY bike projects that you can do in your free time .
Each one contains links to different ways of implementing the project .
The reason for I put this collection together is because I could n’t find anywhere else on the internet that brings all these great projects in one place so make sure you bookmark it !
I hope you enjoy the list and getting creative .
Let me know if there are any more great DIY projects you are aware of .
1 DIY bike stand
When you get into your bike repairs you will soon get sick of standing the bike upside down .
At that point you will want a bike repair stand .
There is no shortage of articles about how to build your own so I recommend starting with the roundup by Bikehacks .
2 Make your own bike camera mount
Thanks to most cameras having a standard mount screw it is very easy to hook up your camera to your bike and share your cycling adventures .
The two articles below offer an easy way of doing this .
3 Bright Bike
Help yourself be seen at night by using so called retro-reflective materials .
The guys behind Bright Bike have all the kit you need and the easy to follow steps to implement it on your bike .
4 Store your bike on these DIY bike racks
In a small house in London the bike can be the cause a lot of clutter .
These racks help to keep your bike out of the way and leave more room to enjoy your home .
5 Make your own bike trailer
In the quest to go car free the bicycle trailer is an essential tool .
How else are you going to get all that shopping from the supermarket ?
By re-purposing some old bike parts you can make your own trailer and save yourself a lot of money .
6 LED bike wheel
If I saw this on the road I would be nothing short of amazed .
The guide in Instructables shows you how you can turn your wheels into fantastic digital displays .
7 Give your bike a healthy neon glow
Further amazement is provided in this guide in Instructables about how to “ boy racer ” your bike with a neon glow .
8 Ugly your bike
Here is another interesting DIY project we have discussed before on London Cyclist .
Uglying your bike to make it unattractive to thieves .
If you couple this with our bike lock tips you are good to go !
9 Make your own super bright bike light
Sometimes you just get the urge to go out and bike late at night .
When this happens your standard bike light will probably not be enough for you to feel comfortable .
What you need is the ultimate in bright bike lights .
The guides below will show you how to modify standard bike lights and save a lot of money when compared to top of the range bicycle lights .
10 DIY bike panniers
Carrying a bag around on your bike is irritating and causes your back to sweat .
Panniers solve this problem .
The two below guides show you how to make your own .

In the not so distant past we launched a Ruby Enterprise Edition sponsorship campaign .
We ’ve been working hard on the code since that time .
And although the campaign target has n’t been reached , we ’ve decided to release it anyway because we believe that this release is of great importance to the community .
Just how important is this release ?
Well , Twitter has beta tested this release and they ’re reporting roughly 30 % improvement in throughput .
Keep reading to learn more and follow us on @phusion_nl for the latest updates .
Summary of changes
It ’s now based on Ruby 1.8.7 - p174 Previous REE releases were based on 1.8.6 .
We were initially reluctant about switching to 1.8.7 : many people reported various incompatibility problems introduced by 1.8.7 , and it seemed that alternative Ruby implementors were boycotting 1.8.7 .
However , the tide has now changed .
Rails 3.0 will drop support for Ruby versions earlier than 1.8.7 , JRuby had recently decided to support 1.8.7 and OS X Snow Leopard as well as all the Linux distros ship 1.8.7 .
We ’ve received a lot of requests from the community for a 1.8.7 - based version .
In short , everybody is moving towards 1.8.7 , and we ca n’t afford to stay behind .
We were initially planning to release a final 1.8.6 - based version , but after carefully considering the current state of things , we decided to skip the 1.8.6 release and jump directly to 1.8.7 .
1.8.7 is also more compatible with 1.9 , allowing a smoother transition to future Ruby versions .
The MBARI patches have been integrated Brent Roman ’s MBARI patch set uses a variety of techniques to significantly reduce Ruby ’s memory usage .
It also adds a bunch of performance optimizations , useful features and bug fixes .
Ruby ’s garbage collector scans the C stack conservatively .
This means that any data on the C stack that might look like a pointer pointing to a valid Ruby object will be treated like a real pointer , causing the object to be retained during garbage collection .
Because of the way Ruby is written and because of compiler optimizations , there may be a lot of such “ pointers ” on the stack , even when they ’re not really pointers but just garbage data that like look pointers .
Brent has refactored and modified many parts of Ruby in order to reduce the possibility of such “ garbage pointers ” occurring on the stack .
As a result , garbage collection will be much more effective .
Many objects that would otherwise not have been freed will be freed thanks to the MBARI patches .
As a side - effect of the reduced memory usage , applications typically run faster as well .
Not only because applications are less likely to be swapped out , but also because modern hardware ’s performance depends greatly on the amount of memory traffic .
Ruby uses an inefficient , linear time algorithm for extending the stack space when switching context between threads and / or continuations .
This is mostly noticeable when you have a lot of threads .
Brent replaces this with a constant time algorithm , which is much faster .
It adds the methods __file__ and __line__ to the Method , UnboundMethod and Proc classes .
Very useful for inspecting large code bases that make heavy use of metaprogramming .
These methods are documented in the Ruby Enterprise Edition manual .
We ’ve ported his patch set to 1.8.7 - p174 .
Especially Twitter benefited a lot from these patches .
The zero -copy context switching patch have been integrated as an optional feature Joe Damato and Aman Gupta have created a patch which implements zero -copy context switching in Ruby ’s threading system .
In Ruby 1.8 , whenever Ruby switches context to another thread , it has to copy over the entire thread stack .
This is very expensive , and the deeper your function calls are nested , the slower it becomes .
The zero -copy context switching patch removes the need to copy any stack data ; instead , it keeps all thread stacks at different areas in memory and simply changes the stack pointer .
In extreme situations , this patch can increase threading performance by as much as 10 times !
Phusion Passenger is not really affected by this patch because its request handling core is not multithreaded , at least not at this moment .
But Mongrel is heavily multithreaded and will benefit tremendously from this patch .
We ’ve made this patch compatible with the MBARI patch set , but there are currently some issues with 64 - bit platforms , so we ’ve disabled it by default .
You can enable it by running the REE installer with -- fast - threading Various other minor changes
When compiling REE , binaries are optimized for size ( - Os ) , not speed .
See below for an explanation .
The tcmalloc memory allocator has been upgraded to version 1.3
RubyGems upgraded to version 1.3.5 .
The Debian package now installs files to /usr / local , so that one does n’t have to mess with $ PATH to get things working .
In practice
This release has been beta tested with Twitter .
Evan Weaver reported significant improvements in Twitter ’s throughput after having switched to this REE release .
Twitter especially benefited from the MBARI patch set .
We ’ve found a few unexpected things during the beta testing phase :
We ’ve found that optimizing Ruby for code size ( compilation with - Os ) yields better results that optimizing Ruby for speed ( compiling with - O2 ) .
Ruby is a very unconventional program and we suspect that optimizing for code size allows more instructions to fit in the CPU instruction cache , resulting in better performance .
Microbenchmarks and synthetic benchmarks such as the Ruby benchmark suite do not show any performance improvements at all , although Twitter was able to measure a significant performance improvement .
As always , benchmark results should be taken with a grain of salt .
Other major beta testers include 37signals and Novell .
They ’re still in the progress of testing , and we ’re eager to receive their test results .

Physics , Topology , Logic and Computation : a Rosetta Stone

It ’s done !
John Baez and Mike Stay , Physics , topology , logic and computation : a Rosetta Stone .
Learn how category theory serves as a lingua franca that lets us translate between certain aspects of these four subjects … and perhaps , eventually , build a general science of systems and processes !
In a nutshell , it goes like this :
object morphism Physics system process Topology manifold cobordism Logic proposition proof Computation data type program \array{ & object & morphism \\ Physics & system & process \\ Topology & manifold & cobordism \\ Logic & proposition & proof \\ Computation & data type & program }
It takes a while to explain the details .
Actually , I ’ve come to feel that in academia no project is ever really done .
At least , not until you lose interest or die — which , come to think of it , is just an extreme case of losing interest .
There ’s always room for revising , improving , extending , and otherwise revisiting old projects .
This is particularly evident with the rise of electronic media like the arXiv .
When you catch the umpteenth typo , do you put up yet another version of your paper or not ?
It just depends how much you care .
There are certainly lots of typos still lurking in this paper , and probably much worse problems .
But , we ’ve tried to take all your comments into account — sometimes by judiciously not doing anything about them — and I feel they ’ve vastly improved the paper .
Thanks , all of you !
We could never have done it without all you logicians and computer scientists .

Jammie Thomas - Rasset and Joel Tenenbaum captured the nation 's attention when they were defendants in the RIAA 's first two trials against accused online infringers .
But here 's the mind - warping reality : both defendants would have been far better off monetarily if they had simply ignored the complaint altogether and failed to show up in court .
That counterintuitive logic played out again this week in Massachusetts , where federal judge Nancy Gertner issued four default judgments against accused P2P file - swappers who never bothered to respond to the charges against them .
Their failure to appear meant an automatic loss , and though the judge does have some discretion in setting penalties , judges often pick the minimum awards in such cases .
That was true in all four cases , where Gertner accepted the record labels ' claims and awarded them the minimum statutory damages of $ 750 per song .
The defendants were accused of downloading an average of ten songs , putting total awards in the $ 7,500 range , in addition to a few hundred more for court costs .
Having $ 7,500 in damages assessed against you by a federal court is no picnic , but it pales in comparison to the two twenty - somethings who actually showed up to court , got attorneys , went through a multiyear process and a nationally covered trial , and came out the other side owing far more money .
The chart below illustrates the point by graphing the various damage awards per song :
When it comes to total damages , the disparities are even greater .
Thomas - Rasset 's retrial ended up with a $ 1.92 million award , while Tenenbaum faces $ 675,000 in damages .
Those who did n't show up owe around $ 7,500 .
In fact , this might well have been Tenenbaum 's fate .
He was actually included in a massive complaint consolidated into a single docket , and it was only when he showed up to a court hearing that Gertner stopped the default judgment proceeding against him and actually helped find him a lawyer — Harvard Law prof Charles Nesson .
Now , Tenenbaum faces a life - altering damage award and the prospect of bankruptcy if not reduced or overturned on appeal .
Update : I was interested more in what happens within the federal court system for this article , but several commenters rightly point out that " not showing up " is n't the cheapest way out of such situations .
Settling with the RIAA usually leads to payments of between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000 , lower than the default judgments issued here by Judge Gertner .
Convincing a jury that you 're innocent could be cheaper still ( if you find a pro bono lawyer ) , though it comes with certain obvious risks .
Steven Donziger , a lawyer representing the group of Ecuadorans who are suing Chevron , contending that they had been harmed by the oil contamination , said : “ I suspect this is a Chevron sting operation ; there needs to be an investigation into Chevron ’s role in this as much as the judge’s .
I find it awfully odd that these individuals would secretly film meetings using James Bond devices like a spy watch and a spy pen .
Image Flames burning gas in Lago Agrio .

The company faces up to $ 27 billion in damages .
Credit ... Moises Saman for The New York Times
“ At the end of the day this will not affect the underlying case , ” Mr. Donziger said , “ other than it might cause a short delay if the judge needs to be replaced . ”
Chevron said it had obtained the recordings from Diego Borja , an Ecuadoran who once worked as a logistics contractor for the company .
The company said Mr. Borja had been working with an American businessman , Wayne Hansen , to secure water treatment contracts .
Chevron said that neither man had been paid for the recordings , but that the company paid for Mr. Borja and his family to leave Ecuador because of concern about his safety .
“ I ’d like to think he brought them to us out of respect for our company and concern for what seemed to be transpiring here , ” Charles James , an executive vice president of Chevron , said of the recordings in a telephone interview .
“ We think this information absolutely disqualifies the judge and nullifies anything that he has ever done in this case . ”
In one of the recordings made in June , the political operative , Patricio García , who identified himself as an official in Mr. Correa ’s political party , referred to $ 3 million in bribes to be split equally among the judge , the presidency and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit .
Mr. Correa ’s party , Mr. García said , would receive the $ 1 million payment on behalf of the plaintiffs .
In the same meeting , Mr. García told Mr. Borja how to approach Ms. Correa , the president ’s sister , about the bribe .
“ Tell Pierina clearly , ‘ Madam Pierina , what we came to do beyond anything else is to participate , participate in the remediation .
That ’s why I want to make you part of this , ’ “ he said .

It 's not enough to make Nanny Pelosi cry ?
Do n't you guys see how exposing treason committed by US government employees is liable to incite violence among the people that find out about it ?
If the perpetrators are held accountable for their treason and put to death as they rightfully should be then this website and everyone who ever visited or commented on it will be responsible !

But they are the " liberal media . "
As we all know .
My guess is that this is a scam to dismiss the importance of what she was testifying about as they earnestly bury it with some slight coverage .
So hopefully that means the " liberal media " will now pay attention !
I 've covered this at my blog and think it 's just one slimy tentacle of what has really been running the US Government since Raygun stole the election from Carter .

Respectfully , I believe your wrong , the responsibility is in not breaking your oath of office in the first place , as such activity is a personal choice .
Fellow citizen / employees ( with sworn oaths ) actually have a responsibility to turn you in when you do break your oath .

I always suspected each party had the goods on the other ( outside of the outright collusion that must go on to some degree ) , and this insured a measure of back - covering .
I 'm sure Hot Karl had to know about all of this also , in reinforcement of Jake Starling 's comment above .
It 's all so terribly sad that I and so many others have zero confidence in our government , and are quick to believe that they would commit almost any crime , cover - up or sell - out , no matter how heinous , in pursuit of their prime directive of maintaining power , rather than of representing the interests of their ( American ) constituents .
I 'm deeply disappointed in the likes of Waxman and Leahy , who know about all this and are doing nothing .
I can't help but picture them carefully calculating the political fallout ( or perhaps their personal safety ) , rather than in carrying out their sworn oath to defend the Constitution .
When so many politicians seem to be so hung up on protecting their personal legacy , I find it ironic that they , being the ones with the power , stand by and let foot soldiers like Sibel shoulder the responsibility of shining light on such major abuses .
Thank you Sibel , and thank you Brad .
I do n't know much about the American Conservative - its circulation and sphere of influence - but I sincerely hope their story starts to make a dent in the consciousness of the MSM and the public .

It is interesting that on national security issues we progressives and some conservatives can find common interest .
Although I do n't share many of their causes , I still keep the AbleDanger blog up on my page because of the Able Danger issue itself and 9/11 , in particular Peter Lance 's investigation on the government 's failure to detect , follow , and deal with national security threats .

The fact that Pat Buchanan started the " American Conservative " magazine has me worried .
That means this story can be written off as an opinion or they 're going to focus only on the Democrats involved .
After so many years of people testifying without being under oath , I fear people in America wo n't notice the story disappearing without a trace .
That would be a tragedy , considering Sibel WAS under oath and allowed BY THE DEMOCRATS to testify for the first time .
To recap : this is NOT opinion , it IS news !

The sheer complexity of this story almost guaranties no coverage .
As usual , I hope Bill Moyers and PBS is paying attention and will give it the in depth , yet understandable treatment it deserves .
Previous specials such as " Buying The War " , " Capitol Crimes " and " Cheney 's Law " were what public television is all about .
Too bad almost nobody seems to have seen those shows .

Ross Levin @ 16 asked :
Is this related to the Krikorian court case ?
Yes .
In that her recent under oath deposition --- where the Obama DoJ , unlike the Bush DoJ , chose NOT to invoke the so - called " state secrets privilege " --- was given in the Ohio Election Commission case of Schmidt v. Krikorian .
Her full 8/8/09 sworn deposition in that case --- both transcript and video --- was posted here several weeks ago , and we 've been following that case very closely since Edmonds ' deposition was first subpoenaed for it in early August .

I think comment # 12 is too widely drawn .
You people that have worked in a bueaucracy or in the government know that there 's only so many hours in the day , and only so much you can know ( not much ) , yet we expect all the government officials to know about all the corruption ( that is hidden by the criminals ) , but they probably find it hard enough to get to their meetings and boss around their 108 assistants .
People generally turn the other way and turn away from wrong doing and flee it and pretend it is n't happening , and generally do n't want to hear about it as it spoils their own smooth sailing and is often considered gossip or rumors .
Think about Blagogevich for instance - for 3 years the FEDS had wiretaps going , and Fitzgerald , although he made a big deal press conference , still did n't have the goods to nail Blago - after 3 YEARS of ( probably not so secret ) wiretaps .
We heard the tape of Blago saying he was n't giving it away for free , but we all know every big power position that is appointed like that is a wheel and deal playa thing , and they all do that all the time , and the whole rest of the Illinois state politicians IMMEDIATELY started jockeying and scrambling to get the position , even trying to remove Blago 's powr by some fiat legislation .
The problem is the actual law is already so lax that they can make deals and there is no way to criminally prosecute and win , since the laws say if there is not a specific quid pro quo verbatim deal made , you can't get 'em , and it 's just the appearance of impropriety .
Remember they make the laws , and make all the loopholes all of them should ever need , and it 's only when some go far beyond the legalized crime into the blatant and open disregard that they get pinched .
So there 's a general mindset that " this just could n't be happening " ( Sibel Edmonds points are so shocking people think it 's garbage ' ) , then there 's the " sting " plots of counterintelligence and state department 's " good relations desired " used as excuses for covering up or not getting into it , and then of course " it could destroy good people 's lives ! " ( much like the 12,000 DC bugshots phone list for the DC madame - they kept jidden away and stricken from the public record because " it couyld destroy good people 's lives " and " someone might have dialed the wrong number - roflmao ) .
It does n't matter to so many people anymore , because what is ethical is considered either far right religious fanaticism if you stick to it , or terrible left wing liberalism if you stick to the other side of ethical .
Most people pulling stuff are probably aware it 's shady or would be if someone pointed out why , but when the law says they can as long as they do n't verbatim outline it to the letter and shake on it or put it in writing - they likely do it happily because their personal benefit is great , the law says they can , and " that 's how it works " , and 14 other people and 3 lawyers were handling their paparwork on it so they had no idea , etc , etc .
One of the big problems in government is people are afraid to stqand up to corruption because " it 's in their department " and they have been trained and told " that reflects badly on them " .
So we get loads of government employees and administrators and bosses who keep their heads down and do n't stir the pot , because they would be " evaluated for failure " if they discover corruption under them , and try to put an end to it .
The reason for that is our massively lunatic society and after all it's just people in government ... and their just kookballs under kookballs , too .
Sibel Edmonds boss probably panicked with fear when she brought it up , oh golly was he going to get reamed and demoted and be under suspicion of being a participant , and with our like I said insane " gut feeling " " cop sense " freak society where facts are secondary to how someone looks , talks or acts or twitches , they all know the Salem Witch Trials start the minute anyone points out any corruption .
Look what Sibel has gone through .
She 's no hero , the answer for everyone is " this ca n't be happening ! "
It 's an X file .

Correct me if I 'm wrong but the deposition she gave in Washington was not the actual court case but some pre-trial findings type activity and she is supposed to testify in the actual trial in Ohio in early October .
Many thanks to you Brad for providing the video of the DC event .
Many commenters on many different blogs have mentioned the difficulty in their busy lives of sitting through her entire testimony .
Those of a 9/11 bent may want to check out the compilation videos at 9/11 blogger where just the parts that in any way relate to it are collected .
I hope ( and assume ) they got whatever permission needed to make such a highlight tape , I do know they credited you , B , for the original .
Arkinsaw # 13 ... Sibels blog : 123realchange.blogspot , has a great piece about our recent missile sale to Turkey and many commenters seem exteremely well informed on all the geo politics of the subject .
I do think it has to be related to our change of plans in Poland and the Chezch republic .

SiliconDoc @ 22 : Sorry .
Calling bullshit on ya .
Again .
You wrote , in your general apologist comment for corruption and lawbreaking :
It does n't matter to so many people anymore , because what is ethical is considered either far right religious fanaticism if you stick to it , or terrible left wing liberalism if you stick to the other side of ethical .
Bullshit .
The " far right religious fanatic [s ] " were in control of DoJ for the last 8 years , and they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING when it came to the Rule of Law , unless they could find Dems breaking it ( and when they could n't , pin some bullshit on 'em , see Siegelman , et al ) .
You then further the bullshit with your allegation of " terrible left wing liberalism if you stick to the other side of ethical . "
It was the left wing ( Liberal or otherwise ) , who have been calling for accountability , the Rule of Law , and defense of the U.S. Constitution for the last eight years , while you and your folks were making excuses for the most unprecedented law - breaking , criminality , and Constitution - shredding in the history of this nation .
Take your despicable , partisan , apologist screeds and subtle , yet invidious deviseness over to the Fox Nation , Silicon .
Nobody here is buying that garbage , no matter how much you keep attempting to sell it .

Her 8/8/09 under - oath deposition in D.C. was in advance of the Ohio Election Commission trial / hearing on Sept. 3rd .
She was called as a witness , but was out of the country , and despite Krikorian ( defendant ) 's request to extend the hearing to Sep. 5th , so she could testing , the OEC refused .
The ' high drama ' 9/3/09 hearing ran long , and had to be continued until Oct. 1 , which means that Sibel will likely be able to testify in person then , if she is called .
She has said she is willing , and Krikorian had previously said he wants her to do so .
So hopefully that will happen .
Hope that clarifies .

Imagine .
Imagine that the US , in a bold stroke , maybe ( certainly ) even cynically , ' take the high road ' , and suddenly ' comes clean ' on all of its deep political actions , exposing , charging , and incarcerating to the letter of the law .
Even cooperating with foreign governments who are doing the same .
Just imagine the good will that would be generated that would allow the US to regain the moral leadership role that it only currently holds in tatters and shreds .
Obama and any other deep political strategists , consider airing all American dirty laundry in one fell swoop .
Obama you go down in history as the man who cleaned up .
You deep political players get to enjoy the benefits of a newly untarnished US to plunder and corrupt .
The rest of us get the semblance of justice , better than any reality tv .
Seriously , the rule of law is the ultimate glue of social cohesion .
At the end of the day , smoke and mirrors will not serve to fool the masses .
Keep adhering to the rule of law , ironically it will benefit you and America , and maybe you might even begin to see the moral benefit .

I 'm told the missing DOD money was not actually $ 2.3 trillion , it was $ 7 trillion .
I understand it was offshored to Israel to fund the U.S. coup and implement the Rockefeller / Rothschild / Crown agenda .
Once they figured out how to fund the Shadow Government off the books , Congress became irrelevant .
Of course Israel double - crossed their 9/11 co-conspirators and is blackmailing the GHW Bush contingent - which explains why the US stood silently by as Israel pillaged Lebanon and why the US is powerless to stop Israel from taking out Iran .
The only way for the US to regain any true power or moral authority is for those with knowledge to turn on those at the top and reveal the evidence of the coup .
Only when the truth is fully revealed does the threat of blackmail disappear .
Dov Zakheim was the facilitator inside the DOD .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges Monday against Bank of America for misleading investors about billions of dollars in bonuses paid to top executives at Merrill Lynch following its purchase of the brokerage giant .
But the SEC simultaneously announced that it would settle with the Charlotte , N.C. - based lender , who will pay a penalty of $ 33 million as a result .
Calling the settlement a " constructive conclusion " to the controversial subject , Bank of America neither admitted nor denied the charges .
The settlement with the SEC will remain subject to court approval .
Regulators alleged that Bank of America failed to disclose plans to as much as $ 5.8 billion in bonuses for fiscal year 2008 in its proxy statement .
Instead , Bank of America told shareholders that Merrill had agreed not to pay year - end performance bonuses , according to the SEC .
" Failing to disclose that a struggling company will pay out billions of dollars in performance bonuses obviously violates that duty and warrants the significant financial penalty imposed by today 's settlement , " Robert Khuzami , Director of the SEC 's division of enforcement , said in a statement .
Merrill 's decision to pay big bonuses first came to light in February , after New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo accused the firm of " secretly " rewarding executives before its merger with BofA closed .
The subsequent investigation by state officials ultimately led to a string of revelations , including Merrill 's decision to move up the date of its year - end bonus payments .
Bank of America chief executive officer Ken Lewis also alleged during the investigation that federal regulators threatened to remove him and other board members if Bank of America backed out of the deal .
Congress waded into the issue shortly thereafter , as lawmakers grilled Lewis , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the matter .
Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif. , the ranking member for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said that the SEC 's charges against BofA offered a " validation " of the concerns of his fellow committee members .
The committee has been looking into what transpired after BofA agreed to buy Merrill and Issa hinted that the investigation may not be over .
" The circumstances certainly underscore the need for us to continue our investigation of the Bank of America -- Merrill Lynch acquisition and the role officials at the Treasury and Federal Reserve had in pressuring the acquisition to move forward , " Issa said in a statement .
Cuomo's office also indicated Monday that Bank of America may not be free from further scrutiny , adding that they were continuing their investigation about whether Merrill 's bonuses violated state securities laws .
Separately , Bank of America announced a shake up in some of its top management ranks Monday , including the hiring of former Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) executive Sallie Krawcheck to run the bank 's global wealth management unit .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) shares rose more than 3.5 % in Monday afternoon trading .
Talkback : Did Bank of America make a mistake by buying Merrill Lynch ?
“ SchwarmStrom ” ( literally , “ swarm power ” )
An ambitious project was unveiled in Germany on Wednesday to install mini gas - fired power plants in people ’s basements and produce as much electricity as two nuclear reactors within a year .
The Hamburg - based renewable energy group Lichtblick and its automaker partner Volkswagen say the plants would produce not only heating and hot water but also electricity , with any excess power fed into the local grid .
The two firms said the concept of “ SchwarmStrom ” ( literally , “ swarm power ” ) would allow Germany to abandon nuclear and coal power stations sooner and help compensate for the volatility of renewables like wind and solar power .
The plants also reduce harmful carbon dioxide emissions by up to 60 percent compared to conventional heat and electricity generation , they added in a joint statement .
In the coming year the programme will install 100,000 of the mini plants , producing between them 2,000 megawatts of electricity , the same as two nuclear plants , Lichtblick and VW said .
“ SchwarmStrom is revolutionising power production in Germany .
It clears the way for more renewable energy and an exit from power from nuclear and coal , ” the statement added .
“ The home power plants together form a huge , invisible power station that does n’t make the countryside ugly or require additional infrastructure . ”
The project “ is thoroughly feasible if the project reaches the forecast size , ” Claudia Kemfert of the DIW research institute told AFP .
She added by way of comparison that “ just getting rid of incandescent light bulbs would be the same as shutting down one nuclear reactor . ”
Gas plants have an advantage over nuclear power stations in that the heat produced by the latter is wasted , the DIW energy expert said .
But “ the most ecological would be to feed these mini-plants with biogas ” rather than natural gas , Kemfert noted .
Lichtblick said another advantage of its plan was that tens of thousands of generators could be mobilised to meet a surge in demand or if drought made it hard to cool nuclear plants or a calm spell idled wind turbines .
VW will contribute to the project by providing a gas - powered engine similar to one used in its popular Golf model .
But LBBW auto analyst Stefan Sigrist told AFP : “ This is mainly a marketing offensive .
It is chic for VW to bask in a greener light . ”
Although the generators are not a new concept , the project is novel in that Lichtblick would retain control over the plants after their installation .
Households would pay around 5,000 euros ( 7,250 dollars ) to have the generators set up along with an appropriate heating system .
But individuals would then pay a lower price for heating and receive a modest “ rent ” for hosting the generator , as well as a bonus at the end of the year calculated on electricity revenues that resulted from Lichtblick ’s sales .

Meet Gwen Thompson , the ' Homeless ' American Girl American Girl markets ' homeless ' doll who lives in a car with her mother .
Sept. 26 , 2009  --
She might never live in Barbie 's dream - house , but Gwen Thompson is the talk of toy town .
She 's the world 's first " homeless " doll .
The forlorn figurine is the newest member of the posh American Girl doll collection .
Owned by Mattel , American Girl has been selling expensive and popular dolls for over two decades .
This year , they introduced Thompson , a grade school girl who lives with her mother in the family car A representative for American Girl says the doll is meant to teach tolerance and is part or an outreach program teaching young girls how to spot bullying and stand up and speak out against it .
In a storybook that details the doll 's life , Gwen 's mother revealed , " I woke up one morning to learn that my husband had left us , and my daughter and I were evicted -- truly homeless .
I always thought homelessness happened to other people .
Never to me . "
Ms. Thompson goes on to describe their destitute lifestyle , " At first , my daughter and I slept in our car .
I 'd park so that we'd wake up near a wayside rest area or restaurant - somewhere where we could use the sink for washing up - and then I 'd go to work and pretend that life was just as it had always been . "
According to the National Center on Family Homelessness , one out of every 50 American children are homeless .
Gwen represents just one of the 1.5 million U.S. children on the street .
The tragic toy sells for $ 95 and is part of a 2009 limited edition set .
This is not the first time American Girl has sparked controversy .
In 2005 , conservative groups called for a boycott of all American Girl products after it was reported that the company donated to a youth organization that supports abortion rights and promotes acceptance of lesbians .

For many people , texting serves as a useful tool .
But for British student Caroline Tagg , a study of text - messaging earned her a PhD .
That 's right , Dr. Tagg now has a doctorate of philosophy in texting — the first of its kind .
To earn the degree , Tagg spent nearly four years studying a total of 11,000 text messages containing 190,000 words and sent by 235 people , all of which she compiled and analyzed in a database .
The Telegraph reports :
[ Tagg ] discovered that people text in the same way as if they were talking , using unnecessary words such as ' oh ' , 'erm ' and often use grammatical abbreviations like ' dunno ' ....
And she discovered from her 80,000 word thesis that there is more to texting that just abbreviations — something most people associate with texting .
" Actually , not many people use abbreviations , " she said .
" People use playful manipulation and metaphors .
It is a playful language .
Not only are they quite creative , it is also quite expressive . "
She found that the average text message contains 17.5 words and that ( shocker ) some texts can be about incredibly mundane matters — " Hi .
I know you are at work but I just wanted you to know I found my pen lid " being a prime example .
She also called the experience " enlightening . "
So what do you think :
Was the research a waste of time , or is Tagg a pioneer in exploring the linguistics of our newest communication method ?

Yesterday it was revealed that , despite her calls for tougher anti-piracy legislation , Lily Allen herself created illicit mixtapes full of copyrighted music and made them available to the public .
Today , after having rationalized why it is okay for her to pirate music , she killed her pro-copyright blog because " the abuse was getting too much . "
In a few dozen articles on her new blog , Lily Allen complained how illegal file - sharing is bankrupting the music industry .
Unfortunately for her she forgot to remove some of her old mixtapes from LilyAllenMusic.com , which revealed that she ’s not the saint she claimed to be .
However , just a few hours after we posted the article , Lily explained that she ’s not a pirate but simply did n’t know any better .
“ I made those mixtapes 5 years ago , I did n’t have a knowledge of the workings of the music industry back then … , ” she responded .
What she probably meant to say is that she had no clue about copyright before her income depended on it .
Yet , she believes that every other person on this planet should know better , or get their Internet access cut off .
Way to go girl .
In fact , the old Lily from 5 years ago is not too different from the hundreds and thousands of casual file - sharers today .
Copyright is a complex issue and the boundaries between right / wrong and illegal / legal are not always that clear .
Instead of waging a war against file - sharers on the blog she could have tried to pass her knowledge about copyright on to the public .
She chose to make it a soundboard for frustrated artists instead , which only resulted in negative reactions from the public up to a point where Lily could n’t take it anymore .
Indeed , Torrent Freak read one posting on the site which had in excess of 100 comments – only 4 of which supported the singer ’s position .
“ I ’ve shut down the blog , the abuse was getting too much , ” she explained on Twitter a few minutes after she announced the end of her legendary music career .
Just before she pulled the blog she wrote “ I will not make another record , ” adding “ The days of me making money from recording music has been and gone as far as I ’m concerned , so I do n’t stand to profit from [ anti- piracy ] legislation . ”
There are a lot of lessons to be learned from the debate Lily inflamed over the last week .
While there seemed to be an endless stream of rich musicians willing to complain on behalf of bands we ’ve never heard of with “ we are n’t suffering , they are ” statements , there were also huge numbers of music fans who were more than a little reluctant to be lectured by well - off superstars on the issue .
But most prominent were those vehemently opposed to UK plans to disconnect alleged infringers from the Internet .
The abuse that Lily spoke of on her blog largely was n’t directed at her , but at these plans and her support for them .
Think again Mr Mandelson .
LONDON Sept. 4 , 2009  --
This morning a steam engine pulled into London 's Liverpool Street Station .
On board : 22 Holocaust survivors who had traveled 700 miles across Europe from Prague in the Czech Republic .
And there to meet them on the platform :
The man who saved their lives 70 years ago .
The last time they made this journey it was the late - summer of 1939 .
They were children , and the Nazi armies were advancing .
In those tense times , 669 mainly Jewish children boarded specially chartered trains at Prague 's Wilson Station , bound for England and safety .
" Our father was , when we were leaving , he was in the next room sobbing , " Alice Masters told ABC News today on board during the final leg of the journey from the English coast .
Alice and her sister Josephine - sitting side by side as the train rattled towards London - never saw their parents again .
" We had letters from them until 1942 , " Alice told us .
" The last letter was March ' 42 .
And they were taken away to the concentration camp on June 6 , 1942 . "
Hanna Slome , a sprightly 84 - year old who eventually settled in New York , was just 14 when her mother dropped her at the station in Prague .
Today Slome remembered the last words they exchanged : " She just said , ' I 'm packing you up and you 're going .
And I 'll be there .
I promise you I 'll be there . ' "
Her mother died in the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp .
This journey , Slome and other survivors said , on the 70th anniversary of their flight from Czechoslovakia is in memory of their parents , in memory of all those murdered by the Nazis , and in honor of the man who saved them from near certain death .
Back then Sir Nicholas Winton was an ordinary , fun-loving London stockbroker .
But when he heard stories from friends in Prague of Jews losing their jobs and homes under Nazi occupation , Winton decided to do something .
Fearing that worse was to come , Winton decided to save as many Czech children as he could .
He masterminded their incredible escape .
Winton raised money , begged the British government to grant visas , chartered the trains , forged papers , and found families in England to adopt the children .
Sir Nicholas Winton Is Now 100
In 1939 Winton was there on the platform to greet the children .
This morning , now 100 - years - old , he was waiting on the platform once again , frail , but still standing and leaning on a cane .
He shook hands with each survivor as they got off the train .
" The trouble 70 years ago was getting them together with the people who were going to look after them , " Winton said today .
" I 've got no responsibility this time . "
Just the grateful thanks of the 669 he saved and their descendants .
There are , they say , 7,000 of them scattered all over the world .
Obama will address a joint session of Congress on health - care reform in prime time on Wednesday .
( Photo by AP ) Obama to address Congress on reform
President Barack Obama will address a joint session of Congress on health care reform in prime time on Wednesday , Sept. 9 , a senior official tells POLITICO .
Obama will receive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at the White House the day before for a previously scheduled sit -down .

The last time a president addressed a joint session of Congress that was n’t a State of the Union , or the traditional first address by a new president , was Sept. 20 , 2001 , when President George W. Bush spoke on the war on terrorism following the 9/11 attacks .
After plans for the session had been reported , Reid and Pelosi released a letter of invitation to the president : " Our nation is closer than ever to achieving health insurance reform that will lower costs , retain choice , improve quality and expand coverage .
We are committed to reaching this goal .
We would like to invite you to address a Joint Session of the Congress on Wednesday , September 9 on health insurance reform .
Thank you for considering this invitation to speak to the Congress and the nation . "
Obama plans to give lawmakers a more specific prescription for health care legislation than he has in the past , aides said .
Congress technically returns to Washington on Sept. 8 , the day after Labor Day .
But many members had planned Sept. 9 as their first workday , so Obama is seizing the first moment when he will have maximum impact .
The address to Congress , the second since Obama took offiice , is a way for White House aides to achieve maximum news coverage as they kick off their plans to recovery from a disappointing August congressional break , which saw the president 's poll number fall as voices of opposition to health care legislation rose .
The exact time of the speech has not been set , but prime time ensures a huge viewing audience beyond the Beltway .
Presidential aides have promised Obama will take back the reins after allowing Congress to work its will on his idea , without one specific plan for Democratic lawmakers to defend back home .
We ’re entering a new season , ” senior adviser David Axelrod said in an interview Tuesday .
“ It ’s time to synthesize and harmonize these strands and get this done .
We ’re confident that we can do that .
But obviously it is a different phase .
We ’re going to approach it in a different way .
The president is going to be very active . ”
Aides said Obama does not plan to make a public option , or government plan , a make - or - break issue when he spells out his specifics .
“ We have been saying all along that the most important part of this debate is not the public option , but rather ensuring choice and competition , ” an aide said .
“ There are lots of different ways to get there . ”
The content of Obama 's presentation is still being debated in the West Wing .
Aides have discussed whether to stick to broad principles , or to send specific legislative language to Capitol Hill .
Some hybrid is likely , the officials said .
The White House said given the Senate Finance Committee until Sept. 15 to try to reach a bipartisan deal , but Obama now is short - circuiting that process .
Axelrod said Tuesday : " We ’re not in the second inning .
We ’re not in the fourth inning .
We ’re in the eighth or ninth inning here , and so there ’s not a lot of time to waste . ”
" His goal is to create the best possible situation for consumers , create competition and choice , " Axelrod said .
" We want to bring a measure of security to people who have health insurance today .
We want to help those who do n't have coverage today , because they can't afford it , get insurance they can afford .
And we want to do it in a way that reduces the overall cost of the system as a whole . "
Democrats expressed relief .
A top Senate Democratic leadership aide said : " It will be greeted largely with relief from lawmakers who have been looking for the president to take more of a role , especially as things have reached something of an impasse . "
" While there may be some differences and disappointments over the details that he ultimately lays out , the fact that he 's rolling up his sleeves and entering the fray , a lot of people on the Hill feel they could use the assistance , " the aide said .
" The [ lack of a ] public option certainly makes it a harder sell .
But overall , the idea of the president stepping in and taking this on is a welcome development . "
Republicans questioned the impact the speech would have .
Brad Dayspring , an aide to House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , said : " The last time a president addressed a joint session of Congress to sell a radical government health care plan was Bill Clinton on September 22 , 1993 . "
Michael Steel , a spokesman for House Majority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , added : " Obviously , we want to hear what the president has to say .
But the American people do n't want a new speech , they want a new plan .
We need to scrap the Democrats ' government takeover of health care and start over on a real , bipartisan plan for reform . "

The advice on which knives to get , how to keep them sharp , and even what cutting boards to use ( only straight - up wood ) comes from Norman Weinstein , the knife skills guy at New York 's Institute of Culinary Education .
Much of it is good , if oft - told , advice , but we particularly like his take on how to hold your blade :
Chef Weinstein 's instruction for actually using a knife is all about relaxation .
Keep your arms in a relaxed position and choke up on the knife :
Your thumb and forefinger should be pinching the actual blade , not wrapped around the handle .
It 'll take some adjustment to hold the knife this way , but Weinstein reminds us , " You have to use the knife correctly before you can cut anything . "

La Commission européenne veut investir dans la recherche sur la future norme de téléphonie mobile de quatrième génération ( Long Term Evolution , LTE , dite " 4G " ) , dont la commercialisation devrait commencer à partir de 2010 dans certains pays de l'UE .
Elle a annoncé mardi 18 août un nouveau financement de 18 millions d'euros pour développer cette norme , qui permettra notamment un accès mobile à Internet dix fois plus rapide qu'avec les réseaux actuels de troisième génération UMTS .
Avec 100 mégabits par seconde annoncés , la technologie 4G permettra de rendre plus confortable l'accès mobile à Internet , à la télévision ou aux vidéos à la demande .
La Commission commencera à négocier en septembre les modalités de ce financement avec des consortiums de projets de recherche , pour un démarrage prévu en janvier .
Entre 2004 et 2007 , Bruxelles avait déjà accordé 25 millions d'euros pour la recherche sur la norme LTE , qui est actuellement testée par plusieurs opérateurs en Finlande , en Allemagne , au Royaume - Uni , en Norvège et en Suède .
Dans ces deux derniers pays , la LTE devrait être disponible au cours du premier semestre 2010 .
En France , le service devrait être lancé par Orange ( France Télécom ) en 2011 ou 2012 .
Les réseaux LTE nécessiteront aussi moins d'antennes que pour la norme de deuxième génération GSM , aujourd ' hui la plus répandue , et pourraient réduire la fracture numérique entre zones urbaines et rurales en favorisant l'arrivée de l'Internet à haut débit dans les régions moins peuplées .
Au niveau mondial , les opérateurs de télécommunications devraient investir quelque 6 milliards d'euros dans les équipements LTE d'ici 2013 , selon des analystes cités par Bruxelles .
Le Monde avec AFP
PrideDEPOT.com recently reported on the Treasure Valleyâ€™s CBS affiliate , KBCI Channel 2â€™s sensational and inflammatory version of the facts surrounding the arrest of Wayne Olin , 65 , who allegedly exposed himself to a Garden City undercover cop in a wooded area near the Boise River .
Olinâ€™s felony solicitation charge was reduced the day after his arrest to misdemeanor indecent exposure .
KBCI covered the story as a â€ œGay Sex Stingâ€ that resulted in the arrest of Olin who has never been identified as a gay man .
PrideDEPOT.com contends that KBCIâ€™s coverage was over inflated and the stationâ€™s news judgment was flawed .
This incendiary reporting of a non-news story was not limited to only KBCI .
The same arrest took on an entirely different scope and scale from the NBC affiliate , KTBV Channel 7 .
Channel 7 exploited the incident with inflammatory coverage that started with Olin then launched into unrelated issues seemingly aimed at promoting misinformation and loathing of gay men .
The story starts off with anchor Mark Johnson warning viewers that the facts of the story may not be suitable for children .
Johnson pitches the story to reporter Ysabel Bilbao , who set the scene for viewers that the Greenbelt , a popular pedestrian trail , has hidden dangers where men are having sex with other men .
If there was any legitimacy to the story at all , Bilbao shot holes in it for the apparent sake of grabbing viewerâ€™s attention .
On its website , KTVB.com posted two stories about the arrest .
The first report posted at 12:37 pm , shows a video with a mug shot of Olin along with the caption â€ œ65 - year - old man arrestedâ€ under the headline â€ œSex arrests along Greenbelt in Garden City.â€ 
When the video is played it runs a completely unrelated story about a murder case in Meridian .
The only thing that is related is there are men in orange .
That error is not what is at issue here but does raise questions about KTVBâ€™s commitment to accuracy .
This first story provides a contrast to the second report , posted just hours later , which is deeply concerning to the LGBT community and their allies .
Bilbao takes the questionable news story about a misdemeanor arrest and mutates it by taking viewers on her odyssey of gay cruising .
In her coverage , Bilbao equates public sex acts and indecent exposure with gay cruising .
Whether it is her personal bias or obvious lack of information about gay men , one thing is very clear â€ “ she effectively demonized gay men through her four minute package .
In his opening to Bilbaoâ €™s report , anchor Mark Johnson says , â€ œGarden City police say he [ Olin ] asked an undercover detective for sexual favors and then publically engaged in an act on himself .â€ 
Then Johnson says , â€ œOlin was doing something in the area known as cruisingâ€  and he tosses the story to Bilbao who is reporting live from the Greenbelt .
In the written article Bilbao quotes the Judge in Olinâ€™s arraignment as saying , â€ œDid willfully and lewdly expose your genitals in public place , to wit along the Boise River Greenbelt at East 48th and Mystic Cove Park.â€ 
Bilbao immediately translates the Judgeâ€™s statement into this : â€ œItâ€™s called cruising and itâ€™s been a problem for officers all around the Treasure Valley for more than 10 years now.â€ 
Of course Bilbao never quantifies the problem , number of arrests , or convictions to support her â€œmore than 10 years nowâ€ statement .
Was it just one arrest , 10 or maybe 100 arrests ?
Bilbao failed to offer precise information to support the statement in her report .
KTVB captions Bilbaoâ€™s video reading , â€ œMen having sex in very public location .â€ 
She says , â€ œIt happened at Plantation Island where police say the men were having sex along the Greenbelt .
Itâ€™s called cruising and itâ€™s easy to find online.â€ 
Bilbao and Johnson donâ€™t understand what cruising is , yet they stand to misinform viewers on the subject without putting it into proper context .
Bilbao demonstrated that she has total disregard for journalistic standards when it comes to reporting on issues impacting gay people .
KTVBâ€™s overblown story about a single arrest of a man who exposed himself sets the stage to stereotype gay men as inherently deviant and something to be feared .
The vast majority of gay men DO NOT engage in public anonymous sex , and the small minority of gay men who do would be less inclined to do so if the media and political hacks did not demean or vilify them as Bilbao did in her report .
KTVB failed miserably to first understand the subject that they reported .
Had they done a little fact - finding they would discover that the men most often arrested for this kind of conduct are not gay .
They are men who mostly self - identify as being straight men , but sometimes have sex with other men .
In her report Bilbao says , â€ œMen women and children are spending their summer days enjoying the Greenbelt , but what may be hiding in the bushes specifically in one area , has Garden City Police concerned.â€ 
Oh , it gets worse !
As if mischaracterizing cruising is was not enough , Bilbao continues with a dramatic web interlude .
She is seen on camera scrolling though listings of locations and non-verbal signals on a cruising website .
â€ œAfter a quick Google search , she tells viewers , â€ œWe found websites that directed those interested to public locations like parks , gyms , truck and rest stops all around the Treasure Valley and throughout the state.â€ 
PrideDEPOT.com tried for over an hour to locate the site Bilbao was surfing and we were not successful in locating it .
Bilbao misinformed viewers by calling this a â€œquick Google search.â€ 
However , we also noticed something very curious .
In one screen shot we saw what appears to be the word â€ œ [ M]embershipâ€  suggesting that KTVB may have had to register as a member of an adult gay website .
Even novice web surfers understand , membership means you have to register with the website and create an account in order to login and view all the content on the site .
Did Bilbao or someone at KTVB sign up as a member of an adult gay website so that she could use this information for her report ?
PrideDEPOT.com did a series of web searches using the word â€˜cruising .â€ ™
The majority of sites we found were travel curse lines and trip package sites .
Bilbaoâ€™s report implicitly suggests there is a connection between men having inappropriate and illegal adult consensual sex in a public bathroom with child molesters .
KTVB showed images of children playing and families sitting at picnic tables in a park 20 miles west of where Olin was arrested in her attempt to link it to the Greenbelt story .
Bilbao says , â€ œFamily - friendly Lakeview Park in Nampa has been a hot spot for years .
The first big arrest happened in 1997 , when eight men between 25 and 75 years old were arrested for having sex in the parkâ€™s bathroom.â€ 
Just then , there are images of urinals and a toilet in the menâ€™s room .
â€ œThen more arrests , â€ says Bilbao , â€ œin the same park six years later.â€ 
As she says this viewers see a childrenâ€™s play area in the distance from inside the bathroom as the door slowly opens .
KTVB clearly wanted to convey the impression of a predator peering out the bathroom door toward innocent children at play , something viewers might see in a story about child molesters .
But this story was not about child molesters .
This is an over - inflated story about a man charged for indecent exposure ; a man who may not actually be gay !
Bilbao hyped up the Greenbelt arrest and went 20 miles away to dig up a 12 - year - old story and never mentions any recent incidents or arrests in the Nampa Park that she described as a â€œhot spot.â€ 
The most recent incident or incidents she talks about happened 6 years ago and she offered no details .
Without missing a beat Bilbao is seen back at her computer on the membership only cruising website .
She highlights it on the screen while telling viewers the specific signals and codes adult men use to connect with one another .
Bilbao is a journalistic hack who weaved together disjointed issues in order to create a patchwork of misinformation on a story about an indecent exposure charge .
Not only that , she can be credited with offering tips to gay bashers and others who may actually harm men who are gay or perceived as gay .
Thanks to Bilbaoâ€™s hackneyed story , an unsuspecting straight man with allergies is now perceived as a gay man looking for sex just because he happens to rub his nose and cough in a public menâ€™s room .
At the very end of her report Bilbao adds a little 12 - second pinch to give herself some plausible deniability as she slips in , â€ œSo police arenâ€™t sure , but they donâ€™t believe that these men are dangerous or that their contacting any children they say they are straight men , gay men , some married some divorced , some have children and they are coming from all social classes , but parents should be aware anyway.â€ 
It is the previous 4 - minutes of coverage and Bilbaoâ€™s creative imagery that has us concerned .
Does this kind of reporting stop anonymous sex in public places , ABSOLUTELY NOT !
But what this style of reporting does accomplish is to instill panic that gay men are to be feared and demeaned .
KTVBâ€™s report enforces the misconception that gay men in Idaho are romping around in bushes or in public bathrooms near children and families .
Bilbao and KTVB should be nominated for an Emmy for Best Drama in the manufactured news category .

The Ivy League institutions Harvard and Yale have been battered by the financial crisis , losing a combined $ 18bn ( £ 10 bn ) in their endowments over the last year .
America's two richest universities , usually known for their investing prowess , warned of further cuts after seeing their endowments shrink by 30 % due to problems with their hedge fund and private equity portfolios .
Harvard 's endowment dropped by $ 11bn to $ 26bn in the year to June , a fall of 30 % , according to the Harvard Management Company , which oversees the endowment .
Excluding donations and distributions , the decline in investment performance amounted to 27.3 % , the biggest in four decades .
The losses forced the 373 - year - old university to lay off 275 staff this summer – its first ever – and halt plans for a campus expansion across the Charles river in Allston , Massachusetts .
The endowment covers a third of its annual budget .
Yale 's endowment fell by $ 7bn to $ 16bn over the period , a worse - than - expected drop of 30 % .
" We want to alert you to the fact that another round of reductions will be necessary , " Yale 's president , Richard Levin , wrote in a letter to the Yale community .
" Only a small fraction of our endowment is invested in publicly traded securities , so the recent stockmarket rebound has not had a substantial effect , " Levin said .
" The bulk of our endowment remains invested in illiquid assets , which have not begun to recover their value . "
This means that Yale will have an annual deficit of $ 150 m from 2011 - 14 , he wrote .
He said the school would cut non-salary expenses by another 5 % this year , having already reduced staff and non-salary expenses by 7.5 % .
Yale , based in New Haven , Connecticut , has cut 600 jobs and postponed construction plans worth $ 2bn .
An initiative to improve administrative services will be scaled back and the university will cut spending on its West Campus development by more than 25 % .
Both Harvard and Yale invested heavily in hedge funds , private equity and timber in recent years .
Last year many of their bets did not pay off and both lost far more than other universities , which focused on stocks and bonds , and where endowments shrank by 18 % on average , according to the research firm Wilshire Associates .
Jane Mendillo , head of Harvard Management Company , said its portfolio was affected by " extreme volatility and financial dysfunction " .
She blamed Harvard 's reliance on illiquid asset classes for the losses .
For years , Harvard kept hardly any cash on hand but now plans to keep as much as $ 500m .
Mendillo said in her report that " nearly every asset class did poorly , " and she called the past year " very likely the most challenging period in modern times for the financial markets as well as for the Harvard portfolio " .
She added : " We expect to see a prolonged period of instability and slower growth in some markets . "
Harvard 's private equity investments declined by 31.6 % while hedge funds saw an 18.6 % fall .
Mendillo has introduced changes including bringing more assets under internal management rather than using outside money managers , pulling money out of some hedge funds and exiting some private equity funds , resulting in a $ 3bn cut in commitments to private equity and real estate funds .
Harvard is also reducing its exposure to real assets such as property , timber and commodities .
Despite Harvard 's loss last year , the endowment has still returned an average of 8.9 % every year for the last decade , while other funds have risen by just 3.2 % on average .
Brown University also suffered large losses , with its endowment falling by nearly 27 % to $ 2.04bn .

Update : my changes have been merged into rip by Chris .
Nice !
The good stuff is here , my ADD - addled friends
I ’ve just spent a bit of time kicking the tyres of Rip , an alternative package manager by Chris Wanstrath .
If you ’ve done any Rails development recently , and tried to keep a vendor directory of gems in order , you ’ll know the pain that almost certainly inspired the Rip project .
While there are already some alternatives ( bundler , dependencies ) , I like the elegant and lo-fi approach that Rip takes .
Environments
Rip lets you partition the dependencies you install into seperate ‘ environments ’ .
When an environment is active , the installed versions are the only ones that running code will be able to load .
So , if you have one project that needs a specific version of soup , for example , you can install that version in an environment for that project .
In your default environment , you can continue to upgrade / downgrade / play about with the gems and libraries that are installed , but as long as you activate the other , known - good environment when you are working with soup , you can be sure that none of the new versions will interfere .
Each environment is like a sandbox .
Unsurprisingly , it ’s a lot like the cheap branching that git brings - you can play around as much as you like , but always get your environment back to working state just by typing rip use < environment > .
The elegance of Rip
I said above that I thought Rip was elegant , and that ’s because these environments are just subdirectories which are added to the $ RUBYLIB environment variable .
This becomes part of the $ LOAD_PATH for your Ruby process .
Regular require statements will work as expected , and you do n’t even need to require " rubygems " ( which , it seems , we should n’t be doing anyway ) .
All Rip really does is try to ensure that the ‘ active ’ environment is injected into the $ RUBYLIB ; switching environments is really just moving a symlink ; and the rest of the code deals with nuts and bolts of actually downloading libraries of code from various sources .
Very simple , as most good things are .
All in all , when it works it ’s a very pleasant development tool to use , and you could do worse than to spend a few minutes checking it out .
Gem dependencies
Rip works with git repositories , directories on the local filesystem , or over HTTP , and has rudimentary support for install rubygems too .
However , the current version ( 0.0.3 ) does n’t install any gem dependencies .
So , if I want to play about with monk , which I did want to do today , Rip is only going to download the monk gem itself , and not any of its dependencies .
It ’s actually going to be a bit of a pain to even find out what the dependencies are .
If I ’m going really start putting Rip through its paces , I need to be able to quickly and reliably install the same libraries that I can install using normal Rubygems , including their dependencies .
Time to stop whining
So , today I rolled up my sleeves and taught Rip how to download gem dependencies too .
It was n’t quite as easy as I hoped - it took me a bit of head - scratching to really figure out the relationship between Packages , the PackageManager , the Installer and the two GemPackages , but thanks to a bit of help from Gabriel Horner ’s previous work , I have it working in a reasonably stable way .
Here ’s my fork of rip installing Rails :
â $ rip install rails Searching gems.github.com for rails ...
ERROR : Could not find rails in any repository Searching gems.rubyforge.org for rails ...
Searching gems.github.com for rake ...
ERROR : Could not find rake in any repository Searching gems.rubyforge.org for rake ...

Successfully installed rack ( 1.0.0 ) Successfully installed actionpack ( 2.3.3 ) Successfully installed actionmailer ( 2.3.3 ) Successfully installed activeresource ( 2.3.3 ) Successfully installed rails ( 2.3.3 ) â $
Next steps
I ’m sure my approach could be improved .
Here ’s the issue on github , if you ’ve got any feedback , or would like to see efforts here continue .
I ’d also quite like to have Rip respect the sources ( and their ordering ) as defined in .gemrc , but that ’s just my preference .
Now , to finally start playing with monk …
( oh , btw , here ’s rip installing monk ; I do n’t know why the dependencies gem needs wycats - thor … )
â $ rip install monk Searching gems.github.com for monk ...
ERROR : Could not find monk in any repository Searching gems.rubyforge.org for monk ...
Searching gems.github.com for thor ...
ERROR : Could not find thor in any repository Searching gems.rubyforge.org for thor ...
Searching gems.github.com for dependencies ...
ERROR : Could not find dependencies in any repository Searching gems.rubyforge.org for dependencies ...

Successfully installed wycats - thor ( 0.11.5 ) Successfully installed dependencies ( 0.0.6 ) Successfully installed monk ( 0.0.5 ) â $
You can see the gem dependency changes in the rip source now .
It now delegates as much as it can to the gem binary , which means it will respect the gem sources you already have installed ( rubyforge , github , gemcutter and anything else ) .
Older versions of gems now install properly too
I had a bit of fun figuring out some kinks in the dependency identification for specific versions of rubygems .
Normally , you can find out the dependencies of a gem , without installing it , by running
$ gem dependency < gem > -- remote
However , this does n’t seem to work for many gems , particularly ones that are n’t the most recent .
For example :
$ gem dependency rails -- remote Gem rails - 2.3.3 rake ( >= 0.8.3 , runtime ) activesupport ( = 2.3.3 , runtime ) activerecord ( = 2.3.3 , runtime ) actionpack ( = 2.3.3 , runtime ) actionmailer ( = 2.3.3 , runtime ) activeresource ( = 2.3.3 , runtime )
But when I try requesting the dependencies for a specific version :
$ gem dependency rails -- version = " 2.2.2 " -- remote
No gems found matching rails ( = 2.2.2 )
No dice .
The simple solution we ’ve adopted is to download the gem at the specific version requested , and then read the dependencies from the gem itself , using gem specification to produce a YAML version of its gemspec :
$ gem fetch rails -- version = " 2.2.2 " Downloaded rails - 2.2.2 $ gem specification rails - 2.2.2.gem --- !ruby / object : Gem :: Specification name : rails version : !ruby / object : Gem:: Version version : 2.2.2 platform : ruby authors : - David Heinemeier Hansson autorequire : bindir : bin cert_chain : [ ] date : 2008-11-20 23:00:00 +00:00 default_executable : rails dependencies : - !ruby / object : Gem :: Dependency name : rake type : : runtime version_requirement : version_requirements : !ruby / object : Gem :: Requirement requirements : - - " >= " - !ruby / object : Gem:: Version version : 0.8.3 version : ( etc )
File conflicts
One of the selling points of rip is that dependency issues are resolved when you are building the environment , and not when your application actually runs .
As part of this , rip will now [ warn you when one library is trying to overwrite a file that was already installed by another package ] [ fil - conflicts ] .
This means that two packages can’t both try to install a file called node.rb ( although they can install package_a / node.rb and package_b
ode.rb , so nicely namespaced code will work just fine ) .
However , this means that my monkrb example does n’t work anymore , because of the wycats - thor dependency :
â $ rip install monk Successfully installed thor ( 0.11.5 )
Some files from wycats - thor ( 0.11.5 ) conflict with those already installed by thor : lib / thor / actions/create_file.rb lib/thor/actions/directory.rb
lib/thor/actions/empty_directory.rb
lib/thor/actions/file_manipulation.rb lib/thor/actions/inject_into_file.rb lib/thor/actions.rb lib/thor/base.rb lib/thor/core_ext/hash_with_indifferent_access.rb lib/thor/core_ext/ordered_hash.rb lib/thor/error.rb lib/thor/group.rb lib/thor/invocation.rb lib/thor/parser/argument.rb lib/thor/parser/arguments.rb lib/thor/parser/option.rb lib/thor/parser/options.rb lib/thor/parser.rb lib/thor/rake_compat.rb lib/thor/runner.rb lib/thor/shell/basic.rb lib/thor/shell/color.rb lib/thor/shell.rb lib/thor/task.rb lib/thor/util.rb lib/thor.rb bin/rake2thor bin/thor rip : installation failed â $
The solution here is n’t really clear .
I think that the dependencies gem should n’t really depend on a user - specific version of thor , and there ’s some kind of irony there .
One way to proceed might be to add a new flag to rip install , something like rip install -- no - dependencies which only installs the package in question and ignores its dependencies .
Anyway , please do kick the tires around , join the mailing list and contribute !

Advertisement A lone gunman has killed two people and wounded at least 10 at a gay support centre in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv before escaping .
Most of the victims were gay teenagers , who were meeting at the centre on Nachmani street when the gunman entered and started firing indiscriminately .
The black - clad man is still at large and police have ordered the temporary closure of all gay clubs in the city .
Gay leaders say it is Israel 's worst - ever hate crime against the community .
That 's actually the surprising issue , there is not at all any homophobic activity in Tel Aviv
Yaron Arad
Tel Aviv hotel worker Witnesses said the gunman fired in all directions with a handgun .
At one point , three deaths were being reported but later accounts spoke only of two fatalities - that of a young man and a young woman .
The shootings took place at the headquarters of the local lesbian and gay rights association .
Shock Anon Shabtie , who works at the Evita gay bar close to the centre , told BBC Radio 5 Live that the gunman had attacked a place which helped young gay people : EYEWITNESS Yaniv Weizman , head of Israel 's youth Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgender Association
We still do n't know who is behind this attack but someone that knew this place - because it's not a place you can see outside - knew exactly where is the place , got in , and just shot everyone there .
It 's a horrible , horrible shock for the gay community , and the Tel Aviv municipality .
Tel Aviv is supposed to be a very safe city .
There is a big anger and if we will know that behind this action it's a religious movement , we will punish the people behind it , and the gay community here is very strong , and there will be a reaction from the gay community and the people in the government will be the first one to give us answers .
" We have a centre for people who want to go out of the closet or get support from the community and they come there every day and there are people supporting them .
" And unfortunately on Saturday evening there are teenagers coming there and they were like I do n't know many guys sitting there with a guy who help them .
" And then the guy came with a helmet on his head and he was shooting them without any reason . "
Hundreds of lesbian and gay Israelis held a rally and lit candles in Tel Aviv in protest at the shooting .
One woman said she was " terrified , shocked , surprised , amazed " by the attack " because it was so unexpected " .
Yaron Arad , who works at a nearby hotel , said the gay community was part of the city .
" We know that Tel Aviv has a very lively gay community with plenty of activities going around , " he told the BBC .
" That 's actually the surprising issue , there is not at all any homophobic activity in Tel Aviv .
" Jerusalem does not naturally accept the gay community but here in Tel Aviv it 's different , totally different story .
A lot of parties , a lot of gay people having fun here .
That 's why it 's so shocking what 's happened here tonight . "

The head of Israel 's youth Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgender Association , Yaniv Weizman , told the BBC the gunman must have intended to attack the centre " because it 's not a place you can see outside " .
He said the gay community was demanding to know why it had been targeted .
" The gay community in Israel , in Tel Aviv , today got a message , a very strong message , a red light , that Israel , Tel Aviv , no longer a safe place to no one , " he said .
" And if someone can give himself the option just to say like hate and to say things against the gay community , today he can see the pictures and to see what these words can lead to . "
Tel Aviv has in the past been targeted in attacks by Palestinian militants but there was no suggestion that Saturday 's attack had a political motive .
A police spokesman described the attack as " criminal rather than nationalistic " .

RAINBOW , Calif. , July 30 ( UPI ) --
A man who bought a historic Oceanside , Calif. , home for $ 1 and moved it to his property in Rainbow , Calif. , said he is now selling it for a lower price -- free .
Hayden Perrine said he had originally planned to convert the house , which was built in 1889 , into an extension of his home , but San Diego County permits and mandated restorations have made the project too expensive , KGTV , San Diego , reported Thursday .

" To do everything they 're asking me to do to this structure and put the foundation in to code and to secure it to the existing home , it would cost me about $ 60,000 , " Perrine said .
Perrine purchased the house for $ 1 from the city of Oceanside after it offered a number of homes for the price with the stipulation that purchasers move the homes at their own expense .
He said the house is now listed on Craigslist as free .
He said the purchaser will have to pay to move the house and conduct the county - mandated restorations .

If things continue spiraling madly out of control as they are right now , there 's at least a modicum of a chance that your children or grandchildren will greet a lifelike robot when sashaying in for the first day of kindergarten .
Horrifying , we know .
A new research effort published in this month 's Science outlines new ways in which humanoids could actually be used to instruct our little ones .
At the core of the project is imitation ; humans , especially young ones , learn a multitude of mannerisms and such by simply watching others .
Thus , it stands to reason that robots are " well - suited to imitate us , learn from us , socialize with us and eventually teach us . "
Already , these social bots are being used on an experimental basis to teach various skills to preschool children , " including the names of colors , new vocabulary words and simple songs . "
Just think -- in 2071 , those harmless lessons will morph into studies of subterfuge , insurrection and rapacity .

First , not that anyone at the White House necessarily cares about the liberal wing of the party ( you know , the ones who do all the work to elect Democrats ) , but I think Rachel Maddow captured what many of us are thinking :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqYuvyIgoq0]
If someone from the White House went on the talk shows and said something like Rachel said this morning — criticizing Senator Grassley for pushing the “ death panel ” story — we ’d be happy .
But , no .
the White House spokespeople were on the shows signaling that they ’re willing to compromise already — that they ’re willing to drop the public option .
Yes , the White House is caving because they want a win , any win , more than they want a good bill .
Too bad the White House ceded so much power to Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley .
If , instead , the President had used his bully pulpit and his “ massive ” organization – you know , those 12 million email addresses we keep hearing about – we would have had a bill by now , and a good one too .
But , no , the Rahm / Messina brain trust let Max Baucus and all of his former staffers in the insurance industry run the show .
And look where it ’s gotten us .
First , Sebelius :
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius downplayed the importance of a public insurance option on Sunday , saying it “ is not the essential element ” of a reform package .
“ What is important is choice and competition , and I am convinced at the end of the day , the plan will have both of those , but ( the public option ) is not the essential element , ” she said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union . ”
And , Gibbs :
Obama ’s spokesman refused to say a public option was a make - or - break choice .
“ What I am saying is the bottom line for this for the president is , what we have to have is choice and competition in the insurance market , ” White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday .
Is anything make or break for Obama ?
I ’m sure this is just the “ bipartisan ” breakthrough that will save the whole bill .
Right .
I do n’t understand why Democrats are always so willing and desperate to compromise with themselves .
The GOPers do n’t want any reform bill .
Their base , comprised of the teabaggers , birthers and deathers , wo n’t let them negotiate .
So , Democrats compromise with themselves , again — and sell out their principles , again .
Just like they did on the stimulus package – they gave the GOP nearly 40 % of the package in tax cuts , and how many votes did it get them in the entire Congress ?
Three .
See , to Rahm and his crew , a win is a win .
They ’ll sacrifice good policy and principles for politics any day .
But , they tell us that we ’re the bad guys for having the audacity to hope that Obama will some day live up to his campaign promises .
( AP ) -- People with a genetic susceptibility to colon cancer could cut their chances of developing the disease in half by taking a daily dose of aspirin , researchers said Monday .
The finding might lead to other treatments by helping researchers understand how aspirin combats colon cancer , one of the top three cancers in rich countries .
European researchers followed more than 1,000 people with Lynch syndrome , a genetic mutation that makes them vulnerable to cancers in the colon , rectum , stomach , brain , liver , womb and elsewhere .
The syndrome accounts for about 5 percent of all colon cancers .
About half of the study participants were given aspirin daily , while the other half got placebo pills for about four years .
In the group that got aspirin , six people developed colon cancer , versus 16 in the group that got placebos .
" We are delighted , " said John Burn of Newcastle University in Britain , who led the study .
" All the more so because we stopped giving the aspirin after four years , yet the effect is continuing , " he said in a statement .
Burn presented the study results Monday in Berlin at a meeting of the European Cancer Organisation .
Previous studies have found patients who already have colon cancer and are being treated with chemotherapy and surgery may further reduce their risk of dying by up to 30 percent by taking aspirin .
The cheap drug is also taken by millions of people worldwide to prevent heart attacks and strokes .
" If this is true , doctors should change how they treat their at - risk patients , " said Alfred Neugut , of Columbia University Medical Center in New York , who has done similar work but was not involved in the European study .
Still , experts said the finding would have no immediate impact on the general public .
" This does n't mean that everyone should start taking aspirin if they 're worried about bowel cancer , " said Henry Snowcroft of Cancer Research United Kingdom .
" Aspirin can cause significant side effects if not used as directed by a doctor , " Snowcroft said .
Though aspirin has been used widely for years to treat minor aches and to alleviate fevers , it can irritate the stomach and intestines and cause major bleeding .
Scientists are still unsure exactly how aspirin fights cancer .
For years , experts thought aspirin slows an enzyme called COX2 that has a role in tumor growth .
Based on his research , where patients did not benefit until several years after taking aspirin , Burn thinks the drug may also affect cancer stem cells .
He hypothesized aspirin might speed up the process by which cells destroy themselves if they pick up " genetic spelling mistakes " that could be cancerous .
That could result in a protective effect against cancer ever developing .
Other scientists were not convinced that stem cells were involved .
" There 's something weird going on here that 's outside of what we normally see , " Neugut said .
" Reducing cancer is a wonderful thing , but there is something else going on here that we do n't understand . "

Meteorites that crashed into the Martian surface last year exposed buried ice to the digital eyes of NASA spacecraft .
Scientists have used those images to deduce that there is a lot more ice on Mars — and that it 's closer to the equator — than previously thought .
In fact , subterranean Martian ice should extend all the way down beyond 48 degrees of latitude , according to the model , which was published in Science Thursday .
That happens to be where the Viking Lander 2 was in operation from 1976 to 1980 .
As part of its science program , the Lander dug a trench about 6 inches deep .
The new model predicts that if it had gone an extra 3.5 inches — a bit longer than a credit card — it would have hit ice .
It 's difficult to project backwards in time what that discovery would have done to the Martian science program , but its impact could have been large .
" To find ice that far from the pole where Viking 2 was , it would have changed the way everyone looked at Mars for the next 20 years , " said NASA Goddard archivist , David Williams , who curates the Viking project historical site .
" It would have been a whole different model for Mars ...
If they 'd dug down just a little more , they'd have this complete opposite view of Mars . "
At the time , scientists did n't really know a lot about the Red Planet .
Finding ice underground might not have been that surprising , but largely because the planetologists did n't have a lot of firm theories about water on Mars .
They thought there was ice at the poles , Williams said , but not much more than that .
Unlike the Phoenix Lander , the Viking 2 Lander 's trenching tool was n't designed to search for or find ice .
Its job was to deliver Martian soil to a series of tests .
As such , Viking 2 would n't have been able to do much with any hard ice that it found , said Steven Squyres , an astronomer at Cornell and lead investigator of the Mars Rover missions .
Its arm just was n't powerful enough .
Squyers also noted that the Viking missions were a tremendous success , without a water ice find .
But the Viking 2 Lander 's work did give the impression that water ice did not exist near the Martian surface in the mid-latitudes .
We 'll never know how NASA 's " Follow the Water " missions to Mars might have changed if , for some reason , the Lander had been commanded to dig just a bit deeper and hit a hard , icy surface .
It goes to show that sometimes scientific discoveries can come down to a few inches and some luck , even on the surface of a planet hundreds of millions miles away .

A few days ago , during a speech at Software Freedom Day in Boston , Richard Stallman has , at least in my book , crossed a line that I thought he would never cross .
Ubuntu developerMartin Owens attended Software Freedom Day , and penned down a few words about what RMS had to say at the end of the day .
When it came to Mono and C# , RMS said that while they are not a problem , you should n’t write applications in C# , and you also should uninstall any applications using it .
Agree or disagree , but this is an opinion he shares with many others , and his concerns are certainly rooted in reality .
How deeply rooted is up for debate .
But then .
The conversation shifted towards Microsoft ’s new Open Source labs , and in response to a question by Owens , Stallman noted that Miguel de Icaza “ is basically a traitor to the Free Software community ” .
He also added that De Icaza is a Microsoft apologist , hence his involvement in the new Open Source labs does not inspire confidence .
I think we officially hit a new low here .
I have no opinion on the whole Mono thing , and I do n’t really care much about it either , but calling De Icaza a traitor to the Free software community actually got me a little riled up .
Are we really talking about the same De Icaza ?
The man who co-founded one of the most popular Free software projects , GNOME ?
Who created Gnumeric ?
Who set up a company which employed several GNOME developers , advancing the Free software desktop ?
De Icaza has done a lot of hard work to advance and promote the Free software community , and whether you like Mono or not , it is still a completely open source project , and enables cross- platform development for those who wish to code in C# .
Why does n’t RMS deride the SAMBA guys in the same manner ?
De Icaza has responded on his blog about Stallman ’s words , and did so in a civil manner .
“ I want to say that God loves all creatures .
From the formidable elephant to the tiniest ant .
And that includes Richard Stallman , ” De Icaza wrote , “ As for me , I think that there is a world of possibility , and if Richard wants to discuss how we can improve the pool of open source / free software in the world he has my email address . ”
Kudos to De Icaza for remaining civil and polite despite such a low blow from RMS .
While I respect RMS for his contributions to the Free software community , I think it ’s pretty clear by now that he has completely lost touch with reality .
The FSF would do good to silently but resolutely move him off stage , and install a new figurehead who comes across a little more …
Constructive and civil .
At this rate , RMS is doing more harm than good to the Free software world .

Last year , my friend Kevin over at Questing for Atlantis and I attended a conference at the Heritage Foundation on the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and civil liberties .
Michael Chertoff was the keynote speaker .
Chertoff spoke on why it is necessary for the DHS to largely ignore civil liberties in protecting the country .
He seemed to get annoyed at the line of questions he received , particularly with regard to airline security .
In an attempt to take a shot at the apparently libertarian - leaning audience , Chertoff wondered aloud who would want to travel on an airline without security checks .
Kevin and I quickly acknowledged that we would gladly frequent such an airline .
Here are some characteristics of such a libertarian airline :
No ID would be necessary for domestic travel ( national laws regarding passports and visas will obviously still apply )
Flights will be less expensive due to less overhead for security
No security lines before reaching your departure gate
You may bring any amount of liquids / gels in your carry - on luggage ( When traveling alone , I will often only bring a carry - on to minimize my time in the airport .
I strongly dislike having my toothpaste confiscated )
confiscated )
Passengers may carry concealed weapons ( Who will pull a gun on a plane full of gun-carrying passengers ? )
less expensive , less time , and less invasion of privacy
The benefits of a libertarian airline can be summarized as If you do n't feel such an airline is safe , then fly on another airline .
I do n’t know if you ’ve been paying attention , but apparently marriage is under attack in this country .
No , not by aliens or sea beasts , but by the type of people who shop at Crate and Barrel .
Now , do n’t get me wrong — those who shop at Crate and Barrel are people just like anyone else , but that does n’t mean they should be allowed to get married .
The way I see it , if we allow Crate and Barrel shoppers to get married , who will be next ?
People who carry Louis Vuitton bags ?
Go see Broadway musicals ?
Or eat at Panera Bread rather than Subway ?
It ’s a slippery slope , my friends .
One solution is to pass a “ Defense of Marriage ” bill in Congress , but what all must we protect marriage from ?
I ’ve made a list .
Crate and Barrel
alcohol
playboys
Playboy magazine
Louis Vuitton bags
neighborhood floozies
Broadway musicals
more alcohol
women under thirty
Panera Bread
Desperate Housewives
desperate housewives
pool boys
Angelina Jolie
the schwa
Key Parties
even more alcohol
Feminism
This is hardly a complete list , and I ’m fairly sure that all kinds of acts of debasement are going on in any Ikea location that threaten marriage to its core , but it ’s a start .
The question then becomes how does such a law get enforced ?
If popular films have taught me anything ( besides the value of a montage set to a retro pop song ) , it ’s that when defending something there ’s only one solution — guns .
Just watch From Dusk Till Dawn or Dawn of the Dead , and you ’ll get a pretty clear picture of how marriage should be protected .
Let ’s round up marriage , take it to a mall , and surround it with common , everyday citizens who have no experience with firearms .
Oh yeah , and then ’s let give them guns .
The staging point for this defense should probably be close by a Victoria ’s Secret for obvious reasons .
Marriage is going to need all the help it can get in this fight .
You may think I sound extremist in my concern , but I ’m just someone who loves marriage .
Now excuse me while I cut this short , but my wife will be home soon and I need to be outside working so she wo n’t bother me with the details of her day .

Anti-drug public service announcements that feature teens using marijuana areto dissuade viewers from experimenting with pot than are advertisements absent such images , according to survey data to be published in the journal Health Communication .
Investigators at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania assessed the attitudes of over 600 adolescents , aged 12 to 18 , after viewing 60 government funded anti-marijuana service announcements .
Specifically , researchers evaluated whether the presence of marijuana - related imagery in the ads ( e.g. , the handling of marijuana cigarettes or the depiction of marijuana smoking behavior ) were more likely or less likely to discourage viewers ’ use of cannabis .
Messages that depict teens associating with cannabis are “ significantly less effective than others , ” the researchers found .
and is mainly present for the group of adolescents who are often targets of such anti-marijuana ads ( i.e. , high - risk adolescents ) , ” authors determined .
“ For this segment of adolescents , including marijuana scenes in anti-marijuana ( public service announcements ) may not be a good strategy .
” Since 1998 , Congress has appropriated over $ 2 billion to fund anti-drug advertisements as part of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign .
In 2006 , a study published in the journal Addictive Behaviors reported that teenagers who were most often exposed to the ad campaign were also most likely to hold positive attitudes about marijuana and were most likely to express their intent to use it .

We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid ( D.N.A. ) .
This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest .
A structure for nucleic acid has already been proposed by Pauling and Corey ( 1 ) .
They kindly made their manuscript available to us in advance of publication .
Their model consists of three intertwined chains , with the phosphates near the fibre axis , and the bases on the outside .
In our opinion , this structure is unsatisfactory for two reasons : 1 ) We believe that the material which gives the X - ray diagrams is the salt , not the free acid .
Without the acidic hydrogen atoms it is not clear what forces would hold the structure together , especially as the negatively charged phosphates near the axis will repel each other .
2 ) Some of the van der Waals distances appear to be too small .
Another three - chain structure has also been suggested by Fraser ( in the press ) .
In his model the phosphates are on the outside and the bases on the inside , linked together by hydrogen bonds .
This structure as described is rather ill - defined , and for this reason we shall not comment on it .
We wish to put forward a radically different structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid .
This structure has two helical chains each coiled round the same axis ( see diagram ) .
We have made the usual chemical assumptions , namely , that each chain consists of phosphate diester groups joining β- d - deoxyribofuranose residues with 3′,5′ linkages .
The two chains ( but not their bases ) are related by a dyad perpendicular to the fibre axis .
Both chains follow right - handed helices , but owing to the dyad the sequences of the atoms in the two chains run in opposite directions .
Each chain loosely resembles Furberg ’s ( 2 ) model No. 1 ; that is , the bases are on the inside of the helix and the phosphates on the outside .
The configuration of the sugar and the atoms near it is close to Furberg ’s ‘ standard configuration ’ , the sugar being roughly perpendicular to the attached base .
There is a residue on each chain every 3.4 A. in the z - direction .
We have assumed an angle of 36 ˚ between adjacent residues in the same chain , so that the structure repeats after 10 residues on each chain , that is , after 34 A .
The distance of a phosphorus atom from the fibre axis is 10 A .
As the phosphates are on the outside , cations have easy access to them .
The structure is an open one , and its water content is rather high .
At lower water contents we would expect the bases to tilt so that the structure could become more compact .
The novel feature of the structure is the manner in which the two chains are held together by the purine and pyrimidine bases .
The planes of the bases are perpendicular to the fibre axis .
They are joined together in pairs , a single base from one chain being hydrogen - bonded to a single base from the other chain , so that the two lie side by side with identical z- co-ordinates .
One of the pair must be a purine and the other a pyrimidine for bonding to occur .
The hydrogen bonds are made as follows : purine position 1 to pyrimidine position 1 ; purine position 6 to pyrimidine position 6 .
If it is assumed that the bases only occur in the structure in the most plausible tautomeric forms ( that is , with the keto rather than the enol configurations ) it is found that only specific pairs of bases can bond together .
These pairs are : adenine ( purine ) with thymine ( pyrimidine ) , and guanine ( purine ) with cytosine ( pyrimidine ) .
In other words , if an adenine forms one member of a pair , on either chain , then on these assumptions the other member must be thymine ; similarly for guanine and cytosine .
The sequence of bases on a single chain does not appear to be restricted in any way .
However , if only specific pairs of bases can be formed , it follows that if the sequence of bases on one chain is given , then the sequence on the other chain is automatically determined .
It has been found experimentally ( 3 , 4 ) that the ratio of the amounts of adenine to thymine , and the ratio of guanine to cytosine , are always very close to unity for deoxyribose nucleic acid .
It is probably impossible to build this structure with a ribose sugar in place of the deoxyribose , as the extra oxygen atom would make too close a van der Waals contact .
The previously published X - ray data ( 5 , 6 ) on deoxyribose nucleic acid are insufficient for a rigorous test of our structure .
So far as we can tell , it is roughly compatible with the experimental data , but it must be regarded as unproved until it has been checked against more exact results .
Some of these are given in the following communications .
We were not aware of the details of the results presented there when we devised our structure , which rests mainly though not entirely on published experimental data and stereochemical arguments .
It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material .
Full details of the structure , including the conditions assumed in building it , together with a set of co-ordinates for the atoms , will be published elsewhere .
On every major measurement , the Census Bureau report shows that the country lost ground during Bush ’s two terms .
While Bush was in office , the median household income declined , poverty increased , childhood poverty increased even more , and the number of Americans without health insurance spiked .
By contrast , the country ’s condition improved on each of those measures during Bill Clinton ’s two terms , often substantially . [ … ]
When Bill Clinton left office after 2000 , the median income - the income line around which half of households come in above , and half fall below - stood at $ 52,500 ( measured in inflation - adjusted 2008 dollars ) .
When Bush left office after 2008 , the median income had fallen to $ 50,303 .
That ’s a decline of 4.2 per cent .
Bush wanted a legacy , and now he ’s got one : over the last eight years , most of us got poorer
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities studied the data , concluding :
Two - thirds of the nation ’s total income gains from 2002 to 2007 flowed to the top 1 percent of U.S. households , and that top 1 percent held a larger share of income in 2007 than at any time since 1928
Meanwhile , the Wall Street Journal reports that America ’s income gap is closing as the nation ’s wealthiest people lose money in the downturn .
What it all adds up to is zero prosperity created by the Bush tax cuts , and lots of pretend - wealth destroyed by lax regulation .
And the message carried by the teabaggers was perfectly encapsulated by Michael Steele :
At town hall meetings , Tea Party protests , and countless other gatherings of concerned patriots , Americans are saying enough is enough .
Enough taxes .
Enough spending .
Enough debt .
Enough entitlement .
And enough arrogance .
Enough .
Republicans have zero credibility on how to stimulate the economy .
Their only prescription is more of the same failure .
Is n’t that the definition of insanity ?

One of the biggest wins of the HTML 5 recommendation is a detailed specification outlining how parsing of HTML documents should work .
For too many years browsers have simply tried to guess and copy what others were doing in hopes that their parser would work well enough to not cause too many problems with HTML markup found in the wild .
While some parts of HTML 5 are certainly more contentious than others – the parsing section is one that is almost universally appreciated by browser vendors .
Once browsers start to implement it users will enjoy the improved compatibility , as well .
One of the first implementations of the HTML 5 parsing rules was actually created to power the HTML 5 validator .
( If you ’re interested in testing it out , https://johnresig.com/ should validate as HTML 5 . )
This particular implementation is in Java , provides SAX and DOM interfaces for use , and is open source .
This is particularly interesting because Henri Sivonen ( the author of the validator ) just recently landed ( Warning : Massive web page ) a brand new HTML 5 parsing engine in Gecko , destined for the next version of Firefox .
What ’s interesting about this particular implementation is that it ’s actually an automated conversion of Henri ’s Java HTML 5 parser to C++.
This conversion happens automatically and changes will be pushed upstream to the Mozilla codebase .
Normally I would balk at the mention of a wholesale , programmatic , conversion of a Java codebase over to C++ but the results have been very surprising : A 3 % boost in pageload performance .
And this is on top of the litany of bug fixes and compliance checks that this code base will be providing .
You can examine some of the progress that went into the constructing the patch in the Mozilla bug .
If you ’re interested in giving the new parser a try ( it ’s doubtful that you ’ll see many obvious changes – but any help in hunting down bugs would be appreciated ) you can download a nightly of Firefox , open about : config , and set html5.enable to true .
If there was ever a time to start playing around with the jump to HTML 5 , now would be it .
Since HTML 5 is a superset of the features provided by HTML 4 and XHTML 1 it ends up being surprisingly easy to ‘ upgrade ’ :
Just start by swapping out your current ( X) HTML Doctype for the HTML 5 Doctype :
<! DOCTYPE html >
From there you can check the site HTML 5 Doctor for additional details on how to get the new HTML 5 elements working in all browsers .
Polluters in China are operating in a " black box " of secrecy , the Ministry of Environmental Protection has warned amid a rash of violent protests related to industrial poisoning .
Offenders are protected by the vast majority of local authorities defying Beijing and violating state law by refusing to disclose information about pollution , with a study showing just 4 out of 113 local governments complied .
The ministry said this lack of transparency was partly to blame for recent riots over lead and manganese poisoning in Shaanxi , Hunan and Fujian , which has affected thousands of children .
" Environmental impact assessment was meant to prevent these kinds of harm , but EIA has repeatedly failed to carry out its duties , " the ministry noted on its website after the riots .
" In the battle between illegal polluters and their opponents , the disparity in power is too great for the public interest to be effectively protected . "
An information transparency law introduced in May 2008 was supposed to ease public concerns about the environment and to hold polluters to account .
But more than a year after it came into effect , a survey by leading NGOs and academics found that only four local governments provided comprehensive details about pollution violations as they were obliged to do .
Eighty - six failed to respond beyond claiming the information was secret or an inappropriate subject to raise in an economic downturn .
Others simply ignored the request .
Ma Jun , who founded the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs which carried out the survey with support from the US - based National Resources Defence Council , said local government transparency was at a very basic level .
But he emphasised the success of the four who met the targets first year around – Ningbo , Hefei , Fuzhou and Wuhan – and claimed progress should be put in a historical perspective .
" China has never had a tradition of opening up government information before , " said Ma , a winner earlier this week of the coveted Ramon Magsaysay Award for integrity in government .
" The conclusion from our survey is that this is doable .
If the local governments share best practice they can easily improve . "
The environment ministry was less guarded in its criticism of local governments .
Citing the results of the survey and the recent pollution disturbances , it said more information was vital .
" The absence of comprehensive , timely environmental data has given polluting companies and local authorities the chance to operate in a ' black box ' .
To break this practice , we need to bring everything out into the sunlight , " it said .
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) -- Yoshiko Sato would love to give her only son a brother or a sister .
But money struggles and Japan 's cost of living have pushed the mother to wait .
Japanese mother Yoshiko Sato says the proposal " would help us with a second child . "
A proposal to pay parents about $ 3,400 a year per child has got her thinking seriously about expanding her family .
The cash for kids plan is the brainchild of the country 's new ruling Democratic Party of Japan , which came into power during the elections this week .
The proposal has garnered supporters and critics .
" It would help us with a second child , " Sato said .
The proposal would pay families the money every year until the child reached high school .
It is an effort to boost Japan 's birthrate , which is one of the lowest in the world and is a major drag on the country 's economy .
It is compounded by Japan 's rapidly aging population .
About a quarter of the country 's population is older than 65 , according to government figures .
By 2050 , that number is expected to reach 40 percent .

Nevertheless , the money for babies proposal has its critics .
Economist Yuri Okina said she wonders where Japan 's government is going to come up with the money to fund it .
The plan is not an instant fix , she said .
What 's needed , Okina said , is a way for women to remain in the work force after having children instead of being forced out because of lack of child care .
" We have to make it normal in Japan for a woman to raise a child and have a career , " Okina said .
Critics also have said the plan would not fix a significant problem for working families -- the lack of day care centers .
About 40,000 children are on waiting lists for day care , according to government figures .
These facilities ' scarcity is problematic for mothers such as Hiromi Espineli .
" Going back to work would be tough , " she said , " since there are so few day care centers . "

The Cleveland Browns would like to put 2008 in their rear view mirror and lose sight of it as fast as they can .
In what can only be categorized as ignorant , Braylon Edwards showed up to Browns camp a day late and failed his physical .
Edwards was placed on the Browns Active / Non-Football Injury list .
Great leverage in a contract year would be to show up early and in shape .
Edwards , who led the entire NFL in drops last year with 17 , has to be more of a leader .
If Cleveland is going to turn things around this season , everybody has to chip in and try a little harder .
With this being the first major story from Browns camp , it seems like another step backwards for a team trying to overcome the “ underachiever ” label they earned last season .
Edwards ’ contract is done after this season .
He could be fined up to $ 17,000 for reporting a day late .
He also missed mandatory minicamp in June with an undisclosed injury .
The swirling rumor mill reported he hurt his ankle playing basketball .
Because he missed minicamp , Edwards was to report with the rookies a week earlier than everyone else on the active roster .
Instead , he showed up a day later than everyone else .

Scarps that cut across the surface of Mercury suggest the planet has been shrinking ( Image : Science / AAAS )
The solar system ’s smallest planet has been shrinking at an unexpected rate , researchers announced on Thursday .
When NASA ’s Mariner 10 probe flew by Mercury in 1974 and 1975 , it returned images of strange cliffs called ‘ scarps ’ that cut across all sorts of geological formations .
That suggested that the planet ’s surface has contracted over time .
Now , pictures of Mercury ’s surface taken with NASA ’s Messenger spacecraft confirm that the crust appears to have buckled .
In fact , the planet seems to have shrunk more than previously thought – and may still be shrinking .

The new result comes from an analysis of pictures snapped when the spacecraft whipped past the planet on 14 January and photographed a previously unseen 20 % of the surface .
In order for such shrinking to take place , Mercury must have had a molten , liquid core that has cooled and contracted over time .
That may settle a debate that has raged for more than 30 years about the planet ’s magnetic field .
Researchers have wondered whether the field is more like Earth ’s , fed by a dynamo of circulating fluid , or like that of Mars , which hosts solid , magnetised rocks .
Liquid motion
In 2007 , a team bounced radar signals off Mercury , revealing slight variations in the speed of the planet ’s rotation that suggested the planet ’s core is partly liquid .
Now Messenger researchers say additional images of scarps , along with a better map of the planet ’s magnetic field , show Mercury has a constitution similar to Earth’s .
“ Both of these results point therefore to an active source for Mercury ’s magnetic field , a dynamo stirred by motions in Mercury ’s fluid outer core , ” says the mission ’s chief scientist , Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Washington DC , US .
Mariner 10 images suggested the planet ’s radius , which is roughly 2400 kilometres , has shrunk by 1 to 2 km since its formation more than 4 billion years ago .
“ What Messenger is showing us is that ’s an underestimate , ” says Solomon .
The new scarp images , which were taken from a better angle relative to the Sun than Mariner 10 , show the planet seems to be shrinking by at least a third more than previously thought .
A second Messenger flyby on 6 October , which will image another 30 % of the planet ’s surface , could show shrinkage that is even more dramatic , says Solomon .
Further study may help date the scarps , revealing whether Mercury is still shrinking or has stopped .

In breaking news this Labor Day Weekend , President Obama announced he was pulling health care off the table .
This stunning announcement was met with cheers from conservatives and stunned silence by Democrats .
“ We have more important things to do . ” the President said , “ including reunifying this country which is on the verge of a civil war over the issue . ”
Rush Limbaugh greeted the announcement by saying the President should be impeached for failing to produce health care reform that would insure all Americans .
Bill O’Reilly issued a statement accusing Obama of dereliction of duty .
In Texas , Governor Perry said the President ’s announcement only firms his resolve to secede from the Union .
“ Any Government that cannot take care of the sick and injured is not a Christian government .
It is our moral imperative that we provide universal health care to all Texicans , and the only way to do that is to declare Texas ’ Independence . ”
Health Insurance companies across the country sent out letters rescinding coverage on every policyholder who has received medical care since January 20 , 2009 , signaling a rally in the stock market .
One AIG executive , who wished to remain anonymous , said the company is now turning its lobbying efforts towards privatizing Medicare .

1 . We are here a Future Ruby with Adam Blum .
So why do n't you tell us a little bit about yourself ?
Thanks Werner .
I am with Rhomobile , I started Rhomobile last year , with a bunch of talented engineering co-founders , and our goal is to provide a framework that enables people to very quickly build smart phone applications that are native mobile device applications , let them write their app once and then they run as native apps across all smart phones .
I have done other mobile start - ups in the past including Good Technology where we had a very large team of engineers trying to write email on a web browser across just three devices .
And we had very large team of engineers , around two hundred , and as it became clear that there were going to be more smart phone OSes not less , now there are six major smart phones operating systems it was pretty clear that if you wanted to do anything that was less horizontal than email , then you needed to have some kind of platform or framework to enable that to be done .
So that was really a lot of our motivation in starting Rhomobile and we are really pleased with how quickly it has been taking of and started to get used by developers including the ones here at Future Ruby .
2 . Which brings us to the point of your main framework , Rhodes .
About this Rhodes it is Ruby to allow developing applications on mobiles ?
Yes , Rhodes is a model view controller framework very similar to other model view controller frameworks like Rails or Python Django or Java Struts , in fact what Ruby on Rails is to websites , Rhodes is to building native smart phone applications .
So absolutely the controllers that you write with Rhodes will be done in Ruby , the views will be done in HTML templates and we chose that not because you are building mobile browser applications , in fact if anything it 's sort of a anti mobile browser approach it 's all about native apps , but HTML is something that everybody knows .
So , you write your views in HTML templates , and then combine with your controller , and then we have a very lightweight ORM , called Rhom that is your model so you take your Rhom models and your Ruby based controllers , and your views and you compile it all into native executables for each of the OSes .
3 . Which OS do you support at the moment ?
We support all the major smart phone operating systems , iPhone obviously , Windows Mobile , Blackberry , Symbian and Android .
4 . These are very different platforms of different operating systems and capabilities .
How do you get Ruby to platforms like Android or Blackberry ?
That 's a good question .
We have two major code lines , our C based Ruby , shared a lot of code , and that is 1.9 based , and so that obviously applies for Symbian for Windows mobile and for IPhone .
And so they share the majority of the code .
It 's absolutely a mobile optimized Ruby , it 's stripped down , it uses a number of techniques like TCMalloc to make the memory operations faster , definitely was n't a myopic port .
The Java based Rubys are based on X Ruby not on JRuby , JRuby would be far too big , so they are based on X Ruby and then it 's in fact our own Ruby in there .
As I mentioned yesterday at FutureRuby , however , at some point it 's probably worthwhile to factor out the Ruby out of Rhodes and get that out into the community and have the rest of the community help us maintain those ports and I have talked with Matz about that at EuRuKo .
It will be a good thing for the whole Ruby community to do .
Factor out just the Ruby piece .
5 . Factor out not just the XRuby but all of the Rubys ?
Remember the Rubys for Android and Blackberry which are Java based , yes they started with XRuby which is in effect a discontinued effort , just because it was smaller .
At this point , essentially it is our Ruby , it started with XRuby but it 's our Ruby that is there .
And in the long term it makes sense to peel out the Ruby from the rest of Rhodes and get that out and have it be maintained by the community which is maybe a way to bring up that we see the value of what we do as more the framework so Rhodes with all the things that it brings along , the model view , controller framework , the ORM , we have a sync client that is on there , we exposed all these various device capabilities as both Ruby libraries and as tags , and that is the real IP .
If device OS vendors started shipping their own Ruby , that is a good thing for us , if we peel out these Rubys and get them out to the community so that we have the community helping us that would be a good thing as well .
6 . So if I write an application with Rhodes , and have my source code and my resources , if I want to deploy it , what exactly happens ?
What does Rhodes , what do your tools do ?
You write , as we describe , your controllers in Ruby , and you are going to be making library calls to the various device capabilities that are exposed there , GPS , PIM , Contacts , push capabilities , and camera support etc .
Then you have your external templates that you do your user interfaces with and when you are done then you run a build task that 's a rake task like any other build task in a Ruby environment .
And you will build a native executable for each different device OS , one of the key differentiators of a Rhodes built app versus a whole earlier generation of mobile technologies going back more like eight years ago if you were to do this , the typical approach was people would have their own non HTML based but sort of proprietary ways of defining apps , they would have an interpreter that was on the phone , some kind of runner .
And what they would do is define their app , the user would download the interpreter on the phone and then they would be able to download these application abstractions .
So pretty much all of the people that were in " enterprise mobility " that started six - seven years ago , that is what they would have , that was the right thing to do at the time .
In 2009 , number one that approach which absolutely made sense for devices with limited CPU and memory is completely unnecessary in the world of modern smart phones .
And number two : it 's no longer acceptable so the app store has made it very clear that that will not fly .
And those expectations have bled over from the app store to other device OSes and the users of really all those device OSes people want native apps , and native executables , they are not going to download some kind of intermediate interpreter runner and then download apps for it .
So that has pretty much vanished from the smart phones , so it 's a good question what do you end up with when you do a build you end up with a native IPhone apps , your .cab files for Window Mobile , your cad files for Blackberry , .sis files for Symbian and your .apk files for Android .
And then you just do what you would normally do to load apps on the phone .
One is obviously if you want to get to the app store then you submit your app to the app store in other cases you could take those native executables and put them up on your website , and then we also have a hosted development as a service , where we actually offer a vending machine or visioning machine so that once you have done your builds , you want to give out the URL to people we 'll provide that as well .
7 . What ends up in the executable files ?
You ship Ruby with that ?
Correct , this gets back to in the days of modern smart phones what makes sense to have on the device .
Our framework , once you have built the native executable nobody knows that you have used the framework .
Now the price that you pay for that is of course you have all the great bits that we have like the Ruby and the ORM and the sync client get embedded in very app .
But the whole size of it is around 2MB .
In fact that is what our budget we say 2MB or less , the 2MB is a non issue these days on 16 GB iPhones and you may have a few less GB on other phones but you can assume whatever modern smart phone you have , you will have the ability to have thousands of apps that are based upon Rhodes .
The old approach would say " Well if I have got all this infrastructure I should have that one time and then just download these apps " , which we could have done , if it was necessary .
Just is n't necessary because these smart phones are just really first class computing devices now .
8 . So the Rubys you provide , do you omit any library features from them ?
Do you cut them down in size ?
We absolutely do .
We see the Ruby as in service to the framework .
So we have this Rhodes framework and there are a lot of things that you should n't need to do if you are using the framework .
Couple of other things is that we pre-compile the Ruby classes so we are actually generating Ruby 1.9 bytecode , that is both for speed and also for ensuring that the app does what it has been compiled to do and what it 's been tested to do .
And for the same reason so that it is acceptable to modern app stores so that they know that it does what it 's said it 's going to do .
And we also do things like remove the eval capability because we do n't want to give programmers the rope to hang themselves with ; we want them to be able to very easily build a compliant app so as a result we never had an app turned down on the app store .
9 . Your Java based Ruby not to call it XRuby , is that compatible with 1.9 ?
No , it 's 1.8 based , there would be a development effort to updating that so all this stuff about doing compiled bytecode only applies to the C based Rubys but it seams it was critical for doing things like iPhone in the app store that we deliver this pre-compiled again both for speed and to ensure that the app does what it says it 's going to do and no more .
There is just work that needs to be done to get the Java based Ruby up to 1.9 and in fact there would be one motivation to factor that stuff out and get it out to the community , we prefer to just have a Ruby to use rather than necessarily maintaining that Ruby forever .
10 .
So this Java based Ruby basically runs on J2ME devices ?
Theoretically it could , it runs on Blackberry which we see it's not actually quite J2ME it 's really its own thing .
Theoretically somebody could port it to J2ME devices .
It may be something that if we factored out the Java based Ruby maybe somebody else could do that port , to take it to true J2ME .
We are very focused on smart phones we will not do feature phone ports .
However our stuff is open source , and we have had people not just express interest in moving the Ruby to feature phones but also moving Rhodes itself to feature phones potentially to LiMo it could be interesting , it 's just we wo n't port to LiMo until there is a LiMo device that has a keyboard on it .
11 . Limo is Linux mobile ?
Yes .
It 's a Linux based mobile platform and right now it 's pretty much feature phone oriented and if that changes , then we 'll consider doing the port but it would be great if somebody in the community wanted to do the port of Rhodes to LiMo ahead of them .
12 . So if I go to the iTunes store , the app store , which apps would I find that are Rhodes based ?
There is a bunch of them out there , we can't really tell which ones , we just happen to know anecdotally from a bunch of developers there is an app called ... Pedia that is out there , there is an app called " Issues to go " that is out there , there is an app for Siebel called Rhosiebel [ spelling unclear ] that is out there , there is an app called " All my means " that is out there , but there is dozens of apps that we do n't even know about , because we are GPL if people GPL their app we say you do n't have to execute a license with us and we know that is being done a lot , we have got thousand helpers on our public beta , on our Rhohub , and we know they are doing things , we have the right to go see what they are doing , but in general we do n't mess with people 's privacy there unless they want to invite us to look at their app .
And then we have hundred of developers on our forums so my guess is the way that we know about something being in the app stores is because somebody has said : " Hey check out this thing on the app store and download it " .
13 . You mentioned Rhohub .
What is that ?
Rhohub is our hosted development as a service , as far as we know it 's the first development as a service for mobile and what that lets you do is do all of your development in Rhodes online .
So you get , I used to say a hosted editor , but it 's really a hosted IDE so it avoids us having to write our own IDE .
What it lets you do is generate , if you use the command line tools in Rhodes you have an app generator which will generate a base level controller in HTML templates then you can then edit , and then we have the sync server we have n't talked much about yet that helps you get access to enterprise apps called RhoSync but if you use the command line tools you would do separate generations for Rhodes and for the RhoSync we have a generator for the backend source adaptors .
If you use it on Rhohub it 's a way to bind together these things , you basically define your app and then you define your objects that are interesting in your app .
And the attribute on those objects will generate the controller , the HTML templates , and the RhoSync source adaptors on the backend .
And then we have the hosted IDE and then when you are done with editing then you will do a build like we talked about with Rhodes but now you can do your build online .
Sometimes the builds can be time consuming you do n't have to wait for the builds on your device , and you do n't have to install all the underlying SDKs on the device .
So if you install Rhodes offline on your own machine , we 'll do builds for you with rake but you still have to have the SDKs installed you have to have the iPhone SDK installed or the Android SDK installed you do n't have to actually use those IDEs or their build script , you can use ours that runs on top of those , with rake but once you do it on Rhohub you can have Rhohub do all the builds for you .
That is development time and then at runtime we also do hosted runtime .
So people would say : " What do you mean hosted runtime ? "
It 's a native app , it 's not a mobile web app , what is that even mean to have hosted runtime ?
That is really two things today but it can be more things : one is the hosted provisioning or the vending machine so like when you do the builds we know where your builds are located and we can give you a mobile .
yourcompany.com and then users hit that with their browser , mobile.yourcompany.com , and then we detect on Rhohub what device they are running from and we will serve up the appropriate executable so it's a vending machine , as one thing .
And then the second thing is a hosted sync server .
So we think our sync server is pretty easy to install but for some people keeping a server up and running getting an URL for it and keeping it up and running and making sure that it is sized appropriately can be real work .
So we give you that hosted sync server .
And we had some requests from beta users of Rhohub of additional services to make it easier for them to develop apps .
One of them is a mobile advertising service and one of them is mobile analytics .
We are going to be very cautious about introducing new services , because we do n't want to introduce services that could just as easily be provided by third parties that are already out there , trying to serve that business , so we will see if there really are needs for these services , it 's all intended to be an accelerant to them building Rhodes based apps .
If there are needs for other services that make it easy to build apps then we will introduce those as well .
14 . You mentioned your syncing capabilities , RhoSync .
How is that integrated with Rhodes or how do Rhodes developers use that ?
Every Rhodes app includes this RhoSync client .
You do n't have to use it , you can write a RhoSync app that either it 's completely local or does all of its connections to the Internet either through JavaScript because you can put JavaScript in your HTML templates or through sockets in Ruby .
However we think it 's generally not the best way , we think the best mobile experience is you sync the data from wherever your backend is we have the information down to the device and then you have that information whether you are online or offline .
To make this easier to do we have the RhoSync client embedded in Rhodes and we have a RhoSync server and that RhoSync server turns out like a Rails app just like any other Rails app .
But we also have installed programs that you say " I want to install RhoSync " and we install everything we install the Ruby , the Ruby on Rails , the database , MySql whatever you need to run and so RhoSync is your server and all that RhoSync needs in order to keep data from a backend current with what you have on your device is using what we would call a source adaptor .
A source adaptor has six methods : login , query , create , update , delete and logout .
You write those six methods in Ruby I assume a lot of people watching this are Ruby developers , so you can imagine that compared to the old way that source adaptors were written for other sync servers if you write it in Ruby you can do a lot in very little .
These source adaptors tend to be like a page or less of code .
We ship with a number of source adaptors as examples for like Sugar CRM or Siebel and other enterprise apps .
And actually you can get a lot value by just writing a one method ' query ' .
You write a handful of lines of code that might call your REST backend , in our online tutorial we call it a Rails based REST backend actually you do n't know that it 's a Rails based REST backend but you call a REST interface and it's like four lines of code , to call out grab the stuff and then you are actually calling the REST interface calling back JSON which gets parsed into a hash of hashes and then as long as you have a hash of hashes then it gets automatically pulled into this server cache in effect and then it's the job of that server and the RhoSync client that is on your device to keep that all up to date .
You as a developer in your Rhodes app you do n't know anything about how this thing happens all that you do in your Rhodes app is you assume that the data is current and so you are writing basic ORM code just like you would in Rails with ActiveRecord where you are referring to the objects and their attributes .
The original purpose of RhoSync was to partially do sync data but also to give the user that experience that their data was always current and available to them .
The side benefit as turned out is that it 's created a really great easy programming model .
Because now when you write Rhodes apps your data is just there .
You refer to objects and you generally should n't have to be doing any network programming , no Net : : HTTP calls or pulling data over the wire in XML , your Rhodes app can just assume that the data is always there .
15 . How do you handle conflict resolution with RhoSync sync capabilities ?
Ok , that is a great question .
What we do is we actually have a spec for how the internal of the Rhosyn algorithm works on the wiki , so anybody can see what is there , obviously it 's open source so you can see that as well .
On every source , so an app can typically consist of a number of sources .
So maybe your accounts , and contacts and leads and opportunities .
So you have a source adaptor for each one of those .
Every source , and you can set it on a source by source basis , has an option that says allow conflicts or not .
If you allow conflicts , then what happens is and that is the default by the way and basically last in wins , but we still flag the fact in the log that there was somebody that came in and updated the records so let 's give an example .
You have an account and you update their zip code .
And you have an account and you update the phone number .
Now it turns out that because we have in our sync protocol we chose to do this object - attribute - value both wire format and storage mechanism , we can handle that fact and say " That is not conflicting " .
And we will do both changes .
Part of it is this whole object value approach that we do also known as a property bag approach , for a wire format , so that handles the vast majority of conflicts .
Now , if you both do change the same thing , you update the zip code and you update the zip code , if we say allow conflict then you 'll win and your zip code update will be second but we will flag that in the log .
If you say do n't allow conflicts , then yours goes in and because no subsequent query has happened , there has been no subsequent sync , of downloading the data , then it 's about apply your update that says " Conflicts are not allowed " and it wo n't do the update and it will also flag it actually in a very similar way in what we call the source log .
You were bringing up the question about these other sync servers that have been out there , in general like many Rails apps and frameworks , we are all about the 80/20 deliver 80 % of the value with 20 % of the complexity .
We think that the choice of attribute object value civilization approach eliminates the vast majority of these conflict issues , and we have this simple thing of allow conflicts or do n't allow conflicts provide a nice high level log that developers can use and then developers can use that log to do whatever interesting business logic they want around it .
In terms of doing , you are correct that there are other sync servers that have done much more complex things , many more options for dealing with this , and that is something that we would want to see either come from developers themselves , within their apps and just give them the right hooks , or from the community .
16 .
What is the future of Rhomobile and all your offerings starting from Future Ruby in the future ?
I think that is a good question because lot of people say " Rhodes is done so what else do you need to do ? "
One of the things that we want to make sure we will do a good job of and it's sort of a new category so we are not really comfortable putting dates around is Rhohub , this development of this service .
Right now we are thinking that it will launch mid August but it 's really going to launch when developers tell us it 's ready .
And we also do n't even think we necessarily know every service they need to be successful .
So a lot of it it 's going to be about making Rhohub successful and then really beyond that for sorts of core Rhodes and what the capabilities are , we are very much driven we think we have delivered the base offering that people can do useful things with , and as far as incremental capabilities we will just listen to our customers and very extremely responsive to the list that they say they want .

From the NY Times : Prolonged Aid to Unemployed Is Running Out
Over the coming months , as many as 1.5 million jobless Americans will exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits , ending what for some has been a last bulwark against foreclosures and destitution .
... laid - off workers in nearly half the states can collect benefits for up to 79 weeks , the longest period since the unemployment insurance program was created in the 1930s .
But unemployment in this recession has proved to be especially tenacious , and a wave of job - seekers is using up even this prolonged aid .
Tens of thousands of workers have already used up their benefits , and the numbers are expected to soar in the months to come , reaching half a million by the end of September and 1.5 million by the end of the year , according to new projections by the National Employment Law Project , a private research group .
There are now an all - time high of 4.4 million Americans who have been out of work for more than six months , up dramatically from 2.6 million in February .
That translates into 29 % of jobless workers who have been out of work for six months , a record since data were first reported in 1948 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The National Employment Law Project report breaks down the extended benefit programs by state .
The programs are triggered by the state unemployment rate .
About half the states qualify for 53 weeks on top of the regular 26 weeks for unemployment benefits .
Other states qualify for 46 , 33 and 20 weeks of extended benefits .
From the report :
Here is a graph I posted earlier this week of the number of workers who have exhausted their regular benefits :
The blue line is the number of workers unemployed for 27 weeks or more .
The red line is the same data as a percent of the civilian workforce .
According to the BLS , there are almost 4.4 million workers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks ( and still want a job ) .
This is 2.8 % of the civilian workforce .
Right now very few workers have exhausted their unemployment benefits , but there is tidal wave coming .
The Law Project estimates 0.5 million workers will have exhausted their extended benefits by the end of September , and close to 1.5 million by the end of 2009 .
Unless the unemployment rate starts to decline , the numbers will continue to grow rapidly in 2010 .

That ’s the belief behind the burgeoning trend of motion comics , which Marvel joins Wednesday with its first issue of the rebooted Spider - Woman series .
Motion comics , crudely put , are usually Flash versions of their paper counterparts enhanced by voice - over narration , musical scores , camera pans and other cinematic tricks .
In other words , animation .
“ We ’re using the motion comics medium to tell brand new stories that can appeal to so many different people , ” said John Dokes , Marvel ’s vice president of sales and marketing .
“ Additionally , we ’re turning classic paper comic series into Marvel motion comics and exposing this next generation to some of the greatest creators and top moments in Marvel history . ”
The new Spider - Woman follows up on the nefarious narratives of Marvel ’s New Avengers and Secret Invasion .
The series , which will be released as both motion comic and in the traditional format , lets Eisner - winning writer and self - professed Spider - Woman superfan Brian Michael Bendis take a shot at the story of Jessica Drew Spider - Woman ’s alter ego from when the character originally appeared in 1977 .
The panels and covers are supplied by Bendis ’ frequent collaborator Alex Maleev , while acclaimed artist Alex Ross also supplies a cover for the first issue ( viewable below ) .
Marvel ’s a bit late to the motion comics game .
Last year , Warner Bros. and DC Comics rolled out motion comics for Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ’ Watchmen , as well as Batman and Superman titles .
From television ’s Heroes to Charles M. Schulz ’s Peanuts to Stephen King ’s short story N , the motion comic has rumbled to life as digital distribution has provided a platform to spread comics to laptops and iPhones .
But the emphasis of this brave new digital iteration is on movement , as the Spider - Woman trailer above illustrates nicely .
Motion comics can pulse into life more quickly than their pulp counterparts , which is one benefit of the medium .
Another plus ?
A lighter carbon footprint .
They ’re also cheaper :
Most major motion comics top out on iTunes at around $ 2 , while the pamphlet versions still run twice that .
( Spider - Woman will cost just $ 1 during a two - week introductory period .
Then the price rises to $ 2 a pop . )
The emerging digital model is still experiencing birth pangs , but it would seem fair to stop using the term motion comics and instead call them what they are , which is animation .
For decades , comics have functioned as elaborate storyboards for possible movies , but have existed in a space apart from cinema .
Moore and Gibbons ’ Watchmen was a great example of that :
Its ambitious layouts took readers ’ eyeballs on tangential journeys from one space to another in ways that films simply cannot match .
Ever since the comics series arrived in 1986 , nearly everyone asked when it was going to be turned into a film .
( 2009 was the answer to that question . )
But old - school fans of eye - popping art and labyrinthine narratives will be hard - pressed to give up their paper copies for Flash animations with sweeping scores .
Part of comics ’ inherent charm was the soundtrack , voiceover or extra-textual material they inspired in readers ’ heads .
By doing that job for them , motion comics could alienate as many readers as they excite .
What ’s your take on the trend ?
Are you a die - hard fan of the old - school printed comics ?
Do you think motion comics are a fad , or the future of comics in the digital age ?
Let us know in the comments section .

I 'm pleased to announce the availability of criterion , a new library for measuring the performance of Haskell code .
Compared to most other benchmarking frameworks ( for any programming language , not just Haskell ) , criterion focuses on being easy to use , informative , and robust .
Here 's a canonical benchmark - worthy function , which has the desirable properties of being both small and slow :
import Criterion .
Main ( defaultMain )
fib :: Int ->
Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 )
To compile a program that will benchmark our fib function , we write a trivial main entry point :
main = defaultMain [
bench " fib 10 " $
-> fib ( 10 +n-n )
, bench " fib 30 " $
-> fib ( 30 +n-n )
, bench " fib 35 " $
-> fib ( 35 +n-n )
]
Criterion itself is trivially easy to install .
$ cabal install criterion
Once it 's installed , we build the application we intend to benchmark .
$ ghc - O -- make Fibber
If we run the Fibber program with the -- help option , it prints a large amount of help output .
The most interesting options early on are -t , which displays raw timing information , and -k , which turns the timing information into a chart of the probability distributions of timings .
So for immediate gratification , we can run Fibber like this :
$ ./ Fibber -t win -k win
The win argument to each option means " display these charts in a window " .
For this article , I used the png argument instead , to get nicely sized images that I could simply drop into WordPress .
$ ./ Fibber -t png:450x175 -k png:450x175
Here 's an example of raw timing information :
Notice that the times on the Y axis are labelled with their units , in this case microseconds .
On the X axis is the run count .
Timing information is somewhat nice to have , but much more useful is an indication of which times occurred most frequently .
The traditional way to display such information is with a histogram .
Histograms are pretty awful , since a histogram with an incorrect bin size is either misleading or useless , and bin sizes have to be chosen by hand .
Much more useful is a kernel density estimate :
This is a chart of the estimated probability densities of timings .
We observe a big hump at about 5.23µs , with a few small outliers further out .
This suggests that it usually takes about 5.23µs to evaluate fib 10 .
Meanwhile , in our console window , our Fibber program has printed a lot more information .
Here 's how it starts :
estimating clock resolution ... mean is 9.956511 us ( 80001 iterations ) found 3711 outliers among 79999 samples ( 4.6 % ) 3505 ( 4.4 % ) high severe
The first thing that Fibber does is measure how long it takes for the system clock to tick .
It will then run our benchmarked code enough times that the resolution of the clock will not introduce a significant error .
Indeed , our first benchmark shows why this is important : if fib 10 takes 5.23 µs to evaluate , but the clock ticks once every 9.96µs , we clearly can't just evaluate fib 10 once , and subtract the start from the end time .
Sometimes it will appear to evaluate instantaneously , since the clock wo n't have ticked , and sometimes it will appear to have taken about 10µs , since the clock will have ticked exactly once .
Both answers would be worse than useless .
Instead , we evaluate fib 10 many thousands of times in order to get the measurement error introduced by the resolution of the clock down to a few parts in ten thousand .
We also use something called the boxplot technique to develop a quick sense of the quality of our data .
In this case , a few percent of our numbers are significantly off from the mean of the sample .
Once we 've characterised the system clock 's period , we figure out how expensive it is to actually use the clock .
estimating cost of a clock call ... mean is 923.3224 ns ( 58 iterations ) found 4 outliers among 58 samples ( 6.9 % ) 1 ( 1.7 % ) high mild 3 ( 5.2 % ) high severe
We adjust our timing measurements to take the cost of clock calls into account , even though in practice this makes almost no difference to the numbers we report .
( If you 're measuring an event that occurs on a millisecond - to - second time scale , you would n't expect a one - microsecond difference to perturb things much ! )
The last part is the most interesting .
We automatically figure out how many times we need to evaluate fib 10 :
benchmarking fib 10 collecting 100 samples , 1911 iterations each , in estimated 995.8188 ms
In this case , we evaluate fib 10 1911 times and measure the cost of this , then repeat this measurement 100 times .
We print an estimate in advance for how long the measurements will take , so that if you 're benchmarking something expensive , you can go for coffee or whatever .
( If you can fetch coffee in 995.8 milliseconds , more power to you ! )
Why do we measure so many times ?
Because we 're going to do some statistical analysis of our measurements to see whether they are trustworthy .
bootstrapping with 100000 resamples
The bootstrap step takes a second or two , and this is where the interesting stuff takes place .
The performance of real - world applications does n't follow some kind of tidy statistical pattern such as the normal distribution , especially when people are measuring in realistic , noisy environments .
If you run a time - consuming benchmark on your laptop , you 're likely to want to switch to your web browser , watch a video on youtube , check your mail , and so on .
Your CPU might slow down because it 's overheating , or your laptop 's ACPI subsystem might change the CPU frequency to conserve power .
In other words , there are lots of things that might perturb our benchmarking results , some of which we can't see or control , but then again they might not occur or might not be important , and our numbers could be fine .
How can we tell ?
We use a statistical technique known as the bootstrap , with which we take some sample data and perform some number crunching to tell us interesting things .
Specifically , we can use the results of the bootstrap to tell us whether the outliers in our measurements ( timings that are far from the mean ) are perturbing our numbers in a significant way .
The first thing that the bootstrap tells us is the mean and standard deviation of our measurements , along with the 95 % confidence intervals for those values .
mean : 5.232800 us , lb 5.222862 us , ub 5.262482 us , ci 0.950 std dev : 79.86726 ns , lb 31.06332 ns , ub 173.0716 ns , ci 0.950
It then reports on the outliers in the measurements , and most importantly , tells us whether they are important .
found 7 outliers among 100 samples ( 7.0 % ) 3 ( 3.0 % ) high mild 4 ( 4.0 % ) high severe variance introduced by outliers : 0.993 % variance is unaffected by outliers
I ran the above example on my laptop when it was idle , so the timing measurements are fine .
Boring !
What about a more interesting example ?
I measured the performance of fib 35 :
collecting 100 samples , 1 iterations each , in estimated 88.14368 s
While this executed , I ran a stupid but computationally expensive task in another window :
while true ; do for ( ( i=0 ; i < 20 ; i++ ) ) ; do md5sum cufp.odp >/ dev /null & done for ( ( i=0 ; i < 20 ; i++ ) ) ; do wait done done
This shell script grinds over a largish file repeatedly , but does so using 20 processes at a time .
It reliably drives the load average on my laptop up to 8 .
What did it do to my measurements ?
As the timing numbers suggest , I ran my CPU - chomping script twice while taking measurements .
This had a noticeable effect not just on the timings , but on their probability distributions too :
Those are two fairly large humps , which certainly seem like they should give cause for concern .
What does Fibber report on the console ?
mean : 1.566470 s , lb 1.333717 s , ub 1.855111 s , ci 0.950 std dev : 1.324608 s , lb 1.114684 s , ub 1.510580 s , ci 0.950 found 23 outliers among 100 samples ( 23.0 % ) 22 ( 22.0 % ) high severe variance introduced by outliers : 52.994 % variance is severely inflated by outliers
Notice that the standard deviation of the sample is almost the same as the mean , a classic sign of sketchy performance measurements .
However , we do n't merely have to spot this suspicious pattern ourselves : by analysing the results of the bootstrap , our benchmark automatically tells us that our numbers are , in effect , junk .
So !
Thanks to criterion , you can now easily measure the performance of Haskell code , and even better , you 'll ( usually ) be told when you 're lying to yourself .
Oh , and you can produce those charts in PDF , SVG , and CSV formats , too , in addition to PNG and windowed output , so you can simply drop camera - ready copy straight into your next Haskell Implementor 's Workshop submission !
There 's plenty of work yet to be done .
In order to improve the rigour of the bootstrap analysis , I want to perform an autocorrelation test on the timing measurements , since an autocorrelated sample can distort the result of a bootstrap analysis .
I 'd also like to be able to produce charts with many estimates overlaid , to allow things like scaling and comparative analyses .
But I think that criterion is off to a solid start .
If you 'd like to work on any of these , let me know : I think that the code is quite clean and easy to work on , and of course the darcs repository for the source is easy to get :
darcs get http://darcs.serpentine.com/criterion
It should even be easy to use criterion to benchmark C code and command line programs .
Much of my work on criterion was inspired by Brent Boyer 's excellent articles on Java performance analysis ( part one and part two ) .
Amusingly , Java and Haskell each pose substantial benchmarking challenges : in the case of Java , dynamic recompilation makes getting good numbers very challenging , while for Haskell , lazy evaluation brings its own difficulties .

Many Christians are puzzled about why atheists cannot seem to let go of the Crusades .
Why must we continue to bring up these atrocities from the relatively remote past , they wonder , and use the atrocities of their ancestors against them today ?
It hardly seems fair .
One might even be tempted to use American slavery as an example to illustrate how little sense it makes to blame a people for what their distant relatives did .
And yet , I 'll be taking a very different position here and arguing that atheists must not let go of the Crusades .
To paraphrase the common maxim , we who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it .
We must remember the Crusades , the various periods of the Inquisition , the Salem witch trials , the Satanic ritual abuse scare in the 1980's , and recent revelations about the Family .
We must remember these grotesque episodes just as we must never forget the Holocaust , Jonestown , or Heaven 's Gate .
We remember them because we cannot allow them to be repeated .
And yet , there is more to it than maintaining these memories out of any noble cause .
No , we must remember because our very survival depends on it .
Atheists remember many of these periods because there are enough of us , at least in the U.S. , who go through our daily lives feeling that another such period could be right around the corner .
We lived 8 years under a Christian extremist presidency , and we are too suspect of human nature to conclude with absolute certainty that we 'll never see a President Huckabee .
It could happen .
We have heard again and again how our Christian neighbors feel about us and what some of them would like to do to us to relax completely .
We have seen a Christian extremist presence infiltrate our military , at least one of our modern political parties , and countless wealthy corporations .
The consolidation of political power , military strength , and massive wealth into Christian extremist hands is something that should terrify every atheist .
We know what can happen because we have seen it again and again throughout history .
Those of us who live in hotbeds of Christian extremism often feel that we are a step closer to the nightmare that others have the luxury of pretending is solely in our past .
" Never forget " is our cry , and we are not about to abandon it .
Celebrate progress where one finds it , but never forget .
Far too much is at stake .
I was chagrined watching Chris Matthews on the Iran question tonight .
He had Michael Rubin of AEI on ( before sunset on Yom Kippur ; wonder what Sandy Koufax would do ? ) pitching neoconservative religion and Robert Baer , the former CIA guy .
All three were doomsday .
And Matthews conducted the rapidfire session like a catechism of crisis .
Ratcheting up the probabilities with each question till we went to break and I was sure we were on the threshhold of WW3 .
To his credit , Rubin separated Israel ’s interest from the U.S. ’s– something the neocons never did when they pushed the Iraq war .
But he said in essence : it ’s an existential threat and Israel is going to take matters into its hands .
Matthews went along with that .
He kept referring to Israel as the refuge for the Jewish people–in what I took to be a motion of unexamined Irish Catholic sympathy–and said that Iran wanted to eliminate it .
I wish someone had dealt with the Iranian bluster question .
Ahmadinejad has never said that he aims to destroy Israel ; he has said that it will vanish from the page of time .
Not that different from anti-Zionists in the U.S. who call Israel the Temporary Zionist Entity .
Also , Ahmadinejad has said that he defers to the political wishes of the Palestinians .
Would he really aim to destroy the Palestinians ?
Ahmadinejad is angered by the unending occupation , which is a red flag of injustice across the Muslim world .
And as Steve Walt has pointed out , the Iranians would never fire one missile at a country that has 200 – why , to watch their country get burnt to a crisp ?
I wish Matthews had brought up Zbig Brzezinski ’s statement that the U.S. should take out Israeli jets before they try to attack Iran , because the American interest , including troops in Iraq , would be so harmed by such a strike .
Matthews agreed with Rubin that a nuclearized Iran is a " psychological threat " to Israel .
But when it comes to psyche , what about Netanyahu ’s irrational performance at the U.N. , producing blueprints of Auschwitz to counter Ahmadinejad ’s Holocaust denial , and calling Hamas Nazis .
Is this a rational actor ?
Do we want him in the driver ’s seat for WW3 ?
Both Rubin and fellow neocon Eliot Cohen in the Wall Street Journal have the same recommendation : regime change .
Iran wo n’t be safe till the Islamic Republic is gone .
And a strike , Rubin concedes , will insure that the Islamic Republic is around for a long time .
Eliot Cohen seems to want a permanent war in the Middle East :
The choices are now what they ever were : an American or an Israeli strike , which would probably cause a substantial war , or living in a world with Iranian nuclear weapons , which may also result in war , perhaps nuclear , over a longer period of time .
Funny how the neocons always project Israel ’s bad behavior on others .
Cohen says that the Iranians are responsible for an arms race in the Middle East .
Is the responsibility theirs alone ?
And as for regime change , how many Americans in high places believe that no progress will come on our biggest problem in the Middle East , the Israel / Palestine conflict , until the Netanyahu government is thrown out ?
Oh here ’s another neocon on the loose : Paul Wolfowitz at Financial Times , pushing for regime change , too .

Of course , it 's not that simple ; but if you believe Dr Tracy Alloway from the University of Stirling in Scotland , Twitter and Facebook are very different beasts when it comes to improve your " working memory " , which relates to " the structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information in short - term memory . "
Dr. Alloway has developed a working memory training programme for slow - learning children aged 11 to 14 at a school in Durham , and she found out that Facebook did wonders for working memory , improving the kids '
IQ scores , while YouTube and Twitter 's steady stream of information was not healthy for working memory .
Also , playing video games , especially those that involve planning and strategy , can also be beneficial .
As with any such study , one needs to take the results with a grain of salt .
Without going into the benefits of training working memory for improving your IQ results , it 's obvious that Facebook and Twitter are hard to compare .
Facebook is extremely versatile : you can play games there , chat with your friends , view photos and videos ; you can even take IQ tests .
Twitter is a much simpler , more streamlined service .
Does that fact alone makes it detrimental to your working memory ?
Dr. Alloway claims : " On Twitter you receive an endless stream of information , but it 's also very succinct .
You do n't have to process that information .
Your attention span is being reduced and you 're not engaging your brain and improving nerve connections . ''
That may be true , and while looking at Twitter like a zombie for the better part of the day is probably bad for you , if you mix it up with other online activities - such as Facebook - I doubt you 'll see any negative effects .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Logging onto Facebook as a resident in the Golan Heights , should you enter Syria or Israel as your home country ?
Facebook now has 300 million users -- almost as many as the population of the United States .
Decades of war and occupation have not provided an answer to that question -- but the social networking Web site now permits both options , sparking fears about an anti-Facebook cyber -war .
The Golan Heights is Syrian territory that was captured by Israel during the Six - Day War in 1967 .
Since then it has been internationally classified as Israeli - occupied territory .
Up until recently , Facebook fans in the Golan Heights could only choose Syria as their country of origin or else leave it blank .
Pro-Israel
Web site honestreporting .com sought to change that , starting a group called " Facebook , Golan residents live in Israel , not Syria . "
Alex Margolin says the campaign was never political .
" It was never a question of the future of Golan ... it 's totally possible that at some time in the future the Golan will change hands and go to Syria . "
The group welcomed 2,500 members in the first week .
Shortly afterwards Facebook policy changed .
Do you think Facebook was right to change policy ?
" We have enabled users in Golan Heights to choose either Syria or Israel in the listings , " a Facebook spokesperson told CNN .
" We currently have the same dual - listing options for the West Bank settlement , which is listed in both Palestine and Israel .
Connect the World Becky Anderson takes viewers across continents , beyond headlines .
2000 GMT see full schedule »
" We deal with the listings for disputed territories on a case - by - case basis , and with Golan Heights we decided a dual listing made sense in this instance . "
Eighteen - year old Ofri Bazaz is delighted she can finally change her profile to Israel , squealing with delight as she tries it for the first time .
She said : " It 's very important on the Internet when somebody comes to my profile on Facebook they will see Israel and not Syria .
I 'm not Syrian . "
But a 20 - minute drive away in the Druze town of Majdal Shams , the reaction is very different .
Facebook users here consider themselves Syrian and refuse to accept the change , as they fear it undermines their peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation .
Shopkeeper Sakar abu Sabit said : " Even if it 's just on the computer , I want people to always recognize me in the Golan Heights as a Syrian citizen . "
Reaction from Syria is likely to be muted according to Syrian scholar , Ammar Abdulhamid .
He told CNN that Facebook and other social networking sites have already been banned in Syria .
" The Syrian government has really taken a strong stance on Internet activism and social networking sites , " he said .
" The real reason is nothing to do with the Arab - Israeli conflict , it 's because these sites are very popular with Syrian activists . "
But with 300 million users worldwide and an estimated 120 million logging in every single day according to Facebook , there will inevitably be fears about a backlash against the site that now finds itself at the center of a 40 - year - old conflict .

Police say there is still more to be done to improve the investigating of rape Rape claims are being left off official crime records , the BBC has learned .
Figures obtained following a Freedom of Information request showed some UK police forces were failing to record more than 40 % of cases .
Rules state only allegations verified as false , reported to the wrong force , or recorded in error can be removed .
The Association of Chief Police Officers said advances had been made in rape investigation but campaigners said women were being denied justice .
The figures showed wide regional variations but some forces had such a high number of cases removed from records - known as " no- criming " - that critics said it was evident the rules were not being properly applied .
Cause for concern
In Northumbria , there were 382 reports of rape .
Of those , 172 never made it into official Home Office figures and that was before any were " no- crimed " .
Police in Durham said only five of 130 cases had been " no- crimed " yet the figures showed a further 83 cases were never officially recorded in the first place .
In contrast , forces in Humberside , Gloucestershire , and Northamptonshire recorded at least 90 % of cases for investigation .
Northern Constabulary , which covers the Highlands , Western Isles and Orkney and Shetland , puts every case on its records .
HM Inspectorate of Constabulary demanded improvements in recording rape claims two years ago but has admitted there is still cause for concern .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The figures also showed hundreds of complaints lodged in the year to March 2008 never went forward to a full investigation .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) said significant advances had recently been made into investigating rapes but admitted there was still much more to do .
Chief constable of Cheshire Police , Dave Whatton , who speaks for Acpo on rape issues , said even when allegations were withdrawn they must still be investigated .
" If somebody 's saying , ' I have been raped but I 'm not prepared to go forward with this at court , ' then it should still stay as a crime .
" That is n't something that should be withdrawn .
Because in terms of threshold tests , it has to be proved that the offence did not take place , not that we can't take forward the investigation . "
Lisa Longstaff , of campaign group Women Against Rape , accused police of not taking rape seriously enough .
She said police have 72 hours in which to investigate a rape allegation and declare it a crime but some were using this as a way to avoid investigating .
BBC website readers have been commenting on this story .
Here is a selection of their thoughts and experiences .
I was attacked by two men two years ago and reported it the morning after .
I was accused by a female officer of making it up and being ' a fantasist ' because I had been drinking .
I have talked to police officers who say they know that the CPS will not prosecute most of the cases they investigate , so they feel there is little point in spending resources on an investigation .
The process has got to change .
Ursula , UK ' Drink ' , ' provocative clothing ' , ' walking alone ' and ' on a date with ' : if these words were ever associated with a victim of male or child rape not getting justice there would be a public outcry .
Yet all these have sometimes been used as excuses for women perceived to be ' asking ' to be raped .
The prejudice based on sensationalistic coverage of those few false rape cases also seems to be all too readily at the forefront of some people 's minds when a rape is reported , rather than the suffering of the victims .
Alison , North Wales , UK I think the media should improve how they report rape claims instead of the knee jerk assumption that an allegation of rape is as good as a guilty verdict .
The fact that so few allegations result in convictions can have two interpretations : first that rapists are getting away with it - which is quite possible ; second that those who claim they are victims are making false allegations , which is also possible .
For what it is worth , I have no idea what percentage of alleged rapists is actually guilty , whether it be all or none .
I doubt the BBC knows any better .
Steve , London , UK I am a victim of rape in a different way : I was accused of rape when I had blatantly not done a thing wrong .
After tests , the girl was cautioned for wasting hours of expensive police time and I was let go .
The whole thing was very hurtful and my dad wanted to sue for slander .
I am appalled by the fact that women think they will get away with this .
I 'm not surprised at the numbers provided by your recent investigation .
Anonymous , UK I work for an independent rape and sexual abuse organisation .
Many of my clients are openly discouraged from pursuing prosecutions and some have had their allegations disbelieved .
It is not the job of the police to tell someone that court will be tough for them and they probably should n't take things further .
Unfortunately , the targets they are set and the amount of cost and paperwork mean that many police make quick judgments .
The number - crunching process dictated by the government causes more of a skew on figures than anything else .
Anonymous , North West , UK
It 's fairly clear that the police force suffers from the same problem many other public institutions have nowadays - league tables and obsessions with statistics .
This encourages them to shy away from crimes such as rape , which are difficult to handle and harder to prove .
Rosie , London , UK
The way justice systems deal with sex crimes is generally contemptible across the world but one would have expected rather better from the UK .
Such situations are the product of inaction on the part of the public : the rapist may the one ultimately responsible for the act but society is responsible for the administration of justice thereafter .

The best example of car as unintentional weapon , this short but so , so sweet clip sees perenially underrated Brad Pitt getting mowed down by not one but two automobiles in a scene resembling some kind of human Pong .
Audiences cheered at this point , believing this horrendous piece of film making was over .
How wrong they were .
9. Christine
Proving that CGI doth not always make the best special effects , Christine was notable for the quite incredible hair styles on show .
Rumour has it that the car demanded a mullet on set .
8. Bad Boys II
When you say Will Smith , people generally cheer .
When you say Martin Lawrence , people generally curl up into a ball and find their happy place .
Trigger a rollercoaster of emotions as the bad boys persue the bad guys on a freeway , only for the criminals to unleash a whole auto - transports worth of brand new vehicles on to the road .
Do we want them to die ?
Our heart says save Will , our head says destroy Lawrence .
7. Death Proof
This clip continues Tarantinos horrendous foot fetish , and also underscores how mean Kurt Russell can look when he wants to .
Its a rare director who can bring something new to a scene as well worn as the car crash , so as with most things Tarantino decides to give us as much car crash as we can handle , replaying the same collision from several different angles , each more horrific than the last .
6. Batman
Tim Burtons Batman was a dark , camp misfit .
Jack Nicholsons
Joker brought levity to the situation , so its great to see this moment of calculated darkness as the Batmobile , remotely driven by the caped crusader , cruises its way into the perps den before inconsequentially dropping a fat bomb out the middle of its tyre .
Queue a badass detonation , the car exploding out of the fire like a bat out of hell .
Every single boy in the audience wanted a Batmobile from that moment on .
The bomb rims have yet to make an appearance on Pimp My Ride .
5. Robocop
Yes its the toxic waste dude .
Easily the grossest death scene in blockbuster history , its also an instance of great black humour as Clarence Boddicker ( the dude from That 70s show , guys ! ) fresh from cutting his compadre clean in half , turns the wipers on to clean the blood from his windscreen , a deliciously pragmatic conclusion to a moment of ultimate horror .
4. Transformers 2
You could take any five minute segment from Michael Bays frame - buggering action extravaganza , though theres nothing quite as menacing , as plain awesome as watching Devastator transform .
As cement mixers , cranes and diggers combine , there is a mounting sense of total doom .
The ensuing destruction is enough to make your eyes bleed .
3. Terminator
The Terminator : I 'm a friend of Sarah Connor .
I was told she was here .
Could I see her please ?
Desk Sergeant : No , you can't see her she 's making a statement .
The Terminator : Where is she ?
Desk Sergeant :
It may take a while .
Want to wait ?
There 's a bench over there .
The Terminator : I 'll be back .
In the space of a minute Arnold Schwarzenegger assured his place in the Hollywood pantheon .
Its easy to forget that this line is so great because the Terminator then drives a car through the front of the building .
Its also a showcase of director James Camerons impeccable skills , beginning with the bland close - up of pencil on paper , followed by the innocuous , polite enquiry of the Terminator which then builds into a direct demand as it scopes the room to assess its integrity .
After a further rebuttal , subtlety takes a quiet walk out the door and comes back in the form of a four - door saloon .
2. Final Destination
You can kind of see it coming .
Stepping into the road , shouting her mouth off .
Yet its still a shock .
A great example of economical horror , a young girl receives a face full of bus .
The subsequent splatter of blood is at once barely noticeable and entirely gratuitous , and the single scream that follows from one of the onlookers is a textbook example of less is more .
If someone really did get hit in the face by a bus ( driven by death , dont forget ) , this is how it would probably go .
1. The Enforcer
Alexander the Great .
Genghis Khan .
Harry Callahan .
Of all the people in history , fictional or otherwise , Dirty Harry would be near the top of your list of people to leave well alone in a queue .
This is a real standout moment in a film full of iconic Eastwood .
The great thing about this scene is the difficulty in pinpointing Harrys motivation for piling his car into the front of the store .
Did he just want to get things over and done with ?
Did he want to save the womans life ?
Is it because they ruined his sports jacket ?
Maybe all of these things contribute to the best use of car as weapon in a movie , ever .
What are your fav moments of cars being used as weapons ?

RAINFALL last month encouraged Haniya , a middle - aged member of the Lambada tribe of southern Andhra Pradesh ( AP ) , to inspect his one - acre ( 0.4 - hectare ) field .
Some speckles of green , to show the red earth had held enough water for weeds to shoot , would have tempted him to sow cotton .
But , towards the end of AP 's monsoon rainy season , the field was parched and bare .
If it rains again , Haniya may sow .
If not ?
He gave the reply of peasant farmers in India and poor , dry places everywhere : “ Only God knows . ”
Back in his village of Veeralapalam , light - skinned Lambadi farmers gathered .
Most had scattered some cotton or lentil seed after the rain .
But it had better rain again : none had access to irrigation from a dozen wells sunk 90 metres into central India 's lava bedrock by richer high - caste Hindu farmers .
A few expected to buy a dousing or two of costly piped water , brought by the same neighbours from a nearby storm - creek .
Even if affordable , said Saidanayak , this would not sustain his hoped - for acre of cotton .
Without more rain , it will fail , adding to his 125,000 - rupee ( $ 2,500 ) debt — a big sum , when the dowry for a Lambada bride is $ 1,200 .
With no crop , no money and three daughters to marry off , he would join the only reliable flood in AP in these drought days : of thousands of tough , skinny peasants into Hyderabad , the state capital , in search of a day - wage .
Asked what he would do there , Saidayanak pushed out his fists and shifted from foot to foot , as if cycling a rickshaw — and laughter diluted the gloom .
Many Indians share his worries .
Around 450 m live off rain - fed agriculture , and this year 's monsoon rains , which between June and September provide 80 % of India 's precipitation , have been the scantiest in decades .
Almost half India 's 604 districts are affected by drought , especially in the poorest and most populous states — such as Bihar , which has declared drought in 26 of its 38 districts .
Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) , home to 185 m , expects its main rice harvest to be down by 60 % .
The outlook for the winter wheat crop is also poor , with India 's main reservoirs , a source for irrigation canals , one - third below their seasonal average .
That also means less water for thirsty cities , including Delhi , where 18 m people live and the water board meets around half their demand in a good year .
Belated cloudbursts in AP and other states have brought relief .
But late sowing tends to produce a thin harvest .
AP counted some 20 farmer suicides last month , and there will be more .
A short drive from Hyderabad , Koteswara Rao watched as four Hindu outcasts and two blue - horned bullocks ploughed his 16 acres ( 14 of them leased ) for cotton .
If it fails he will be left with a $ 4,000 debt and , being of lofty caste , he said , he could never sweat it out as a labourer .
“ Suicide would be easier . ”
No one should starve , at least .
None of India 's previous five big post - independence droughts caused famine .
And after two bumper years , the government says it has enough wheat and rice in store to prevent serious food - grain price inflation .
With agriculture accounting for only 18 % of GDP , compared with 30 % in 1990 , the drought will in fact cause relatively little damage to India 's economy ; it should still grow by over 5 % this year .
Lavish spending on rural welfare since 2004 , when the Congress party won power in Delhi , will also help .
Almost 30 m people have benefited from the government 's chief public - works project , the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ( NREGS ) .
Yet the drought underlines a grim truth .
India 's extremes of hydrology , poverty and population present vast difficulties for water management which it has never mastered .
And they are growing .
Increasingly frequent droughts may be a sign of this — if , as some think , climate change is to blame .
It will accentuate India 's problems , with the monsoon rains , which supply over 50 % of much of India 's annual precipitation in just 15 days , predicted to become even more contracted and unpredictable .
At the same time , the rapid melting of Himalayan glaciers promises to deprive the great rivers of the Indian sub - continent , the Indus , Ganges and Brahmaputra , of their summertime source .
This threatens a triple whammy : of longer dry seasons , in which these rivers do not flow , and more violent wet seasons .
That would mean more bad news for flood - prone eastern India , including Bihar , where over 3 m were displaced last year when the Kosi river burst a crumbling embankment .
India 's water future was worrying even without climate change .
Despite daunting seasonal and regional variations , it should have ample water for agricultural , industrial and household use .
But most of it falls , in a remarkably short time , in the wrong places .
India 's vast task is therefore to trap and store enough water ; to channel it to where it is most needed ; and , above all , to use it there as efficiently as possible .
And on all three counts , India fares badly .
Without huge improvements , according to a decade - old official estimate , by 2050 , when its population will be a shade under 1.7 billion , India will run short of water .
There are already signs of the conflict this would cause .
Having bickered for decades over their rights to the Krishna river , AP and upstream Maharashtra and Karnataka are now furiously building dams and diversions that the river might not support even in flood .
In Orissa 30,000 farmers — for whom over 80 % of India 's water is reserved — laid siege to a reservoir in 2007 to try to stop factories using its waters .
The desert state of Rajasthan has seen similar protests against the diversion of water to its growing cities .
In one , five farmers were shot dead by police .
The government is worried : “ 2050 is a very frightening sort of a picture , ” says A.K. Bajaj , chairman of India 's central water commission , which provides technical support to the state governments who control India 's water .
Its main solution is to build more large dams ( 390 are under construction ) , and river diversions , including a long - mooted extravaganza of 30 linkages which would unite most of India 's river basins .
Indeed , India needs more water storage : it has 200 cubic metres per person , compared with 1,000 cubic metres in China .
But given the decrepitude of much of its existing water infrastructure , and its profligate ways with water , its more urgent priorities are to repair and reform .
Worshipping old gods
Famine - prone for most of its history , India 's attachment to dams is understandable .
Its ability to feed itself owes much to a splurge on big dams and canal projects in the 1950s - 70s — for example , the colossal Bhakra dam in Himachal Pradesh , completed in 1963 and described by the then prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru , as a “ new temple ” of India .
The Bhakra brought 7 m hectares of north - west India , chiefly Punjab and Haryana , under irrigation .
This prepared the way for the Green Revolution of the 1960s , when the introduction of new seeds and chemical fertilisers hugely boosted farm yields in those states and in the coastal region of AP — which was irrigated in the 19th century by a British engineer , Sir Arthur Cotton , who is still worshipped there as a god .
But , the world over , without expensive maintenance to prevent siltation in reservoirs and leakage from canals , grand dams and irrigation schemes tend to be as inefficient as they are environmentally destructive .
And India 's corrupt , underfunded and overmanned state irrigation departments — UP's , for example , employs over 100,000 people — often provide no maintenance at all .
As a result , each year India is estimated to lose the equivalent of two - thirds of the new storage it builds to siltation .
Bad planning , often as a result of inter - state rivalries , causes more waste .
Thus , between 1992 and 2004 India built 200 large and medium - sized irrigation projects — and the area irrigated by such schemes shrank by 3.2 m hectares .
The village of Veeralapalam offers a snapshot of this , and of the losers in a political economy where water is the main currency .
From the early 1960s it received occasional water in a small canal , at the tail - end of a system off the Krishna river .
But this has been dry since 1985 because of leakage up - channel and , the Lambadi farmers say , illegal tapping by members of a more favoured community .
The canal was re-dug last year under the NREGS , but seems unlikely to get any water .
A few miles up - channel in Ulisaipalam , a village dominated by high - caste Hindus , there is water , but more problems .
Wading shin -deep , P. Venkat Reddy transplants dark green paddy into his two acres of irrigated , but undrained , land .
When there is water in the canal , for around four months each year , it is waterlogged , fit only for paddy .
But in recent years the canal has held insufficient water for a full paddy crop — forcing Mr Reddy to supplement it with groundwater .
He pumps this , with electricity given free to farmers in AP , from a borehole drilled 45 metres into his land .
Since the 1970s , when affordable water pumps became available and electricity reached many more places , millions have done the same .
India is the world 's biggest user of groundwater , with some 20 m bore - holes providing water for over 60 % of its irrigated area .
Being entirely in farmers ' hands , this is up to three times more productive than canal irrigation .
In 2002 , by a conservative estimate , it was worth $ 8 billion a year to the Indian economy — more than four times what the central and state governments spend on irrigation schemes .
Groundwater irrigation has transformed the lives of millions .
It has also rectified problems , of water - logging and salination , caused by canals .
But in many places , including productive Punjab and Haryana , whose rather well - off farmers also get free or cut - price electricity , the rate of groundwater extraction is unsustainable .
Nearly a third of India 's groundwater blocks were defined in 2004 as “ critical , semi- critical or over - exploited ” .
The World Bank reckons that 15 % of India 's food is produced by “ mining ” — or unrenewable extraction of — groundwater , including in 18 of Punjab 's 20 districts .
Satellite maps released by America 's NASA last month showed that north - western India 's aquifers had fallen by a foot a year between 2002 and 2008 : a loss of 109 cubic km ( 26 cubic miles ) of water , or three times the volume of America 's biggest man-made reservoir .
This is storing up trouble .
As bore - holes run dry , as those over the hardrock aquifers of southern - central India do on a monthly basis , many poor people may be deprived of safe drinking water .
Currently , 220 m Indians lack this .
Not all India 's groundwater is potable anyway ; in places , it is getting seriously polluted .
And India 's groundwater reserves will be especially missed when climate change makes surface - water sources even more sporadic .
Their depletion will accentuate this , with springs , which could have provided a trickle of run-off during the extended dry seasons , increasingly failing .
Pump and be damned
Some excuse this resolute destruction by saying that India 's farmers do not understand groundwater .
But they know when it is running out , as an impromptu conclave in the Punjabi village of Lubana Teku showed .
“ Punjab will become a desert , like Rajasthan , ” said Jarnail Singh , a stately , orange - turbaned grower of rice .
When Mr Singh began pumping groundwater in 1973 , turning his 14 acres from cotton to paddy , it took a three - horsepower engine to bring it up from 1.5 metres .
Now the groundwater is 20 metres down , and he requires a 15 - horsepower pump to sluice his green paddy - fields .
“ We know the water is going , ” said Mr Singh .
“ But we 're not going to change our ways unless the government makes us . ”
Rather , it encourages him to keep pumping .
Besides paying nothing for his water or electricity — seven hours of it a day —
Mr Singh knows the government will buy all the rice he can grow , at a pre-ordained “ minimum support price ” .
Set against this package , Punjab 's efforts to conserve its groundwater , mainly by telling farmers not to transplant paddy before the monsoon rains , are rather puny .
State governments know that this is madness .
Over a quarter of India 's electricity is given free or cut - price to farmers .
As a result , the state power utilities are bust .
Understandably , however , politicians balk at reform .
Two chief ministers recently tried charging farmers for electricity , in AP and Madhya Pradesh , and were kicked out of office .
The Congress party chief minister of Haryana , which is going to the polls in October , will not make that mistake .
He is demanding $ 200 m from India 's Congress - led central government as a contribution to Haryana 's agricultural - power subsidy .
The subsidy raj is not confined to farmers .
Many municipal governments price water well below cost , and therefore struggle to supply it .
Delhi , where the water board 's revenues cover only 40 % of its operating costs , should have plenty of water .
It draws 220 litres per citizen , more than Paris .
But half of it disappears from leaky pipes .
To mend these , workmen , having no underground maps , must dig up and sift through a tangled mass of pipes and cables , like untrained surgeons manhandling intestines .
Predictably , for a couple of hundred rupees a month , posh south Delhi gets the best water supply .
When its taps run dry , the locals , including India 's political and bureaucratic elite , pump groundwater — often illegally .
By one estimate , bore - holes provide 40 % of the capital 's water ; and south Delhi 's groundwater , which underlies the offices of India 's Central Groundwater Authority , is being depleted by up to three metres a year .
But tube - wells , which cost around $ 600 , are no option for Delhi 's poor , including 4 m slum - dwellers .
To augment their supply they must buy water , of dubious quality and at extortionate prices , from a well - connected water mafia .
In fiery June residents of Sangam Vihar , a poor suburb of south Delhi , rioted after getting no water for two weeks .
In normal times , according to Vishnu Sharma , a 36 - year - old resident , he and his family receive , at unpredictable times , around an hour and a half of muddy piped water each week .
They pay $ 2 for this , he said — and another $ 20 , or a quarter of his factory wage , to private water - sellers in cahoots with corrupt water - board officials .
“ So why bother complaining ? ” he said angrily .
EPA
An increasingly precious load
Who could deny that rich Delhiites must pay more for water , so the city 's poor can get more ?
The rich , of course .
In 2005 a World Bank - sponsored effort to reform the water board was shot down by local NGOs .
As well as worrying , reasonably , about the bidding process for contracts , they were outraged to discover that , in return for round - the - clock clean water , the targeted households would be charged about $ 20 a month — or what Mr Sharma pays his local water don .
Pay more , use less
To make farmers use less water , they must pay , or pay more , for electricity .
The longer state governments wait to institute this , the higher the cost of pumping groundwater will go — and the more difficult reform becomes .
Nor is pricing alone a panacea .
According to a World Bank study , farmers are already paying rather a lot for subsidised but poor - quality electricity .
In Haryana , farmers with electricity spent 25 % of their incomes on it and on repairing burnt - out pump - engines ; those without electricity spent 31 % of their incomes on diesel .
To charge farmers more for electricity , utilities will have to improve supply .
And farmers must learn to use water more efficiently .
Selling groundwater to cities , as farmers outside Chennai have done , is one possible answer .
Another , to keep up India 's food production , is to spread the use of modern seeds and other technologies — such as an improved system of paddy cultivation that uses half as much water and has boosted yields in Tamil Nadu and AP .
Ideally , commercial cultivation of thirsty sugar - cane and paddy should also be shifted eastwards , to the poor and sodden parts of Bihar and West Bengal .
For now , alas , the political trade - offs and mammoth infrastructure development this would require make it seem unimaginable .
Farmers on arid , rain - fed land need help of other sorts .
Even if they had electricity — which 400 m Indians do not — they could hardly pay for it .
Nor would it be altogether desirable for them to pump groundwater unless they could be enjoined to sow appropriate crops , such as pulses and millet , and water them wisely .
In dry areas , where profligate water - use by one farmer can make many wells run dry , farmers have been persuaded to share information on rainfall , groundwater levels and cropping , and so collectively regulate themselves .
One attempt at this in central AP involves 25,000 farmers .
And India must have more dams .
These need not be large ; indeed , given problems of maintenance and resettlement , it would be better if they were not .
For these and other reasons , most experts also seem to want the ambitious river - basin - linkage idea to be scrapped .
In most places , urban and rural , India 's state governments would do better to concentrate on building and restoring millions of small water storages , tanks and mini-reservoirs , and put local governments in charge of them .
There is no simple solution to India 's complicated water crisis .
But if prayers are necessary , let them be offered in small shrines , not vast concrete temples .
This is an emergency guide to iPhone software development , i.e. a guide for competent developers who have n’t written code for the iPhone platform before , and just want to get started right now .
If you ’re inexperienced in application development , this is n’t for you ; try a good book instead .
If , however , you ’re confident of your ability to read documentation , do your research , and apply your existing skills to a new language , IDE , SDK and platform without the need for a preface , introduction and lecture on guiding principles , you ’ve come to the right place .
No filler , no philosophy , and no bullshit - because you ’re a professional , and you do n’t have time for it .
The clock is ticking , so let ’s go .
For easy and speedy assimilation , this guide consists of simple lists of facts and tips as bullet points , split into sensible sections .
Have a quick read through them , and then start coding .
Hardware
You have to use a Mac to develop iPhone apps .
Specifically , you need an Intel Mac - iPhone development is n't supported on PowerPC Macs .
There are hacks to make it work ( at time of writing ) , but if you 're serious about it you should probably just get an Intel Mac .
Does n't have to be brand new ; all new Macs have been Intel - based for years now .
You 'll need the iPhone SDK , which is free from Apple when you sign up as an iPhone Developer .
It 's obviously handy if you have an iPhone or iPod touch too , though you can certainly get started without one ( the SDK includes a Simulator you can run your code in ) .
Xcode ( your IDE ) has an Eclipse - like all - in - one UI by default ( though you can split it all out into separate windows if you like ) , but its documentation browser is a separate window .
Both those primary windows work best when large .
You 'll also need to at least occasionally be using Interface Builder for your GUIs , and you 'll be running the iPhone Simulator often .
Given all these demands on your screen - space , you may find it helpful to have a big monitor , or even two side - by - side .
Your Mac will automatically extend your desktop onto multiple monitors as soon as you connect another one .
Development Environment
You have to use Xcode as your IDE .
You can use an external text - editor of your choice alongside it if you like .
Xcode has built - in help and API listings .
Look in the Help menu , and choose Documentation .
It also has a Research Assistant feature which shows info about whatever class - name or type your text insertion - point is in or near ( including links to Apple sample code which uses that method / class / etc ) .
That 's in the Help menu too .
Option / Alt - doubleclick on a class or method to go to the relevant documentation .
Apple / Command - doubleclick on a class or method to go to the place where it 's defined .
Press the Esc key to autocomplete .
You 'll get a popup list of options if necessary .
There 's a graphical debugger ( a UI on gdb ) , and a tool called Instruments which lets you inspect just about everything from file access to memory usage to performance .
Xcode provides native GUI support for Subversion , CVS and Perforce .
You 're also free to use any SCM system you like , via the command line .
Xcode wo n't cause any damage to your SCM system 's special / hidden files .
Programming language
You have to use the Objective - C language .
It 's just C , with some extra stuff ( literally ; it 's C with a fancy preprocessor and runtime ) .
Objective - C syntax looks weird , but it 's only visually different .
receiver .
doThing ( foo , bar , baz ) in Java would be something like [ receiver doThingWithFoo : foo and Bar:bar and Baz:baz ] in ObjC .
in Java would be something like in ObjC .
Objective - C just splits the method - name into pieces and intersperses those pieces with the actual arguments , so it reads like a sentence .
It 's verbose , but it 's more explanatory .
Accept it and move on ; you have auto - complete to help with the typing .
Because it 's based on C , object types are n't automatic pointers like they are in Java ; you have to explicitly create them as pointers .
This is usually just as simple as putting an asterisk between the class name and the variable name when you declare an object .
As you might expect , that breezy glossing - over hides some complexity , and causes me some pain because you really should learn how it actually works .
There 's plenty of tutorial material online about pointer syntax in C .
Try reading it sometime .
Primitives like int etc behave as you 'd expect , because it 's just C .
If you want to use dot-notation to access instance variables , you can .
You just need to declare a " property " for that instance variable first .
Read the docs on properties .
Accessing properties is actually just calling appropriate automatically - generated getter and setter methods on the object ( literally ) .
You can override those methods if you want to ; it 'll work as you expect .
A few specific things you 'll want to know about :
You can call the superclass 's implementation via super .
The equivalent to Java 's this is pretty much self .
You can access the selector ( method name ) for the current method with _cmd .
Those last two are implicit parameters to every method ; it 's not magic .
Strings .
About 99.99999 % of the time you 'll want NSString objects instead of raw C strings .
Objective - C has a nice feature whereby you just put an @ symbol before a string to make it an NSString , like @ " this " .
Just do that by default , every time ; it 's pretty much always what the APIs will expect .
Application Frameworks
There are two main frameworks you 'll be using : UIKit and Foundation .
These are n't " Cocoa " ( that 's the Mac desktop development equivalent , consisting of AppKit and Foundation ) , but they 're extremely closely related and in many cases are near - duplicates .
If you 're looking up documentation online , be sure you 're looking at docs for the iPhone version of Foundation , and not the Cocoa ( Mac ) version .
Classes to do with actual visual controls etc ( including windows , views , buttons , tables , etc ) begin with " UI " , and have names like " UIButton " or " UIWindow " .
A lot of the non-visual stuff is in classes beginning with " NS " , including object types like NSString , NSNumber , NSArray , NSDictionary ( a hashmap class ) and so forth .
There are also some other frameworks , including a fair few C - based ones .
There 's a convention whereby data - structures are immutable ( not editable ) by default .
In almost every case , if you want an editable version of that same type then it has a mutable subclass , whose name will be of the form " NSMutableArray " , " NSMutableDictionary " and so forth .
You can often call mutableCopy on the immutable version to get a mutable one with the same contents .
Pay attention to memory - management rules ( mentioned below ) when you do that .
Saving and Loading
For saving preferences or settings , look at NSUserDefaults .
For saving files , look at NSDictionary 's ability to read and write XML property - lists ( for saving basic data - structures containing standard object types ) , or at NSData ( for more complex and / or custom objects ) .
Memory management
You have to manage your memory manually .
There 's no garbage collector .
There are simple rules and conventions ; follow them at all times , and without exception .
This is one area where you just have to read the docs .
There 's also a good tutorial here .
Do n't make it harder than it actually is .
You can get the hang of this in an afternoon .
GUI programming
There 's a really nice GUI builder called Interface Builder , included with Xcode .
When people mention " IB " , it 's Interface Builder they mean .
You can also make your GUI programmatically if you want , or mix both techniques .
Neither method is " preferred " ; IB is a tool that you can use if it helps you .
The files which Interface Builder generates are called " nibs " .
The actual file - extension for nibs is often " xib " , but can be " nib " too .
" xib " is used for iPhone stuff ; it 's a newer format than nib .
Interface Builder will just do the right thing .
Code can be connected to IB - created GUI via " outlets " : instance - variables with IBOutlet before their type , on classes which you connect in IB .
Read the docs on it .
IB - created GUI can be connected to code via " actions " : methods which take one parameter of type id , and return the type IBAction , on classes which you connect in IB .
Read the docs on it .
To make the connections you need to have an instance of the appropriate class in the nib document .
If it does n't exist , drag a yellow Object cube from the Library , then use the Inspector to change its class to the correct one .
That 's enough to create an actual instance of the class at runtime .
You make connections by right - click - dragging in Interface Builder .
You can also just right - click to see and modify a list of all connections for an object .
UI in a nib file is n't like a specification or template , and it is n't code - generation either ; it 's actual instances of objects , serialized into a file for later reloading .
These are real , actual objects .
There 's zero magic in Interface Builder .
The first / main nib is loaded by the UIApplication class , and its name is read from a property - list file in your project ; you can see it and take a look .
That 's how the main nib gets loaded ; it 's just a handy default behaviour .
You can load as many other nibs as you like .
Debugging
Xcode has a GUI for gdb , the well - known C ( etc ) debugger .
For cowboy debugging , use the NSLog ( ) function ; it 's a bit like System.out .
println in Java .
It takes an NSString , so it would look like this : NSLog ( @" Hello World ! " ) ;
function ; it 's a bit like in Java .
It takes an NSString , so it would look like this :
You can put printf - style formatting characters into it , and add the relevant variables after the string just like you 'd expect .
The syntax is identical to printf : NSLog ( @" You are %d years old " , age ) ;
You can also output arbitrary object types using the %@ formatting character .
Many hierarchical datastructures like NSArray and NSDictionary will be pretty - printed automatically .

Many hierarchical datastructures like NSArray and NSDictionary will be pretty - printed automatically .
The equivalent of Java 's String toString ( ) method is -( NSString *) description .
Many of UIKit and Foundation 's classes provide helpful default implementations of this .
The root class ' implementation will simply print the object 's class - name and address in memory .

The root class ' implementation will simply print the object 's class - name and address in memory .
The console output is within Xcode itself , either in a separate window or in a split pane ( depending on how you 've got Xcode set up ) .
Using the iPhone Simulator
The Simulator is included with the iPhone SDK .
It is NOT cycle - accurate .
Not even remotely .
Your animations will be much faster in the Simulator than on the device , so do n't ever judge performance from the Simulator .
It does n't have all the apps / facilities of an actual iPhone .
For example , it does n't simulate things like the accelerometer .
Do n't try to submit apps to the App Store that you have n't tested on actual devices .
Your Mac 's keyboard works for text - entry in the simulator .
Your mouse works for clicking and dragging .
You can simulate two - finger input by holding down the Option / Alt key .
The Simulator has menu-commands to rotate the device to landscape and back to portrait , and also to simulate a memory - warning so you can respond to that situation ( no garbage collector , remember ? )
Deploying to a device
You have to have a certificate in order to sign your code to make it work on a device .
This is true for development as well as for actually deploying on the App Store .
You have to pay a yearly fee ( $ 99 ) to get the ability to create such a certificate .
Getting onto the App Store
If you have n't yet signed up as a paid iPhone Developer to get a certificate , start now .
You can't just do it at the last minute , once your app is ready - it takes time .
You 'll have to provide various pieces of information , and enter into a distribution contract with Apple .
Apple will take 30 % of your profits , and will meet all distribution costs .
Give yourself at least several days to do all this .
Apple has to approve your app before it goes onto the App Store .
This can take any amount of time ; right now it 's somewhere around 1 - 2 weeks .
You can't speed this process up ; you just need to wait .
This is an inherently and unavoidably flexible part of your deadline , so do n't over - promise .
This approval process happens even when you submit an update to an existing app , every time .
Your app will be run by an actual human .
If your app is rejected , you 'll almost always be told why .
You can make suitable changes and re-submit it .
Getting more help
When you need help , do what you ’d do on your own platform :
Read the official docs .
There are Getting Started guides as well as raw API documentation ; it 's all there when you log into the iPhone Developer site .
Look at the sample code provided by Apple .
Search the official forums , and post a question if necessary .
Also try third - party forums .
Use Google ; someone might have blogged about this .
Buy a book ; there are a few out there now .
Use Amazon reviews to see what 's worth buying .
And apply the usual common - sense principles when seeking help :
Do n't ask your questions here ; this is a blog , not a support forum .
Likewise , do n't email me your questions .
Do your research before asking anything .
Be prepared to answer the question " what have you tried ? "
Be precise .
If you 're coming from another platform , say so and mention which one - you might be using terminology from your platform which is slightly different in the iPhone development world .
If you tell us where you 're from , we 'll figure it out .
Be concise ( but not at the expense of precision ) .
Be polite and respectful ; it costs nothing , and you 'll get more and better answers .
Final Note
When learning a new development platform , you ’ll inevitably encounter some frustrations along the way .
Try to remember that these two statements are almost always true :
It 's probably not badly designed , it 's just temporarily unfamiliar .
You 're probably not stupid , you 're just temporarily inexperienced .
Keep those in mind .
Now go get started .

Glenn Beck 's Apology to Libertarians
Some preliminaries
If you 've been following this blog recently , you must have noticed that many of the posts in these past few weeks are about using Python to communicate via the serial port .
I specifically decided to write them as separate posts and not as part of a series , because I think that each post is interesting in itself .
But just in case you got confused , here 's the logical order : Setting up Python to work with the serial port A “ live ” data monitor with Python , PyQt and PySerial Framing in serial communications
In this post I want to present some useful Python code to implement the ideas of ( 3 ) .
Additionally , I 'll introduce a very useful library for constructing frames from various forms of data .
Code
The code for this post is available here .
It contains the modules discussed , the sample code shown and even some unit tests .
Arrays of data in Python
When we think about a sequence of bytes in Python , two approaches come to mind : an array of integers in the range 0 - 255 , or a ' packed ' string .
Here 's some Python terminal action that displays the difference : >>> arr = [ 0 x45 , 0 xAB , 0 xC3 , 0 x16 ] >>> arr [ 69 , 171 , 195 , 22 ] >>> str = ' \x45\xAB\xC3\x16 ' >>> str ' E\xab\xc3\x16 ' >>> '' . join ( chr ( b ) for b in arr ) ' E\xab\xc3\x16 ' >>> [ ord ( b ) for b in str ] [ 69 , 171 , 195 , 22 ]
This shows that the two formats are essentially interchangeable , and also that it 's very easy to convert between the two .
The format we 're going to use is the packed string , because this is what the pyserial module uses to send and receive data .
Serializing data
So , to send data over the serial port we first have to turn it into a packed string - this is called serialization .
Python has a couple of built - in ways to do that - with the array and struct modules .
However , both are suitable for fairly simple and unsophisticated data .
To serialize arbitrarily sophisticated data formats , it 's much better to use the powerful and flexible construct library .
Here 's a sample message format defined with construct ( from sampleformat.py in this article 's code archive ) : from construct import * message_crc = Struct ( ' message_crc ' , ULInt32 ( ' crc ' ) ) message_format = Struct ( ' message_format ' , ULInt16 ( ' msg_id ' ) , ULInt16 ( ' dest_addr ' ) , Enum ( Byte ( ' command_type ' ) , RESTART = 0 x40 , RESTART_ACK = 0 x80 , SIGNAL = 0 x22 , _default_ = Pass ) , BitStruct ( ' flags ' , Flag ( ' on ' ) , BitField ( ' status ' , 3 ) , Flag ( ' cache ' ) , Padding ( 3 ) ) , Byte ( ' datalen ' ) , Array ( lambda ctx : ctx [ ' datalen ' ] , Byte ( ' data ' ) ) , Embed ( message_crc ) )
It shows off a few interesting features of construct : Explicit specification of endianness for multi- byte fields
Enumerations
Support for byte - oriented and bit-oriented fields
Arrays of data with specified length
Embedded structs
The message should look roughly familiar for anyone designing and using binary protocols .
It 's very typical of how real formats look - some ID fields , flags , data , CRC .
Here 's how this message format can be used to pack and unpack a message : >>> from sampleformat import message_format >>> from construct import * >>> raw = message_format.build( Container ( ... msg_id= 0 x1234 , ... dest_addr= 0 xacba , ... command_type= ' RESTART ' , ... flags=Container ( on= 1 , cache= 0 , status= 4 ) , ... datalen= 4 , ... data= [ 0 x1 , 0 xff , 0 xff , 0 xdd ] , ... crc= 0 x12345678 ) ) >>> raw.encode ( ' hex ' ) ' 3412baac40c00401ffffdd78563412 ' >>> c = message_format.parse( raw ) >>> print c Container : msg_id = 4660 dest_addr = 44218 command_type = ' RESTART ' flags = Container : on =
True status = 4 cache = False datalen = 4 data = [ 1 255 255 221 ] crc = 305419896
A few things to note here : message_format is an object with two useful methods : build for packing data into a string , and parse for unpacking it back from a string .
is an object with two useful methods : for packing data into a string , and for unpacking it back from a string .
Container is a class taken from construct .
It 's just a simple data container holding its data items in attributes .
Any compatible object would do here ( duck typing ! ) - for example a namedtuple .
I chose Container because it comes with construct anyway and is simple and useful .

I chose because it comes with anyway and is simple and useful .
raw is a packed string .
The encode string method is used here to show the hex values of the string 's bytes .
Framing ( protocol wrapping and unwrapping ) protocolwrapper.py in the code archive is a faithful Python implementation of the Framing in serial communications article .
Not much more to say about it here - the code is commented and should be simple to understand if you 're familiar with the theory .

In what was possibly the most surreal , horrific , and unimaginable thing I have ever witnessed in my life , 1200 Riot Police and Military Personal rabidly attacked a group of well under 300 American citizens , many of them just students that were unaware there was even a protest going on .
They then expanded their perimeter and shut large areas of Oakland down .
This is how my last experience at the G20 in Pittsburgh went down , out of control authorities mercilessly attacking an unarmed crowd with batons , tear gas , pepper spray , sound weapons , and rubber bullets .
Around 10 pm on Friday night , long after the vast majority of dignitaries and protesters had left , it became evident that the outrageous show of force by the Military and Police was not enough to stave off their thirst for blood .

I bet you the current issue of Cosmopolitan has an article whose title begins with a number .
" 7 Things He Wo n't Tell
You about Sex , " or something like that .
Some popular magazines feature articles of this type on the cover of every issue .
That can't be happening by accident .
Editors must know they attract readers .
Why do readers like the list of n things so much ?
Mainly because it 's easier to read than a regular article . [ 1 ]
Structurally , the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay .
An essay can go anywhere the writer wants .
In a list of n things the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of points of roughly equal importance , and he tells the reader explicitly what they are .
Some of the work of reading an article is understanding its structure — figuring out what in high school we'd have called its " outline . "
Not explicitly , of course , but someone who really understands an article probably has something in his brain afterward that corresponds to such an outline .
In a list of n things , this work is done for you .
Its structure is an exoskeleton .
As well as being explicit , the structure is guaranteed to be of the simplest possible type : a few main points with few to no subordinate ones , and no particular connection between them .
Because the main points are unconnected , the list of n things is random access .
There 's no thread of reasoning you have to follow .
You could read the list in any order .
And because the points are independent of one another , they work like watertight compartments in an unsinkable ship .
If you get bored with , or can't understand , or do n't agree with one point , you do n't have to give up on the article .
You can just abandon that one and skip to the next .
A list of n things is parallel and therefore fault tolerant .
There are times when this format is what a writer wants .
One , obviously , is when what you have to say actually is a list of n things .
I once wrote an essay about the mistakes that kill startups , and a few people made fun of me for writing something whose title began with a number .
But in that case I really was trying to make a complete catalog of a number of independent things .
In fact , one of the questions I was trying to answer was how many there were .
There are other less legitimate reasons for using this format .
For example , I use it when I get close to a deadline .
If I have to give a talk and I have n't started it a few days beforehand , I 'll sometimes play it safe and make the talk a list of n things .
The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers .
When you 're writing a real essay , there 's always a chance you 'll hit a dead end .
A real essay is a train of thought , and some trains of thought just peter out .
That 's an alarming possibility when you have to give a talk in a few days .
What if you run out of ideas ?
The compartmentalized structure of the list of n things protects the writer from his own stupidity in much the same way it protects the reader .
If you run out of ideas on one point , no problem : it wo n't kill the essay .
You can take out the whole point if you need to , and the essay will still survive .
Writing a list of n things is so relaxing .
You think of n/2 of them in the first 5 minutes .
So bang , there 's the structure , and you just have to fill it in .
As you think of more points , you just add them to the end .
Maybe you take out or rearrange or combine a few , but at every stage you have a valid ( though initially low - res ) list of n things .
It 's like the sort of programming where you write a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it , but at every point have working code — or the style of painting where you begin with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour , then spend a week cranking up the resolution .
Because the list of n things is easier for writers too , it 's not always a damning sign when readers prefer it .
It 's not necessarily evidence readers are lazy ; it could also mean they do n't have much confidence in the writer .
The list of n things is in that respect the cheeseburger of essay forms .
If you 're eating at a restaurant you suspect is bad , your best bet is to order the cheeseburger .
Even a bad cook can make a decent cheeseburger .
And there are pretty strict conventions about what a cheeseburger should look like .
You can assume the cook is n't going to try something weird and artistic .
The list of n things similarly limits the damage that can be done by a bad writer .
You know it 's going to be about whatever the title says , and the format prevents the writer from indulging in any flights of fancy .
Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form , it should be a good one for beginning writers .
And in fact it is what most beginning writers are taught .
The classic 5 paragraph essay is really a list of n things for n = 3 .
But the students writing them do n't realize they 're using the same structure as the articles they read in Cosmopolitan .
They 're not allowed to include the numbers , and they 're expected to spackle over the gaps with gratuitous transitions ( " Furthermore ... " ) and cap the thing at either end with introductory and concluding paragraphs so it will look superficially like a real essay . [ 2 ]
It seems a fine plan to start students off with the list of n things .
It 's the easiest form .
But if we 're going to do that , why not do it openly ?
Let them write lists of n things like the pros , with numbers and no transitions or " conclusion . "
There is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format : when you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the list is an exhaustive one .
I.e. if you write an article that purports to be about the 7 secrets of success .
That kind of title is the same sort of reflexive challenge as a whodunit .
You have to at least look at the article to check whether they 're the same 7 you 'd list .
Are you overlooking one of the secrets of success ?
Better check .
It 's fine to put " The " before the number if you really believe you 've made an exhaustive list .
But evidence suggests most things with titles like this are linkbait .
The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there 's so little room for new thought .
The main point of essay writing , when done right , is the new ideas you have while doing it .
A real essay , as the name implies , is dynamic : you do n't know what you 're going to write when you start .
It will be about whatever you discover in the course of writing it .
This can only happen in a very limited way in a list of n things .
You make the title first , and that 's what it 's going to be about .
You can't have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in the watertight compartments you set up initially .
And your brain seems to know this : because you do n't have room for new ideas , you do n't have them .
Another advantage of admitting to beginning writers that the 5 paragraph essay is really a list of n things is that we can warn them about this .
It only lets you experience the defining characteristic of essay writing on a small scale : in thoughts of a sentence or two .
And it 's particularly dangerous that the 5 paragraph essay buries the list of n things within something that looks like a more sophisticated type of essay .
If you do n't know you 're using this form , you do n't know you need to escape it .
Notes
[ 1 ] Articles of this type are also startlingly popular on Delicious , but I think that 's because delicious / popular is driven by bookmarking , not because Delicious users are stupid .
Delicious users are collectors , and a list of n things seems particularly collectible because it's a collection itself .
[ 2 ] Most " word problems " in school math textbooks are similarly misleading .
They look superficially like the application of math to real problems , but they 're not .
So if anything they reinforce the impression that math is merely a complicated but pointless collection of stuff to be memorized .

Woman , intruder shot during home invasion attempt
Home invasion
An attempted home invasion late Tuesday in North Las Vegas resulted in an exchange of gunfire and a woman and an intruder being shot .
Police said someone tried to enter a home shortly before midnight in the 4100 block of Karma Drive , between West Craig and Alexander roads , when the homeowner opened fire .
The intruder fired back and injured the woman , authorities said .
Officers were dispatched to the home at 11:52 p.m. and upon arrival found a 31 - year - old North Las Vegas resident with gunshot wounds to her leg .
The injured woman said she had exchanged gunfire with unidentified men who had entered her home and threatened to shoot her 14 - year - old son .
The boy was n’t injured .
Police found a blood trail that left the residence and ended in the street in front of the house .
Sgt. Tim Bedwell of the North Las Vegas Police Department said he is n't sure who fired first .
He said the woman suffered a minor non-life threatening gunshot wound and was transported to University Medical Center .
At the hospital , officers were notified a male gunshot victim had recently arrived to be treated who matched the description of one of the suspects .
His injuries are described as serious but non-life threatening .
Authorities said they do not know if the woman knew the intruder .
Bedwell said an arrest has n’t been made in the case .

Adam Levinson was coy about his own payout A Wall Street trader thought to have received the biggest bonus of all time has defended industry payouts .
Adam Levinson runs two hedge funds at Fortress Investments .
It was so keen to keep hold of him that they reportedly gave him a $ 300 m slice of the company .
" In this business our ... mission is to generate returns to investors .
If we do n't succeed in that task , we do n't get paid , " he told BBC World Service .
" If we do , we do , " he said at his office in Midtown Manhattan .
He had n't spoken to the media at all since his " mega - bonus " - as Britain 's Mirror newspaper described it - made the news last August .
However , he refused to be drawn on his personal pay packet .
' Biggest payday '
He made it clear to us that whilst he was happy to answer questions about remuneration in general , he did n't want to talk about what some have called " the biggest payday in history " .
The act of regulation does n't scare me or bother me
Adam Levinson
What he did say though , is that in exchange for a share in the company , he gave up some of his entitlement to proceeds from his funds ' profits .
Mr Levinson is prepared to concede that pay structures may have played a role in the excessive risk taking by banks : " Investment banks are regulated institutions , which posed systemic risks .
The risk - taking that generated excessive gains and then resulted in extraordinary losses may have been the result of the compensation structure . "
" Then again it might not be terribly important .
Either way , it 's probably worth looking at " .
He was also keen to emphasise what he viewed as the difference between running a hedge fund , focused solely on making often short term investments with its own capital , and the broader activities of investment banks .
" Those institutions are engaged in a series of services from asset management to sales and trading .
There are so many different elements that there can be conflicts . "
Greater regulation Mr Levinson has been in the hedge fund business since 2002 - before that he worked as a trader for Goldman Sachs in several of the world 's big financial centres .
He witnessed a big expansion in the size and influence of hedge funds for several years before the financial crisis .
" This industry went through a phase of extraordinarily high growth .
Recently it 's become smaller and far more streamlined , versus certain bloated characteristics that it had before . "
He agrees with a push to subject the hedge fund industry to greater scrutiny in the post - crisis world , with efforts likely to be discussed once again at the forthcoming G20 summit in Pittsburgh .
" The act of regulation does n't scare me or bother me .
In fact I think the industry should be regulated and we 've been preparing for regulation for years .
It 's actually a necessary agreement in restoring confidence " .
Despite being one of the wealthiest men in finance , he thinks the gap between rich and poor in American society may have become too wide in the last three decades - and believes that that may partly be contributing to the current political backlash .
And he 's a supporter of inheritance tax .
" It 's very good for society and incentivises production rather than protecting the interests of certain families .
If you 're going to tax somebody , then tax inheritance .
I 'm not sure my kids deserve my money , or at least deserve it without a healthy government tax .
The US tax collectors - the Internal Revenue Service - must be rubbing their hands in glee at the thought .

Initial reports of shots being fired during a Coast Guard exercise near the route of President Obama ’s motorcade Friday afternoon proved false , raising questions about how the media and the military handled the incident .
The exercise , which the Coast Guard said was routine and planned in advance , occurred on the Potomac River near the Pentagon , where Obama attended a memorial for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
CNN and Fox began reporting that the Coast Guard had opened fire on a suspicious vessel .
CNN reported on its breaking - news Twitter feed : “ Coast Guard confronts boat as Obama visits Pentagon , police scanner reports say shots fired . ”
It took the network almost 30 minutes to get clarification and report that the boats were merely in a training exercise .

“ The higher the stakes , the more careful you have to be to make sure you are correct , ” said Tom Fiedler , dean of Boston University ’s College of Communication .
“ Unfortunately , this is one of those examples of ready - fire - aim journalism . ”
The false reports of gunfire were based on radio calls in which Coast Guard personnel imitated “ bang bang ” noises , agency spokeswoman Lt. Nadine Santiago said .
Al Tompkins , a faculty member at the Poynter Institute , a journalism center , said : “ It ’s a really dangerous practice to use radio traffic as your principal source of information , because it so often turns out to be incorrect . ”
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs also rebuked CNN for not confirming its information .

“ Before we report things like this , checking would be good , ” Gibbs said .
CNN defended its reporting , saying in a statement that the network had aired the story after observing the maneuvers of Coast Guard vessels on the river and hearing a radio transmission in which someone said : “ We have expended 10 rounds . ”
Before reporting the incident , CNN said , it contacted the Coast Guard public affairs office .
A Coast Guard spokeswoman said she was unaware of any activity on the river , CNN said .
Frances Fragos Townsend , a former Homeland Security advisor to President George W. Bush and a frequent contributor to CNN , said in an interview that if the Coast Guard had not bungled its responsibility to communicate with other agencies and the public , the incident could have been avoided .

“ It ’s incumbent on the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security to inform people , " Townsend said .
The Coast Guard said it was not required to tell any federal or local agencies about the exercise in advance .
Security consultant and former Secret Service agent Ron Williams also criticized the Coast Guard ’s lack of interagency communication .
He said that though there was no danger of the Secret Service overreacting , such a breakdown was appalling , especially on Sept. 11 .

Iowa public health officials have acknowledged the existence of a blank template entitled FACILITY QUARANTINE ORDER in the case of a Novel Influenza A H1N1 pandemic .
The official press release states , however , that there is no draft or text of a “ Quarantine Order ” by the Iowa Department of Public Health .
Reported by the Iowa Independent :
“ A quarantine template created by the Iowa Department of Public Health and accessible through the Centers for Disease Control Web site should not be of great concern , according to a press release from health department officials .
‘ IDPH wants to make it clear that Iowa has not issued any isolation and quarantine orders for novel influenza A ( H1N1 ) , and has no plans to issue any this fall , ’ officials wrote in the press release .
See Health officials : Iowa quarantine document not cause for concern , Iowa Independent , Sept 1 , 2009 ‎
The IDPH suggests in this regard that the drafting of public health templates is a routine undertaking , while also confirming that “ in preparation for public health emergencies , ” … “ isolation and quarantine orders are only very rarely used in very specific situations . ” ( emphasis added ) .
The last statement of the IDPH is notoriously ambiguous :
If indeed isolation and quarantine orders are rarely used , why then was a template prepared which explicitly contemplates an ORDER pertaining to a QUARANTINE FACILITY ?
Moreover , the template was issued on May 1st , at the very outset of the H1N1 swine flu crisis in Mexico , barely two days after the WHO declared a level 5 pandemic advisory on April 29th .
Are we playing on words ?
The template already contains the essential features of a formal QUARANTINE ORDER , which suggests that quarantine procedures are contemplated within the Iowa Department of Public Health .
The result of these procedures have led to the formulation of the blank template .
The issue , therefore , is not whether a quarantine order has been activated .
The issue is
1 ) the State of Iowa has contemplated a policy of “ forced confinement ” ,
2 ) at some future date , in the next few months , the blank template entitled FACILITY QUARANTINE ORDER could be activated with a view to actually implementing the quarantine precedures .
Also of significance is the fact that this template entitled FACILITY QUARANTINE ORDER has been endorsed by the Atlanta based Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , which has published the document on its website .
The CDC is the main federal agency responsible for H1N1 pandemic preparedness in coordination with other governmental agencies including FEMA , Homeland Security , State and municipal governments , as well as in liaison with the WHO .
There are two quarantine documents on the CDC ’s website .
The first refers to HOME QUARANTINE ORDER , the second to FACILITY QUARANTINE ORDER .
( pdf )
Click to access the CDC page , which identifies both templates as CDC reference documents .
Media reports pointed to “ rumors swirling after a quarantine form was found by someone on the internet … ”
( See report on kimt.com , September 1 , 2009 )
We are not dealing with rumors .
The FACILITY QUARANTINE ORDER document posted on the website of the CDC , a federal government agency , envisages quite explicitly “ forced confinement ” in the case of the H1N1 swine flu :
“ The Department has determined that it is necessary to quarantine your movement to a specific facility to prevent further spread of this disease .
The Department has determined that quarantine in your home and other less restrictive alternatives are not acceptable because [ insert the reason home quarantine is not acceptable , the person violated a previously issued home quarantine order , the person does not have an appropriate home setting conducive to home quarantine , etc . ]
The Department is therefore ordering you to comply with the following provisions during the entire period of quarantine : 1 . Terms of confinement .
You are ordered to remain at the quarantine facility , _____________________
[ insert name and address of facility ] , from ___________ to ____________ [ insert dates of quarantine ] . ….
4 . Legal authority .
This order is issued pursuant to the legal authority contained at Iowa Code chapters 135 , 139A and 641 Iowa Administrative Code chapter 1 , a copy of which is labeled Attachment B and is attached to this order for your review .
The Department shall comply with the principles for quarantine contained in subrule 1.9 ( 3 ) of this attachment when issuing and implementing this order .
[ efoods ]
5 . Ensuring compliance .
In order to ensure that you strictly comply with this Quarantine Order the Department or persons authorized by the Department may regularly inspect the quarantine facility .
6 . Violations of order .
If you fail to comply with this Quarantine Order you may be ordered to be quarantined in a more restrictive facility .
In addition , failure to comply with this order is a simple misdemeanor for which you may be arrested , fined , and imprisoned . ”

Absent fathers can always expect to get a lot of flak .
They ’ve already been blamed for their kids ’ early sexual maturation , but now research suggests that genes , not necessarily paternal absence , may be the main factor .
Several studies have shown that in households where the biological father is missing , children reach sexual maturity , have their first sexual experience , and are more likely to become teenage parents at a younger age .
Whether that ’s down to the stress of not having a father around or the fact that a single mother cannot be as vigilant as two parents has been hotly debated .
Jane Mendle at the University of Oregon in Eugene and her colleagues suspected that genes might play a bigger role than was being acknowledged .
The age of sexual maturity and first sexual experience is highly heritable , so she and her colleagues decided to see if the relatives of kids with absent fathers showed the same tendencies .

In the family
They examined data collected for the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth .
Mendle ’s team compared 1382 offspring born to women who were genetically related : twins , sisters or cousins .
The mothers were interviewed every year between 1979 and 1994 , and every two years thereafter .
Their children were interviewed , too , once they reached 14 .
Among other questions , the children were asked about age at first intercourse .
The researchers found that the more closely genetically related the children were , the more alike they were in age of first intercourse , regardless of absent fathers .
Genetics , they argue , has far more influence on this measure than a father ’s absence .
Mendle says it is possible that the genes which might make a man more likely to abscond also contribute to early sexual maturation – but not everyone is persuaded by her conclusions .
Bruce Ellis at the University of Arizona in Tucson says the research design controls neither for environment – since the children of sisters grew up in separate households – nor for genes , since the children of sisters share only 12.5 per cent of their genes .
And Jay Belsky , a psychologist at Birkbeck , University of London , says the study does n’t take into account how genes and environment work in combination .
Mendle agrees that genetic explanations and environmental ones often work together , and adds that parents who transmit certain genetic traits can also transmit them socially .

25 Cosplay Babes of Dragon * Con 2009
The plus side to having everyone dress in elaborate costumes for an extended weekend is that it gives the fairer of the genders a reason to adopt the likenesses of their favorite fictional characters — even if that means causing them to go half naked and / or require the application of mass body paint .
I ’m not going to lie to you folks .
Dragon *Con has the most gorgeous scenery in all of Georgia and this was probably the most enjoyable thing I ’ve covered for the site in a long time .

House Unearths a 14th Forged Letter from a Lobbyist
By David A. Fahrenthold
Congressional investigators today said they have turned up a 14th forged letter that was sent to a Congressional office criticizing the House 's climate change bill , this one appearing to come from an American Legion post in Rocky Mount , Va .
The letter , sent to the office of Rep. Tom Perriello ( D - Va. ) , asks Perriello to " make sure the Waxman - Markey bill includes provisions to promote American energy independence , while protecting already cash - strapped constituents from increases in electricity prices . "
It concludes , " Thank you for listening to concerns of vets in your district . "
But the letter actually appears to have been faked by a Washington lobbying firm working for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , a Congressional spokesman said today .
The lobbying firm , Bonner and Associates , has conceded that an employee forged letters to three Congressional offices , including Perriello's , in the run-up to a vote on the climate bill .
That employee has been fired , the firm said .
" We have confirmed [ that the letter is fake ] directly with the person whose name was forged , " said Eben Burnham - Snyder , a spokesman for the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , which is investigating the forgeries .
The committee is chaired by Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) , who along with Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , sponsored the bill .
It passed the House in June , with Perriello voting yes .
Lisa Camooso Miller , a spokeswoman for the coal group , said that it had brought the letter to the committee 's attention in the first place , after an internal investigation could not confirm it was legitimate .
But she said the group is still not certain the letter is fake , even after talking to the person whose signature is on it .
" At the end of that conversation , it was unclear whether the letter was in fact false , " Miller said .
She reiterated that the coal group finds the forgeries " inexcusable . "
" This type of misrepresentation has no place in any policy debate , " Miller said .
A message left for an official with the Rocky Mount American Legion Post , Charles Santrock , was not immediately returned .

( AP ) --
No fish can escape mercury pollution .
That 's the take - home message from a federal study of mercury contamination released Wednesday that tested fish from nearly 300 streams across the country .
The toxic substance was found in every fish sampled , a finding that underscores how widespread mercury pollution has become .
But while all fish had traces of contamination , only about a quarter had mercury levels exceeding what the Environmental Protection Agency says is safe for people eating average amounts of fish .
The study by the U.S. Geological Survey is the most comprehensive look to date at mercury in the nation 's streams .
From 1998 to 2005 , scientists collected and tested more than a thousand fish , including bass , trout and catfish , from 291 streams nationwide .
" This science sends a clear message that our country must continue to confront pollution , restore our nation 's waterways , and protect the public from potential health dangers , " Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement .
Mercury consumed by eating fish can damage the nervous system and cause learning disabilities in developing fetuses and young children .
The main source of mercury to most of the streams tested , according to the researchers , is emissions from coal - fired power plants .
The mercury released from smokestacks here and abroad rains down into waterways , where natural processes convert it into methylmercury - a form that allows the toxin to wind its way up the food chain into fish .
Some of the highest levels in fish were detected in the remote blackwater streams along the coasts of the Carolinas , Georgia , Florida and Louisiana , where bacteria in surrounding forests and wetlands help in the conversion .
The second - highest concentration of mercury was detected in largemouth bass from the North Fork of the Edisto River near Fairview Crossroads , S.C .
" Unfortunately , it 's the case that almost any fish you test will have mercury now , " said Andrew Rypel , a post - doctoral researcher at the University of Mississippi who has studied mercury contamination in fish throughout the Southeast .
He said other research has shown mercury in fish from isolated areas of Alaska and Canada , and species that live in the deep ocean .
Mercury was also found in high concentrations in western streams that drain areas mined for mercury and gold .
The most contaminated sample came from smallmouth bass collected from the Carson River at Dayton , Nev. , an area tainted with mercury from gold mining .
At 58 other streams , mostly in the West , the acidic conditions created by mining could also be contributing to the mercury levels , the researchers said .
" Some ecosystems are more sensitive than others , " said Barbara Scudder , the lead USGS scientist on the study .
All but two states - Alaska and Wyoming - have issued fish - consumption advisories because of mercury contamination .
Some of the streams studied already had warnings .
" This is showing that the problem is much more widespread , " said Sonya Lunder , a senior analyst for the Environmental Working Group , which has pushed for stronger advisories on consumption of mercury - laden fish and controls on the sources of mercury pollution .
" If you are living in an area that does n't have a mercury advisory , you should use caution . "
Earlier this year , the Obama administration said it would begin crafting a new regulations to control mercury emissions from power plants after a federal appeals court threw out plans drafted by the Bush administration and favored by industry .
The Bush rule would have allowed power plants to buy and sell pollution credits , instead of requiring each plant to install equipment to reduce mercury pollution .
The EPA also has also proposed a new regulation to clamp down on emissions of mercury from cement plants .

( CNN ) -- A former " Manson family " member who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and is now terminally ill faces her 13th parole hearing on Wednesday .
Susan Atkins , shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders , has a parole hearing Wednesday .
Susan Atkins , 61 , has terminal brain cancer .
As of earlier this year , she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair , according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney , James Whitehouse .
However , despite her declining health and an impressive prison record , Whitehouse wrote , " there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society . "
The hearing will be held at the Central California Women 's Facility at Chowchilla , California , said Terry Thornton , spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
Atkins was moved to the Chowchilla facility from the California Institution for Women at Frontera last year because of her illness .
Watch Linda Kasabian describe the murders »
" Last we heard , she is expected to attend , " Thornton said Tuesday of Atkins .
The proceeding is scheduled to be held in a hearing room , but depending on Atkins ' condition , it could be held at her bedside , Thornton said .
The panel is expected to render its decision following the hearing after deliberating behind closed doors , she said .
Atkins -- California 's longest - serving female inmate -- has been denied parole 12 times previously , Thornton said .
She was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two - night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969 .
She and the others -- Manson , Leslie Van Houten , Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles " Tex " Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people , including Tate , and two additional deaths the following night .
Their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation 's death penalty laws in 1972 .
By her own admission , Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , and stabbed the actress , who was eight months pregnant , 16 times .
In a 1993 parole board hearing , Atkins said Tate " asked me to let her baby live .
... I told her I did n't have any mercy on her . "
After killing Tate , according to historical accounts of the murders , Atkins scrawled the word " pig " in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband , director Roman Polanski .
Polanski was not home at the time , but three of Tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his nearby cottage .
If the panel decides to grant Atkins parole -- called a " tentative suitability finding " -- the decision is subject to a 120 - day review process by the California Board of Parole Hearings , Thornton said .
If it still stands , the matter then goes to the governor 's office .
The governor 's options include allowing the decision to stand , actively approving it , modifying it or reversing it , according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation 's Web site .
However , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has previously opposed Atkins ' request for compassionate release -- a request made by terminally ill patients wishing to be released before death .
The Board of Parole Hearings unanimously denied that request in July 2008 .
It was also opposed by Debra Tate , Sharon Tate 's sister .
If parole is not granted , another hearing will be set in three , five , seven , 10 or 15 years , at the discretion of the panel , Thornton said .
Atkins has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson .
But Debra
Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free , saying the slayings were " so vicious , so inhumane , so depraved , that there is no turning back . "
" The ' Manson Family ' murderers are sociopaths , and from that , they can never be rehabilitated , " Debra Tate said .
" They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die .
There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the ' Manson Family . '
Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we , as a society who values justice , can do . "
In a manuscript posted on her Web site , Atkins , who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz , wrote that " this is the past I have to live with , and I have to live with it every day . "
" Unlike the reader , or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool , I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life .
Just like the families and friends of the victims , this is with me every day .
I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away .
And that 's not ' neat , ' and that 's not ' cool . ' "
Atkins ' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008 , Whitehouse wrote on his Web site .
On May 15 , doctors predicted she would live less than six months .
But she passed that deadline , he wrote , and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7 .

The isopod was found living inside a weaver fish
A rare parasite which burrows into host fish before eating and replacing their tongues with itself has been found off the Jersey coast .
Fishermen near the Minquiers - islands under the jurisdiction of Jersey - found the isopod , a type of louse , inside a weaver fish .
Marine researcher Paul Chambers , from the Société Jersiaise , was one of the fishing party and identified the find .
He said he was surprised to find the isopod away from the Mediterranean sea .
Isopods are normally about 2 cm ( 1in ) long and live in fish , surviving on the animal 's blood , in warm waters .
' Quite vicious '
Mr Chambers told BBC Jersey : " When we emptied the fish bag out there at the bottom was this incredibly ugly looking isopod .
" Really quite large , really quite hideous - if you turn it over its got dozens of these really sharp , nasty claws underneath and I thought ' that 's a bit of a nasty beast ' .
" I struggled for weeks to find an identification for this thing until , quite by chance I stumbled across something that looked similar in a Victorian journal .
" Apparently there 's not too much ill effect to the fish itself except it 's lost its tongue . "
Experts at the University of Southampton confirmed that the creature was an isopod and that there had been several sightings of them in Cornwall in 1996 .
Mr Chambers added : " It does n't affect humans other than if you do actually come across a live one and try and pick it up - they are quite vicious , they will deliver a good nip . "
FLAGSTAFF , Ariz./ DALLAS ( Reuters ) - A grassroots conservative campaign against the Obama administration ’s healthcare reform plan has galvanized Republicans but also exposed the party to charges it is a captive of the fringe .
Republicans , who suffered overwhelming defeat in elections in 2006 and 2008 and are the minority in Congress , have taken heart this summer from a wave of townhall meetings and rallies that highlighted public uncertainty about the plan .
Although it was doubtful that Republicans ever would support healthcare reform , the signature issue of President Barack Obama ’s agenda , protests by key members of the party ’s base have made it even more difficult to do so .
At the same time , many Americans say they want some sort of healthcare reform pushed through .
Republicans risk the wrath of voters if Democrats successfully brand them as obstructionist and pass a reform bill without their support .
The dilemma was apparent Monday night in Flagstaff , Arizona when hundreds of supporters gathered to greet “ The Tea Party Express , ” an anti-government bus group touring the nation en route to a final rally in Washington , D.C. on September 12 .
“ Impeach the Fascist Dictator , ” read a sign carried by Vicki Grant , a 59 - year - old real estate investor .
“ I think it ’s atrocious , and any government program is bound to fail .
They all fail , ” Grant said of Obama ’s plan .
“ Anytime you get the government involved in anything it ’s a mistake .
Free market is ... what made America great . ”
Others at the rally toted signs that read : “ Hands Off My Healthcare ” and “ Kill the Obamacare bill . ”
John Echols , 38 , a political consultant and one of the event ’s organizers , said it was a non-partisan affair , but analysts say such protests , following weeks of often rowdy demonstrations , were not lost on Republicans .
HEALTHCARE RADIOACTIVE FOR REPUBLICANS
“ They have made the healthcare bills radioactive for Republicans , ” said Dennis Goldford , a political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines , Iowa .
He added that Republicans were reeling after losing congressional seats in 2006 and the White House in 2008 and were vulnerable to arguments from conservative elements that they had become too mainstream .
“ The Republicans are so disorganized and here ’s the one group claiming some Republican alliance .
And they are the ones with the passion and the energy in the Republican Party .
The party is riding a tiger and the question will be whether they can control these people or not , ” Goldford said .
Conservative talk radio hosts and others have helped stoke opposition to Obama ’s plan by charging that it is a socialist takeover of healthcare that will spur abortion by providing federal funding for the procedure .
Obama and his supporters have denied the charges and say the changes are simply aimed at improving the healthcare system , mainly by providing coverage to the roughly 46 million Americans with no medical insurance .
But the criticism has helped rally conservatives , including conservative Christians , who remain a key part of the Republican base .
Some analysts said conservative activists are unlikely to sway independent voters not to mention Democrats in Congress , who may cobble together enough votes to pass healthcare legislation after Congress resumes next week .
“ They ’re speaking to the choir ... all it really does is reinforce their own positions ... but it does n’t affect any significant portion of the population , ” said Bruce Merrill , a political analyst at Arizona State University in Phoenix .
Cal Jillson , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas , said he could envision a scenario in which Democrats pass a bill including a “ trigger ” to phase in a public insurance option if private companies did not reduce costs or introduce other reforms .
That is unacceptable to Mike Strohmeyer .
“ I do n’t think it will work ...
It ’s super expensive and our healthcare will suffer , it will get phased out , ” the 55 - year - old police officer said at the rally in Flagstaff .
Who 's Your Daddy ?
within the Democratic Party , liberals have the majority .

Americans are going to see how Obama governs when it comes to a divisive issue like health care reform .
Even though there are many critics , will he push through on the public option , which is probably the best way to compete with the insurance industry and bring costs down .
And it 's not just about health care either .
Some suggest the President 's beginning to appear weak and wishy washy on a range of issues , whether it 's gays in the military or immigration reform or going around apologizing to other countries .
At times the president appears to be ineffective at even leading his own party as the Democrats continue to wander around like a gaggle of unruly children .
Mr Obama ought to call a meeting of the Democratic leadership and say " I 'm the boss and if you do n't like it , there are ways of making your life miserable , especially when it comes time for your re-election . "

wants
One of the first things you will need to do when you get a new puppy or dog is to register with a local vet .
Most vets offer healthcare plans to help you spread the cost for veterinary treatment throughout the year .
Choosing the right vet for you can be daunting , but it ’s worth doing some research to make sure you pick the right practice for you and your pet .
When should puppies go to the vet ?
You can make an appointment for your puppy to see the vet when you contact them to register .
It ’s a good idea to let your puppy settle in for a few days first .
On the first visit , the vet will carry out a puppy health check .
This involves examining their eyes , ears and teeth , weighing them and listening to their heart .
Ask your vet what your dog ’s ideal weight will be as an adult .
You will need this information to make sure you feed your puppy the right amount of food .
Take with you any paperwork given to you by the breeder , previous owner or dog rehoming centre .
This includes a vaccination card , your puppy contract and breed registration papers .
How often do you take a puppy to the vet ?
If you have got an eight week old puppy from a breeder , they may have already had their first vaccinations .
However , they will still need to have their second set of vaccinations .
This will be about two weeks later .
Your vet will advise you on what vaccinations your puppy needs .
Your puppy will also need to be wormed and deflead .
This can be done at home as directed by your vet .
Thereafter , it ’s an annual booster for dogs to protect them from nasty diseases .
They will also need a health check .
This is offered every six or 12 months , depending on your vet .
Your vet will examine your dog and check their weight at these appointments .
If your puppy is fit and well , the next trip to the vet will be for neutering ( the removal of an animal ’s reproductive organ , either all of it or a considerably large part ) .
A female dog is ready to be spayed at around 6 months old .
Male dogs are usually castrated at around 6 - 7 months old .
Choosing a Good Vet
Every town has a vet or a few veterinary practices .
You can find details of your local vets using the RCVS Find A Vet search facility .
All vets in the UK are registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons ( RCVS ) .
It is illegal for anyone in the UK who is n’t registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons ( RCVS ) to practise as a vet .
The RCVS is the UK ’s governing body for veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses .
When it comes to picking a vet , there are a number of factors you may want to consider .
This includes specialism ( dogs in this case ! ) , location and structure .
Some vets specialise in a particular species of animals , for example , small animals such as cats and dogs .
Other vets specialise in farm animals or horses etc .
Vets also vary by business structure .
Some vets have practices inside pet shops .
Others are part of a large nationwide veterinary group .
The main ones are :
CVS
Independent Vet Care
Medivet
A smaller percentage of vet practices are independent and privately - owned .
How much do vets charge ?
During the first year of your puppy ’s life , you will need to pay for a full course of vaccinations .
This is to protect them from diseases .
You will also need to have them spayed or castrated .
Veterinary treatment can be expensive , particularly if they become seriously sick or are injured and need surgery or to stay overnight .
Pet insurance
It ’s a good idea to get pet insurance for dogs .
This can cover any unexpected costs in the event of your dog being seriously ill or injured .
Shop around to compare pet insurance for your dog and check the small print for what ’s covered and what ’s not .
Dog health care plans
Most vets offer dog and puppy health care plans .
These cover annual vaccinations , and a year ’s worth of prescription flea and worm treatment .
They also include health checks every six to 12 months .
You pay a monthly subscription for this annual plan .
Always do your research
Referrals are one way to find a good vet .
Referrals from friends and acquaintances are the best way to find a vet .
Ask specific questions to those giving referrals such as
How long has your pet been seeing this vet ?
What were the health problems and how were they treated ?
What were the costs ?
Hope this helps and good luck !
An Arab couple from northern Israel claims their one - year - old daughter was kicked out of a daycare center in a neighboring Jewish community " because she is an Arab " , and have decided to take the matter to court .
However , in an unprecedented legal move , the parents are not suing the daycare center itself , but one of the mothers who they say incited the rest of the parents against their daughter and got her kicked out of the center .
This could pave the way for lawsuits not against the discriminating establishment , but against a third party for applying pressure and incitement .
The couple lives in the Arab village of Sulam near the Jewish community Merhavia near Afula .
Some eight months ago , when their daughter , D. turned one , they decided to register her in a Merhavia daycare center .
The two communities generally live in harmony together , and when the couple approached Ivon Grinwald , owner of the Ivon daycare center in the town , she told them there was room for one more child and that she had never had an Arab at the center and would love to have D. join .
But the blissful utopia was shattered soon after , and according to the lawsuit , on D.'s first day at the daycare center , many parents , lead by the defendant Neta Kadshai , waged a war of " slurs and efforts aimed at having D. removed from the daycare center , making it clear that the defendants children will not be in the same center as an Arab girl " .
' Jewish daycare center should stay that way '
The suit , which was filed by attorney Dori Kaspi at the Afula Magistrate 's Court , describes a number of racist slurs made by the parents :
" The parents of six of the center 's children , including the defendant , approached Grinwald and made it clear to her that they would not have their children in the center with an Arab girl , and that they demand she be kicked out , and threatened that if she is not removed , they would remove their children from the center .
" That same evening , Grinwald called D.'s mother and invited her to an urgent meeting and informed her that some of the children 's parents have demanded D. be removed from the daycare center because she is an Arab .
As the plaintiff sat there listening , shocked and humiliated , the defendant called Grinwald and told her that if she does not remove D. from the center , she will remove her two children the next day .
" Grinwald explained to the plaintiff that if six of the center 's children leave , she will not be able to continue operating the center , and she returned the contract and the checks to the plaintiff . "
As a result of the pressure , D. was then kicked out of the daycare center .
Now , her parents are suing the mother , Neta Kadshai , who they say was behind the pressure for NIS 300,000 ( $ 76,161 ) .
The lawsuit argues that the defendant " violated the Basic Law : Human Dignity and Liberty .
The plaintiff 's felt degraded , humiliated and rejected , and they suffered undue pain and suffering as a result of the slander against their daughter and themselves . "
The defendant refused to comment on the lawsuit .
Grinwald said in response on Thursday , " I want to forget about this and do not wish to comment . "
In an interview to Army Radio eight months ago , Grinwald spoke of the issue , saying , " The parents called her a girl from ' the sector ' , they said this is a daycare center for Jewish children and that it should stay that way .
These are their personal opinions and I should respect them …
I can't change the world , I have to look out for my livelihood …
If I go down , four other provider go down with me . "
BOUNDING BOX Maximum 762 × 393 × 393 mm ( Bronzed - Silver , Bronze , Black )
178 × 178 × 178 mm ( Gold , Nickel ) Minimum 6 × 6 × 3 mm
Your model should be within the minimum and maximum bounding box sizes .
The maximum bounding box represents the largest model that that we can manufacture .
The minimum bounding box size is the smallest dimension in which we can manufacture in this material .
WALL THICKNESS Min Supported Wall Thickness 1.0 mm Min Unsupported Wall Thickness 1.0 mm A supported wall is connected on at least two sides .
Walls in your model must meet the minimum measurements to ensure it survives the printing and cleaning process .
Thin walls are prone to warping during printing and are fragile to clean .
Objects that meet the minimum requirements may still be rejected based on the geometry in which case our production team will communicate with you if the design needs improvements and can assist you to strengthen your model .
The minimum wall thickness may vary by length and can be checked using the 3D Tools for a given model .
WIRES Min Supported Wires 1.0 mm Min Unsupported Wires 1.0 mm
A geometry is considered a wire when it 's thinner in both unconnected directions than its length .
Wires that are under our suggested minimums are prone to breaking in the cleaning process , or warping .
SURFACE DETAILS
Min embossed detail 1.0 mm high & wide mm thick Min engraved detail 1.0 mm high & wide mm thick
We recommend these minimum measurements for details like embossing or engraving , based off of printer resolution .
Although 0.2 mm details will show up in this material , we find that text raised at least 0.5 mm shows up most clearly .
If you want crisper text or embossed details , try bumping the thickness up to 0.5 mm .
ESCAPE HOLES Single Escape Hole Diameter 4.0 mm Multiple Escape Hole Diameter 2.0 mm Pressurized air is used to blast excess powder from models that are hollow , or contain hollow cavities .
In order for us to safely do this , escape holes need to be larger than 4.0 mm in diameter .
For models larger than 50.00 mm³ we require two or more escape holes at least 2.00 mm in diameter .
A single escape hole at the end of a cavity will not allow material in the corners near the escape hole to fully escape .
So we recommend multiple escape holes at both ends of the cavity .
CLEARANCE 3.0 mm
Clearance is the space between an two parts , e.g. space between gears or a ball and socket joint .
INTERLOCKING AND ENCLOSED PARTS ?
No .
Steel is printed by depositing a liquid binder onto a bed of steel powder one layer at a time .
The product is then removed from the printer and infused with bronze .
While the product is being transferred from the printer to the infusion chamber , it exists in a delicate " green state " which does not support interlocking parts .
MULTIPLE PARTS ?
Up to 250 .
SPRUES
We cannot print Steel parts with sprues .
Any part with sprues will be rejected .
Since sprues are inherently thin by design , Bronze will not be able to be infiltrated between parts that are sprued and the model will fail in production .
ACCURACY ±5 %
The bronze infiltration of each steel part makes this material less dimensionally accurate than other Shapeways materials .
Shrinkage is more prevalent , especially on small holes and inner diameters .
Accuracy and tolerance can vary greatly depending on the model , and are hard to predict because they are so geometry specific .
A 5 % deviation on a ring is around 1 US ring size .
So if you order a size 6 , the deviation could cause the actual print to be a size 5 or 7 .
DESIGN TIPS Print Lines or " Stepping " A " staircase " effect , or print lines , can occur on the surface of your print .
These can become more pronounced on curved and angled surfaces .
Color Variation
The way that bronze infiltrates the steel can vary , and this changes the color of your product .
If there is a higher concentration of Bronze near the surface , it will take on more of Bronze 's deep brown color over steel 's gray color .
For a visual of this variation , see the FAQ section .
Sandcastle Rule :
If this structure was made of wet sand , would it break ?
There 's a part in the production process for stainless steel 3D printing during which the model is fragile and brittle .
It 's basically like wet sand .
When you design , ask yourself this question : if I made this out of wet sand or brittle clay , could I lift the design without it breaking ?
If the answer is " no , " then your design might break in production .
Nickel and Gold Finishes Can Wear Through Matte Gold , Polished Gold , and Polished Nickel Steel go through an electroplating process that deposits a 100 micron layer on the outside of the product .
This gives them a unique finish and is great for aesthetic purposes , but will wear off on functional products that are exposed to friction .
Nickel Allergies
Some people may have a nickel allergy , so we do not recommend using the Polished Nickel finish for wearable items , particularly jewelry .
Shapeways
Steel is not completely corrosion - resistant and may tarnish .
Small Engraved Details and Sharp Corners Steel products are tumbled with a corn polishing media to smooth out their surface .
If your product has small engraved details or sharp corners , this polishing media may get stuck .
To avoid this issue , make your engraved details over 2 mm wide and avoid sharp corners .
Too Delicate or Large for Polishing Products larger than 150 x 150 x 150 mm and products with particularly thin features or details will undergo bead blasting instead of the regular polishing process in order to avoid breakage .
This may lead to a rougher and less consistent finish than usual .
Plating Models containing a liquid holding cavity that are difficult to fully dry run the risk of corrosion and cannot be plated .

The year is 1982 and the soundtrack is Town called malice , Come on Eileen and Should I stay or should I go .
The boys look good in rockabilly - inspired flat top haircuts , lumberjack shirts and 501s , while ra-ra skirts and leggings are all the rage for girls .
Israel invades Lebanon , Britain and Argentina go to war over some islands somewhere in the South Atlantic , and Italy wins the world cup .
That was the last time Labour trailed the Lib Dems – or the Liberal - SDP Alliance , as they were back in the day – in the opinion polls .
But the latest survey from Ipsos Mori gives Labour just 24 % , one percentage point behind Clegg and co , with the Tories on 36 % .
And Cameron has n’t had to kill a single Argie to get there .
It ’s probably a rogue result ; the Lib Dems appears to be enjoying an 8 % post - conference bounce , and their ostensible advantage over Labour is well within the established margin of error for these things .
But the symbolism is there , all the same .
I was a young Bennite activist in this period , and have for the last 27 years had to listen to the standard invective that early 1980s influx of lefties came close to destroying the Labour Party , and only the Long March to the neoliberal centre - right commenced under Kinnock enabled it to survive , let alone form the last three governments .
Unsurprisingly , I have never bought into the analysis .
Michael
Foot ’s leadership was deliberately sabotaged by some of the very people now posing as the most consistent Labourites .
Yes Polly Toynbee , I do mean you ; protestations of the need for loyalty ring hollow from the mouths of erstwhile SDPers .
Then there was the Falklands Factor .
Remember when making war on the third world was electorally popular ?
The contrast with the damage Afghanistan and Iraq have done to Labour ’s standing could not be more complete .
New Labourites maintain that Labour in 1982 had been pushed back to its core constituency , and at the empirical level , that seems largely true .
But the point is that we had a core constituency left ; even that has now been dissipated by those who thought seven figures cheques from the super - rich were somehow adequate compensation for the loss of a mass electoral base .
The irony is that it the very people who will suffer the most under the Tories are the ones who will ensure their victory , largely by abstention but perhaps by voting fascist .
Not a few will actively support the Conservatives .
The 1983 manifesto was famously dubbed the longest suicide note in history .
But suicide notes are only notes , after all .
There is all the difference in the world between writing one and actually committing suicide .
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) --
One of the suspects accused of killing an honor student in a beating captured on tape in Chicago has admitted to jumping on the victim 's head after he was already lying on the ground , said a spokeswoman for the Cook County state 's attorney .
Derrion Albert , 16 , was beaten to death last week .
His death was captured on video .
In the videotaped confession , 19 - year - old Silvanus Shannon also said that the victim , Derrion Albert , 16 , never struck him , said the spokeswoman , Tandra Simonton .
Three teens arrested in Albert 's death -- Silvanus Shannon , 19 ; Eric Carson , 16 ; and Eugene Riley , 18 -- were seen on the videotape attacking Albert , and were charged with first degree murder and held without bail , Simonton said .
Monday night authorities said they charged a fourth suspect , 17 - year - old Eugene Bailey , with murder .
On Monday during the bond hearing , prosecutors described how the street fight escalated from a dispute between two factions at Albert 's high school to a beating that left the honor student dead .
Prosecutors said Albert was an " innocent bystander " who ended up in the middle of a street fight between two factions of students at his school , Christian Fenger Academy High school , on Chicago 's South Side .
When school let out at 2:50 p.m. on Thursday , Albert was on his way to the bus stop when two groups of students converged on the street , Simonton said .
AC 360 Anderson Cooper has the latest on the beating death of a Chicago honors student on " AC 360 . "
Tonight , 10 pm ET see full schedule »
The two factions , one that lived near the Altgeld Gardens housing development and one in an area known as " The Ville , " began fighting after a shooting earlier that day that police called gang - related .
Albert was approached by Eric Carson and another unknown person , both members of the " The Ville " faction , Simonton said .
Carson struck
Albert in the head with a piece of a wooden railroad tie , and the second person punched him in the face , Simonton said .
Albert was knocked unconscious by the blows for a short period , Simonton said , but gained consciousness and quickly tried to move from the escalating street fight .
" He gained consciousness and moved a few feet away , but as he was trying to get up , he was attacked by a second group , " Simonton said .
That group , made up of five members from the opposing faction , then took their shots at Albert , Simonton said .
He was struck in the head by Riley with the piece of railroad tie , a rectangular piece of wood used as a base for railroad tracks , Simonton said .
Once Albert was on the ground again , Shannon was seen " stomping on his head repeatedly , " Simonton said .
An amateur videotape shot by a witness , which has been broadcast nationally , showed the attack unfolding .
A local TV station that received the tape turned it over to police .
Watch graphic video of the attack »
The video shows that , as the attackers ran away , the person with the camera and several others approached Albert and carried him into a nearby building .
" Derrion , get up ! " a female voice pleads on the video .
Albert was taken to Roseland Community Hospital and then to Advocate Christ Hospital and Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead , Simonton said .
Shannon and Riley do not have criminal records .
Carson is on probation for a 2008 robbery conviction , according to Simonton .
On Monday , family and friends , some wearing shirts bearing Albert 's photo , held a vigil in his honor .
Albert 's grandfather , Joseph Walker , told CNN affiliate WLS - TV that his grandson was a good kid who did n't deserve to die .
" He was in Bible class this Tuesday night .
Church on Sunday , " Walker told WLS - TV .
" I have no trouble out of my grandson whatsoever .
This thing that happened to him is so horrific that we just do n't know what we 're going to do .
We lost a really dear friend in my grandson .
He was a blessed child . "
Walker said the family was struggling to come to terms with why Albert was killed .
" I do n't know where all this anger come from these people today , " he told WLS - TV .
" That 's just too much anger for someone to have in their heart .
All I can do is I 'm going to pray for these people , I 'm going to to pray for forgiveness . "
Rick Sanchez asks , " Are our young people salvageable ? " »
Albert 's aunt , Rose Braxton , told CNN affiliate WGN - TV that the family was hurt again when a memorial in Albert 's honor was burned down .
" To go and burn a memorial after such tragedy , then that just speaks for itself to what kind of people they are , " she told WGN - TV .
Family and friends asked the community to turn in anyone they knew who was a part of Albert 's beating .
" What kind of person , what kind of individual , has such rage and such anger and such madness ? " the Rev. Michael Pfleger said .
" We 've got to get to the hearts of our children , because nothing , nothing , excuses or justifies the actions of an individual who would beat another individual .
Nothing justifies that in this society . "
Pfleger said it was time to make a change , so children are n't afraid to go to or from school .
He said this kind of teen violence was not just an issue for Chicago , but from " Oakland to Newark . "
Ron Huberman , CEO of Chicago Public Schools , said he had met with Albert 's classmates .
" How do we make sure this event does n't become another event ? " he said .
" Another vigil on another day . "
Huberman said he will fight every day to ensure the safety of children in Chicago 's schools .
" We can promise them and we can say that we we will absolutely remember Derrion , " he said .
Flanked by people holding signs with photos of a young child and the words " Do n't shoot , I want to grow up , " Pfleger pleaded for peace .
" It 's time for guns , and it 's time for two - by - fours to stop being the way we treat each other , " he said .

We Have Met the Enemy in the War On Terror . . . and He Is Us by Doug Newman dougnewman@juno.com
Special to The Libertarian Enterprise
Is it just me , or does anyone else feel the vise grip tightening ?
Thursday 's news read as follows : " Airline passengers around the country stood in line for hours and airport trash bins bulged with everything from mouthwash and shaving cream to maple syrup and fine wine Thursday in a security crackdown prompted by the discovery of a terror plot in Britain . "
Imagine this .
In " the land of the free and the home of the brave " there is a " security crackdown . "
Crackdown on whom , may I ask ?
United Airlines posted updated TSA regulations including a ban on all liquids or gels in carry - on baggage on its web site on August 10 , in response to the discovery of the terror plot .
Hmm .
Perhaps I am na�ve , but I thought that things like this had to be passed by legislators and signed by the president before I could be arrested for violating them .
But no .
We have a War on Terror .
The executive branch has to act and act fast !
It is for your protection .
I mean they have to do something .
We are told that we are fighting a war against terrorists who " hate our freedom " and seek to " undermine our very way of life . "
If America succumbs to full - blown tyranny it will not be because of crazed , diabolical " Islamo - Fascists . "
It will be because the American people willingly relinquished their freedom in the name of security .
America has two constitutions .
One was ordained and established in Philadelphia in 1787 .
The other exists in the hearts and minds of the American people and far more important .
If " we the people " are ignorant , apathetic and downright unwilling to defend their God - given rights , the written Constitution becomes just a piece of paper .
Ever since September 11 , the American people have been all too happy to let the FEDGOV do whatever it pleases .
We applaud the USA PATRIOT Act .
We submit to the TSA grope - and - grab at airports .
We have no objection to warrantless searches .
We could care less if Uncle Sam monitors our e-mails and phone calls .
After all , " if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear " and " your civil liberties do n't matter if you 're dead . "
My response to this is : " Just how do you know you have nothing to hide ? "
Consider the following :
Americans have already accepted all ten policy planks of the Communist Manifesto as the law of the land .
Millions of Americans do n't mind one bit that we have the world 's highest incarceration rate .
The Federal Register Uncle Sam's compendium of laws and regulations with which you and I are required to comply runs 70,000 pages .
Do you know what is in there ?
Do you ?
If you violate it , prepare to don an orange jumpsuit .
The Internal Revenue code runs 11,000,000 words .
Again : do you know what is in there ?
The worst part of the post - 9/11 agenda is Uncle Sam 's assumption of power to imprison terror suspects arbitrarily and indefinitely without formal charges , without the right to face their accuser , without a jury trial or without any semblance of due process whatsoever .
What was that about " threatening our very way of life " ?
This is not the doing of some psychopath in Afghanistan .
It is the doing of our own government .
And it is all in the name of freedom , of course .
As one observer put it : " On September 11 , 2001 a horrible crime was committed .
On September 12 , 2001 the American people became suspects . "
Of far greater danger than terrorists abroad is how unquestioningly so many Americans have accepted their new status .
First it was 9/11 and the growth of the surveillance state .
Then it was Thursday 's unveiling of a terrorist plot in Britain and new restrictions on what we can carry on planes .
What will come after the next terrorist episode , be it an attack or an arrest ?
And how calmly will the American people accept whatever laws or regulations Uncle Sam hands down ?
As an old German proverb says , freedom dies in little pieces .
During the Clinton years , it was popular to say that you loved your country but you feared your government .
Under Bush
II , the same people want you to think that if you do not follow in lockstep with your government , you are all kinds of unspeakable things .
Police state groupies tell us that these are temporary measures necessary to keep us safe from terrorists .
Ben Franklin once remarked that those who sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither .
The German people in the 1930s were happy to sacrifice their liberties to a leader who would keep them secure .
They did this for 12 years .
For the 8871st time , Bush II is not Adolf Hitler .
However , the American people are in total denial that their own government , left unchecked , can do far more harm than any foreign terrorist .
In the case of Ex Parte Milligan in 1866 , Supreme Court Justice David Davis wrote : " The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people , equally in war and in peace , and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men , at all times , and under all circumstances .
No doctrine , involving more pernicious consequences , was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government .
Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism . "
The anarchy of which Justice Davis wrote was that of unrestrained power .
When you let people do whatever they want , you get Woodstock .
When you let governments do whatever they want , you get Auschwitz .
So what do we do about terror ?
Simple .
Get out of the superpower business .
Stop trying to run the whole world .
When you have troops in 130 countries , is it any wonder that so many people hate you ?
Bring the troops home .
Use your military to defend your shores and borders and be done with it .
It is hard for a lot of Americans , blinded as they are by hubris , to understand , but most of the world does not want our way of life .
And the more bombs we drop , the more they will hate us .
As Pat Buchanan has stated , " To Islamic peoples , whether the Crusaders come in the name of God or in the name of democracy , they are still Crusaders . "
And they want the Crusaders gone .
Buchanan has also stated that , " The price of empire is terror .
The price of occupation is terror .
The price of interventionism is terror . "
Terrorists do not " hate us for our freedom . "
They hate our relentless meddling in the internal affairs of their nations .
The problems of the Arab world are not America 's to fix .
So let us quit trying to fix them .
The people who have no problem with the advancing police state are many of the same people who so harshly criticized France for not joining America in invading Iraq in 2003 .
France had a terrorist problem at one point .
And then they pulled out of Algeria .
The whole business brings to mind the comic strip character Pogo , who once remarked that " We have met the enemy , and he is us . "
Such is the case in the War on Terror .
It is not " the terrorists " who want to take away our freedom .
It is the United States government , aided and abetted by the ignorance and apathy of so many Americans who will gladly trade freedom for security .
The German people did this 70 years ago , with grisly results .
Let us pray that this does not happen in America .
There is no guarantee that it can't .
