Brion Vibber has been working on ogv.js , an Ogg video player in JavaScript , supporting both audio and video .
We ’ve seen video codecs in JavaScript before , such as Broadway ( H.264 ) , Route9 ( WebM / VP8 ) , and more but mostly without audio support to go along with it .
We have audio codecs in JS too , just not combined with video yet .
That changes with ogv.js .
You can check out the demo , which runs in all modern browsers , but best in Firefox from what I ’ve seen , thanks to asm.js optimizations .
I got about 23 FPS at about 40 % CPU usage .
Of course , Firefox and Chrome already support Ogg video natively , so the primary targets of the project are Safari 6 + and IE 10 +.
Ogv.js is an Emscripten compile of libogg , libtheora , and libvorbis .
It ’s actually a fork of a project I started to bring Ogg Vorbis audio to the Aurora .js suite of audio codecs .
However , at this point , I ’d be hard pressed to find any of my code in the project .
The video decoding process actually starts with a streaming HTTP implementation , which allows videos to start playing before the entire file has been downloaded .
Unfortunately , there is n’t a good streaming XHR API cross browser , so they use a combination of Microsoft 's MSStreamReader API for IE 10 + ( hopefully going to become standardized ? ) , Firefox ’s proprietary moz-chunked - arraybuffer , and binary strings ( ouch ! ) for Chrome and Safari .
This allows much increased perceived performance , since decoding can happen as the file is being downloaded .
Once the video stream has been received , it is fed into the C wrapper around libogg , libtheora , and libvorbis for decoding .
Then the audio goes to the Web Audio API ( which means no IE support at this point ) , and the video is rendered in a canvas element .
At this point , the project is just using a simple 2d canvas for rendering pixels , but they say in the readme that a WebGL implementation could be used in the future .
I ’ve seen huge performance increases ( up to 20 % ) by moving the colorspace conversion ( the last step of decoding ) to the graphics hardware , which can do it in parallel , so I ’m looking forward to seeing this .
Parallel decoding in web workers is also being considered , since decoding both the video and audio on the main thread can make for some stutters on slower machines ( read : mobile ) .
Support for seeking is also on the roadmap .
Video decoding in JavaScript is an interesting problem , and not something on would have expected a few years ago .
But , it seems like people keep trying it , and with each attempt , we get better .
JavaScript performance keeps increasing , especially with things like asm.js , and the new SIMD API ( more on that soon ! ) .
One by one we ’re checking off the things on this list .
Who knows how practical it really is , especially since HD video or anything large still basically kills any system , and on mobile it can drain your battery really quickly .
But its a good benchmark for performance , and it ’s darn cool anyway !
You can check out ogv.js on Github , and a demo as well .
P.S. I hope you like the new site design , it should be much more readable on mobile thanks to the responsive layout .
Let me know what you think !
I do n't know who this " spoiled rotten cat " is

About Insuring Your Health KHN contributing columnist Michelle Andrews writes the series Insuring Your Health , which explores health care coverage and costs .
To contact Michelle with a question or comment , click here .
The average American woman who wants two children spends roughly five years trying to get pregnant or being pregnant .
She spends a much longer time – 30 years , on average – trying to avoid pregnancy , often at no small expense .
That may soon change , at least the expense part .
Starting this fall , the health - care overhaul will require new health plans to begin providing a range of preventive health services at no cost to patients .
Many people , including women ’s health advocates and some employer groups , think contraception should be one of the required free services .
“ It ’s basic preventive health care , ” says Laura Hessburg , a senior health policy adviser at the National Partnership for Women and Families .
Among other health benefits , women who plan their pregnancies are more likely to get necessary prenatal care and avoid closely spaced births , which can put a strain on their bodies and their parenting skills , and may result in low - birth - weight babies .
Many health plans already cover prescription contraceptives .
Twenty - seven states have laws that require some level of coverage .
Improving access and coverage even further could help reduce the estimated 3 million pregnancies a year that are unplanned .
One of the reasons for unintended pregnancies is the cost of contraception , say experts .
Even if a health plan covers contraceptive services , women often face hefty co-payments , ranging from $ 20 to $ 50 per month for birth control pills to several hundred dollars for a longer - acting method such as an intrauterine device .
“ For young women , $ 40 or $ 50 is a lot of money , ” says Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
According to Richards , it ’s not uncommon for young women to come to a Planned Parenthood clinic and buy three months ’ worth of pills rather than a year ’s worth , because that ’s all they can afford .
Experts say another important benefit of eliminating out - of - pocket costs is that it could encourage the use of more - reliable and cost - effective contraceptives , such as IUDs and hormonal implants .
These methods may provide protection for several years , without relying on women to remember to take a pill or insert a device .
But their higher upfront costs currently discourage many women from using them .
Not everyone agrees that contraception belongs on the list of free preventive services , however .
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , for example , opposes it .
“ Preventive care should be about preventing disease , ” says spokeswoman Deirdre McQuade .
“ Fertility is not a disease to be cured , and the government should not treat it as that . ”
Allison Nichols says she ’d be grateful for help covering her contraceptive costs .
The 25 - year - old owner of a natural foods store in Brooklyn pays $ 77 a month for her birth control pill , Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo .
There ’s no generic version of that pill available , and her health plan covers only generics .
She has tried other pills , but they made her moody and caused weight gain .
Her options now seem limited .
“ I ’m just going to pay for it , ” she says .
At this point , it ’s unclear whether contraception will make the list of free covered preventive services .
A few specific women ’s health services , such as mammograms , are required by the new law .
But many others will be determined based on guidance from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration , and it could take up to a year for the federal agency to develop its recommendations , says Judy Waxman , vice president of health and reproductive rights for the National Women ’s Law Center .
Many employers support covering contraception because it ultimately saves them money :
Even the priciest birth control is a lot cheaper than the $ 8,000 - to - $ 11,000 price tag for an employee ’s prenatal and maternity care .
“ We do n’t think there ’s any benefit to cost - sharing on contraceptives , ” says Helen Darling , president of the National Business Group on Health , which represents large employers .
There are limits , however , to what the group will support .
Employers should n’t have to pay the full cost of a brand - name drug , Darling says , if there ’s a generic equivalent .
Unless there ’s a medical reason for it , patients should pay the difference between the brand - name and generic versions .
A PriceWaterhouseCoopers study commissioned by NBGH estimated that the cost to health plans of providing preventive family planning services is about $ 40 per member annually .
A typical family policy costs about $ 13,000 a year .
“ The amount of money they ’re talking about is minuscule compared to overall premium costs , ” says Adam Sonfield , a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute .
When Portal 2 was first announced , it was expected to be released sometime this holiday season .
But , in traditional Valve fashion , the developer has announced that the game has been delayed and is now expected to launch at some point next year .
The news comes via a press release titled " VALVE ANNOUNCES MAKING GAMES IS HARD , " in which the company explained that " even though Portal 2 will arrive slightly later than planned , all life on earth wo n't instantaneously stop as every molecule in your body explodes at the speed of light . "
This news comes soon after the announcement that Valve had cancelled its previously planned Portal 2 event at E3 and replaced it with a " surprise . "
However , it looks like that surprise — which Ars has a meeting to see — will be Portal - related .
Valve describes it as the " E3 *** PORTAL - 2- THEMED-FOR - GOD'S SAKE *** surprise . "
Stay tuned for further details , which should be revealed at E3 next week .
Police charged a father with murder Sunday , accusing him of beating his 6 - year - old to death because the boy would not fall asleep .
Police say the fatal , eight - hour beating was the final episode in at least two weeks of abuse that Tekerrious Jackson suffered since coming to spend the summer with his father , 34 - year - old Alex McGowen Duncan .
“ This has got to be one of the most horrifying and heartbreaking cases I ’ve ever seen , ’’ Houston Police Department Homicide Division detective Sgt. Brian Harris said .
“ The saddest thing is , that because of the unconditional love he had for his father , the child would often tell him , ‘ I love you daddy . ’ ”
Duncan would force Tekerrious — who was called TK — to get on his knees and raise his arms above his head when the child did n’t go to sleep , police said .
Harris said Duncan would then proceed to repeatedly punch the child in the chest .
“ If ( Duncan ) did n’t see him with his eyes closed or saw him wink , he would beat him , ” Harris said .
Saturday night started the same way , police say .
Duncan put TK to bed around 7 p.m. on one of the two mattresses in the small efficiency apartment in the 4900 block of Polk .
Duncan shared the one - room unit with his girlfriend , 30 - year - old Tammyra Sampson , and her 11 - year - old daughter , Harris said .
After Duncan saw TK ’s eyes flutter , he forced the boy onto his knees and ordered him to raise his arms above his head and clasp his hands together , Harris said .
Every time TK became tired and lowered his arms or gave an unsatisfactory answer to a question his father asked , he would get what Duncan described to investigators as “ chest boxing , ” a flurry of punches to the chest and the rest of the body , Harris said .
Daughter was witness
Harris said the beating continued until 3 a.m. with Sampson and her daughter witnessing the entire event .
Harris said Sampson only intervened once to “ show ” him how to properly discipline a child with a belt .
“ She said ‘ I stopped him and said ‘ If you ’re gonna whoop him , let me show you the proper way to whoop him , ’’’ he said .
At one point , TK soiled himself , Harris said .
“ That sent the father into even more of a rage , ” he said .
Shortly afterward , TK began to have what appeared to be a seizure .
An ambulance was called and the boy was taken to Texas Children ’s Hospital , where he was pronounced dead upon arrival .
Initially , Duncan , who has a history of drug charges dating to 1995 , told police that the bruising was from attempting to revive the child from the seizure by slapping him and giving him chest thrusts .
His story , however , did not match the 11 - year - old child ’s graphic demonstration to police of the beating or Sampson ’s statements .
During his interview , Duncan told investigators that he beat the boy in order to show his son how to “ man up . ”
“ He said he was trying to teach him discipline , so he would make good choices , ” Harris said , adding that Duncan would also hit Sampson ’s daughter , but not as severely because she was a girl .
Duncan is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday .
Sampson , who has a criminal history and history with Child Protective Services , has also been charged with injury to a child causing serious bodily injury by omission .
Both are in Harris County Jail with a bond of $ 50,000 each .
With father for summer
Duncan had gone about three years without seeing his son before calling the boy ’s mother to say he wanted to be a part of the boy ’s life again , Harris said .
The child ’s mother agreed to let him stay with his father for the summer .
When she left TK in late May , Duncan was living with his mother in the 5300 block of Coke .
TK ’s mother had not been able to get in contact with them and had no idea they had moved to the residence on Polk with Sampson but was assured that her son was OK by Duncan ’s mother .
Neighbors in the small apartment complex were shocked by the news of the child ’s death .
They said the couple had moved in only a few weeks ago .
“ There are people who pay lots of money to have kids .
They take medicine so they can have kids and pay money to have other people ’s kids , ” said one neighbor , who wished to remain anonymous .
“ How can someone take the life of their own child ? ”
CPS is investigating and has placed the 11 - year - old child with her paternal grandmother .

This weekend a Japanese spacecraft is due to return to Earth , possibly carrying the first sample taken directly from the surface of an asteroid .
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) launched the craft — dubbed Hayabusa , or " falcon " in Japanese — in 2003 .
The probe rendezvoused with the small near - Earth asteroid Itokawa in 2005 , where it lingered for several months before heading back toward home .
After a round - trip journey of four billion miles ( six billion kilometers ) , Hayabusa is expected to land in Australia around midnight on June 13 ( 10:30 a.m. ET on June 12 ) .
Despite a few glitches along the way — including problems with the instruments designed to take samples — it 's possible Hayabusa managed to collect a small amount of asteroid dust and gas .
Hayabusa 's sample container was designed to hold up to ten milligrams of material , but " we 'll be very happy if we get a cubic millimeter back , " said team member Trevor Ireland , a planetary scientist at the Australian National University ( ANU ) in Canberra .
" That 's much smaller than a match head ... but we can pretty much tell what 's going on from that amount of material . "
( Related : " Water Discovered on an Asteroid — A First . " )
Scientists wo n't know for sure whether they 'll be any precious cargo to study until the container is retrieved , Ireland said .
" We 're literally in the dark about whether we 've got something there to analyze or not . "
Hayabusa 's Return Will Make Twin Fireballs
With its final course adjustments now complete , Hayabusa principal investigator Junichiro Kawaguchi said things are proceeding smoothly .
" There are currently no problems .
...
Everything is on course , " Kawaguchi said .
If all continues to go as planned , Hayabusa 's sample return capsule will separate from the main body when the spacecraft is about 25,000 miles ( 40,000 kilometers ) from Earth .
Both objects are then expected to enter the atmosphere above a sparsely populated military - testing zone in the South Australia ( map ) outback known as the Woomera Prohibited Area .
Roughly the size of England , Woomera " is a fairly biggish sort of landing target , but [ JAXA ] is narrowing it down to about 20 or 30 square kilometers [ 7.7 to 11.5 square miles ] " within that zone , ANU 's Ireland said .
As Hayabusa and its return capsule streak through the upper atmosphere , they will appear as twin , incandescent fireballs visible for about a minute to anyone within roughly 100 to 200 miles ( 200 to 300 kilometers ) of the reentry point .
The spacecraft 's trajectory , however , wo n't take it over any heavily populated areas .
Hayabusa 's refrigerator - size main body will most likely be incinerated during reentry .
But the 16 - inch ( 40 - centimeter ) return capsule is equipped with a high - tech heat shield and a parachute to help it land safely .
About an hour after touchdown , a helicopter carrying JAXA team members will try to locate the capsule from the air and record its GPS coordinates .
Due to safety reasons , the return capsule will not be recovered until dawn the next day .
At that point , the helicopter will return to the site with a retrieval party , which will include Hayabusa team members as well as Aboriginal land owners .
" Native [ Aboriginal ] title holders will be among the first to go out and see the landing site , " Ireland said .
Within 24 hours of its retrieval , the capsule will be flown to a specially - built JAXA facility in Japan to be opened sometime the following week .
" We 're not really set up in Australia to ... minimize the risk of contamination and maximize the returns " of the capsule opening , Ireland said .
First " Pure " Asteroid Sample ?
The sample - return part of Hayabusa 's mission is also full of suspense .
During the course of its seven - year trip , the spacecraft has suffered a string of mishaps .
For instance , en route to the asteroid Itokawa , the craft 's solar cells were damaged by a powerful solar flare , limiting its energy supply and prolonging the time it took to reach the asteroid .
Once " parked " near the asteroid , an altitude adjustment error sent the craft 's exploration robot MINERVA tumbling into space .
What 's more , during one of Hayabusa 's few successful landings on Itokawa , a metal - projectile system crucial for collecting asteroid samples failed to deploy .
However , scientists think it 's possible some gas and dust may have been funneled into the spacecraft 's collection chamber during its landing .
( Find out what Hayabusa has already revealed about Itokawa 's " shaking rubble pile " makeup . )
And if there 's anything inside the capsule , Hayabusa 's cargo could give scientists a first glimpse into what asteroids are really like .
The findings could offer new insight into the formative years of our solar system , scientists say , because asteroids are the rocky leftover building blocks of planets and moons .
" We do n't currently have any asteroid samples , " Ireland said .
Technically , what scientists have now are meteorites — usually small asteroid chunks — that have survived the passage through Earth 's atmosphere but have been irrevocably scarred in the process .
" Their original surfaces are pretty much lost , " Ireland said .
" This will be the first time we can actually look at the surface of an asteroid and look for things such as space weathering , and how the solar wind interacts with rocky material , and so forth . "
A preliminary group of international scientists , including Ireland , has already been selected to perform the initial examination of any " pure " asteroid sample inside the capsule .
" All of the inspection initially will be done in Japan , " Ireland said .
If there is enough of the sample to go around , in about a year JAXA will distribute some of the precious bits of space rock to other research centers around the world .
Building a Better Heat Shield
Even if Hayabusa 's sample container comes up empty , the mission could still be a success :
The state of the capsule after reentry could lead to engineering advances that will benefit future space missions , said Peter Jenniskens of the NASA Ames Research Center in California .
Although not officially part of the Hayabusa team , Jenniskens and colleagues will be watching the reentry from aboard a modified NASA DC - 8 research airplane flying at an altitude of about 39,000 feet ( about 12,000 meters ) .
" We hope to have a really good view of the reentry , " Jenniskens said .
" The aircraft allows us to be above the weather .
...
If you observe from the ground , you have a lot of dust and water vapor between you and the capsule . "
( Related pictures : " NASA Guts 747 , Adds 17 - Ton Telescope . " )
The aircraft will be about 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) from the Hayabusa fireballs and thus in no danger of being struck .
" We 're positioning the aircraft so that the capsule is coming more or less toward us , " Jenniskens said .
This will give the plane 's instruments a good view of the capsule 's heat shield , which is expected to pulsate between red , orange , and yellow during reentry .
The team will later use the exact colors to estimate the temperatures the capsule experienced during different points of the reentry process and to evaluate the heat shield 's performance .
NASA 's research plane will also play an important role in the capsule - retrieval process .
" We are providing eyes for JAXA in case there is [ cloud ] cover , " Jenniskens said .
" We 'll be able to confirm the reentry path ... and help determine how fast the capsule penetrated into the atmosphere and where the endpoint of the trajectory is expected to be . "
ANU 's Ireland added that , even after seven years of anticipation , he and his colleagues will wait however long it takes to find out what 's inside the capsule .
I have to admit that I am still a bit of a sucker for reading things made out of paper , but I routinely wish that Ctrl + F worked on them .
It ’s a good argument for having digitized , searchable versions of books on the web .
I gave permission for that to happen to This Gaming Life a long time ago , and I ’ve just discovered that it has now been uploaded to the net .
It ’s a book about the relationship between gamers and the games they play , and it ’s a book dominated by experiences with PC games .
You ’d like it .
You can still buy those beautifully papery versions here in the US and here in Europe .
HOLLAND -- U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra , R- Holland , wants to amend the Constitution to protect " the liberties of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children . "
His proposal has 137 co-sponsors in the House .
Hoekstra spoke at a press conference Friday with state Rep. Dave Agema , state Sen. Bill Hardiman and president of parentalrights.org and Patrick Henry College Chancellor Michael Farris .
Hoekstra wants the amendment to keep " parental rights " within families without government intervention .
The proposed amendment also states that international law cannot supersede the amendment , something the U.S. Supreme Court has used to justify some of its cases , most recently Graham v. Florida , which the justices ruled that minors who commit non-homicide crimes must have some opportunity to be released .

Elections are imminent .
Please send me your thoughts and suggestions if you believe we can extend the BDS to the political arena and do something to :
* apply pressure on all political parties this federal election to reconsider their support to Israel ’s occupation , expansionism and crimes against humanity
* send political parties and politicians a message that their support to Israel / half - hearted support to Palestine will cost them votes
* link up with similar pressure groups across Australia
As all of us know , there are currently no spokespersons in Parliament for the Palestinians barring Julia Irwin who , in frustration with Labor policies , has announced her retirement from politics .
In contrast , both Labor and the Liberals have taken strong pro-Israel positions and shield her from scrutiny / sanctions in the UN whenever Israel ’s expansionism , war crimes , human rights abuses and crimes against humanity come up for passing a resolution .
Installing a George Galloway ( pro-Palestinian former MP in UK ) or a Julia Irwin in our Parliament in this election would obviously be a tough call but at least we can explore options to deny major parties of votes .
At this stage , only crude ideas come to my mind such as asking voters to :
* vote for independents
* write the word ‘ Palestine ’ on their ballot .
* Refuse to vote I am aware of the crudity of these ideas and am sure , with the benefit of your thoughts , better , more viable ideas will emerge .
We cannot afford to vote back politicians ( some professing ‘ support ’ to Muslims and the Palestinian cause ) who sat dumbly in Parliament as :
* it welcomed and felicitated a delegation of 35 Israeli leaders indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity in December 2009 including : 1 ) Ehud Olmert who ordered : a ) the 2006 cluster bombing of Lebanon which killed 1,200 people b ) the 2007 blockade of 1.5 million people in Gaza and c ) the December 2008 ferocious attack on Gaza which killed 1,400 people including 900 civilians 2 ) Avi Dichter and 3 ) Sivan Shalom
* it passed the bi-partisan motion in 2008 congratulating Israel on the 60th anniversary of her founding and Labor ’s role , under Doc Evatt , in keeping Palestinians out of the deliberations leading to the partition of Palestine
* Julia Gillard led a 40 - member delegation to Israel within months of Israel ’s commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead .
* Australia failed to criticise the specific violence against the Gaza relief flotilla ; and support a UN call for an independent investigation .
* Australia advocated sanctions against Iran but not on Israel for her possession of nuclear weapons and failure to sign the NPT .
This election , we need all candidates to heed Julia Irwin ’s words : “ Every parliamentarian ought to think seriously about the moral implications of Australia normalising relations with a state that is still under investigation for war crimes committed during Israel ’s Cast Lead operation … .
Our media glibly accept the excuses of the Israeli public relations machine and ignore the horrific realities of Israel ’s barbaric behaviour in Gaza .
How can we criticise brutal regimes elsewhere in the world when we condone worse atrocities when they are committed by Israel ? ”
We need our candidates to heed a Sydney parish priest , Rev. David B. Smith , who said : “ It is shameful to think that our country is involved in helping to cover up war crimes …
Australia has not only helped to legitimise the assault on Gaza that began last December , but has also served to legitimise the siege , which is ongoing and continues to be the cause of enormous human suffering . ”
As an ANZAC nation , we cannot permit the continuance of this moral scandal or our country ’s continued support to genocide , occupation and colonisation .
In solidarity David Albuquerque PS : Below is a letter I sent to some Labor figures .
I will do something similar with the Liberals . ……………………………………………………………………………………………… .
Dear Labor Candidate
I thank you for your campaign letter in my letter box .
While it has information about Labor ’s track record and future plans , it makes no mention of your foreign policy .
You may be aware that the Muslim community as well as sections of the broader community have had ongoing concerns about the pro-Israel statements , trade practices and policies of your government and senior Labor leaders – in particular Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard .
With the emotions generated by Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard ’s failure to condemn Israel ’s attack , in international waters , of a ship carrying humanitarian supplies and the murder of nine volunteers , Muslims and other supporters of Palestine have to re-evaluate their traditional support for Labor .
Labor ’s support only encourages Israel to continue :
* her expansionist programme in the illegally occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem
* to avoid a resolution of the long - standing Middle - East conflict by refusing to halt the illegal construction of settlements and the apartheid iron wall in occupied East Jerusalem and the west Bank
* her three - and - a - half year cruel siege of Gaza enforced as brutally as we witnessed on June 1 and last December ( when similar attempts to relieve the dire humanitarian crisis there were repulsed brutally )
* the maintenance of cruel apartheid practices such as checkpoints , Jews - only roads , by - pass roads and road - blocks calculated to harass and humiliate Palestinians and prevent their access to schools , employment and hospitals
* the prolonged detention and inhuman torture of political prisoners and freedom activists in Israeli jails and other human rights violations as recorded by Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and other international monitoring agencies
* committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza , the West Bank and Lebanon as reported by the UN ’s Goldstone Commission , Amnesty and other agencies
In view of the above , we notice with great concern :
* Kevin Rudd ’s introduction of the bi-partisan motion in 2008 congratulating Israel on the 60th anniversary of her founding and Labor ’s role , under Doc Evatt , in keeping Palestinians out of the deliberations leading to the partition of Palestine
* Kevin Rudd ’s infamous ‘ support to Israel is in my DNA ’ declaration
* Julia Gillard ’s leadership of a 40 - member delegation to Israel within months of Israel ’s commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead .
A study of the transcripts of Ms Gillard ’s speeches and interviews from her trip to Israel and Ramallah , reveals that the word “ Gaza ” did not once pass her lips .
Challenged by a reporter to say whether she believed Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians was “ fair and just ” , she avoided the question and retreated into platitudes .
* Julia Gillard ’s comments to the Australian Jewish News on 21.8.09 supporting Operation Cast Lead in Gaza .
Gillard characterised the onslaught as no more than Israel exercising its “ right to defend itself ” against Hamas .
” Clearly the act of aggression was engaged in by Hamas which commenced shelling with rockets and mortars into Israel , ” Ms Gillard said .
“ That is what breached the ceasefire , and Israel responded . ”
* Labor ’s invitation , welcome and felicitation accorded to a delegation of 35 Israeli leaders indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity in December 2009 including : 1 ) Ehud Olmert who ordered : a ) the 2006 cluster bombing of Lebanon which killed 1,200 people b ) the 2007 blockade of 1.5 million people in Gaza and c ) the December 2008 ferocious attack on Gaza which killed 1,400 people including 900 civilians 2 ) Avi Dichter and 3 ) Sivan Shalom
* Kevin Rudd ’s failure to criticise the specific violence against the Gaza relief flotilla ; and support a UN call for an independent investigation .
* the Labor government advocacy of sanctions against Iran but not on Israel for her possession of nuclear weapons and failure to sign the NPT .
* Labor MP Craig Emerson ’s response in Parliament on June 16 , 2010 to Julia Irwin ’s speech condemning Israel ’s attack on the aid flotilla and murder of activists : “ I want to make it clear that , in making her adjournment speech tonight , the member for Fowler was not speaking on behalf of the Rudd government . ”
* The propriety of Ms Gillard ’s partner , TimMathieson , being employed as a real estate salesman by the founder of the Australia Israel Forum , Albert Dadon , and Mr Dadon ’s closeness to prominent pro-Israel Labor MP Michael Danby who was influential in the coup that installed Ms Gillard as Prime Minister .
We can not but take note of your failure to raise a single question in Parliament critical of your government ’s support to Israel or to participate in any of the protests in support of Palestinian rights and contrast that with the intensive involvement of Revolutionary Socialist Party candidate Hamish Chitts in the pro-Palestinian campaign .
We cannot but help compare Labor ’s support to Israel with the Greens ’ official policy on Palestinian rights appended to this letter .
I intend , with the help of others , to publicise Labor ’s pro-Israeli stand in constituencies like Lakemba , in west Sydney , and Holland Park , Bald Hills , Lutwyche , Darra , Algester and Kuraby , in Brisbane , where significant sections support the Palestinian struggle .
Yours faithfully David Albuquerque ………………………………………………………………………………………………..
The following is the Greens ’ position passed by consensus at Australian Greens National Conference , Adelaide – 27 - 29 October 2006 as below and published for the world to see on their website : http://greens.org.au/system/files/israelpalestine.pdf

3. Short Term Targets
• 3.1 The Australian Greens call for : 1 . the establishment of an international commission under the auspices of the UN to effect a settlement of the conflict , in accordance with the above principles and goals 2 . peace negotiations facilitated by the commission leading to a schedule for the implementation of all the goals sought in 2 above .
• 3.2 As preliminary steps to the achievement of the goals , the Australian Greens call for : o the immediate end to all acts of violence against civilian populations , including state targeted assassinations and suicide bombings
* the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli military from all Palestinian cities , towns , refugee camps , surrounding areas and transport routes , allowing freedom of movement of Palestinians within the West Bank and Gaza
* the immediate freezing of all Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories ( including natural growth ) and the simultaneous commencement of the repatriation of the Israeli settlers from the Palestinian territories
* an associated withdrawal of Israeli security and military forces from the areas evacuated by the settlers
* the immediate dismantling of the separation wall
* the deployment of an international peace keeping force endorsed by the commission to : monitor the implementation of the above preliminaries by the parties ; ensure that civilian populations are not exposed to the risk of hostile attack ; and provide the Palestinian Authority with assistance to re-establish its infrastructure o an immediate end to refusal of , or hindrance to , medical aid and an end to the destruction of infrastructure , agriculture and homes .
• 3.3 In addition to the above preliminary steps , the Australian Greens call for :
* full involvement of representatives of Palestinian and Israeli women ’s organisations in the peace negotiations , in line with the principles set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women , Peace and Security
* international support to establish a joint healing process , based upon the principles of a truth and reconciliation commission ( similar to experiences in South Africa )
* UN endorsed measures , such as sanctions , as needed and in conformity with Australian Greens policies , to ensure compliance of the parties with the international commission
* Australian , international and Israeli assistance programs in the Palestinian territories which together are sufficient to repair and rebuild Palestinian infrastructure , institutions , agriculture and the environment
* an end to Australian taxation deductions for donations to states , institutions and organisations engaged in violation of human rights including settlement activity , and the harassment , shooting and killing of civilians .
• The Australian Greens extend their support , respect and recognition to Israelis , Palestinians and international peace workers in the area , who act or speak out for peace in the region and who promote non-violent action against the occupation of the Palestinian territories , often placing their own well - being at risk .

Didier Drogba , the Ivory Coast captain , underwent an emergency operation tonight in an attempt to save his chances of participating in the World Cup after the Chelsea striker damaged his elbow in today ' sfriendly against Japan .
The Ivory Coast manager , Sven -Goran Eriksson , said : " He may have an operation , but he is not out .
He got a bad injury , a bone close to the elbow is broken , but he is going to a specialist and we will take it from there .
We will wait until tomorrow evening .
The doctors they can't say any more than that . "
A wave of dismay swept across Ivorian football when the forward was helped off the pitch in distress in the 19th minute of today 's match following a clash with the opposing defender Tulio , off whom a Drogba free - kick had earlier deflected to give Ivory Coast the lead .
Drogba was taken to hospital in Sion , Switzerland , where the Ivorians have been undergoing altitude training .
Drogba earlier informed French journalists that the injury would prevent him from playing in the World Cup but later retracted that and said an operation could salvage his hopes .
That was backed up by spokesman of the Ivorian Football Federation , who said categorically : " He 's not at all out of the World Cup .
He can still play . "
If Drogba does recover in time it would spare him a devastating blow – the player has often spoken of his hope to crown what he reckons has been the finest season of his career by leading his country to glory at the first World Cup to be staged in Africa .
The loss of a player who has scored 44 goals in 69 appearances for his country – and hit 37 in all competitions for Chelsea this season – would severely damage the Elephants ' chances of making an impact in South Africa .
Ivory Coast are in perhaps the toughest of all groups , with Brazil and Portugal representing formidable obstacles between them and the next round .
Tulio , who was born in Brazil , spoke of his regret about the incident and said there had been no intent to cause harm .
" It was a very physical game for both sides , and unfortunately that injury happened , " he said .
" Drogba and I ran into each other while chasing a loose ball and , in fact , I got there first .
He bounced off me and I could see it was something bad happened when he started screaming in pain .
But everybody at the stadium saw I did not mean to hurt him .
These things happen in football and I just hope Drogba recovers in time for the World Cup .
" I am not this kind of player and would never have gone over the top , especially in a friendly match so close to the World Cup .
They were also getting physical on us , but nothing nasty .
It 's just a shame this happened . "
When told that Drogba may not play in South Africa , Tulio exclaimed : " Oh , God .
This is unfortunate .
I feel really sorry for him and his team . "
Eriksson said that the match had been a robust encounter but exonerated the Japanese of any wrongdoing .
" It 's a physical game and the Japan player did not want to hurt Didier , " said Eriksson .
" It was a competitive match and it got physical at some points , but there was nothing bad . "
In addition to his contributions on the pitch , Drogba carries enormous influence within the dressing room .
He has sometimes been accused of trying to exert too much control over team selection and strategy , though that complaint has not surfaced since the appointment of Eriksson , and there is certainly no doubt that he would have been the Ivorians ' most potent weapon on the pitch .
If he does miss the tournament , his country will be captained by the Manchester City defender Kolo Touré , who recognised that the loss of Drogba would be " a huge blow " .
Touré did try to find some silver lining , suggesting that if the striker were ruled out , it would at least provide the team with even more motivation to perform well .
" It 's a huge blow because Didier is our captain , our friend and a very important player , " said Touré .
" But we need to keep our heads up and try to bounce back .
There are quality players in this squad who will try to use this moment as an opportunity to shine .
We will work hard to play well for Didier and if he really can't play we want him to got to South Africa with us .
We need to be able to go on without him . "
At the age of 32 , Drogba is unlikely to have another opportunity to play at the World Cup .

Will Carling 's decision to leave his fiancee and their 10 - month - old son following his latest infidelity has caused widespread outrage .
Zak Jane Keir argues that Carling was only doing what comes naturally .
But Peter Baker claims biology is irrelevant to mono - gamy , and that recent studies prove men are not only faithful , but happy to be so
THE FRENZIED condemnation of Will Carling 's recent infidelities has been misdirected .
Carling is only doing something that comes naturally after all : wanting a sexual partner other than the one he is officially permitted to have sex with .
There is a well - known theory to the effect that men want to have sex with as many women as they can in order to perpetuate their own genetic legacy .
The corresponding theory is that women want to have sex only in the context of a relationship or marriage , in order to ensure a protector for any children they might bear .

If this was an abiding natural truth , there would hardly be the need for the kind of intensive cultural pressure to restrict and control female sexuality that actually exists .
Monogamy , broadly speaking , is an invention of a patriarchal world view , and its purpose is to ensure that no man need doubt he is the father of his children , born by his women .
If male polygamy is a biological imperative to ensure the survival of the superior males genes - because the superior male fights off all the competition - the equivalent biological drive in the female would be to engage in sex with as many men as possible during the conception period , so that the ' superior ' sperm would be the one that made it through to fertilise the egg .
It is to prevent this happening that men have placed such emphasis on monogamy through the centuries .
While we , the Twentieth Century boys and girls , are not entirely at the mercy of our biological imperatives ( we wear clothes even in warm weather , we eat because it is " meal - time " rather than according to appetite , most of the sexual activity we engage in is re- creational rather than procreational ) , we should ask ourselves why certain behaviour patterns are idealised above all others and why we are so quick to condemn those who break these particular rules .
The ideal of lifelong monogamy stems from an era of considerably lower life expectancy than we have at present ( and some social studies appear to have noticed a radial decrease in the figures for spouse murder , coinciding with the liberalisation of divorce laws ) .
And while it is possible and perfectly valid for people to choose one - to - one relationships as a preferred lifestyle , the fact that so many people find it a source of frustration and misery should encourage us to consider other options .
To regard a monogamy - based sexual model as an opposition between male " wickedness " and female " virtue " does neither sex any favours : the " good " woman , we might remember , has always been the one who voluntarily narrows the scope of her world .
To the kitchen usually .
If we must condemn Will Carling ( if it 's actually any of our business ) then we should criticise what appears to be unnecessary brutality in the manner of exchanging one sexual partner for another , not in his inability to follow an outdated and pointlessly narrow code of conduct .
In fact , it 's his acceptance of monogamy as the ideal that caused this mess in the first place : the monogamous ideal would hold that your currently preferred sexual partner is the only valid one , and all others are dispensable .
Very ethical .
It 's time to divorce mono - gamy and morality : they 've definitely grown apart , and should n't have got together in the first place .
SO WILL Carling has scored with more women than he has tries for England .
That is a matter for his conscience and his partners .
Neither his behaviour , nor that of Bill Clinton , Peter Stringfellow or any other latter - day Casanova , proves that men are naturally predisposed to reject monogamy .
To suggest that men somehow feel genetically or hormonally compelled to have sex with as many partners as possible is as absurd as arguing that women are biologically destined to do the cooking and cleaning .
First , some facts .
It might seem about as exciting as a cup of cocoa and an early night but , for most British blokes , mono - gamy is the norm .
The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles , the largest ever analysis of sexual behaviour , found that a whopping 85 per cent of men ( both straight and gay ) aged 16 - 59 had only monogamous relationships .
The same survey also found that most men have surprisingly few notches on their bed - posts .
Two - thirds of straight men reported either no or just one sexual relationship during the last five years , and over one - third have accumulated no more than two partners in their entire lifetime .
This hardly amounts to evidence of an uncontrollable male libido .
At the level of fantasy , of course , most men are probably rather different .
But this is not surprising in a society that continues to teach boys to emulate " real man " , the guy who spends his days killing terrorists and his nights making passionate - and distinctly non- monogamous - love to an endless number of supermodels .
What is truly astonishing is that , given this cultural framework , relatively few men actually convert their sexual fan - tasies about colleagues at work , next door neighbours or even Playmates of the Month into real - life sexual behaviour .
The currently high divorce and separation rates do not constitute evidence of men's natural disinclination for monogamy either .
These are much more likely to be a reflection of financial pressures , stress resulting from the increasingly intense demands of working life and a decline in supportive family and neighbourhood networks .
Now that women are more financially independent , they are also much less willing to put up with what they often regard as men's emotional immaturity .
Although many men undoubtedly regard monogamy as an ideal arrangement , it would be absurd to deny that others do find it an uncomfortable constraint .
For complex reasons psychotherapists can no doubt trace back to early infancy , men often grow up frightened of getting close to women .
They may also fear rejection by women - and it does not take Freud to point out that the best way of avoiding rejection is to do the rejecting .
Yet , as many women know only too well , men are quite capable of remaining emotionally detached within a relationship but simultaneously loyal and sexually faithful .
Although it is not yet clear whether male behaviour is determined more by nature or nurture , there can be no doubt that there is not one universal form of masculinity with one fixed set of behaviours .
Being monogamous - or not - is neither " natural " nor " unnatural " for men ; rather it is a way of being determined by each individual 's particular brew of genes , hormones , experiences and preferences .
In this sense , Will Carling is no more or less typical of men than the Pope .

HOPES that a voluntary filter of child pornography will become industry standard across all internet service providers have been dealt a blow , with significant mid-sized carrier Internode declaring yesterday that it will not participate .
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy late last week announced the government would hold off on its filter proposal until a year - long review of refused classification rules had been completed .
At the same time the government said three internet service providers - Telstra , Optus and Primus , which between them represent about 70 per cent of Australian internet connections - would voluntarily block child abuse content , with the prospect that others might follow .
But yesterday , Internode declared it had significant concerns with administration of the blacklist of child porn URLs ( uniform resource locators , the technical name for web addresses ) used for the voluntary filter , and refused to apply it .
'' It covers a tiny proportion of the content that would need to be blocked for it to be effective and has already been shown to contain URLs of legal content that Australians would expect to access , '' Internode 's regulatory and corporate affairs manager , John Lindsay , said .
Finland enshrines ' legal right ' to broadband
Finland has made access to broadband connections to the internet a legal right for every one of its citizens in the first legislation of its kind anywhere in the world .
Gurcharn Sahota works on some of the world 's fastest cars at his workshop just outside Derby .
But if you 're used to spending £ 5 on getting the car cleaned at the local garage , forget it .
Gurcharn says he uses painstaking cleaning methods to make £ 1 million supercars look almost better than new .
He 's worked on Bugatti Veyrons , McLaren F1s , F1 GTRs and Pagani Zondas .
At his specially - equipped garage Gurcharn told Newsbeat , " a full treatment here costs around £ 7,000 " .
" For that kind of service I 'll spend around four weeks working on a car . "
Gurcharn 's work goes beyond the usual bucket and sponge wash .
Shampoo and clay bars
" We have various different processes that we put the car through , " he said .
" First is a complete wash with pH neutral shampoo and citrus degreasers , which is essentially orange extract .
" We use different temperature water , from 40C to 140C depending on the area of the car .
Gurcharn has to use special towels and an extra powerful hair dryer to make the vehicle ready for the next stage of cleaning .
" Then it 's decontamination using clay bars to get rid of things like tree sap , tar and air pollutants . "
£ 8,000 Brazilian wax
Incredibly , it 's important to remove scratches and marks that are barely visible to the naked eye .
Gurcharn said : " I use an electrical scanner to work out the depth of the paint work to 1/1000th of an inch .
" That way I know how deep I can go with ultra fine sandpaper and polish . "
Some of the tools , equipment and products he uses are the most expensive in the world .
Natural wax imported from Brazil at more than £ 8,000 per tin takes pride of place on his trolley .
International travel
As for customers Gurcharn 's work takes him all over Europe and beyond .
" Sometimes if one of my customers calls up from the Middle East they 'll fly me out there business class .
" All my kit will come with me and I can spend anything from a couple of days out there to several weeks . "
Currently , he 's working on the classic Porsche 911 .
" The owner has driven it over especially from Paris and is staying in a local hotel while I work on it for two days . "
As for accusations that no car service , no matter how much effort goes into it , can be worth what he charges he 's still proud of the work he does .
" If you give me a new car I can make it look better .
" If one of my customers wants to respray a million pound car it could cost them up to £ 100,000 .
" Give it to me for a couple of weeks , I 'll charge a fraction of the price and it will look even better . "
So …I ’ve been absent from here for awhile now .
And that is my own fault .
I ’ve been suffering ; not monumentally , and not compared to most people , and mostly in my head .
But every once and awhile depression gets me and it ’s all I can do to keep my head above water .
This summer I went swimming , this summer I might ’ve drowned , but I held my breath and kicked my feet and moved my arms around .
I start my summer job in approximately eight hours .
I ’m fairly terrified , but excited too .
A nervous excitement , shall we say ?
I ’ve gotten my fifth tattoo .
It ’s healed now , so it ’s less red , but it still stands in a beautiful stark cream colored white from my skin , raised .
Like a scar .
It holds a complex meaning ; it is a symbol of myself as a survivor of sexual assault ( survivor , not victim ) and the lotus flower is …it ’s special to me .
The deeper the mud , the more beautiful the blossom .
I still think about top surgery a lot .
But just top surgery .
I do n’t want to take testosterone , I do n’t want to mess with my body ’s chemistry , I one day want to have kids .
Sometimes I wonder if having a bicornate uterus ( basically , a double uterus ) is representative of being born intersexed .
This I can only speculate on and I have no other reasons to suspect this , besides my tendency to grow facial hair .
Unless there is some surgery that happened when I was born that my parents have n’t told me about .
I highly doubt this , since most operations ( or should I say , mutilations ) are aimed at making “ normal ” looking genitalia , not functionally genitalia , or to be more explicit , I have not suffered a loss of sensation .
I do n’t think .
Anyway , I crave a male contoured chest .
I ca n’t help myself .
In fact , I would n’t need to surgically or societally change my sex in any other way .
Ca n’t I have a male chest but a driver ’s license that reads “ F ” ?
I find myself looking at men on the beach in envy .
And once I ’ve made this choice , will I regret it ?
Will I suddenly want breasts again ?
Or are they just something that ’s there and not really that important to me ?
I certainly do n’t think much of them .
I ’ve found a female therapist in Holyoke who specializes in trans folk so maybe I can get some professional insight once I head back to the Noho area .
I could talk about what ’s been happening in my personal life , friendships and such .
But I really do n’t want to .
So I ’m not .
I should probably stay away from ecstasy for awhile .
My vision is starting to change , my dopamine drops get worse each time .
Especially after this most recent episode , most recent being about a month ago now .
Still do n’t think I ’ve recovered .
I ’ll be absent for several months at my summer job , which is me playing pirate for the summer .
But I ’ll be back with many stories .
I ’ll raise a glass to being no one else ’s fool .
Raise some question to the rule , who says you ’d have to lose a love to find one ?
At the United Nations , there are , as you ’d expect , flagrantly pointless press briefings going on in some wing or another , concerning some topic or another , at any given hour of the day .
The diplomats and reporters accept the custom with knowing smirks and lazily upraised hands .
It ’s the standard kabuki .
Except , that is , when Reverend Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann is speaking .
The president of the U.N. General Assembly , d’Escoto has apparently decided , at age 76 , that he has no time left for politesse , and his briefings are another animal entirely -- the kind of invective - laced bravura jags perfected by Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez , who , as it happens , are two of d’Escoto ’s heroes .
Take a March showing the Nicaraguan priest and onetime Sandinista put on after returning from a tour through Asia and Europe , during which he had cozied up to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and defended Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir against Darfur - related war crimes charges .
Back in New York and pressed by reporters about such controversial stands , he scoffed at Washington ’s demonization of Ahmadinejad , given its “ canonization of the worst of dictators , ” like Marcos and Pinochet .
He blamed the United States for undermining the United Nations in the run-up to the Iraq war .
He suggested that the Bashir indictment was racist and tied it ( and , if his furrowed brow and hand - waving were any indication , the Darfur carnage itself ) to the White House .
“ Who first raised the issue of genocide ? ” he said .
“ Bush .
George W. Bush .
That should tell you quite a bit already . ”
What made this monologue so startling was that it appeared not in the dark days of the previous U.S. administration , but in the early euphoria surrounding Barack Obama .
Indeed , at this point Susan Rice , Obama ’s ambassador to Turtle Bay , could take on a full - time staffer for the sole purpose of reprimanding d’Escoto .
In March , her deputy told The Washington Post that he “ has repeatedly abused his position to pursue his personal agenda , and in doing so he diminishes the office and harms the General Assembly . ”
Herein lies the challenge for the Obama administration :
To make good on its promise of better using the United Nations , it does n’t just need to navigate the power politics of the Security Council .
It must figure out how to manage diplomats like Reverend d’Escoto and the restiveness in the U.N. ranks he represents .
When its soporific secretary - general , Ban Ki Moon , began work in 2007 , the United Nations was in arguably the worst shape of its 60 - year history - - a byword for political impotence , with the war in Iraq stumbling into its fifth year and the rockets flying in Gaza , and a possible breeding ground for corruption , with Kofi and Kojo Annan having been investigated in the Oil - for - Food scandal .
The contempt for the place expressed over the years by the likes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick , to say nothing of John Bolton , suddenly seemed all too justified .
Even devoted internationalists and liberals found themselves asking whether it still served a purpose .
What was desperately needed , it was agreed , was a revitalizing figure , a post - cold - war Dag Hammarskjold who could make the United Nations relevant again .
Ban is emphatically not that figure .
He began work in 2007 with little fanfare and has governed with less .
In certain quarters , the beleaguered Korean is known as Ban Ki Who ?
And that quiescence has left an opening through which d’Escoto has charged -- carrying all the baggage from his colorful past .
A Bell councilman said Monday that he did n’t know his salary was $ 90,000 a year less than his colleagues ’ nor that some city administrators made far more than that , until The Times reported that the district attorney ’s office was investigating why the pay was so high for the part - time positions .
Councilman Lorenzo Velez said he is being paid $ 8,076 a year , while his colleagues are drawing nearly $ 100,000 annually .
Ahead of Monday night ’s council meeting , Velez called for an investigation , saying that if The Times ’ report is true , the city manager , assistant city manager , police chief and entire council should resign .
FULL COVERAGE : High salaries stir outrage in Bell
The Times reported that Bell ’s Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo was earning $ 787,637 annually , twice as much as President Obama ; Police Chief Randy Adams was earning $ 457,000 a year , 50 % more than Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck ; and Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia was earning $ 376,288 , more than most city managers .
Hundreds of angry residents attended Monday night ’s council meeting , expecting that officials would take action against Rizzo .
Earlier in the day , Vice Mayor Teresa Jacobo said she expected Rizzo to resign or be fired at the meeting .
Instead the council , citing legal concerns , ordered a staff report on city salaries , sparking outrage from spectators .
“ We ’re asking for your patience , ” Velez said over the shouts of “ Fire Rizzo now ! ” and “ Recall , recall ! ”
Rizzo did not attend the meeting .
The council asked for the salary report to be available at the July 26 meeting .
“ You ’re either with us or against us — and if you ’ve been earning a $ 100,000 a year , you ’re against us , ” said Cristina Garcia of the community group Bell Assn. to Stop the Abuse .
Group members said they planned to file recall papers against council members .
In recent days , the group had passed out more than 9,000 fliers urging people to attend Monday ’s meeting .
“ I ’m very angry , ” said Leticia Arquino .
“ I literally have to work 24 hours to pay their salaries . ”
A number of people waved signs that read “ Stop the abuse on our taxes ” and “ Welcome to Bell , where the City Council makes more than you do .
Also , we have nice parks . ”
One person had a sign showing Mayor Oscar Hernandez with devil horns .
As the meeting got underway , people were collecting signatures demanding an audit of all City Hall finances .
Outside the tiny council chambers , people pressed against the door as fire officials threatened to shut down the meeting unless the crowds backed off .
Earlier in the day , Velez showed a reporter his statement of earnings and deductions , showing that the city paid him $ 310.62 every two weeks .
His annual salary is about what his colleagues get paid each month .
It was unclear what caused the discrepancy .
Velez said he bears some responsibility for not finding out the salaries of city employees , “ but I was under the impression that I was being paid just like everyone else . ”
Records show that the councilman whose resignation led to Velez ’s appointment was quickly hired at the city ’s food bank .
According to city records , that councilman kept his salary after stepping down .
Council members receive the same benefits as city employees , including medical coverage and pension eligibility .
Velez , a heavy - equipment operator for the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks , said he was “ in shock ” when he learned that the other council members were making nearly $ 100,000 annually .
“ I was truly surprised . ”
The 55 - year - old was appointed to the council to fill the unexpired term of Victor Bello , who resigned for undisclosed reasons in August .
Almost immediately after Bello left the council , he became the only full - time employee at the city food bank , working as an assistant to the food - bank coordinator , according to Rizzo .
Rizzo said no one had the job before Bello .
Documents obtained by The Times under the California Public Records
Act show that in September 2009 , Bello was being paid $ 96,600 a year — the same as council members , except for Velez .
The documents also show that Bello was being paid for sitting on four city boards .
But according to resolutions the council approved in June 2008 , commissioners on those boards must be council members .
Bello could not be reached for comment Monday .
Jacobo , the vice mayor , said she thought Bello was a volunteer at the food bank .
When she learned of his salary from The Times , she “ was angry . ”
The Los Angeles County district attorney ’s office is investigating the large salaries council members receive for their part - time positions .
Bell has a population of about 40,000 , 90 % Latino and more than 50 % foreign - born .
It is one of the poorest cities in Los Angeles County .
Most of council members ’ salaries come from serving on boards such as the Community Redevelopment Agency , the Community Housing Authority , the Planning Commission , the Public Financing Authority , the Surplus Property Authority and the Solid Waste and Recycling Authority .
City records show that in July 2009 council members received $ 8,083.25 per month for sitting on the boards .
The records also show that the boards perform little work , with some meetings lasting only a minute .
Although his payroll records show Velez receiving $ 27.69 for sitting on one board and $ 42.74 for another , he said he knows nothing about them .
As far as he was concerned , Velez said , he was taking part in council meetings only .
“ The city of Bell can not stand these kind of salaries , ” Velez said , pointing out that the city has cut services and laid off employees .
In an interview last week with The Times , Hernandez , the mayor , and Councilman Luis Artiga justified their salaries by lauding city services and noting that no one had been laid off or forced to take furloughs .

MySpace co-president Jason Hirschhorn will be leaving the company tomorrow .
This is mere months after he was promoted to co-president from chief product officer -- after then - CEO Owen Van Natta got the boot -- and barely a year after he joined the company .
No matter what the MySpace handlers say to the contrary , it 's pretty obvious the once - hot social network is a terrible mess and that it 's very unlikely it 's going to turn itself around .
So eventually News Corp. owner Rupert Murdoch and digital boss Jon Miller are going to have to get rid of it .
Will MySpace be the next Bebo -- which AOL spent $ 850 million on in 2008 and now just sold for less than $ 10 million ?
Or will Murdoch just shut it down to lose less face ?

Three people were arrested when a water fight in Hyde Park involving some 1,500 people spilled out on to Oxford Street .
Police closed the busy central London shopping street to traffic on Friday evening to deal with the incident .
One person needed hospital treatment for a facial injury sustained at the event , which is thought to have been organised on a social networking site .
One male was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and two for public order offences , police said .
Section 60 order
Officers estimate that about 1,500 people attended the event , which began in Hyde Park at 1300 BST .
The water fight eventually petered out at about 2100 BST , police said .
One posting advertising the event said : " As soon as the clock strikes 1 pm , let battle commence - get as many other people wet without getting wet yourself !
Last one with a dry T - shirt wins !!! "
A police spokesman said most of the people who took part in the water fight - held on one of the hottest days of the year so far - were well - behaved .
However , Scotland Yard issued a Section 60 order allowing officers to search revellers in the area .
Supreme Court : Suspects Must Explicitly Invoke Miranda Rights
Doug Mataconis · · 5 comments
The Supreme Court ruled today that mere silence in response to police questioning is not sufficient to constitute an invocation of a suspect ’s Miranda rights :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that suspects must explicitly tell police they want to be silent to invoke Miranda protections during criminal interrogations , a decision one dissenting justice said turns defendants ’ rights ” upside down . ”
A right to remain silent and a right to a lawyer are the first of the Miranda rights warnings , which police recite to suspects during arrests and interrogations .
But the justices said in a 5 - 4 decision that suspects must tell police they are going to remain silent to stop an interrogation , just as they must tell police that they want a lawyer .
The ruling comes in a case where a suspect , Van Chester Thompkins , remained mostly silent for a three - hour police interrogation before implicating himself in a Jan. 10 , 2000 , murder in Southfield , Mich .
He appealed his conviction , saying that he invoked his Miranda right to remain silent by remaining silent .
But Justice Anthony Kennedy , writing the decision for the court ’s conservatives , said that was n’t enough .
” Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk to police , ” Kennedy said .
” Had he made either of these simple , unambiguous statements , he would have invoked his ‘ right to cut off questioning . ’
Here he did neither , so he did not invoke his right to remain silent . ”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor , the court ’s newest member , wrote a strongly worded dissent for the court ’s liberals , saying the majority ’s decision ” turns Miranda upside down . ”
” Criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent — which counterintuitively , requires them to speak , ” she said .
” At the same time , suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so .
Those results , in my view , find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent cases and are inconsistent with the fair - trial principles on which those precedents are grounded . ”
Of course , Miranda v. Arizona itself is extra-constitutional in some sense in that there is nothing in the Fifth Amendment that requires police to give warnings of any kind to suspects and much of the case law since Miranda was decided in 1966 has involved pairing back some of the more radical interpretations of the Court ’s decision , which were seen as interfering too deeply into the ability of police to investigate crimes .
The main purpose of the Miranda warning , in fact , can be seen as actually aiding police in that it ensures that confessions obtained in compliance with the law wo n’t be thrown out on a technicality .
Which is why I think the decision today makes sense .
Merely staying silent without specifically saying “ I wo n’t talk ” or “ I want a lawyer ” ( after having been read the Miranda warning , which occurred in this case ) could mean a number of things from a suspect who thinks he can beat the police interrogator to one who wants to delay the inevitable as long as possible .
Requiring police to assume that it always means that the suspect wants to invoke their Constitutional rights seems to me to be an undue hinderence on law enforcement .
As Lyle Denniston says :
The one theme underlying both parts of the opinion for the majority was that the detectives here had given Thompkins his Miranda rights , and had validly determined that he understood them .
After that , the Court made clear , the way the interrogation went — or stopped — depended upon choices that Thompkins had available to him .
Failing to explicitly invoke his right to silence , and given it up by briefly confessing , Thompkins opted to give evidence against himself , according to the ruling .
The other side of the coin , of course , is the fact that the Miranda Warning has become such a pervasive part of the culture over the past 40 years or so thanks to police and legal dramas on television and the movies , that one wonders if there really are all that many people who do n’t know that they have a right to be quiet and ask for a lawyer when the police start questioning them .
That ’s not an argument for overturning Miranda , because I think the mandated warning still serves a useful purpose for suspects , police , and the court system , but it does argue strongly that relaxing the requirement a little bit wo n’t lead to the disaster that some civil liberties advocates might fear .

Not lovin ' it : U.S. chicken McNuggets ' contain SILLY PUTTY chemical '
Chicken nuggets sold in U.S. branches of McDonald 's contain a chemical used in Silly Putty .
' McNuggets ' sold to American fast food lovers contain dimethylpolysiloxane , an anti-foaming agent used in Silly Putty .
They also have more calories and fat than those sold in the chain 's British restaurants , according to a CNN study .
Four American McNuggets total 190 calories , 12 grams of fat and two grams of saturated fat .
The equivalent portion in Britain clocks in at 170 calories , nine grams of fat and one gram of saturated fat .
Transatlantic tastes : McDonald 's Chicken McNuggets contain more calories , fat and chemicals than their British counterparts
U.S. McNuggets also contain a petrol - based chemical called tertiary butylhydroquinone ( tBHQ ) as well as dimethylpolysiloxane .
British McNuggets contain neither .
A spokeswoman for McDonald 's put the transatlantic differences down to the local methods of food preparation .
Lisa McComb , McDonald 's global media relations manager , said that in the U.S. McNuggets are coated and then cooked , while in Britain they are cooked and then coated .
The result , she explained , is that British McNuggets absorb less oil and have less fat .
Labeling also plays a part in giving nuggets sold in Britain the appearance of being healthier than those sold in the U.S. , she said , as ground celery and pepper are listed on the American packaging as simply ' spices ' .
' You would find that if you looked at any of our core food items , you 'd see little , regional differences , ' she said .
' We do taste testing of all our food items on an ongoing basis . '
Ms McComb added that dimethylpolysiloxane is used for safety reasons to prevent the oil from foaming .
Marion Nestle , a New York University professor and author of What To Eat , told CNN that tertiary butylhydroquinone and dimethylpolysiloxane in the McNuggets probably pose no health risk to consumers .
America : Republic or Democracy ? by William P. Meyers
Lately , from politicians , radio - talk show hosts , and other commentators , we have heard that we should forget about democracy , because the U.S.A. is a republic .
But some questions are being posed by democracy advocates :
What is a republic ?
What is a democracy ?
Should the United States be a mere republic , or a genuine democracy ?
Republicans and other democracy detractors point to the U.S. Constitution and bits of history , and say , " See , the Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution gave us a Republic .
They believed democracies were dangerous and unworkable . "
On that , they are partly right , but they fail to mention that democracies and republics overlap .
They are not opposites .
And they fail to account for the history of American government since 1788 , much less the debates that took place in America prior to 1788 , when the U.S. Constitution was substituted for the Articles of Confederation .
Democracy means rule of the people .
The two most common forms of democracy are direct democracy and representative democracy .
In direct democracy everyone takes part in making a decision , as in a town meeting or a referendum .
The specific rules may vary : perhaps everyone must agree , perhaps there must be consensus , perhaps a mere majority is required to make a decision .
The other , better known form of democracy is a representative democracy .
People elect representative to make decisions or laws .
Again , specifics vary greatly .
And , surprise , a representative democracy is a kind of republic .
What distinguishes a republic is that it has an elected government .
Representative democracies are , therefore , a kind of republic .
Self - appointed governments such as monarchies , dictatorships , oligarchies , theocracies and juntas are not republics .
However , this still allows for a wide spectrum .
The classic is the Roman Republic , in which only a tiny percentage of citizens , members of the nobility , were allowed to vote for the Senators , who made the laws and also acted as Rome 's supreme court .
Most people would say that Rome was a Republic , but not a democracy , since it was very close to being an oligarchy , rule by the few .
Although the Roman Republic was not a dictatorship ( until Augustus Caesar grabbed power ) , it did not allow for rule of the people .
In both theory and practice the Soviet Union , that late evil empire , was a republic ( Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) because the lawmakers were elected , if only by the Communist Party members .
Beginning with the Constitution 's adoption , America has been a Republic .
But the dominant trend over the last two centuries has been to make it into a democracy as well , a representative democracy , also known as a democratic republic .
True , the creation of the Constitution itself was partly a reaction against democracy .
In states like Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts , the situation was getting way too democratic for the monied aristocracy that had , since the American Revolution , refused to share power with ordinary men .
The causes of the American Revolution were many , but for the monied class there were three principal aims .
They sought self - government : that is , they sought to rule the colonies themselves , to further their own interests .
They sought to protect the institution of slavery , which had been endangered by Lord Mansfield 's ruling against it in the Sommersett case of 1772 .
And land speculators like George Washington sought to seize more Native American Indian land , which the British had outlawed .
But to win the American Revolution this predatory elite needed help .
Their own rhetoric about freedom and equality led to widespread demands for the right to vote : universal suffrage .
In other words , the people began demanding democracy .
Even the slaves ( white and black alike ) demanded to be freed and allowed to vote .
After the British were defeated a centralized , national government was seen by George Washington and company not as a method of extending freedom and the right to vote , but as a way of keeping control in the hands of rich .
They wrote several anti-democratic provisions into the U.S. Constitution .
Slavery was institutionalized .
The Senate was not to be elected directly by the people ; rather Senators were to be appointed by state legislatures .
The President was not to be directly elected by the voters , but elected through an electoral college .
The Supreme Court was to be appointed .
Only the House of Representatives was elected directly .
More important to our democracy - versus - republic debate , the U.S. Constitution left the question of who could vote in elections to each individual state .
In most states only white men who owned a certain amount of property could vote .
So , on the whole , the first federal government that met in 1789 was a republic with only a fig - leaf of democratic representation .
This is what today 's commentators mean when they say America is a republic , not a democracy .
Fortunately ( for the democrats ) , the early federal government was not very powerful .
In state after state it became easier for white males to qualify to vote .
And slowly , decade after decade , our republic became a democratic republic .
At the national level the major steps toward democracy can be marked by amendments to the U.S. Constitution .
The Bill of Rights guaranteed limits to the power of the federal government .
The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery .
The Fourteenth Amendment effectively extended the vote to all adult male citizens , including ex-slaves , by penalizing states that did not allow for universal male suffrage .
The Fifteenth Amendment explicitly gave the right to vote to former slaves .
After the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments did not extend suffrage to women , a vigorous campaign for the vote was launched by women , who received the vote through the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 .
But the main Amendment that tipped the scales from the national government of the United States being a mere republic to being a true representative democracy was the often - overlooked Seventeenth Amendment , which took effect in 1913 .
Since 1913 the U.S. Senate has been elected directly by the voters , rather than being appointed by the state legislatures .
That makes the national government democratic in form , as well as being a republic .
There will always be anti-democratic forces in any society .
The most blatantly undemocratic feature of U.S. government in the 20th century was the unconstitutional but systematic disenfranchisement of African - American and other non-white citizens .
This came to an end in the 1950's and 1960's with a series of Supreme Court decisions against segregation laws , the passage of Civil Rights Acts , and the passage of the Twenty - Fourth Amendment outlawing poll taxes .
We even lowered the voting age to 18 with the Twenty - Sixth Amendment in 1971 .
There are no longer any voter - qualification impediments to democracy in the United States .
But many have noted that the will of the people has tended not to prevail , and that a majority of people eligible to vote are so discouraged that they do not vote .
The main reason for this is the buying and selling of elections and politicians by the wealthier class of citizens and their special interest groups .
A year or more before elections take place , the winner is decided by those who vote with dollars .
But this is a defect in democracy , not a reason to abandon it .
The answer is to cure the defect , not to attempt to destroy our representative democracy .

An article in the Chronicle Wednesday ( “ Arizona law hanging over Calderon visit , ” Page A7 ) erroneously said that Arizona 's new law “ allows police to stop and question anyone suspected of being in the country illegally . ”
This statement is flatly untrue .
It 's not even close to being true .
And it 's the kind of statement that does a disservice to people who are trying to make reasoned arguments either way about the Arizona law .
The Arizona law makes it clear that there must first be a valid “ lawful stop , detention or arrest ” before any investigation of immigration status can begin .
The valid “ stop , detention or arrest ” cannot involve immigration status ; it has to be independent , based upon an “ other law or ordinance . ”
These are quotations from the text of the law .
A stop , detention or arrest can't be justified by merely suspecting someone 's immigration status .
It is only after a valid arrest , stop or detention has been established — only at that point — that a police officer can even consider investigating immigration status , under the Arizona law .
And at that point , the officer still can't investigate , unless there are “ reasonable ” grounds to suspect illegal entry .
And even then , he can only make a “ reasonable effort ... to determine the person 's immigration status . ”
More importantly , the officer can't begin to make an arrest , unless the inquiry produces a solid basis , or in other words , probable cause for arrest .
And the Arizona law says that ethnicity — a person 's appearance — cannot be considered as the basis of the reasonable grounds .
It does n't have to say this , because it 's already the law , but it 's a good thing for Arizona to restate it explicitly .
As an example , consider the case of the Oklahoma City bomber , Timothy McVeigh .
This terrorist was apprehended as the result of a routine traffic stop .
The officer who stopped him did n't know McVeigh was a capital murderer .
He had no license plates , and that is why he was pulled over .
The traffic stop disclosed that McVeigh had no vehicle registration and was carrying a handgun without a permit .
But the reason for McVeigh 's apprehension certainly was not because he was “ someone suspected of being a terrorist , ” although that kind of reasoning might seem analogous to the erroneous statements about the law that have been made in the media .
It was only after he was detained in a valid , lawful traffic stop , based on independent grounds , after the facts prompted the police to undertake an investigation , that they developed evidence that McVeigh was the bomber who had killed more than a hundred people in a federal building .
That 's the way it should be done .
And that 's what the Arizona law does , in the case of immigration violations .
In fact , ordinary vehicle stops result in a large percentage of lawful arrests .
For misdemeanors , felonies , and even capital crimes like McVeigh's .
This is so because traffic violations frequently bring officers into positions to witness evidence of minor crimes or very serious crimes that they did not suspect when they signaled the vehicle to pull over .
We ought to appreciate it when a police officer is alert and curious during a traffic stop .
That 's what the Arizona law is about .
If an officer sees indications of a crime , he should ask questions and look for further evidence .
That is what the police did in Timothy McVeigh 's case , and it is what they should do in other cases when they have made a lawful arrest , stop , or detention .
Including investigating immigration crimes .
But that does n't mean , as erroneously reported , that officers can “ stop anyone suspected ” of a crime , and the Arizona law does n't authorize that at all .
Part of the opposition to the Arizona law comes from people who simply do n't know what the law says .
And that includes some people in high places .
A few days ago , under questioning by U.S. Rep .
Ted Poe , R - Humble , the attorney general of the United States , Eric Holder , admitted that he had n't read the Arizona law .
That 's amazing , since Holder had called for consideration of a lawsuit to declare unconstitutional the law he had n't read .
And a part of the opposition to the Arizona law , I think , comes from people who do n't want us to follow the rule of law in immigration matters .
This includes so - called sanctuary cities such as San Francisco , whose officials have criticized the law .
There are legitimate questions about the Arizona law .
Will it result in a tendency toward pretextual stops because officers are motivated to find immigration violations ?
I doubt it , but others are sure of it , and the answer is that it 's speculation either way .
We 'll have to see how it works .
Will individuals who are in the country illegally decline to report crimes , more so than they do now , as a result of the Arizona law ?
I doubt it , since a valid apprehension is required first , and since such people already are reluctant ; but others are sure they know the opposite .
And again , we 'll have to find out .
Meanwhile , the media 's erroneous characterization of the Arizona law does n't help anyone answer these serious questions at all .

I watched the Brazil v Ivory Coast match in the bar of a Cape Town media hotel on Sunday and , not that it was really needed , was given another reminder of what an impossible job referees have in modern football .
When Luis Fabiano broke through to score Brazil ’s second goal , the reaction of around 60 watching journalists ranged from joy to disappointment – but nobody was crying “ handball . ”
After three TV replays , suddenly it seemed that French referee Stephane Lannoy had blundered in missing what had now somehow become an “ obvious handball . ”
More replays , a second handling offence revealed , and it was a world conspiracy against African soccer .
Heads were shaken , insults hurled and Lannoy ’s competence ridiculed by the assembled throng of “ experts ” who had , to a man , also missed the offences in real time .
As the match degenerated into its late farce , Lannoy was again abused .
But even if the World Cup had been operating under Europa League rules with five match officials on duty , it would have been difficult to see everything that was going on .
The Ivorians were certainly putting in some tasty tackles , and some fouls , but the way Brazil manager Dunga was reacting on the sidelines one would have thought they had brought out machine guns .
Kaka then suffered what seemed an unjust second yellow and thus red card as TV replays showed Ivorian substitute Kader Keita hugely exaggerating his pain – actually deliberately misleading the officials by holding his face after the contact was with his chest – to get his opponent in trouble .
It is not the poor referee who should be criticised for buying the fakery but the players , who foul , dive , cheat and lie in a bid to gain an advantage then scream about injustice when an opponent does the same .
If there is any justice then FIFA should review the match , wipe off Kaka ’s red card and ban Keita .
However , the organisation that failed miserably to hand out any meaningful punishment to Brazilian Rivaldo after he delivered one of the most famous and blatantly ridiculous pieces of pretence to get Turkey ’s Hakan Unsul sent off after a ball hit his leg and he clutched his face in “ agony ” in the 2002 World Cup is unlikely to take the action most fans feel would be fair .

A new video has surfaced which shows a test subject in a testing facility playing a certain Modern Warfare 2 ( Pause at 0:41 seconds ) with his 3D glasses on .
After a few seconds the test subject apparently can’t take the 3Dness ( ? ) of the game ( Modern Warfare 2 ) and flips out .
At the end of the viral video you might notice “ PS4 ” which definitely does not mean Playstation 4 but could be referring to firmware update 4.0 .
We ca n’t offer you the video in 3D , kindly manage with inferior 1080 p HD youtube quality
The previous video which was made viral three days ago also showed some sort of new Playstation technology ( 3D ) being tested on another subject .
Both these videos most likely are being used as viral marketing tools for Sony ’s upcoming E3 event .

Astigmatizam je refrakcijska greška oka također nazivana cilindar .
U nastavku vam donosimo potpuni vodič ; saznajte uzroke , simptome , vrste i načine dijagnostike .
Također ćemo pojasniti mogućnosti korekcije s naočalama , kontaktnim lećama i laserskim zahvatom .
Sadržaj :
1 . Što je cilindar i zašto nastaje ?
Astigmatizam ili cilindar oka nastaje zbog nepravilno zakrivljene rožnice , koja zrake svjetla ne lomi u svim meridijanima jednako , a ponekad i zbog nepravilno zakrivljene očne leće .
Ova greška oka se često pogrešno naziva “ stigmatizam ” , ali ipak najčešće možemo čuti naziv cilindri .
Naziv cilindri je logičan , jer se astigmatizam korigira lećama s cilindričnom dioptrijom ( dioptrija pod određenim stupnjevima ) .
Još uvijek nije poznato zašto se neki ljudi rađaju s nepravilnom rožnicom , ali rizik je veći ako jedno ili oba roditelja imaju astigmatizam .
Također , veća je vjerojatnost nastanka kod preuranjeno rođene djece , kao i kod nedonoščadi .
2. Simptomi astigmatizma
Astigmatizam se najčešće pojavljuje kombinirano uz kratkovidnost ili dalekovidnost .
Simptomi su zamagljen i nejasan vid , deformirana slika , ili deformirana tiskana slova pri čitanju .
Kod blagog astigmatizma osoba ne primijeti uvijek postojanje poremećaja , jer zamagljen vid ispravlja akomodiranjem ( prilagodba očne leće za gledanje na blizinu ) .
Dok visoki stupanj astigmatizma uzrokuje značajne probleme s vidom i nemoguće ga je ne primijetiti .
Kod djece se pri dugotrajnom čitanju pojavljuje glavobolja i povećan umor .
Simptomi se mogu razlikovati kod svake osobe , ali osnovni simptomi uključuju :
3. Vrste astigmatizma
Pravilni ( regularni ) astigmatizam – slučaj kod više od 80 % ljudi sa astigmatizmom je pravilni astigmatizam , kada se dva glavna zamišljena meridijana nalaze pod pravim kutem .
Takav astigmatizam je najčešće podložan ispravljanju .
Ako glavni meridijani leže pod pravim kutem , ali su postavljeni koso , takav astigmatizam se naziva kosi astigmatizam .
Pravilni astigmatizam možemo podijeliti na :
Jednostavni astigmatizam – jedan meridijan je dalekovidan ili kratkovidan .
Složeni astigmatizam – oba meridijana su dalekovidna ili kratkovidna .
Miješani astigmatizam – jedan meridijan je dalekovidan , a drugi kratkovidan .
Nepravilni ( iregularni ) astigmatizam – dva glavna meridijana nisu okomita jedan na drugi .
Ovaj tip astigmatizma je uglavnom uzrokovan zbog bolesti rožnice ( keratokonus ) , ili nastaje kao posljedica ozljede ili upale rožnice .
Astigmatizam označavamo kao astigmatizam “ po pravilu ” , ako vertikalni meridijan jače lomi zrake svjetla od horizontalnog .
Kada je slučaj suprotan , odnosno kada horizontalni meridijan lomi zrake svjetla jače od vertikalnog meridijana , takav astigmatizam označavamo kao astigmatizam “ protiv pravila ” .
4. Astigmatizam kod djece
Djeca često neće ni shvatiti da imaju cilindre sve dok ne obave pregled vida .
Rana dijagnoza kod djece je važna , jer zamućen vid negativno utječe na čitanje i koncentraciju u školi .
Prema preporukama struke , prvi kompletan oftalmološki pregled treba obaviti u trećoj godini života .
Ukoliko nisu prisutni problemi s vidom pregled treba ponoviti sa 6 godina , te nakon toga svake godine do navr šenih 16 godina .
Korekcija astigmatizma kod djece je moguća s naočalama i/ili kontaktnim lećama .
Ovisno o jakosti astigmatizma i drugim čimbenicima , preporučuje se nošenje polutvrdih ili mekih kontaktnih leća .
5. Kako se dijagnosticira astigmatizam ?
Dijagnoza astigmatizma se vrši rutinskim pregledom vida .
Postoji nekoliko testova koje vaš oftalmolog ili optometrist mogu koristiti tijekom pregleda vida kako bi se utvrdila eventualna prisutnost astigmatizma .
Pregled za astigmatizam uključuje :
Kompjutersko mjerenje dioptrije
Kompjutersko mjerenje dioptrije vrši se uz pomoć uređaja koji se naziva autorefraktometar .
Uređaj će izmjeriti okvirnu dioptriju svakog oka zasebno .
Pregled je potpuno bezbolan i traje svega nekoliko minuta .
Subjektivno određivanje dioptrije
Subjektivno određivanje dioptrije vrši se uz pomoć optotipa koji mogu sadržavati slova , brojeve ili simbole .
Vaš oftalmolog ili optometrist će zatražiti od vas da pročitate slova s određene udaljenosti .
Uz pomoć izmjene stakalaca u probnom okviru , utvrditi će potrebnu korekciju astigmatizma za postizanje optimalne vidne oštrine .
Keratometrija
Keratometrija se vrši uz pomoć keratometra kako bi se izmjerila zakrivljenost rožnice oka .
Ova pretraga je nužna u slučaju probe kontaktnih leća , te je također potpuno bezbolna i neinvazivna .
Topografija
Topografija se vrši uz pomoć topografa koji fotografira rožnicu i analizira ju u nekoliko sekundi .
Ova pretraga se obično radi ukoliko postoji sumnja na keratokonus – degeneraciju rožnice koju karakterizira visoki astigmatizam .
Pretraga je bezbolna i neinvazivana .

6. Korekcija i liječenje astigmatizma
Pravilni astigmatizam se može korigirati dioptrijskim naočalama , toričnim kontaktnim lećama , ili kirur škim zahvatom .
Ta grana kirurgije se naziva refrakcijska kirurgija .
Korekcija nepravilnog astigmatizma je otežana , koriste se kontaktne leće , ponekad pomaže samo operacija .
Cilindrična dioptrija može biti stabilna , ali isto tako se stanje često pogoršava , zato je iznimno važno redovito posjećivati oftalmologa ili optometrista , zbog dobivanja potrebne korekcije .
Dioptrijske naočale
Dioptrijske naočale su najjednostavnija opcija , te su uglavnom prvi izbor .
Sadržavaju posebne cilindrične leće koje korigiraju dioptriju pod određenim kutom .
U slučaju prvih naočala s cilindričnim lećama potrebno je privikavanje , možete doživjeti male nesigurnosti kod kretanja .
Za potpunu prilagodbu je uglavnom dovoljno nekoliko dana nošenja .
Kontaktne leće
Kontaktne leće su obično bolji izbor kod viših cilindričnih dioptrija .
Kontaktne leće se nose direktno na oku i zbog toga pružaju jasniji i prirodniji vid .
Još jedna važna prednost u usporedbi s naočalama je šire vidno polje .
Dostupne su meke i polutvrde kontaktne leće .
Zamjenske meke kontaktne leće su dostupne do 2.75 dioptrija cilindra , a iznad toga se preporučuje nošenje polutvrdih leća .
Kod prisutnosti keratokonusa , dobra opcija su hibridne kontaktne leće .
Lasersko skidanje dioptrije
Zahvaljujući modernim tehnologijama , većina pacijenata ostvaruje izvrsne rezultate nakon laserske korekcije dioptrije .
Moguća je korekcija LASIK ili PRK metodom , ovisno o preporuci oftalmologa .
Laserska korekcija se obavlja kod osoba starijih od 18 godina .
Zaključak
Astigmatizam je vrlo uobičajena refrakcijska greška oka , jer većina ljudi ima određeni stupanj astigmatizma .
Korekcija je nužna samo kada ometa vidnu oštrinu , a tzv. fiziološki astigmatizam nije potrebno korigirati .
Ukoliko ste primijetili bilo kakve probleme s vidom posjetite vašeg oftalmologa ili optometrista , jer čak i najmanje dioptrije mogu imati negativan utjecaj .
Odrasli bi trebali obavljati preglede očiju svake dvije godine , a nakon navršene 40-e godine života , kontrole vida je preporučljivo obavljati jednom godišnje .

Perhaps the greatest freedom in a democracy is freedom of speech .
Throughout our nation ’s history , people have died fighting not only for our right to speak , but for our right to be heard .
The Internet is the greatest communications network ever created because it allows us to speak for ourselves without first asking permission from corporate gatekeepers .
The Internet ’s importance as a forum for speech is the result of the principle called net neutrality , which prevents the phone and cable companies that provide Internet service from discriminating against content online or interfering with the free flow of Internet traffic .
But net neutrality and the open Internet may be in serious trouble .
Julius Genachowski , the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , has been holding closed - door meetings with Verizon , AT&T , Comcast , and Google that could pave the way for a corporate takeover of the Internet .
The big phone and cable companies want to kill net neutrality so they can control and manipulate the content you can access on the Internet .
Those who can pay will have their websites sped up ; those who ca n’t may have their sites slowed down or even blocked .
Guess who ’ll be able to pay that extra cost ?
The big corporations .
Meanwhile , the small or startup business or the new nonprofit organization will be pushed to the digital margins .
The FCC , our nation ’s communications watchdog agency , is currently trying to modernize its Internet policy framework .
Unless it succeeds , the phone and cable companies will be free to censor us online , block the websites we want to see , and track the websites we visit without disclosing their practices .
The agency is under immense pressure from the lobbyists to take control of the Internet away from Internet users and turn it over to corporations .
The Center for Responsive Politics reports that these companies spent more than $ 20 million lobbying the federal government during the first quarter of 2010 alone .
Many of these lobbyists enjoy a direct line to decision - makers in Congress and at the FCC .
Glance at a list of the top staffers working on telecommunications just a few years ago , and you ’ll find name after name now representing industry , unconcerned about advocating for positions they used to oppose .
The Sunlight Foundation reported that 72 percent of the lobbyists hired by AT&T , Comcast , Time Warner Cable , Verizon , the National Cable & Telecommunications Association , and the U.S. Telecom Association – the leading opponents of net neutrality –have previous government experience .
This figure includes 18 former lawmakers and 48 former Hill staffers who worked for the House and Senate commerce committees that provide congressional oversight of the FCC .
The FCC has the power to do the right thing .
What the American people want is someone to stand up and fight for them against corporate corruption –whether from BP , AIG or Comcast .
It needs to protect the Internet from a corporate takeover .
It 's very warm in Central Europe - high temperatures in Pilsen reach 35 °C - and the global mean temperatures are close to the July 2009 values which were pretty warm .
But the sea ice tells us a different story .
For several months , The Cryosphere Today has been showing the decline of the Arctic sea ice .
Several months ago , the anomaly grew and almost reached zero but it stayed slightly negative throughout 2010 and has been dropping , reaching - 1.5 million squared kilometers a week ago or so .
However , the figure has been rising since that time and the newest reading is - 1.333 .
At any rate , the Arctic has returned to a " shortage of ice " while the Antarctic sea ice boasts the good old tendency to grow .
It 's currently at +1.337 - so the total global sea ice anomaly is actually positive again , despite the warm global mean temperatures .
Imagine that .
Several decades of news reports about armageddon and melting ice and after 30 years , we 're exactly where we were in 1980 . ;-)
-- Senator Ashburn , in the L.A. Times interview
[ from a dispatch carried on BakersfieldNow.com , " home of KBAK & KFFX Eyewitness News " ]
Change of course : Roy Ashburn urges support for gay rights
By DON THOMPSON , Associated Press
May 27 , 2010
SACRAMENTO , Calif . ( AP ) -- Sen. Roy Ashburn spoke out passionately in favor of gay rights during a legislative session .
The Republican from Bakersfield was forced to reveal he is gay after a recent arrest for drunken driving .
On Thursday , he urged his fellow senators to " rise above discrimination " and support letting gays serve openly in the military .
Ashburn also weighed in on a bill designed to protect clergy who refuse to perform gay marriages .
" I am no longer willing or able to remain silent on issues that affect sexual orientation , the rights of individuals , and so I , um , I 'm doing something that is quite different and foreign to me .
And it 's highly emotional , " Ashburn told fellow senators .
Ashburn said he would not be speaking at all were it not for his drunken driving arrest in March after he left a gay - friendly nightclub near the state Capitol .
. . .
in the early morning hours of March 3 .
He was arrested for DUI after he'd left a gay club , and soon thereafter acknowledged that he was gay .
His DUI cost him his driver 's license for a time and put him back on a bike , pedaling his life in an altogether new direction .
Something happened that I guess caused me to realize that .
When I was in sixth grade , the police had a raid in the sand dunes [ near San Luis Obispo ] and a bunch of gay men were arrested , probably charged with indecent activity .
That sticks in my mind — the publicity and the shame around it .
One of my teachers was one of the people .
The talk among the kids , the talk among the adults , the talk in the community , the press — at that time the choice was pretty clear :
If you were gay and open , it was a life of shame , ridicule , innuendo about molesting and perversion .
It was a dark life .
Given that choice of whether you come out or whether you 're in secret , I mean , there really was n't a choice .
The answer is both yes and no .
I was married and had children .
And I had a career and a passion .
I also had a huge secret .
But given my circumstances and my responsibilities , it was n't an overwhelming issue for me .
The desires were always there , but my focus was primarily on — well , pretty selfishly — on me and my career and my family .
The best I can do is to say that I was hiding .
I was so in terror I could not allow any attention to come my way .
So any measure that had to do with the subject of sexual orientation was an automatic " no " vote .
I was paralyzed by this fear , and so I voted without even looking at the content .
The purpose of government is to protect the rights of people under the law , regardless of our skin color , national origin , our height , our weight , our sexual orientation .
This is a nation predicated on the belief that there is no discrimination on those characteristics , and so my vote denied people equal treatment , and I 'm truly sorry for that .
I 'm just trying to tell the truth from the reality of the life I 've lived , which has been an amazing life .
I have had the privilege of serving in elective office for 26 years and dealing with important legislation , and I did so with a huge secret and in many ways a career built upon lies and deceit .
Now that the truth is known , actually I am comfortable talking about these things .
SACRAMENTO , Calif . ( AP ) -- Sen. Roy Ashburn spoke out passionately in favor of gay rights during a legislative session .
The Republican from Bakersfield was forced to reveal he is gay after a recent arrest for drunken driving .
On Thursday , he urged his fellow senators to " rise above discrimination " and support letting gays serve openly in the military .
Ashburn also weighed in on a bill designed to protect clergy who refuse to perform gay marriages .
" I am no longer willing or able to remain silent on issues that affect sexual orientation , the rights of individuals , and so I , um , I 'm doing something that is quite different and foreign to me .
And it 's highly emotional , " Ashburn told fellow senators .
Ashburn said he would not be speaking at all were it not for his drunken driving arrest in March after he left a gay - friendly nightclub near the state Capitol .
" Does anyone really believe that a person 's sexual orientation affects their ability to serve our nation and protect our freedom ? " he said , supporting a resolution urging Congress to change the military 's policy on gays .
" The answer is that being gay or straight has nothing to do with ability , devotion , courage , honor , skill and loyalty , the characteristics that I think we would all agree are desirable and necessary for those who serve in our national military , " Ashburn said .
" The current policy of ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' is clearly out of date and discriminatory . "
He cited conservative icon Barry Goldwater 's view that government should stay out of people 's private lives .
" It calls upon our nation 's best instincts and seeks to correct a basic discrimination that is hurtful to people and to our country , " he said of SJR9 , the resolution by Sen.
Christine Kehoe , D - San Diego , who is openly gay .
" I respectfully ask that we rise above discrimination and vote aye on this resolution . "
In this context it 's good to hear the last words of Ashburn 's quoted by the L.A. Times 's Patt Morrison :
" I do n't know that I 've ever felt more optimistic about the future for myself .
I do n't know what the future holds , but I think it 's going to be incredible . "
#
My agenda for today was an update on the state of the " conventional wisdom " on anti-incumbent fever , but that will have to wait till tomorrow .
( I wish we could always shove the conventional wisdom out of sight this easily . )
All I really have in mind for today is a gut reaction to Howie 's morning post -- specifically , the large chunk of interview he reproduced by the 's Patt Morrison with recently self - outed California State Sen .
Roy Ashburn , whose " life as a ' family values ' politician all but ended months ago , " Patt recalls -- Howie has repeatedly recommended former Rep. Bob Bauman 's post - traumatic book The Gentleman from Maryland : The Conscience of a Gay Conservative , written after he'd come to grips withignominious self - outing , and the life of repression and denial that preceded it .
I gather from Howie that Bauman achieved some real understanding of the way he'd screwed up a large chunk of his life , and hurt a lot of people who did n't deserve to be hurt , by pretending to be someone other than he was , and in pursuit of that pretense donning the guise of a rabidly homophobic political warrior .
I 'm embarrassed to say that I 've never actually read Bauman 's book , but in the wake of the Ashburn interview , I 've just ordered a copy .
( You can find them dirt - cheap on amazon.com . )
Because what I find so fascinating about the Ashburn interview is how little he can muster to say about his long period of what we might call professional homophobia .
It 's not that he 's inarticulate , just barely articulate on this subject -- and understandably so , given that he 's probably only just getting past the " my life as a train wreck " stage .
Listen again as Patt points out , after establishing Ashburn 's fascination with politics from his earliest memories , that " you must have realized a public career was incompatible with being open about your sexual preferences " :
And when he was elected to public office himself , " Were your sexual preferences in the back of your mind , or did you just go about your business ?
" Now Ashburn is set up for the crucial subject of his horrible record on every subject relating to the normal rights of gay people as citizens .
What a way to live !
Is it possible not to feel empathy for how hard it must have been ?
It does n't excuse his professional homophobia , but now that he 's come out the other side , it 's hard not to wish him well .
Not only is he dealing honestly , finally , with who he is , but he says he 's dealing with his alcohol - abuse problem , which you have to figure is not unrelated .
As I 've said repeatedly , it seems to me that the dramatic shift in public attitudes toward LGBT folk has been largely attributable to the growing awareness of straight folk thatrepresentatives of the once - exotic " other . "
They 're coworkers , friends , and family members , and once you know them as actual people , as opposed to the grotesque caricatures fobbed off by the masters of social orthodoxy , it turns out that they 're people just like any other people -- some good , some bad , most somewhere in between , just like everybody else .
It has to be scary as well as deeply shameful for not just closeted by positivelyguys like Bob Bauman and Roy Ashburn to accept that ill - informed , malignant characterization of " the other " and applying it .
This of course is the " internalized homophobia " that every LGBT person has to cope with -- and let me say once again ( as I did most recently in a post called " Maybe it 's not that mysterious why the upper ranks of the GOP and the Far Right are overflowing with homophobic closet cases " ) that for me nobody has made this more understandable than Mike Signorile , whose " Case for Outing on All Levels , " in the June , Howie cited again this morning .
I 'm thrilled in dealing with younger gay men to note how dramatically lower the internalized - homophobia quotient has become .
The less of it there is to overcome , the better shot the victim has of getting beyond it .
And that manufactured shame does n't do anyone any good , except for primarily religion - peddling creeps who exploit homophobia for their personal advantage .
To return to that May 27 AP piece , reporter Don Thompson notes : Earlier on , Thompson reported :
Labels : Ashburn , Bauman , GOP homophobia , homophobia , internalized homophobia , Michelangelo Signorile

Just as I am a Scrum fan I am also a fan of the Pomodoro technique .
The Pomodoro technique is a personal time management method inspired by agile practices such as the backlog , the sprints and making the work priorities visible and explicit .
Pomodoro means tomato in Italian and the Pomodoro technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo .
A short explanation of how you use the Pomodoro technique to manage your day :
In the morning you make a backlog , prioritize it and estimate it in number of Pomodoros .
A Pomodoro is an uninterrupted time span of 25 minutes .
Then you start work : work for 25 minutes then take break – if you are interrupted handle the interruption in a number of specific ways depending on the type of interruption .
Write down how many pomodoros you use on every task and make notes about interruptions .
At the end of the day take some time to reflect on what you have done , how long it took you to do it and what you could do better , document and put in an archive .
This is a great technique to use if you are coming home from work not sure what you have accomplished and how your time was spent .
This way you make sure to document your day , think about your priorities and compare them to your actual work done .
The data collection side of this technique can also be used to assess the consequences of a change you have made to your habits or working environment .
You can read more about the Pomodoro technique in this free e-book written by the originator himself .
He has also made a cheat sheet useful for talking to colleagues or friends about the technique :
As this technique is quite popular with software developers there is a lot of software implementations to assist you in using this technique : several iPhone apps and versions of the timer used to measure the 25 minutes .
I have used this technique when I had to write my thesis at the university and it worked well for me .
The e-book is easily read and even though the technique is difficult in practice , the learning curve is not steep .
The first pomodoro was the hardest one but the technique was easily picked up .
Maybe you should just try it – I would love to hear your experiences .

Good , then sit down for a moment : we 're hearing from a trusted source that the thoroughly - leaked Motorola Droid 2 for Verizon will be launching on August 12 -- although it seems to be something of a soft launch , because marketing efforts are n't scheduled to kick in until a week and a half later on the 23rd .
What 's even more interesting , though , is that there 'll be a Star Wars edition of the phone launching with a white R2 - D2 on the back .
For the record , this is n't the first time Verizon has toyed with the Droid line 's Star Wars origins ; Motorola actually had to license the name from Lucasfilm , and to promote the original phone , Big Red sent around remote - control Artoos last year to various media outlets .
What we do n't know is whether the special edition will be launching at the same time as the stock version -- so if the plain - vanilla Droid 2 comes out first , that might automatically make the decision of which to buy for some folks .
What about you ?

Mrs Clinton said : " I 'm not saying that they 're at the highest levels , but I believe that somewhere in this government are people who know where Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda is , where Mullah Omar and the leadership of the Afghan Taliban is , and we expect more co-operation to help us bring to justice , capture or kill those who attacked us on 9/11 .

This is the first of a series of posts about business intelligence tools , particularly OLAP ( or online analytical processing ) tools using MySQL and other free open source software .
OLAP tools are a part of the larger topic of business intelligence , a topic that has not had a lot of coverage on MPB .
Because of this , I am going to start out talking about these topics in general , rather than getting right to gritty details of their performance .
I plan on covering the following topics :
Introduction to OLAP and business intelligence .
( this post ) Identifying the differences between a data warehouse , and a data mart .
Introduction to MDX queries and the kind of SQL which a ROLAP tool must generate to answer those queries .
Performance challenges with larger databases , and some ways to help performance using aggregation .
Using materialized views to automate that aggregation process .
Comparing the performance of OLAP with and without aggregation over multiple MySQL storage engines at various data scales .
What is BI ?
Chances are that you have heard the term business intelligence .
Business intelligence ( or BI ) is a term which encompasses many different tools and methods for analyzing data , usually presenting it in a way that is easily consumed by upper management .
This analysis is often used to determine how effectively the business has been at meeting certain performance goals , and to forecast how they will do in the future .
To put it another way the tools are designed to provide insight about the business process , hence the name .
Probably the most popular BI activity for web sites is click analysis .
As far as BI is concerned , this series of posts focuses on OLAP analysis and in a lesser sense , on data warehousing .
Data warehouses often provide the information upon which OLAP analysis is performed , but more on this in post # 2 .
OLAP ?
What is that ?
OLAP is an acronym which stands for online analytical processing .
OLAP analysis , which is really just another name for multidimensional analysis , consists of displaying summary aggregations of the data broken down into different groups .
A typical OLAP analysis might show “ sale total , by year , by sales rep , by product category ” .
OLAP analysis is usually used for reporting on current data , looking at historical trends and trying to make predictions about future trends .
Multidimensional Analysis
Multidimensional analysis is a form of statistical analysis .
In multidimensional analysis samples representing a particular measure are compared or broken down into different dimensions .
For example , in a sales analysis , the “ sale amount ” is a measure .
Measures are always aggregated values .
That is , total sales might be expressed as SUM ( sale_amt ) .
This is because the SUM of the individual sales will be grouped along different dimensions , such as by year or by product .
I ’m getting a little ahead of myself .
Before we talk about measures and dimensions , we should talk about the two ways in which this information can be stored .
There are two main ways to store multidimensional data for OLAP analysis
OLAP servers typically come in two basic flavors .
Some servers have specialized data stores which store data in a form which is highly effective for multidimensional analysis .
These servers are termed MOLAP and they tend to have exceptional performance due to their specialized data store .
Almost all MOLAP solutions pre-compute many ( or even all ) of the possible answers to multi-dimensional queries .
Palo is an example of an open source version of this technology .
ESSbase is an example of closed source product .
MOLAP servers often feature extensive compression of data which can improve performance .
Loading data into a MOLAP server usually takes a very long time because many of the answers in the cube must be calculated .
The extra time spent during the load is usually called “ processing ” time .
A relational OLAP ( or ROLAP ) server uses data stored in an RDBMS .
These systems trade the performance of a multidimensional store for the convenience of an RDBMS .
These servers almost always query over a database which is structured as a STAR or snowflake type schema .
To go back to the sales analysis example above , in a STAR schema the facts about the sales would be stored in the fact table , and the list of customers and products would be stored in separate dimension tables .
Some ROLAP servers support the aggregation of data into additional tables , and can use the tables automatically .
These servers can approach the performance of MOLAP with the convenience of ROLAP , but there are still challenges with this approach .
The biggest challenges are the amount of time that it takes to keep the tables updated and in the complexity of the many scripts or jobs which might be necessary to keep the tables in sync .
Part five of my series will introduce materialized views which attempt to address these challenges in a manageable way .
What makes a ROLAP so great ?
An OLAP server usually returns information to the user as a ‘ pivot table ‘ or ‘ pivot report ’ .
While you could create such a report in a spreadsheet , the ROLAP tool is designed to deal with millions or even billions of rows of data , much more than a spreadsheet can usually handle .
MOLAP servers usually require that all , or almost all of the data must fit it memory .
Another difference is the ease by which this analysis is constructed .
You do n’t necessarily have to write queries or drag and drop a report together in order to analyze multidimensional data using an OLAP tool .
Data before pivoting :
Data summarized in pivot form :
ROLAP tools use star schema
As I said before , a sale amount would be considered a measure , and it would usually be aggregated with SUM .
The other information about the sale , such as the product , when it was sold and to whom it was sold would be defined in dimension tables .
The fact table contains columns which are joined to the dimension tables , such as product_id and customer_id .
These are often defined as foreign keys from the fact table to the dimension tables .
A note about degenerate dimensions :
Any values in the fact table that do n’t join to dimensions are either considered degenerate dimensions or measures .
In the example below the status of the order is a degenerate dimension .
A degenerate dimension is stored as an ENUM in many cases .
In the example below that there is no actual dimension table which includes the two different order statuses .
Such a dimension would add an extra join , which is expensive .
Any yes / no field and / or fields with a very low cardinality ( such as gender or order status ) will probably be stored in the fact table instead of in a dedicated dimension .
In the “ pivot data ” example above , all the dimensions are degenerate : gender , region , style , date .
Often a dimension will include redundant information to make reporting easier , a process called “ denormalization ” .
Hierarchical information may be stored in a single dimension .
For example , a dimension for products may include both the category AND a sub-category .
A time dimension includes year , month and quarter .
You can create multiple different hierarchies from a single dimension .
This allows ‘ drill down ’ into the dimension .
By default the data would be summarized by year , but you can drill down to quarter or month level aggregation .
The screenshots here in the jPivot ( an OLAP cube browser ) documentation can give you a better idea about the display of data .
The examples break down sales by product , by category , and by region .
The information is presented in such a fashion that it can be “ drilled into ” and “ filtered on ” to provide an easy to use interface to the underlying data .
Graphical display of the data as pie , line or bar charts is possible .
Focusing on ROLAP .
This is the MySQL performance blog , and as such an in depth discussion of MOLAP technology is not particularly warranted here .
Our discussion will focus on Mondrian .
Mondrian is an open source ROLAP server featuring an in - memory OLAP cache .
Mondrian is part of the Pentaho open source business intelligence suite .
Mondrian is also used by other projects such as Wabit and Jaspersoft .
If you are using open source BI then you are probably already using Mondrian .
Closed source ROLAP servers include Microstrategy , Microsoft Analysis Services and Oracle BI .
Mondrian speaks MDX , olap4j and XML for analysis .
This means that there is a very high chance that your existing BI tools ( if you have them ) will work with it .
MDX is a query language that looks similar to SQL but is actually very different .
Olap4j is an OLAP interface for java applications .
XML for analysis ( XMLA ) is an industry standard analytical interface originally created by Microsoft , SAS and Hyperion .
Whats next ?
Next we ’ll talk about the difference between data marts and data warehouses .
The former are usually used for OLAP analysis , but they can be fundamentally related to a warehouse .

An Iranian woman convicted of adultery has been sentenced to death by stoning .
If carried out the sentence would be the first known stoning to take place in the Islamic Republic in years .
Sakineh Mohamamadi e Ashtiani , a 43 - year - old mother of two in the northwestern Iranian city of Tabriz , was accused of having extramarital relations with two men who ended up killing her husband .
Infidelity is illegal in Iran , and usually punished with lashes and prison time .
While the Iranian penal code allows for the death sentence in infidelity cases , execution by stoning is rare .
The case , first leaked to Radio Farda by women ’s rights activist Soheila Vahdati , began in 2005 when Ashtiani was arrested for having " illicit relationships . "
She was convicted by a local court a year later and sentenced to 99 lashes and an unknown amount of time in prison , where she has remained since .
Following the original case , however , Ashtiani and her boyfriends were accused of murdering her husband .
Ashtiani was convicted and sentenced to death by stoning .
She has denied any wrongdoing but reportedly asked local authorities for a pardon , stating simply “ If I have done any wrong , I repent . "
The request for clemency was denied .
Mina Ahadi , an advocate for the International Committee Against Stoning , said the family has no news as to the status of the case .
“ I have been in contact with her children and her son went to Tehran today to speak with the authorities about his mothers case , ” she told The Media Line .
“ But basically we are just waiting .
” Ashtiani’s two children , Fasride and Sajjad , 16 and 20 respectively , have been leading the campaign for her release .
Mohammad Mostafaie , a prominent Tehran - based human rights lawyer representing Ashtiani , told The Media Line he was unable to comment on the case , but has prevously claimed that his client ’s execution is imminent .
“ It was n’t announced publicly so nobody knows much about the process through which the sentence or verdict is handed down , ” Niusha Boghrati , an Iranian journalist who covers human rights issues told The Media Line .
“ Local women ’s rights activists found out about the verdict and rumors started in the blogosphere that this woman is facing stoning .
Then a famous human rights lawyer , Mohammad Mostafaie , went to Tabriz and confirmed that this woman has been sentenced to death by stoning .
” According to Article 83 of the Laws of Islamic Punishment in Iran , ratified in 1991 , adultery is punishable by stoning .
Iranian human rights advocates point out , however , that murder is punishable by hanging .
They allege that Ashtiani ’s adultery case was reopened during her murder trial , despite her having already been punished .
“ What ’s interesting about this case is that this woman had already been sentenced to lashes for adultery , ” Boghrati said .
“ She appealed to a higher court .
They did not decrease her sentence but on the contrary took it to the next level , which in the case of adultery is death by stoning .
” Hamid Tehrani , the Iran editor of Global Voices , which aggregates citizen journalism , said stoning is extremely rare .
“ It ’s not the usual way of punishing crimes but it ’s up to the discretion of the judge , ” he told The Media Line .
“ It ’s important to note that it ’s not just women who get stoned and it is very unpopular in Iran .
” Boghrati , the journalist , argued the new interest of Iranian media in the case did not bode well for Ashtiani .
“ Stoning , or other intense abuses of human rights that happen in Iran , are not only about the Islamic Republic insisting on carrying out the sentence itself , it ’s a way for the regime to defy civil rights activists and civil society , ” he said .
“ In that , media attention of cases like this actually increases the chances that this woman will be executed because the government wants to prove to civil society groups that no matter how hard you try , and how much support you get from the UN or international human rights groups , we still have the capacity to curb you .
” Kourosh Ziabari , an Iranian journalist and political correspondent with Foreign Policy Journal , agreed .
“ The core idea behind punishment is the same internationally , ” he told The Media Line .
“ Countries that exercise such punishments are principally interested in maintaining the social security of society .
The focus of media outlets on the issue just magnifies and amplifies the exercise of such punishments in Iran . ” “ Everything is not perfect here but Iran is very advanced in women ’s rights when compared to other Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt , neither of which receive regular condemnation from the international community over human rights because they are allied with the US , ” Ziabari continued .
“ This form of punishment is not that common in Iran , while many other Islamic countries regularly use stoning as a form of punishment .
” Meanwhile in Rasht , another major city in northwestern Iran , women made headlines after they successfully resisted an attempt by the local Morality Police to arrest a woman .
The incident , which was captured on video , escalated after the police began beating the woman ’s mother , who attempted to stop the police from arresting the woman .
A crowd which had gathered around reacted strongly to this and began booing the police and attempting to damage their vehicle .
The cops gave up on trying to arrest the woman and drove away , their back window broken , to the cheers of the crowd .
Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy
Not all types of bankruptcy are the same .
For example , Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves the liquidation of assets through an appointed trustee to pay off debts .
Chapter 13 involves a payment plan arranged by the court to pay back at least a portion of the debt .
Each person who files for bankruptcy will need to take a means test , which determines their ability to pay off their debt .
Chapter 7 bankruptcy is generally for those who have little or no income to cover their debt .
Those who have a good income may not qualify for Chapter 7 and may be able to enroll for Chapter 13 .
As an experienced Salt Lake City Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 lawyer , I can carefully examine your situation and make an assessment on how to proceed .
When we asked Vampire Weekend 's Ezra Koenig about the woman on the cover of Contra last October , he said , " I do n't want to give away all the details about the photo just yet , but I learned that she 's now living in Malibu . "
Now we learn that the cover star , a woman named Kirsten Kennis , is suing the band and the photographer who took the shot for more than $ 2 million , according to a TMZ report .
Apparently , Kennis filed the lawsuit in L.A. County Superior Court yesterday and , though a photo release form clearing the shot does exist , she claims the signature on the document is a forgery .
Vampire Weekend declined to comment on the matter at this time .
During a keynote address at WWDC today , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the next revision of the company 's iconic iPhone hardware .
Dubbed " iPhone 4 , " Jobs called the new iPhone model " the biggest leap since the original iPhone . "
He said that the new device has over 100 new features , but he detailed just eight of them during his presentation .
Physically , the new iPhone resembles the prototypes that were leaked earlier by Gizmodo and Tinh t?.
In particular , Jobs noted that it was 9.3 mm thick , or 24 percent thinner than the iPhone 3GS .
Jobs called the iPhone 4 the " thinnest smartphone ever . "
As expected , it features a camera and LED " flash " on the back , as well as a front - facing camera ( more on that later ) .
The stainless steel band that surrounds the outside rim of the device is part of an integrated antenna system for improved reception .
Both the back and front surfaces have improved scratch - resistant coatings .
Also as rumored , iPhone 4 has four times as many pixels on its 960 x 640 pixel , IPS LCD " Retina " display compared to previous iPhones .
That gives the 3.5 " display a resolution of 326 pixels per inch , enough to achieve print - like quality for graphics and text .
It has an 800:1 contrast ratio , another 4 x improvement over the iPhone 3GS .
Existing apps will get improved rendering for text and native controls when running under iPhone OS 4.0 , though updating custom controls and graphics will be up to developers to get the best results .
" This is going to set the standard for displays for the next several years , " Jobs said .
Internally , the iPhone is now powered by Apple 's A4 mobile processor , the same snappy processor that powers the iPad .
Because the power efficiency of the A4 is combined with a larger battery , Apple claims 40 percent more talk time on 3G — from 5 to 7 hours for the iPhone 4 .
It gets about 6 hours of 3G browsing or 10 hours of WiFi browsing .
Media mavens will get up to 40 hours of music or 10 hours of video playback .
The battery is good for 300 hours of standby time .
In addition to the A4 processor and improved battery , Apple is updating several of the internal components .
WiFi is upgraded to 802.11n speeds , and the cell radios support up to 7.2 M bps down , 5.8 M bps up HSPA +.
Dual microphones are included for ambient noise cancellation .
And Apple has added a MEMS - based gyroscope for six - axis motion sensing , in addition to the accelerometer of previous iPhones .
New CoreMotion APIs are available in iPhone OS 4.0 to take advantage of the new motion - sensing capabilities .
As we suspected , Apple has added a 5MP , backside illuminating sensor to the iPhone 's camera hardware .
In addition to vastly improved low - light shots , the camera is also paired with an LED flash .
The camera is capable of recording 720p HD video at 30 fps , and can use the LED as a " torch " lightsource .
Adding to the software features of the camera , Apple has added digital zoom to take advantage of some of those ( in many cases ) extraneous megapixels .
It has also added tap - to - focus for video recording in addition to still image capture .
Along with the improved image capture tools , Apple is launching iMovie for iPhone — a complete video editing environment complete with scene transitions , editable titles , themes , and more .
The app will sell for $ 4.99 via the App Store , presumably when iPhone OS 4.0 becomes widely available .
As for " one more thing , " Jobs announced a new video chat feature called " FaceTime . "
The new feature works between one iPhone 4 and another iPhone 4 over WiFi — so no compatibility with older iPhones , and you wo n't have to worry about video calls bumping up against AT &T 's new data caps .
" FaceTime is gonna be WiFi-only in 2010 , " Jobs explained .
" We 've gotta work a little bit with the cellular providers to get ready for the future . "
Apple is making FaceTime an open industry - wide standard , and expects to ship tens of millions of compatible devices ( we 're guessing a compatible iPod touch is coming this fall ) this year .
" I grew up here in the US with The Jetsons and Star Trek and communicators , dreaming about video calling , and it 's real now ! "
Jobs said during a demo with Apple SVP of industrial design Jonathan Ive. Jobs suggested that FaceTime could be embraced by old college buddies or those in long - distance relationships .
However , Jobs showed a video of the true target demographic : families with children .
Jobs also noted that those who rely on sign language to communicate could benefit from the feature , though a stand would be needed to sign fully with both hands .
Pricing is as expected , with a 16GB iPhone 4 running $ 199 with a two - year contract ( in the US ) and a 32 GB model selling for $ 299 with a contract .
The iPhone 3GS moves in to replace the iPhone 3G at $ 99 with a contract .
( Expect comparable pricing worldwide depending on contract options . )
AT&T is offering customers who would be eligible for a new iPhone within 6 months of June 24 an early upgrade option without a price penalty — a nice move after frustrating many users with recent 3G data pricing changes .
i Phone 4 will be available in the previously revealed white and black colors .
Pre-orders begin June 15 , with phones shipping June 24 in the US France , Germany , UK , Japan .
It will roll out to 18 more countries in July , 24 more in August , and 40 more in September .

One of my favorite games at E3 in 2008 was You 're in the Movies .
When it was revealed at Microsoft 's media presentation I was charmed by the idea of a game taking an isolated set of actions and , by changing the aesthetic context , giving them new meaning .
The arrangement of disconnected arm waving , facial gestures , and jogging into a semi- coherent narrative is very close to the center of what I 've always thought games can do better than anything else .
It 's the experience of art made literal ; giving new and unexpected meaning to something usually glanced past .
Games typically use this model to affect difficulty .
Simple actions become increasingly more difficult as more obstacles are built into levels .
It 's rare that a game advances by creating new emotional context for its repeated mechanics .
see deal Red Dead Redemption : Game of the Year Edition - PlayStation 3 $ 19.99 on Gamestop
Big+sky +country .+
Like all open world games , Red Dead Redemption is most convincingly about navigation .
The game is at its best when it gets out of players ' ways and lets them wander through a world that , in motion , is a beautiful reduction of nature .
The sun is continually moving , broken by leafy branches one moment , dampened by gray clouds and falling snow the next .
The sound of the The game is thoughtfully designed to a scale that ensures these subtle transitions are always noticeable .
I 'd set a waypoint on the map and trot off through the world , enjoying the non-competitive reward of a pretty picture controlled by my thumb 's whimsy .
It reminds me of Endless Ocean , in which the simple pleasure of moving through space and seeing it revealed in new angles is reward enough .
In these moments the world is filled with thematic possibility , the terrible stress of trying to build an isolated civilization in the dusty wastes combined with a foreboding of the depravity it sometimes produces .
When I stopped my horse to accept a mission , however , Redemption became a disastrous work of episodic gunplay and sarcasm .
If you were to take out the navigation and string together all of the missions as a series of linearly connected levels it would be stultifying .
The ruminative beauty and scale of Redemption 's open world becomes obscuring and mechanically absurd in the dozens of missions that ask players to kill a set number of bandits .
The right analog stick that is so wonderfully responsive when panning the camera around my horse becomes a hyper - sensitive white speck that requires a heavy auto - aim function just to make it manageable .
The sauntering animations that make it easier to think of the cowboy in the screen as a living creature become nonsensical in the heat of combat .
In almost every gunfight I 'd find myself steering John Marston into a barrel or flower pot I had n't seen with the camera facing the opposite way .
I 'd spend a second or more correcting the camera to see what was happening , wait another second to watch his walking animation finish so I could regain control and then aim him to where I 'd wanted him to go in the first place , tapping on the sprint button to make it happen faster .
Meanwhile , the screen fills with red as John absorbs enemy gunfire without a flinch .
He can't stumble around a flower pot but he can take a rifle shot to the back and keep his feet .
If you think these are cheap criticisms , I agree with you .
Every game in the world has some glaring mechanical inconsistencies that can be discovered .
It 's not the sluggish animations or the nanny - ing auto - aim that really bother me ; it 's the lack of any emotional experience in the combat missions to draw me back from my momentary disbelief .
The shooting missions , which , after a promising first hour of pastoral busy work , predominate the game and they are utterly robotic .
The world where I can ride around in the desert looking at rabbits scamper on the horizon , stop to pick a rare flower , and then look up and watch a bulbous knot of rainclouds darken the sky cannot be the same place I stop periodically to kill seventeen banditos on behalf of a rapist and his corrupt soldiers .
When a mechanical shortcoming adds complication to that unforgivable pretext , I reach a point where I no longer want to extend my suspension of disbelief to the people who 've created this world .
There 's irony in that statement as nothing compels me to complete story missions .
I 'm free to play Redemption as a reflective wandering game for as long as I please .
It 's me who chooses to go back to Augistin Allende , Nigel West Dickens , and Harold MacDougal to ask what 's next .
It 's something in my desire to keep the thread unspooling that makes me willing to endure the moral degradation of serving subhumans .
I wanted to take part in the story .
I knew when starting the game things would end poorly as they are bound to in any story whose title that contains the word " redemption . "
Redemption is a cynical story of failure , revenge , and its ultimate futility .
It 's also a story of heavy sarcasm ( not irony ) , flaccid social stereotypes ( a drunken Irishman , a corrupt Mexican colonel , a self - obsessed revolutionary poet , a stoic Indian , a pig - faced incompetent with a birth defect , a depraved " Yankee " intellectual ) , and pleasureless debauchery .
Many of the main characters in the plot are n't meant to be humans but tools with which Rockstar can make a few dirty jokes .
To its credit , there are more empathetic moments in Redemption than any other Rockstar game I loved discovering Zhou , the opium - addicted indentured servant from China longing to pay off his debt and return home to his true love .
I was happy to reach the end of the game and discover John 's wife was an ex-prostitute still prone to jealousy and deprecating jabs of intimacy .
I liked the final turn of Dutch , an ageing outlaw who retreats into the snowy mountains and induces renegade Indians to join his directionless cause .
A Texas border town police chief and members of Mexican drug cartel cells operating in Houston and across the state are among 429 accused traffickers arrested as part of a nationwide sweep this week , federal authorities announced Thursday .
The captures are the culmination of a multitude of investigations and 2,200 arrests over the past 22 months .
Investigators uncovered schemes that included using fake school buses , cloned company vehicles and bogus bails of hay to move drugs north , and cash and guns south into Mexico .
According to the U.S. Department of Justice , cities in which arrests were made this week included Houston , El Paso , Corpus Christi and McAllen .
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said 3,000 agents fanned out in 16 states on Wednesday alone to arrest the most recent 429 people .
“ Our aim was to target not just cartel operations , but the networks of individuals across the United States the cartels tap to distribute drugs in our country and smuggle cash and guns out of it , ” Holder said from Washington .
Project Deliverance
Dubbed Project Deliverance , the arrests reached from New York to California as well as within Mexico .
In the Southern District of Texas , which stretches from Houston to the border , the operation resulted in the indictment of 58 people and the seizure of 31,000 pounds of marijuana ; 1,300 pounds of cocaine and an assortment of real estate as well as bank accounts .
“ It certainly has dealt a blow to the cartels , said Zoran Yankovich , head of the Drug Enforcement Administration 's Houston Division .
“ We targeted distribution networks ' command and control .
That is what we always go after . ”
In the Western District of Texas , which includes San Antonio and El Paso , 69 people were snared , many with ties to Ciudad Juarez , where unrelenting drug cartel violence has continued to wrack the border .
U.S. Attorney John E. Murphy , the top prosecutor for that region , said agents nabbed 6,800 pounds of marijuana and more than 1,100 pounds of cocaine — as well as $ 2.37 million in alleged criminally derived assets .
In Texas ' Hidalgo County , Sullivan City Police Chief Hernan Guerra is accused of being in cahoots with the traffickers from both the Zetas and Gulf Cartel , according to the DEA .
He is charged with conspiring to traffic drugs .
“ I know very little about the evidence involved here , ” said Oscar Alvarez , Guerra 's attorney .
“ I suspect , just based on my general reading , that there must be several cooperating defendants and informants and possibly some wiretaps .
It looks like an extensive investigation . ”
It remains to be seen how long the chief will be able to draw pay from his $ 40,000 a year job to run the 15 - person force in Hidalgo County .
Authorities contend the chief was charged as part of the same investigation that singled out at least 70 residential lots in Hidalgo County that were purchased with millions of dollars in drug proceeds .
‘ Hold them accountable '
“ Project Deliverance is the latest engagement in our ongoing struggle to confront and defeat the Mexican cartels , ” said Jose Angel Moreno , the top federal prosecutor in Houston .
“ These arrests , seizures and prospective forfeitures further our goal to dismantle and disrupt their operations and hold them accountable , ” he continued .
What overall effect the operation will have remains unclear .
U.S. officials said although it broke up transportation and distribution networks from various Mexican trafficking organizations , such networks have proven themselves to be replaceable .
A similar federal operation last fall resulted in the arrests of 300 alleged members of La Familia , one of Mexico 's more vicious drug gangs , which distributes methamphetamine and other drugs across the United States .
Difficult to disrupt
Despite those arrests , and blows against the gang in Mexico , La Familia remains a powerful presence in the Mexican underworld .
“ Is Deliverance going to solve the problem ?
No , ” said a U.S. official , who requested anonymity , and characterized it as “ chipping away ” at trafficking organizations ' U.S. networks .
“ You hope that by attacking all sections of the organizations you will have the ability to at a minimum disrupt — and hopefully dismantle — them , ” the official said .
“ The ideas is from top to bottom try to attack the entire organization . ”
Among those named in a stack of indictments is a freelance criminal who specialized in smuggling heroin into the U.S. for the Sinaloa Cartel and other organizations .
The alleged trafficker was arrested in Mexico in May .
He was allegedly shipping as much as 150 pounds of heroin a month to various U.S. states and bringing $ 2 million in proceeds monthly into Mexico , the official said .
He is named in dozens of drug related indictments across the United States , indicating the reach of his transportation network .

The widespread belief that chemical dispersants will enhance the breakdown of oil from the Gulf of Mexico disaster is based on weak scientific data .
That 's among the topics in a comprehensive status report that is the cover story in Chemical & Engineering News ( C&EN ) , the American Chemical Society 's weekly newsmagazine .
C&EN Senior Correspondent Jeff Johnson and Assistant Editor Michael Torrice note in the article that government and industry officials continue to struggle with how to handle the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , in which more than 20 million gallons of oil leaked into the ocean .
Detergent - like chemicals called dispersants , which break up oil slicks into drops , are among the key remediation tools .
C&EN points out that technicians who apply the dispersants assume that the chemicals will help breakdown the oil by creating smaller droplets that oil - eating microbes in the ocean can consume .
But a 2005 National Research Council report , which described the results of three decades of research into dispersants ' effects , gives mixed reviews .
Studies showed evidence for " enhancement , inhibition , and no effect . "
The report raises concerns that the microbes may chew up the dispersant molecules instead of dining on the oil .
Nevertheless , as government and industry officials continue to wrestle with the best way to cope with the disaster , chemical dispersants will continue to play a role in this cleanup , the article concludes .
This story and related content on the oil spill is available at http://pubs.acs.org/cen/oilspill/
One thing I am realizing about going a long time without eating meat ( 15 years ) followed by a relatively short time eating as a moderately enthusiastic meat eater ( 5 years and change ) is that it does n’t always occur to you to include it in meals .
In fact , I have apparently only made four dishes on the site this year that include meat , and two were briskets for big dinner parties .
With a fridge bursting ( literally ; if you can find room for a jar of mayo in there , you ’d be my hero ) with spinach and scallions , radishes , real baby carrots , sugar snaps , shelling peas and tiny freshly - dug red potatoes rolling off the top , I can hardly imagine why I ’d need to roast a chicken .
But when I was going through my ( very , very , very long ) list of Recipes I Want To Try last week , these lamb chops jumped out at me , promising to at least temporarily break me out of my asparagus — hashed !
ribboned !
tossed with pasta for one ! — rut .
There were three big sells on this recipe for me , the first being Anne Burrell : I love everything she cooks .
The second was that these chops are entirely in the kitchen and I had no idea you could make great lamb chops without a grill .
Related , reason three is that , I only recently discovered that I like , nay , love lamb chops .
Adore them .
In fact , I think my enjoyment of lamb chops — versus dabbling in ribs or a vague appreciation of steak — is pretty much the only thing that makes me a “ real ” meat eater these days , which I define as liking the taste of something so much , you ’d even enjoy it plainly , just salt and pepper on a grill .
That ’s love , right ?
Fortunately , this recipe has a little fun with them , smearing them , once browned , with a olive - pistachio - lemon zest and garlic tapenade that you can whiz up in no time in a food processor .
Chops are browned for two minutes on each side in a pan , slathered with the tapenade and baked for five minutes to utter lamb perfection — the whole dish can literally be pulled off in 30 minutes , leaving time for the important stuff , like sitting in the grass , and pondering how your thighs got so awesome .
What , you do n’t do that too ?

1 ( 8 - rib ) rack of lamb or 6 lamb chops
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper *
To make the pistachio tapenade :
In a food processor combine the pistachios , olives , capers , garlic , herbs and puree .
While the machine is running , slowly drizzle in olive oil until the mixture becomes a paste .
Add the zest and pulse 1 more time , drizzling in more oil if necessary .
Reserve until ready to use .
If using a rack of ribs : Remove 2 rib bones from the 8 rib rack to make it a 6 - rib rack .
Counting from either end , remove the 2nd and 7th bones ; this will create 6 even chops that are thicker than a normal lamb chop .
Cut 6 even chops .
Cook your chops : Season your six lamb chops generously on either side with salt and freshly ground black pepper .
Allow them to sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking .
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a large saute pan generously with olive oil and bring to medium - high heat .
When the oil is hot but not smoking , add the lamb chops and cook for about 2 minutes on each side to brown .
If the pan begins to smoke , lower the heat .
The chops should be beautifully caramelized on both sides .
Remove the chops to a sheet pan and schmear generously with the pistachio tapenade .
Place in preheated oven and cook another 4 to 5 minutes for medium rare .
Remove chops from oven and let rest for at least 5 minutes before serving .
* My addition .
Does anyone know why not a single Anne Burrell recipe calls for black pepper , only salt ?
I would love to hear your theories !

Personal finance can seem like such an amazingly complex topic at times .
There are so many things to think about with financial management including budgeting , saving , investing , credit , debt , mortgages and so much more .
Each topic has sub -topics – and it feels like it could take a lifetime to figure it all out .
It can be overwhelming .
A few days ago I talked about how we as humans like to take things that are basically simple , and make them more complex .
In that article I argued that we should “ keep it simple stupid ” and try to focus more on some of the basics , instead of trying to make things too complex .
Continues after Advertisement
In the spirit of going back to the basics , today I want to start a series of posts called “ Personal Finance Basics ” where I 'll be talking about some of the simple concepts of personal finance that I believe you should focus on in order to be successful .
Today , I 'll be talking about saving and paying yourself first .
Pay Yourself First
One important piece of advice that you often see repeated , but not followed is the simple advice of paying yourself first .
This advice has been around for ages , so sometimes it seems a little antiquated – something your grandfather might tell you .
The thing is , it works .
JD from getrichslowly.org explains paying yourself first this way :
Before you pay your bills , before you buy groceries , before you do anything else , set aside a portion of your income to save .
The first bill you pay each month should be to yourself .
This habit , developed early , can help a person build tremendous wealth .
I wish I ’d understood this when I graduated from college .
So to pay yourself first you make your saving a priority – and as soon as your paycheck comes in , you pay yourself , and fully fund your savings and investment goals .
The problem is that most people do n't pay themselves first .
They play the game backwards – and end up following a system where they pay all their bills , spend on entertainment and eating out and the last thing they do is fund their savings and investment goals .
When they do that they often end up running out of money before they are able to fund their savings .
Savings becomes a footnote and gets lost in the shuffle .
Why Should I Pay Myself First ?
While most people agree that having some sort of savings and investment plans is important , not everyone agrees about how to get there .
For many it just seems too hard to save their money first because they feel like they 've got too many other spending and debt priorities .
Here are some of the reasons why I believe that it 's important to pay yourself first .
Paying yourself first makes saving a priority :
When you save last by default it means that all of your other bills , spending and other monetary obligations are more important that saving for your future .
By paying yourself first it makes your saving and investment goals the priority .
: When you save last by default it means that all of your other bills , spending and other monetary obligations are more important that saving for your future .

Paying yourself first equals sound financial planning :
When you pay yourself first it means that you 're planning ahead – not just for the far future – 30 years down the line – but also for every day emergencies like medical issues , car troubles and so on .
When you save first and have an emergency fund , you 'll be ready when these problems crop up .

Paying yourself first can help motivate you to reach your goals :
When you pay yourself first you 'll see your savings and retirement accounts growing faster than if your savings goals came after your bills and entertainment expenses .
Watching those savings can be very motivating to help move you towards reaching other goals as well !
How Should I Pay Myself Automatically ?
Once you decide it 's a good idea to pay yourself first , the next step to take is to put a plan in action in order to actually pay yourself first .
For me the best thing you can do is make paying yourself first automatic .
Here are some ways that you can work towards reaching your savings and investment goals .
Set up automatic investments :
Set it up with your company to automatically invest in your company 's retirement savings plan , especially if they have a plan that matches your investments .
If they do it 's an automatic 100 % return right away !
If they do n't match think about setting up a tax - free Roth IRA and maxing that out first .
Then open one of the variety of pre-tax investments and maxing those out .
If you have the money come out of your paycheck before you even see it , it makes it much easier to make a plan that does n't include that money !

Open a high yield savings account :
Open up a online savings account where you can set up an automatic savings goal – where money is withdrawn for your savings every month without you having to do anything .
Again , making it automatic makes it much easier !

Come up with your own ways to trick yourself into saving :
Doing things like saving coins and adding them to your savings , or saving every $ 10 bill that comes your way are examples of ways you can increase and add extra savings .
What are some ways that you can come up with to trick yourself into saving ?
Do you have thoughts on why it 's important to pay yourself first ?
Tell us your thoughts in the comments .

ElliptiGo
Most cyclists and gym - equipment enthusiasts would ask why anyone would ever want to combine a bicycle with an elliptical machine .
Engineer and ultramarathoner Brent Teal 's answer may not satisfy the diehards , but he can tell you just how to do it .
After a year spent building five prototypes out of off - the - shelf steel tubing , abandoned bike parts and skateboard decks , and riding thousands of test miles on these DIY bike mashups , Teal built ElliptiGo , the first ever bike - cum - ellipitcal machine .
One of the most difficult parts of building this bike , which was the brain child of injury - plagued Ironman athlete Bryan Pate , was getting the long stride length , Teal says .
To extend the frame and create an adjustable platform , Teal designed a long span in the middle of the bike that was light and rigid .
Crank arms attached to this platform are made from 7000 - series aluminum , and to keep it light , the platforms that hold bikers are made of carbon fiber .
The ElliptiGo stride length is adjustable from 18 to 25.5 inches so it can accommodate different rider sizes and preferences .
One thing can be said about the ride :
The bike moves like nothing else on the road .
It 's surprisingly agile when taking turns , and smooth when accelerating .
While standing and biking is at first awkward , it gives the rider better vision , although it 's not made for mobile efficiency — a strenuous workout is a given .
The ElliptiGo will be for sale in July 2010 for about $ 2200 .

Younger people today -- in fact , people of all ages -- no longer see the car as a necessary expense or a source of personal freedom .
In fact , it is increasingly just the opposite : not owning a car and not owning a house are seen by more and more as a path to greater flexibility , choice , and personal autonomy .
Underlying all of this is not so much a shift in " car culture " values but a shift in economic realities .
Owning a car and a house are very costly , for individuals and the economy as a whole .
What distinguished " savers " from " spenders , " according to a Canadian study ( .pdf ) , is outlays for housing and especially for cars .
The amount of money the average American family spends on housing and cars went from 22 percent in 1950 to 44 percent by the 1980s to more than half today .
It 's not so much that America is a society of wanton over - consumers -- though some surely fit that bill -- it's that they 've been trapped by the housing - car - energy complex that once stood at the very heart of the U.S. " Fordist " economy .
And as any number of studies have shown ( .pdf ) , America 's over - investment in housing has badly distorted its economy .
We can't recover by breathing life back into that old economy .
Lasting prosperity requires investment in a new and more efficient economic system .
We 'll never get there if we continue to spend every last penny on houses , cars , and energy .
We need to reduce spending on the old Fordist consumption bundle in order to free up capital for new technologies , new industries , and greater skill and personal development broadly .
Some of that is already happening as people downsize their homes , downshift consumption , and trade train rides or walkable neighborhoods for long suburban commutes .
Young people are at the cutting edge of these shifts , as they are just starting up in their jobs and careers ; choosing places to live , work , and raise their families ; and deciding how they want to live their lives .
Great Resets like this are generational events .
They do not spring forth overnight but emerge gradually over time as millions upon millions of individuals and families reset themselves in light of new economic realities .
We remain in the very earliest stage of the current reset .
While some look at rebounding car sales or an uptick in the housing market as a sign of economic recovery , from where I sit , the shift away from driving and cars among young people is a much better indicator that the economy is starting to head in the right direction .

Preamble : So , Chelsea 's simple three - step plan to winning the title starts here .
The equation , arithmetic and , indeed , math is simple : three wins from their remaining three games will see Carlo Ancelotti's team crowned champions .
Their opponents today , Stoke , are comfortably ensconced in midtable and on the slow wind down towards season 's end .
They should n't really pose too many problems for the home side – but since when has football worked like that ?
As everyone knows , the first step of any respectable multi-part plan is admitting you have a problem … and in defending set - pieces , Chelsea have had a season - long one .
Stoke love corners , free - kicks and Delap-ins more than than Tony Pulis loves that baseball cap and with Chelsea 's Captain Caveman , John Terry , suspended today , you can expect the Blues backline to face no small amount of scrutiny .
Pulis has already commenced with his mental disintegration tactics – though the man he 's chosen to target is the one in black , accusing referees of bottling it when it comes to awarding decisions against the big clubs .
Bolton 's Owen Coyle would probably agree after his side were twice denied penalties in their 1 - 0 defeat to Chelsea the other week but , as mentioned , JT is on the sidelines so the percentage of ' ball - to - hand ' incidents in today 's game should decrease by about 172.36 r % .
For those of you interested in more than just hunches and bluster , however , here are the key stats : Chelsea have n't lost at home to Stoke in the league since 1974 ( but the Potters did win at the Bridge in the League Cup in 1995 , thanks to a solitary Paul Peschisolido goal ) ; Chelsea have n't lost two Premier League games in a row since 2006 ( when they 'd already won the title ) ; the only teams Stoke have beaten since February are Hull and West Ham ; Chelsea have claimed the most points after going behind in the league ( 15 ) and Stoke have dropped the most after going ahead ( 22 ) ; and Terry is suspended .
So , that 'll be Stoke taking a 1 - 0 lead from a dead - ball situation , Chelsea equalising via a dodgy penalty gifted them by the ref before ending up emphatic 4 - 1 winners .
You can thank me when the bookies pay out ...
Teams , you say ?
Chelsea : Cech , Paulo Ferreira , Ivanovic , Alex , Ashley Cole , Lampard , Ballack , Malouda , Kalou , Drogba , Anelka .
Subs : Hilario , Joe Cole , Zhirkov , Sturridge , Belletti , Hutchinson , Van Aanholt .
Stoke : Sorensen , Higginbotham , Huth , Abdoulaye Faye , Collins , Delap , Whitehead , Whelan , Etherington , Fuller , Kitson .
Subs : Begovic , Lawrence , Beattie , Pugh , Shawcross , Sanli , Wilkinson .
Man most likely to be on the end of a Tony Pulis eyeballing : Steve Bennett ( Kent )
Stuff that may affect today 's result : Didier Drogba plays up front , with the spritely ninja trio of Nicolas Anelka , Florent Malouda and Salomon Kalou buzzing around him .
Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack will be holding ( eh ? ) .
Ashley Cole makes his first start since breaking his ankle on 10 February ( Go England ! ) .
Stoke line up with two strikers , which is to be applauded ( though they do only have six league goals between them ) and the twin peaks of Abdoulaye Faye and Robert Huth at the back .
" No Paul Peschisolido in the Stoke line - up ? " notes Damian Wims .
Sadly not – he's got a little bit of housework to do for Karren Brady , apparently .
Adverts on Sky : Make a bet , make a bet , make a bet .
Has Matty Etherington 's story taught us nothing ?
Thoughts , anyone ?
Or do you care as much about this as you do the election ?
We can talk about the Marathon , if you like .
Or the snooks ...
Is that corporate endorsement of the United anti-Glazer protests I spy ?
In the William Hill ( told you it was all betting ) ad just on , a fan supposedly " showing his true colours " is wearing a conspicuous green and gold scarf .
You gotta join the system to beat the system , or something .
Peep !
' Ere we go , then .
Rory Delap heads the ball back to Thomas Sorensen after an early cross from Paulo Ferreira .
The Chelsea support is in full song at the Bridge as Chelsea kick from right to left .
2 min : First Eyjafjallajökull joke from Martin Tyler .
I wo n't repeat it .
Ricardo Fuller chases a ball into the Chelsea half , but Petr Cech get there first and launches a clearance up field to Didier Drogba .
Frank Lampard receives the ball on the right but his cross is cut out .
4 min : Branislav
Ivanovic takes the ball towards his own corner flag and then shields it from Fuller , apparently already believing that his side are ahead and all he has to do is run down the clock .
Fuller eventually fouls him .
5 min : Drogba gets the first sight of goal , crunching a shot into a Stoke defender on the edge of the box .
The corner fails to trouble the visitors .
6 min : Fuller skins Ivanovic down the right , muscling his way past John Terry 's stand - in before pulling the ball back from the byline .
Alex does well to cut the pass out though , averting the danger in the process .
8 min : Stuart Graham smells hypocrisy in the air : " You can talk with your sporting index ' learn to spread bet like a pro ' banner on the same page . "
Deplorable , I know .
But do n't tell me you expected better from the guardian ?
9 min : Stoke are forced into a very early substitution , as Abdoulaye Faye departs the field with some niggle or other .
He 's replaced by Ryan Shawcross , who 's making his first appearance since that whole Ramsey leg thing .
11 min :
An excellent chance falls to the feet of the man on the field probably least ready to deal with it .
Lampard 's swirling effort from 25 yards was beaten away by Sorensen , the ball falling straight to Ashley Cole ... but the left - back only manages to hit the keeper with his follow - up effort .
13 min : Stoke are going about their business in the usual , unfussy manner .
They 're every inch a Premier League team these days , I feel , despite this being only their second season in the top flight .
They seem comfortable , familiar in a way that Reading , say , never did .
15 min : Chelsea continue to probe away , with Ferreira 's cross from the right headed away by Higginbotham .
Malouda then nearly carves a path through the Stoke defence , but Drogba can't quite control his pass .
17 min : Malouda is hustled out of it by Whelan , but back come Chelsea again .
Just seen a replay of Dean Whitehead dispossessing Drogba a minute ago – might have been a teency bit of hand involved there .
What was that about referees and big decisions , TP ?
19 min : Drogba hammers a drive well over after a quick short - corner routine from Chelsea .
They look very comfortable so far , the would - be champions .
20 min : Terrific save from Sorensen .
Kalour whipped in a lowish cross from the right and Drogba bulleted a header towards the near post only for the Dane to tip it wide for a corner .
Anelka then can't quite fiddle the ball home from close range from the set piece .
22 min : Getting closer ... Drogba is sent clean through by a majestic Malouda pass from inside the Chelsea half , but after the Ivorian had managed to touch the ball past Sorensen , he blazed a half - volley into the stands .
He had time – though there was a Stoke man back on the line .
GOAL ! Chelsea 1 - 0 Stoke ( Kalou 24 ) Drogba is the architect and there was quite some design in Chelsea 's opener .
Malouda again raked a pass from left to right , with Drogba peeling off towards the edge of the box .
Instead of bringing the ball down with his chest , which would have been the easy option , he controlled it flamingo - style with the outside of his right boot , contorting his body to bring it down and then curl a low cross between Sorensen and his defence where Salomon Kalou stooped low to score .
Easy as that .
26 min : It 's been all Chelsea .
It will continue to be all Chelsea .
Shall we just stop now and go have a pint instead ?
" You have to feel sorry for Stoke fans as they are ten points behind Everton in the nothing - to - play - for league , " emails Ian Copestake .
" Surely some competition could be arranged for these teams to make mid-table security more
exciting . "
29 min : Stoke venture into the Chelsea half and win a throw !
Heeeeeeeeeeere comes Rory ...
30 min : Chelsea ultimately defend the throw , with Cech claiming , but not before it had pinged around the box off a couple of players .
They do seem at sixes and sevens when it comes to high balls , Chelsea .
Still , they 're now off on the attack again .
GOAL ! Chelsea 2 - 0 Stoke ( Kalou 31 )
And that 's the result !
Lampard 's thunderous right - foot strike is well kept out by Sorensen , but the ball squirts away from him and Kalou jumps in with both feet to help the ball over the line from a couple of yards out .
The Stoke players are complaining about the finish and Sorensen has been hurt ...
33 min :
It looks like Thomas Sorensen is going to be taken off here , so we 'll get a look at Asmir Begovic .
The Dane is receiving oxygen .
It was a crude challenge from Kalou , but it did n't look to me as if he really caught Sorensen .
I reckon he may have been hurt stretching to get there .
35 min : Tom Britten writes : " So . As a United fan , at what point do I switch this off and look to next weekend ?
2 - 0 ? 3 -0 ? "
Oh , I think just about now will do it , Tom .
Begovic is on and Stoke are to restart after a few minutes off the clock .
36 min : Drogba is played in behind the defence again by Malouda and the striker attempts a Hollywood strike from a very tight angle on the right .
It goes miles over and earns Drogba a chiding from Andy Gray .
As if Gray could plait Drogba 's hair ...
38 min : Glenn
Whelan chips the ball into the box from a Stoke free - kick but it 's cleared – by Mr Ubiquitous , Didier Drogba .
Fuller is then crowded out on the edge of the box and Chelsea attempt to break .
40 min : Fuller , who 's been the only Stoke player to prick Chelsea at all so far , does Ivanovic again on the right , but his low centre is cut out .
If he could have found Kitson at the back post that would have been very close to a sniff of a chance .
But he did n't .
41 min : Florent Malouda , who is such a classy player , receives the ball in the area after a one - two on the left and his drive is deflected over for a corner .
42 min : Here 's John Allen .
" As a member of the goalkeeper 's union I have to say ; hurt stretching to get there , are you kidding me ?
Perhaps you could ask a colleague to take a running jump at your wrist and see how it feels .
Terrible decision to let the goal stand . "
43 min : PENALTY to Chelsea !
Robert Huth is hugging Salomon Kalou 's ankles ( no , literally ) but it 's actually outside the box .
Still , this is n't rugby , and Steve Bennett has to penalise the Stoke defender .
TP wont like that .
Up steps Lampard to deny Kalou his hat - trick ...
GOAL ! Chelsea 3 - 0 Stoke ( Lampard 44 ) Asmir Begovic 's first touch is to pick the ball out of his net after Lampard 's confidently struck spot - kick low into the bottom - right corner .
Thank you , Stoke , and goodnight .
45+1 min : Well , I shall defer to John Allen and several others who 've emailed in with blue - tinged missives about Kalou 's challenge : Sorensen has been taken to hospital with a suspected broken elbow .
45+3 min : Desperate news for Sorensen , then , and there are to be seven minutes of added time in the first half .
And this after Shay Given 's injury yesterday .
Who 's be a goalkeeper , eh? Chelsea almost create chances through first Drogba and then Malouda .
Chelsea are romping this .
45+5 min : " You can't really expect reasoned responses from Andy Gray as a commentator as he remains the only footballer in history to have scored all his goals with his head . "
Ian Copestake has a , err , diagnosis for Sky 's No1 colour man 's case of idiotmouth .
45+6 min : Stoke have had an effort on goal ( it went wide ) .
Nicolas Anelka has been felled in the area by a cheeky trip from Glenn Whelan that went unnoticed .
Yawn .
Half - time : And Chelsea go in at the break three goals to the good and looking to further boost their confidence ahead of next weekend 's trip to Anfield .
Have your say – the verdict on Salomon Kalou 's second goal : " Perhaps Kalou should talk to his own keeper about reckless challenges , " huffs Niall Mullen .
" He got the ball but it 's a disgraceful challenge that shows no care for his fellow professional . "
" If Sorensen went to kick that ball and Kalou made that challenge it would have been a red card .
Why is he allowed to dive two feet , studs up when the goalkeeper is reaching with his hands ? "
Andy Waddington has a question to which I do n't know the answer .
Stuart Lawson : " ' I reckon he may have been hurt stretching to get there . '
Hmmmm , that may have been what caused the injury .
Or it may have been Kalou 's studs connecting with his wrist at full pelt ... "
Sorensen and all that :
So , we 've had the multi-angle half - time review and it would seem that Sorensen 's hand got caught on Kalou 's studs as he stretched to get to the ball which caused his arm to get awkwardly jerked out to the side .
I was surmising that it might be another dislocation , a la Given yesterday , from the way he was sprawled out – but clearly I was wrong .
The barmy thing is Kalou could probably have toe - poked the ball home easily enough with one foot ; gods know why he jumped in like that .
Peep !
Peep !
Off we go again .
No half - time changes that I noticed , but I think we can assume that Drogba will be given a rest once he 's scored the fourth .
47 min : Unsurprisingly , Calro Ancelotti wants more of the same this half – so reports Geoff Shreeves down on the touchline .
Management 's a lark , is n't it .
48 min : With Chelsea happily beating up on another small kid , let 's traduce Jose Mourinho 's reign at Stamford Bridge why not .
" Malouda is indeed classy - and his rise exemplifies above all others the rise in the quality of the football played in the Premier League over the past few years , " says Kit Baker .
" An object lesson in why it is a very good thing that Mourinho is no longer in the country .
( And before you say it , remember that Mourinho never took Chelsea to the Champions League final ) . "
It being ?
I was going to say that there have alway been players of Malouda 's quality in the Prem , certainly since the mid-90s .
But I do think he 's tasty , all the same .
50 min : Fuller has a bit of a paddy after Ivanovic touched him on the sleeve , or tickled his elbow or something .
That 's about as exciting as it's got for Stoke today .
51 min : Kalou dips and weaves his way into the box from the right wing before tonking a rising drive over the upright on the far side of the goal .
Would have been a nice way to get the hat - trick .
53 min : Ashley Cole , who 's not been too involved but equally has n't been stretched on his return , shows some dandy footwork in the box , twice feinting and cutting back past his man ... but then he miskicks and the ball runs away from him .
56 min : How much are Chelsea going to win by at Anfield , then ?
Stoke , in time - honoured got - nothing - to - play - for fashion , are lying back at taking it here .
Ian Copestake is already looking ahead : " Liverpool fans face a dilemma next week .
If fourth place is out of the question then it will be like following England with Paul Mariner up
front : face facts and support the opposition . "
58 min : Stoke Substition : Dave Kitson slowly ambles off and straight down the tunnel for an early douche to be replaced by Tuncay .
59 min : Glenn
Whelan is booked for a foul – the first yellow of the day – and Alex bazookas the free - kick into some distant part of Knightsbridge .
61 min : Dean Whitehead is then carded for ' simulation ' .
He ran on to a neat ball in behind Ivanovic , who lunged but missed everything ... and Whitehead , instead of running on and at least trying to cross – y'know , playing the game – Supermans across the turf then looks up questioningly when he 's shown the yellow .
You know what you did , Dean .
64 min :
This game is so dead rigor mortis is beginning to set in .
I doubt there 's even a chance of it being reanimated zombie - style , for some brain - munching second - half carnage .
Zombies always improve things , I 'm sure you 'll agree .
Anelka schwings a right - footer some way wide of the target .
66 min : Anthony Hopkins has a naughty thought .
" Six minutes into the second half and no Stoke defender has taken a run at Kalou for breaking their keeper 's arm ?
Hard to believe given their manager .
Maybe later is the thinking .
Has to happen , however . "
But none of them are that kind of player , Anthony , surely you know that ?
GOAL ! Chelsea 4 - 0 Stoke ( Kalou 68 ) Lampard saw Kalou scampering into space behind Collins on the right , with Shawcross playing him onside in the middle , and after hitting a tame first effort straight at the keeper , Kalou completes his hat - trick by stabbing into an open goal .
70 min : Talking players not being like than , n'all , Glenn Whelan , who has been booked , ploughs into Michael Ballack , I think , with his studs firmly in the ' up ' position .
Bennett waves play on , however .
71 min : Chelsea bring off three - goal man Kalou for little Joe Cole .
72 min : What a miss from Malouda !
That 's amazing .
From less than a yard , the Frenchman fails to connect properly with Anelka 's low cross and the ball bobbles wide of the far post .
Geoffrey Boycott 's grandmother could have scored that .
74 min : " Just checked the Premier League table to see where Liverpool and Everton are and noticed that Chelsea are already shown as having won this game .
Although it is highly likely that this will indeed be the result I feel it is disrespectful to Stoke to assume that the game is over .
( Even though we all know it is ) , " writes Richard Harris .
" As to Liverpool letting Chelsea win in order to stop United I would argue that there is one thing the Reds fans will like even less than the United claiming their 19th title , and that is being pipped in the league by the Toffees .
If Liverpool lose to Chelsea and Everton win their last two games this will happen . "
We 're all about the future here at the guardian , Richard .
And this game is over .
Good point about the Merseyside thing , though .
75 min : Robert Huth absolutely clumps Ashley Cole and rightly gets a booking .
Ballack skies another chance for Chelsea .
77 min : Well , maybe the game 's not quite dead , but Stoke 's chance are .
It should be 5 - 0 , Malouda again the man who should score .
Anelka and Drogba combined will to open space on the left and after Anelka 's shot was blocked he teed up Malouda , who side - stepped a despairing challenge and then attempted to place the ball in the bottom corner ... only for Begovic to pull off an outstanding reflex save .
79 min : Chelsea substitution : Nic Anelka is withdrawn for Daniel Sturridge .
GOAL ! Chelsea 5 - 0 Stoke ( Lampard 81 ) A quite delightful finish from Frank Lampard sprinkles the hundreds and thousands over the cherry on the already over - iced cake .
Sam Hutchinson curled a precise cross from the right flank to the far post where Lampard eschewed heading the ball in favour of cushioning it with the outside of his right boot over Begovic and into the net .
Did I say it was Game Over ?
83 min :
All this talk of goal difference – which Chelsea are pumping up fatter than Jordan 's lips here – seems a bit redundant to me .
If they do n't win at Liverpool , they wo n't win the title as it seems very unlikely that the they 'll end up tied for points with United .
Good for confidence though .
GOAL ! Chelsea 6 - 0 Stoke ( Sturridge 87 ) Sturridge finishes expertly after being put through on goal by Drogba , again .
The substitute nipped round Begovic and slotted in from the angle .
Good for confidence , and all that ...
GOAL ! Chelsea 7 - 0 Stoke ( Malouda 89 ) " Are you watching Manchester " bellow the home crowd after Malouda makes this a bona fide route by turning home the ball from about five yards .
He roofed it , but there was no chance of him missing that one .
90+1 min : Young Sam Hutchinson , who I reliably informed crossed the ball for Lampard 's second and is also a future England captain ( I can't vouch for either of those claims ) nearly makes it 8 - 0 but he 's hurried into shooting and he toe - ends his effort wide .
This has been the dullest 7 - 0 thrashing ever , I tell you .
Peep !
Peep !
Peep !
That 's it , Chelsea have knocked Stoke into a cocked hat and go back to the top of the table .
Chelsea now have a goal difference of +61 and they 've scored 93 goals this season .
Remember all that talk of Arsenal breaking 100 earlier in the campaign ?
Well , Ancelotti's lot are n't far shy now .
Anyway , the scoreline tells the story at Stamford Bridge – Chelsea were muscular and compact , like corned beef , and Stoke merely innocent midtable bystanders .
They wo n't care overly ( though spare a thought for poor Thomas Sorensen ) and United supporters can't have been expecting much more .
Were you watching Manchester and , indeed , Liverpool ?
Step two is next week , at Anfield .
Thanks for your emails today .

Image caption Russian spy Anna Chapman was married to a British man
Anna Chapman , one of the Russian spies deported from the United States , has been deprived of her British citizenship , the BBC understands .
She has lost her British citizenship and exclusion is expected to follow , meaning she cannot travel to the UK .
Ms Chapman was among 10 Russians arrested in the US who admitted to being agents for a foreign country .
Last week her lawyer said she would like to come to the UK as she has a UK passport through a previous marriage .
Russia agreed to exchange four US spies for the 10 Russian agents and the swap was carried out in Vienna on 9 July .
Ms Chapman , who is also known as Anya Kushchenko , is the daughter of a Russian diplomat .
Until the Home Office 's decision , she had dual Russian - UK nationality .
BBC home affairs correspondent Andy Tighe said Ms Chapman became the best - known of the Russian spy ring after details and photographs from her Facebook entry were picked up by newspapers around the world .
Vienna spy swap
He said her lawyers were handed a letter formally revoking her citizenship and she was told her passport was no longer valid .
It is understood steps are also being taken to permanently exclude Ms Chapman from travelling to the UK in the future , our correspondent said .
Earlier this month , Briton Alex Chapman , 30 , from Bournemouth , Dorset , talked to a newspaper about his four - year marriage to the 28 - year - old Russian .
He said they had met at a party in London in 2002 and married five months later .
He said she changed dramatically during the marriage , and by the end was having " secretive " meetings with " Russian friends " .
Ms Chapman did not seek to conceal her Russian identity when she arrived in New York from Moscow in February 2010 , saying she wanted to build up a recruitment agency targeting young professionals in both cities .
But following the Vienna spy swap , a Home Office spokesperson had said they were reviewing Ms Chapman 's passport situation .
" The home secretary has the right to deprive dual nationals of their British citizenship where she considers that to do so would be conducive to the public good .
This case is under urgent consideration , " the spokesperson said .
Shadow home secretary Alan Johnson had said it " cannot be in our interests " to let Ms Chapman settle in the UK .
The BBC's Dominic Casciani said only half a dozen people have been stripped of British citizenship since the law was introduced in 2002 .
The law was partly introduced to make it easier to deport radical cleric Abu Hamza al Masri .
The home secretary can strip someone of citizenship if their presence is " seriously prejudicial " to British interests : for example , if they are a threat to national security .
The 10 Russian agents had pleaded guilty in New York to " conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of a foreign country " .
More serious money - laundering charges against them were dropped .
Prosecutors said the accused had posed as ordinary citizens , some living together as couples for years , and were ordered by Russia 's External Intelligence Service ( SVR ) to infiltrate policy - making circles and collect information .
On Sunday it was reported that two of the four Russians expelled from Moscow as part of the spy swap were believed to be staying undercover in a British hotel .
The brother of one , Igor Sutyagin , said he had called his wife from a small town on the edge of London , but had not been told exactly where he was .
Desde que tiene uso de razón , Verónica Langer vive con el fantasma de su pasado .
Las circunstancias que obligaron a su familia tomar la decisión de seguir una vida en México son producto de una guerra de la cual ellos quisieron sobrevivir cambiando todo lo que conocían hasta entonces .
Y aunque algunos de los integrantes de su familia tienen el recuerdo claro , Verónica quiso ir más allá de sólo reflexionar sobre la historia familiar heredada y contrarrestar con lo mejor que ella sabe hacer : actuar , aunque reconoce que también tiene gusto por escribir situaciones que nacen producto de la experiencia , como esta pieza .
Éste es un proyecto que Verónica Langer presenta en el Centro Cultural El Hormiguero con el monólogo :
Detrás de mí , la noche , en el que relata los entramados de la propia familia por un viaje a México , donde se instalaron y vivieron el resto de sus días .
Con la dramaturgia de Noé Morales , escenografía de Ingrid SAC e iluminación de Roberto Paredes , ésta es la historia con la voz poética de una mujer que está decidida a indagar en los entresijos menos iluminados de su historia y de su árbol familiar .
“ Mi madre , que era judía , me contaba mucho sobre esto y con el paso del tiempo he ido descubriendo cosas que no sabía y que me inquietaron mucho , la obra empieza con una reflexión sobre todo lo que tuvo que pasar para que nosotros llegáramos aquí , de ahí surge la necesidad de explorar ese pasado , entender cómo es ahora en la actualidad , y cómo el pasado también te marca ” , comentó en entrevista con El Economista .
En el soliloquio , Verónica cuenta que es hija de inmigrantes vieneses , llegados a América a finales de los años 30 del siglo pasado , perseguidos tanto por su origen judío , así como por su ideología política que no encajaba en el marco de tolerancia de un régimen autoritario .
Verónica encara una constante interrogante a lo largo de su interpretación unipersonal durante todo el montaje : ¿son el pasado y el origen una llaga destinada a no cerrar ?
“ Ser hijo de inmigrantes es diferente a ser hijo de personas del lugar , un poquito ésta es la temática : tener la sensación que no somos parte ” , profundizó .
“ Yo sí creo que me afecta y que me importa muchísimo ( este tema ) , hay gente que elige que no quiere hablar , le sigue resultando muy difícil hablar ” , reflexiona una de las joyas del espectáculo escénico en México con 40 años de trayectoria y que ha tenido recientes participaciones en producciones como La casa de las flores y Rosario tijeras .
“ Mi idea con esto es que volteemos todos a ver nuestras propias historias , porque tenemos una y es la que nos formó ” , comentó .
Agregó que una de las satisfacciones que le regala este trabajo , que emprendió desde el pasado 6 de diciembre que estrenó su obra , fue “ darle voz a la gente que nunca la tuvo , gente que me fui encontrando en el camino y que ya estaba olvidada ” , comentó .
“ La obra la estoy produciendo yo , con mi esfuerzo , no tengo apoyo de nadie , lo hago por una necesidad personal , esperamos presentarla en otros lugares , pero empezamos en este espacio ” , concluyó .
Langer se presentará hasta el próximo 22 de diciembre del 2019 , los viernes a las 8 de la noche , sábados a las 7 de la noche y domingo a las 6 de la tarde , con un costo de 250 pesos la entrada , incluye descuentos autorizados , y la función es apta para público mayor a los 15 años .

Only “ extreme ” insiders are cool enough for this school .
That ’s apparently the one requirement to get new media content directly from a few individuals who Fox News opinion host Glenn Beck has selected to lecture on politics , U.S. history and the right - wing ’s ideal vision for a theocratic America .
Yes , you read correctly : Glenn Beck is launching what he calls a “ university , ” and only subscribers to Beck ’s “ Insider Extreme ” club ( memberships start at $ 9.95 per month ) are allowed access .
ADVERTISEMENT
That last item , about the right - wing ’s ideal vision for America , is not pronounced by Beck in his , er , founding documents .
However , the politically ambiguous television personality has hired Dr. James R. Stoner — who believes that separation of church and state means not discriminating between Christian denominations — and David Barton : a man better known as one of the most influential evangelical Christians in the country and “ the right ’s favorite pseudo - historian , ” according to his critics at People for the American Way .
“ Offered exclusively to Insider Extreme subscribers , Beck University is a unique academic experience bringing together experts in the fields of religion , American history and economics , ” Beck ’s Web site declares .
“ Through captivating lectures and interactive online discussions , these experts will explore the concepts of Faith , Hope and Charity and show you how they influence AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s past , her present and most importantly her future . ”
James Stoner , Jr. Ph.D. , is a professor of political science at Louisiana State University , a graduate of Harvard University and a theocrat , in that he also genuinely wants to afford publicly funded school officials in America the right to lead students in prescribed religious activities , ceremonies or practices ; specifically , Christian prayer .
He wrote that “ government - sponsored prayer , proclamations of days of prayer and thanksgiving , even grants to the clergy to run schools for the Indians ” were and should still be perfectly legal , save for “ several generations ” of Supreme Court justices who drove church and state apart .
“ The prohibition against laws ‘ respecting an establishment of religion ’ was meant , in the eyes of these scholars and justices , to insure that the federal government would not prefer one [ Christian ] denomination to another , ” he opined .

Dr. Stoner added : “ To the fear that majority culture will so dominate the scene as to exclude minority religions , I would reply that America ’s religious diversity seems generally to insure that politicians , unlike judges , soon learn at the polls a hard lesson in tolerance if they offend .
Besides , the Free Exercise provision would not be touched by this amendment , but , arguably , would be reinforced . ”
He concludes with what seems to be a woefully idyllic vision of a future theocratic America that has significantly restricted abortion : “ For if a prayer amendment could , in the process of its enactment and in its effect , restore the original American understanding of the place of religion in republican life , I am confident that a people who have rediscovered how to see the hand of the Almighty in their daily lives will soon come around to seeing life itself as God ’s gift . ”
Another of Beck ’s lecturers , former Columbia Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychology and Education David L. Buckner , is perhaps best known to the masses for passing out in the middle of a Fox News broadcast .

Beck ’s site features no guarantee that Buckner will remain conscious during his online lessons .

The third addition to Beck ’s lineup is David Barton , who has no lengthy title or weighty degree .
Here ’s how People for the American Way , which calls him “ the right ’s favorite pseudo - historian , ” describes Barton ’s career :
Whereas people like James Dobson and Pat Robertson are well - known right - wing figures , Barton operates mostly under the national mediaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s radar , speaking to small groups of activists all over the country and churning out an array of resources that provide the pseudo - historical foundation for much of the right - wing agenda on everything fromreigning in Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ judicial activismÃ¢â‚
¬Â and Ã‚Â impeaching judges toÃ‚Â defending the phrase Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ under GodÃ¢â‚ ¬Â in the Pledge of Allegiance and Ã‚Â decrying homosexuals in the military .
Through his organization , Ã‚Â Wallbuilders , Barton peddles a wide array of videos , books and other resources designed to Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ introduce the current generation of Americans to an uncensored view of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s religious and political history .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  [ 10 ]
Despite BartonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s lack of academic credentials and his shoddy scholarship , he has managed to create an important niche by traveling around the country and all over the world telling audiences that the Founding Fathers were evangelical Christians just like them , and intended to create a nation of , by , and for Christians .
Not surprisingly , BartonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s history has been eagerly embraced by the Right .
The Eagle Forum hasÃ‚Â cited BartonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s work on impeachment [ 11 ] and , in 2004 , nearly 100 members of Concerned Women for AmericaÃ‚Â gathered at the US Capitol where they met Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ their legislators and [ gave ] them each a copy of David BartonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s video , Ã‚Â Foundations of American Government .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  [ 12 ]
Focus on the FamilyÃ‚Â calls Barton a Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ nationally renowned American history scholarÃ¢â‚ ¬ Â [ 13 ] and Ã‚Â peddles his work on its website .
Barton alsoÃ‚Â appeared , via video , at the Family Research CouncilÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ Justice Sunday IIIÃ¢â‚
¬
Â event , where he reinforced the theme Christians are under attack by the court system and had his pseudo - historypraised by Rev. Jerry Falwell , who stated Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ We need to come back to what the founding fathers and David Barton were just telling us about .
We are a nation under God. Ã¢â‚¬Â 
ADVERTISEMENT
Beck ’s site describes Barton as a best - selling author who owns a “ massive library - museum of tens of thousands of original writings , documents , and artifacts from early America ” and lauds his efforts in the “ development of social studies standards for numerous states . ”
He does not disclose that Barton is the former vice chairman for the Texas Republican Party .
Nor does he add that Barton has been heavily involved in getting the Texas school books changed to present a significantly different teaching of history .
Textbooks from Texas are considered influential in many markets because so many get printed , with some ultimately being purchased by other states .
Ã‚Â CurriculumÃ‚Â revisions Ã‚Â passed in Texas include teaching climate change as possibly false , teaching the pseudo - science of “ intelligent design ” as equal to the “ theory ” of evolution and scrubbing lessons about American liberals from history lessons , replaced by lessons on the Republicans ’ congressional triumph in 1994 and Ronald Reagan ’s administration .
Barton ’s only degree , as Washington Monthly noted , is a bachelor ’s in religious education from the Oral Roberts University .

Classes at “ Beck U ” are in no way accredited by any educational standards agency and will apparently be only offered online through interactive video chats and on - demand clips available to “ Insider Extreme ” subscribers .
It ’s unclear if Glenn Beck plans to offer a t - shirt or pullover sporting his so - called “ university ” logo , but even if he did , one question would undoubtedly remain : “ Why in the hell would anyone buy that ? ”
This video promoting Beck ’s “ university ” was published to YouTube on Friday , July 2 , 2010 .
DALLAS -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Vince Young was issued a Class C assault citation after an incident at a Dallas - area strip club early Sunday morning .
Video surveillance shows
Young trying to get through people surrounding a man indentified as Creiton Kinchen inside an office at Club Onyx after Creiton apparently insulted Young and made a derogatory sign referencing the University of Texas , Young 's alma mater .
A brief scuffle ensues .
" [ Kinchen 's comments ] obviously made Mr. Young upset , " Dallas police Lt. Craig Miller said .
" That conversation continues and there was more accusations against the University of Texas which prompted , in this case , Mr. Young to come back into the room where he just about exited . "
According to the police report , Kinchen sustained a bloody lip in the fight , but did not require medical attention .
Titans spokesman Robbie Bohren said the team was aware of the incident and had contacted Young .
He said the team was still gathering information .
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a tweet that the league " will look into it . "
The video shows
Young conversing with Kinchen and a man indentified by police as the club 's manager calmly before nearly exiting the room .
Kinchen then flashed an upside - down " Hook 'em Horns " hand sign , causing Young to retaliate .
Bystanders attempted to breakup the fight and the lights were briefly turned off before Young exited the room .
Police told The Associated Press Young was not at the club when police responded to a call of a physical confrontation .
His citation is punishable by a fine up to $ 500 .
A call to Young 's attorney Scotty Allen was not returned and Young could not be reached for comment .
Young returned to form this season after two troubled years in which he dealt with injuries and inconsistency on the field before being replaced by veteran Kerry Collins .
Image caption Prosecutors said the raids were over alleged clerical abuse of minors
The Vatican has expressed shock at raids , including the " violation " of a cathedral crypt , by Belgian police investigating alleged child sex abuse .
As well as searching a couple of main Church offices and a cardinal 's home , police had drilled holes in two archbishops ' tombs , said the Church .
Prosecutors said the raids were over alleged " abuse of minors committed by a certain number of Church figures " .
Belgium is one of many countries where the Church has been hit by sex scandal .
In April , the Bishop of Bruges , Roger Vangheluwe , resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a boy more than 20 years ago .
' Da Vinci Code '
The Vatican has summoned the Belgian ambassador to the Holy See to voice anger over Thursday 's raids .
Police in Leuven seized nearly 500 files and a computer from the offices of a Church commission investigating allegations of sex abuse .

They also searched the Church 's headquarters , the Brussels archdiocese in Mechelen , north of the Belgian capital .
Bishops holding a meeting there were barred from leaving the premises for several hours and had their mobile phones confiscated , said Church officials .
Investigators made holes in the tombs of two former Belgian primates at Mechelen cathedral , and sent down cameras in search of any hidden documents , without success , said a Church spokesman .
In a statement , the Vatican expressed " shock over how the searches were carried out by Belgian judicial authorities and indignation over the violation of the graves of the Cardinals Jozef - Ernest Van Roey and Leon - Joseph Suenens , " reports AFP news agency .
The raids had been the stuff of " crime novels and The Da Vinci Code " , said the Church 's leader in Belgium , Archbishop Andre- Joseph Leonard .
" We are surprised it went as far as drilling into tombs in the cathedral , " he told a news conference in Brussels on Friday .
A spokesman for the Belgian prosecutor in the Belgian capital told news agency Reuters that investigators partially opened one tomb in the cathedral after someone mentioned work had recently been carried out on the grave 's exterior .
Officers also raided the nearby home of Belgium 's former top cleric , the recently retired Archbishop of Mechelen - Brussels , Cardinal Godfried Danneels .
He was not interrogated but a personal computer and some paperwork was confiscated .
The Vatican said the raids had led to the " violation of confidentiality of precisely those victims for whom the raids were carried out " .
The Catholic Church in Belgium has apologised for its silence on abuse cases in the past and Archbishop Leonard has promised a policy of zero tolerance .

Tomcat 7 Debuts for Java
The open source Apache Tomcat Java server is among the most popular ways of deploying Java applications , and significant updates have been few and far between .
Now , however , four years after its last major release , the Apache Tomcat project this week introduced Apache Tomcat 7 , ushering in a number of enhancements .
The open source Tomcat 7 Java app server leverages some of the new JavaEE 6 specifications formally ratified at the end of 2009 .
In addition , new performance and security features are also baked into Tomcat 7 , and its developers say the server is intended to provide an easy migration path for Java applications that already run on Tomcat 5.5 and 6.x .
Still , Tomcat users might want to wait a bit before they choose to migrate .
" The release announced this week was Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 -- it was the first release of the Tomcat 7 branch , " Mark Thomas , a member of Apache Tomcat 's project management committee , told InternetNews.com .
However , " the Tomcat developers voted to grade it ' beta . ' ... While it passed all the compatibility tests and our own unit tests , we recognized that with the number of new features and the refactoring that had been performed , there was a reasonable chance that there would be some regressions that would make it unsuitable for production use in most cases at this stage . "
Thomas also said that Tomcat 7.0 wo n't be considered " stable " until its developers get a handle on the volume and severity of bugs reported after this week 's launch .
He added that the Apache Tomcat project 's formal definition of " stable " is that a release may only contain a small number of relatively minor bugs , and that Apache Tomcat stable releases are intended for production use , running for extended periods of time .
" It is always going to be a judgment call .
Major Tomcat releases typically take 6 to 12 months to reach stability , " Thomas said .
" My intention as the current Tomcat 7 release manager is to produce Tomcat 7 releases more frequently with the effect -- hopefully -- of enabling Tomcat 7 to reach stability sooner . "
Apache Tomcat 7 enhancements
In terms of new features supported in Tomcat 7 , Thomas noted that Tomcat now implements Servlet 3.0 , JavaServer Pages 2.2 and Expression Language 2.2 from the JavaEE 6 specifications .
He added , however , that the specifications supported in Tomcat 7 represent only a subset of the full set of the JavaEE 6 specifications .
" Tomcat has always implemented this specific sub -set of the JavaEE specifications , " Thomas said .
" Another Apache project , Apache Geronimo , implements the full JavaEE specification and uses Tomcat as part of their solution . "
The fact that Tomcat in the past has not implemented the full JavaEE specification has helped to give it the reputation for being a lightweight Java app server , a status that has won it some amount of commercial appeal : Vendors including SpringSource and MuleSoft provide commercial versions of Tomcat that compete against full - scale JavaEE app servers .
In addition to introducing some new JavaEE 6 specification support , Tomcat 7 takes aim at performance with a new feature to detect and prevent Web application memory leaks .
" The intention of the new functionality is to protect developers from unexpected side effects of using some standard Java APIs that will trigger Web application memory leaks , and to detect application coding errors that can cause memory leaks , " Thomas said .
" Detailed information on application errors are reported in the logs when an application is reloaded .
Administrators may also query if any applications caused issues as a result of a reload via the manager application or via JMX ( Java Management Extensions ) . "
" A parallel would be :
Why are the wildlife running to the edge of a forest on fire ?
There will be a lot of fish , sharks , turtles trying to get out of this water they detect is not suitable , " said Larry Crowder , a Duke University marine biologist .
I 'll quote someone far more eloquent than I , that I hope will help in understanding how we are contributors to it , and give you a couple of other people to hear whose words should also help .
It is said that humanity has evolved one - sidedly , growing in technical power without any comparable growth in moral integrity , or , as some would prefer to say , without comparable progress in education and rational thinking .
Yet the problem is more basic .
The root of the matter is the way in which we feel and conceive ourselves as human beings , our sensation of being alive , of individual existence and identity .
We suffer from a hallucination , from a false and distorted sensation of our own existence as living organisms -
Most of us have the sensation that " I myself " is a separate center of feeling and action , living inside and bounded by the physical body - - a center which " confronts an " external " world of people and things , making contact through the senses with a universe both alien and strange .
Everyday figures of speech reflect this illusion .
" I came into this world . "
" You must face reality . "
" The conquest of nature . "
This feeling of being lonely and very temporary visitors in the universe is in flat contradiction to everything known about man ( and all other living organisms ) in the sciences .
We do not " come into " this world ; we come out of it , as leaves from a tree .
As the ocean " waves , " the universe " peoples . "
Every individual is an expression of the whole realm of nature , a unique action of the total universe .
This fact is rarely , if ever , experienced by most individuals .
Even those who know it to be true in theory do not sense or feel it , but continue to be aware of themselves as isolated " egos " inside bags of skin .
The first result of this illusion is that our attitude to the world " outside " us is largely hostile .
We are forever " conquering " nature , space , mountains , deserts , bacteria , and insects instead of learning to cooperate with them in a harmonious order .
In America the great symbols of this conquest are the bulldozer and the rocket -- the instrument that batters the hills into flat tracts for little boxes made of ticky - tacky and the great phallic projectile that blasts the sky .
( Nonetheless , we have fine architects who know how to fit houses into hills without ruining the landscape , and astronomers who know that the earth is already way out in space , and that our first need for exploring other worlds is sensitive electronic instruments which , like our eyes , will bring the most distant objects into our own brains . )
The hostile attitude of conquering nature ignores the basic interdependence of all things and events -- that the world beyond the skin is actually an extension of our own bodies -- and will end in destroying the very environment from which we emerge and upon which our whole life depends .
Cory Doctorow , co-founding editor at Boing Boing and author spoke with Reason editor Nick Gillespie on the prejudice against children , the impact of offering his books for free and the obsolescence of creative monopoly ( 5:26 ) :
Mr. Doctorow ’s 2008 bestselling novel Little Brother can be downloaded here .
The heroic Michael Bauwens , editor at the P2P Foundation blog , posted the introduction to that work — where Mr. Doctorow discusses technology as a “ force for liberation ” — here .
Mark Frauenfelder — editor - in- chief at Make magazine , co-founder at Boing Boing and author himself — discussed the significance of unschooling and the do - it - yourself ( D.I.Y. ) discovery process on development and education with Ted Balaker at Reason ( 8:36 ) :
Whenever I wander a few blocks from the newsroom , a pleasant young activist wearing environmentalist gear will approach me and politely inquire as to whether I “ have a few minutes to spare for the environment . ”
No , is invariably the answer , though I do n’t find the request objectionable , only mildly irritating .
Everyone has the right to proselytize , after all , to try and convince others that their moral , religious , economic , political or ideological notions are best .
Even my fellow atheists are getting in on this game .
If you agree , then you might be shocked that three evangelicals were recently arrested by police after they were caught handing out religious paraphernalia outside an Arab - American festival in Dearborn , Mich .
A U.S. District Court judge had implausibly banned all groups from distributing any literature , even on sidewalks around the festival .
The cops , then , were impelled to deal with these four troublemakers who were distributing snippets from the Gospel of John .
Yet , beyond the seemingly flagrant attack on constitutional rights , there is another issue worth pondering : our aversion to conversion .
Ayaan Hirsi Ali , the former Muslim human - rights activist who lives under armed guard for fear of her life , is author of the powerful new book “ Nomad . ”
As secular as they come , she advocates that Christians become more active in countering the growing reach of Islamic radicalism in the Western world with their own outreach program .
“ Next to every mosque , build a Christian center , an enlightenment center , a feminist center , ” Hirsi Ali explained .
“ There are tons of websites , financed with Saudi money , promoting Wahabism .
We need to set up our own websites — Christian , feminist , humanist — trying to target the same people , saying , we have an alternative moral framework to Islam .
We have better ideas . ”
Do we have better ideas ?
Let ’s concede not everyone agrees .
During an interview with Hirsi Ali , Tavis Smiley went as far as to assert that more people were murdered ( “ every day ” ) in the name of Christianity than are murdered under the banner of Islam — which is so preposterous it deserves no answer .
I am no Christian , never have been .
But even a God - denier can’t alter history .
Though some of us tend to focus on the ugly aspects of religion ( and there are plenty ) , it would be difficult not to concede that liberty , tolerance , basic rights of women , education , free inquiry , free speech and freedom of religion thrive in predominantly Christian nations .
And you do n’t have to look past the most recent homegrown radicals — Nidal Malik Hasan , Faisal Shahzad or Najibullah Zazi , to name three — who were , in some part , educated or radicalized in the United States to understand that Christians should not shy away from engaging in the battle of faiths and ideas .
And secularists have no reason to be offended by the thought of it .
Thankfully , on Thursday , the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the evangelicals and overturned a lower court ruling allowing the Christians to distribute their propaganda on the festival ’s perimeter if they choose .
And choice is the key .
When Hirsi Ali brings up the idea , which is often , interviewers — even some of the friendly ones — seem to flinch at the insensitivity of suggesting that anyone try to cajole someone away from their faith .
Are n’t we supposed to respect other religions ?
Is n’t it impolite — or “ racist , ” “ exclusionary ” “ xenophobic ” — to claim that your beliefs are superior to or more practical than someone else ’s ?
No .
We claim as much every day in our elections , in books , in conversations , in blogs , in columns .
Why should anyone be immune ?

Iceland is , of course , one of the great economic disaster stories of all time .
An economy that produced a decent standard of living for its people was in effect hijacked by a combination of free - market ideology and crony capitalism ; one of the papers ( pdf ) at the conference I just attended in Luxembourg shows that the benefits of the financial bubble went overwhelmingly to a small minority at the top of the income distribution :
Olafsson and Kristjansson
And in the process of building short - lived financial empires , a handful of operators built up enormous debts that their fellow citizens are now expected to repay .
But there ’s an odd coda to the story .
Unlike other disaster economies around the European periphery – economies that are trying to rehabilitate themselves through austerity and deflation — Iceland built up so much debt and found itself in such dire straits that orthodoxy was out of the question .
Instead , Iceland devalued its currency massively and imposed capital controls .
And a strange thing has happened : although Iceland is generally considered to have experienced the worst financial crisis in history , its punishment has actually been substantially less than that of other nations .
Here ’s GDP :
Eurostat
And here ’s employment :
Eurostat
The moral of the story seems to be that if you ’re going to have a crisis , it ’s better to have a really , really bad one .
Otherwise , you ’ll end up taking the advice of people who assure you that even more suffering will cure what ails you .
A team of scientists from the University of Montreal and Harvard University has discovered that exposure to organophosphate pesticides may be associated with increased risk of Attention - Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) in children .
Published in the journal Pediatrics , the investigation found a connection between exposure pesticides and the presence of symptoms of ADHD .
The study focused on 1,139 children from the general U.S. population and measured pesticide levels in their urine .
The authors conclude that exposure to organophosphate pesticides , at levels common among U.S. children , may contribute to a diagnosis of ADHD .
" Previous studies have shown that exposure to some organophosphate compounds cause hyperactivity and cognitive deficits in animals , " says lead author Maryse F. Bouchard of the University of Montreal Department of Environmental and Occupational Health and the Sainte - Justine Hospital Research Center .
" Our study found that exposure to organophosphates in developing children might have effects on neural systems and could contribute to ADHD behaviors , such as inattention , hyperactivity , and impulsivity . "
This study was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences .
The study was authored by Maryse F. Bouchard of the University of Montreal and Harvard University , David C. Bellinger , Robert O. Wright , and Marc G. Weisskopf of Harvard University .

Reports have been coming out of the Gulf for days about British Petroleum blocking access to beaches and animal - cleaning stations , in some instances using private Blackwater - style mercenaries to do so .
Journalists as well as citizens have been thwarted in their attempts to see for themselves the extent of the damage being done by the runaway Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Know what I 'd like to see happen ?
I would like to see a thousand people , ten thousand , a hundred thousand , just show the hell up down there and demand access .
Citizens and reporters alike , just get down there , link arms , and walk to the beaches and the marshlands with digital cameras and cell phones for instantaneous blogging of what they see , hear and smell .
Pile into as many rented , borrowed and begged boats as can be mustered and plow out there to the scene of the crime .
Dare the gendarmes to stop us .
One of two things would happen : either the people would break through those unconscionable corporate barriers and show the world what is really going on in the Gulf , or the forces BP has arrayed against the truth would react with violence , which would tell us everything we need to know about what is happening , and would be enough to break that God damned criminal corporation finally and forever .
Either way , there would be thousands of people down there to chronicle what is happening , a ready - made army of volunteers who can also pitch in as best they can and begin the epic process of trying to undo what has been done .
Sounds crazy ?
Maybe , but it is the kind of direct action that has been missing from our national narrative , not just in the Gulf but all over .
What would happen if a million people marched on Wall Street , parked themselves in the road , and demanded that every " too big to fail " institution be torn down a brick at a time ?
What would happen if a million people parked themselves on Pennsylvania Avenue and refused to leave until American military forces are removed from Iraq , as promised ?
Big stuff would happen , friends .
The kind of stuff we'd be proud to tell our grandchildren about .
Yes , Virginia , there is a We The People , and in the second decade on the 21st century , we rose up righteous and turned the tide away from this corporate war - machine oligarchy whose seemingly overwhelming power and masterful media manipulation put us all to sleep ... but only for a while .
Yes , Virginia , there was a way , and we found it , and we did it .
A very old friend of mine recently described President Obama as a " narcotic , " and it was as spot - on an analysis as I have ever heard .
Millions upon millions of people were mobilized during the psychotic tenure of George W. Bush ; we knew what was wrong , we knew why it was wrong , and we summoned the care and courage to throw ourselves into a determined effort to bugger his deranged intentions .
We failed far more often than we succeeded , but at a minimum , we were on the move .
Now , a year and a half later , We The People have become stuck in the mud as matters continue to go badly and dangerously wrong .
Too many of the Bush - era policies we railed against are still in effect , with a few extra twists of the knife ( escalation in Afghanistan , pre-Deepwater approval of more offshore oil drilling , etc. ) that are putting us even deeper into a hole .
Where is the action ?
Where are the voices raised in a roaring chorus of " No " ?
Obama is a narcotic , my friend said , and that has a lot to do with it .
Too many people think things are better now , despite all evidence to the contrary , because Bush is gone and this wildly intelligent , grand - speaking new president is in office .
We are not necessarily asleep , but we are on the nod , watching the world burn around us without lifting a finger because , well , things are better now .
Right ?
Hm .
Perhaps having thousands of people descent upon the Gulf is a dumb idea , not feasible , even crazy .
But imagine what would happen if we did just that .
Imagine Wall Street thronged with citizens whose futures have been looted , refusing to leave until real change is finally effected .
Imagine what would happen if this slumbering , pissed off nation rose up and got moving again .
A large enough lever can move the world .
It is long past time for We The People to remember that , shake off the narcotic comfort of delusional hope , and start working the shoe leather again .
Enough of this crap .

Public outrage over the BP oil spill fouling the Gulf of Mexico has focused on water pollution .
But an air pollution health threat may also be serious , according to UCI researchers .
A team of UCI scientists , including Nobel laureate F. Sherwood Rowland and Chemistry department Chairman Donald Blake , has detected concentrations of toxic chemicals such as alkyl nitrates , methane , hexane and butane compounds that can irritate or burn skin and eyes or cause dizziness , according to studies .
So far , air samples from about 400 canisters the group collected on a recent trip to the oil spill do not show levels above government safety thresholds .
But the concentrations are higher than those found over heavily polluted urban areas , such as Los Angeles , Mexico City or Oklahoma oil tank farms .
The blown - out well is 50 miles off Louisiana and is gushing oil into the gulf at a rate between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day .
Several cleanup workers have been hospitalized with respiratory complaints .
UCI researchers say it is unclear whether the noxious gases in the air around the spill are the result of oil , of chemical dispersants or of other sources .
More funding and government coordination are needed , they said .
The scientists have submitted their findings to the Environmental Protection Agency and to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
NOAA followed up with a monitoring flight , but the results have not yet been released .
The UCI team is collecting more samples with an eye toward publishing a peer - reviewed paper in the near future .

Police said Tuesday that a " suspicious device " found on the roof of a business after a fire earlier this month was a rocket .
Authorities are attempting to determine whether the case is connected to a series of attacks on the Hemet Gang Task Force .
The fire was reported June 3 at Los Altos Market in Hemet .
Police said the nine - pound , inert training rocket malfunctioned and landed on the roof of the building , where firefighters found it after the blaze was extinguished .
Authorities said the M29A2 rocket was pointed in the general direction of the Hemet Police Department , according to Southwest Riverside News Network .
The discovery came amid an investigation into attacks against the city 's Gang Task Force and City of Hemet property .
When the blaze was first reported June 3 , Lt. Duane Wisehart said , " Based on the type of device , time of occurrence and close proximity to the police facility , the investigation is being handled by the same task force as the prior attacks on police and city buildings and vehicles . "
The attacks began in December when a gas line of the roof of the Gang Task Force building was directed into the building .
In February , a device described as a " home - made zip - gun " was discovered as a task force officer opened a gate at the building .
In March , an explosive device was attached to an unmarked patrol car .
Later than month , four city code enforcement trucks were torched in the Hemet City Hall parking lot .
In April , a fire damaged a mobile home used for police training .
Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire , which burned pallets at the market .
NASA 's Mars Science Laboratory , dubbed Curiosity , is now moving from problem child to a ready for action robot .
Launch is set for 2011 .
The latest Mars robot may be dead , but NASA scientists haveplenty to keep them busy as they scout out four potential stomping grounds for anambitious new rover pegged to be the next red planet explorer .
NASA declared the PhoenixMars lander ?
its youngest Mars probe ?
officially dead in late May afterphotos taken of it from orbit revealed substantial damage from its environmentin the Martian arctic .
Those photos came from the same powerful orbiter thathas been searching for the ultimate drop zone for NASA 's new MarsScience Laboratory ( MSL ) which is currently set for a November 2011 launch .
The new roving robot lab , known as Curiosity , is expected todetermine whether Mars is or was ever habitable to microbial life .
The rover ' scombination of technical improvements should make any potential landing sitesmore scientifically rich than anywhere Mars landers have gone before .
" We will either land inDisneyland or in the parking lot next to Disneyland , " said Ashwin Vasavada , Curiosity deputy project scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) inPasadena , Calif. , echoing the project 's mission manager .?
[ Bestand worst Mars landings . ]
Stomping grounds on Mars
NASA is closing in on the end of a long process ?
whichbegan three years ago ? to poll ? ? the Mars science community for potentiallanding sites , then weigh the pros and cons of each .
Now , out of some 60 possible sites considered at differentstages of the process , the list has been whittled down to four .
They are regionsof Mars known as Mawrth Vallis , Gale crater , Holden crater and Eberswaldecrater .
" These are the best placesyou could possibly imagine you would want to go , and for the first time , youcan actually land near them and get to them , " said Matthew Golombek ofJPL , co-chair of the Curiosity rover landing site steering committee .
Mars rover bull 's eye
The Curiosity rover is the first Mars mission ever built touse a guided entry , meaning it will steer itself through the Martian atmospherelike a guided missile instead of flying passively like a shuttlecock .
Becauseof this , the spacecraft can hit a much smaller landing target than ever before .
NASA 's Viking missions required landing zones 190 miles ( 300 km ) long to account for possible drift as the craft descended through theatmosphere .
Having to find a safe area of that extent ?
free of craters , cliffsand rocks ?
drastically limited the potential landing sites .
?
Later , the MarsPathfinder mission and Spirit and Opportunity rover landings worked with targetellipses 60 miles ( 100 km ) long .
The Curiosity rover , however , is designed to hit a target justover 15 miles ( 25 km ) long and 12 miles ( 20 km ) wide .
" It opens up a lot morepossibilities of squeezing the ellipse within the terrain and closer tofeatures of interest , " said Vasavada .
After landing , Curiosity will alsobe able to drive up to 20 kilometers to reach targets , or " go - to " sites .
The new rover is also built to decelerate faster thanprevious missions , meaning it can land on more elevated terrain , which opens upeven more of the red planet for exploration .
And because Curiosity lacks solarpanels and is designed to withstand severe cold temperatures , mission plannerscan target anywhere from thirty degrees North to thirty degrees South latitude .
Where to land on Mars ?
These broader landing possibilities give researchers roughlyhalf the planet to choose from , or triple the area open to Spiritand Opportunity rovers .
To zero in on the most interesting landing sites , Mars scientists made use of data collected from orbit .
In 2005 , the OMEGA spectrometer on board ESA 's Mars Expressorbiter picked up the presence of phyllosilicates ?
clay minerals that formedin the presence of water ? on the Martian surface .
For the past few years , MarsReconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) has been mapping those phyllosilicates at highresolution .
All four of the landing sites under consideration containlayered phyllosilicates , which must have been deposited over a period of time .
Vasavada said the phyllosilicates are all found in terrain that dates back toroughly the first billion years of Mars history , known as the Noachian era .
Curiosity will be the first rover to land on such ancient terrain .
Ideally , Mars scientists would like a landing site in whichthey know going in how the phyllosilicates were formed , to be sure they canconstruct a complete story of the features Curiosity will be examining .
The most comprehensive of possible landing sites for the Curiosity rover are Holden crater and Eberswalde crater , adjacent to each otherin the Southern highlands of Mars .
Based on MRO observations , Holden crater was formed from animpact that disrupted an existing river system .
The river eventually brokethrough the crater and flooded it , leaving behind phyllosilicate minerals .
Holden may have also contained lakes prior to the flooding , which would haveleft their own traces .
Eberswalde predates Holden andcontains something very exciting to researchers ?
the sedimentary remains of ariver delta on the western side of the crater .
" Here the geologic story isreally tight , " Vasavada said .
" It 's basically a pile of sediment thatwas deposited by a river . "
Curiosity could be used tofigure out how long the river system was running , what kind of sediment wasdeposited and where it came from .
River deltas trap sediment along withorganisms and organic molecules , which are all the things mission scientistswant to study .
" The downside , " according to Vasavada , " would be that the delta may have only been activefor very short time in Mars history . "
Riskier Mars targets
Riskier from the perspective of geological understanding butpotentially more rewarding in terms of mineral remains are Mawrth Vallis and Gale crater .
Mawrth Vallis is one of the oldest valleys on Mars , formedapproximately 3.7 billion years ago .
It also contains the best - exposedphyllosilicates on Mars .
In images from MRO 's CRISM instrument , scientists haveidentified multiple layers of phyllosilicates made of different materials .
Someare rich in iron and magnesium ; others are rich in aluminum .
" It suggests a change in environment , a change inchemistry " when Mars was warmer and wetter , said Golombek .
" All ofthat is incredibly interesting to go look at . "
What Mawrth Vallis lacks is an understanding of how theminerals got there , Vasavada explained .
" That 's something we coulddiscover by putting a rover there and driving around , [ but ] we would like toknow that before . "
A similar situation holds for Gale , a 90 - mile ( 150 - km ) widecrater near the bottom of Elysium Planitia .
Some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years old , Gale contains a mound ofphyllosilicates in the middle that towers 3 miles ( 5 km ) high ?
higher eventhan the crater 's rim .
At the top of the mound are younger sulfate minerals , which would have formed in more acidic water than the phyllosilicates belowthem .
If Curiosity landed at Gale , it might be able to survey abillion years of Mars history , Vasavada said .
The only problem , he added , isthat researchers can't be sure whether the minerals were deposited by water orair .
" Everybody 's wishing we had the perfect site where wecould sort of do it all , " said Vasavada .
" Really there are strongsupporters behind each of these four sites for different reasons . "
More debate ahead
At the next landing site workshop in September , researcherswill continue debating the pros and cons of the four sites , including how longit will take Curiosity to reach the phyllosilicates in each case and thepotential pitfalls along the way such as cliffs and rocks .
" If it takes ayear to drive out of the ellipse , that 's a factor you have to take intoaccount , " said Golombek .
The final recommendation wo n't come until next May or June , after MSL scientists construct simulations of the surface conditions followinga fifth workshop next March or April .
After that , it will be up to NASA 'sAssociate Administrator for Space Science to make the final decision .
It 's too soon to make an informed choice , said Golombek .
"
The science is only half of the issue .
I do n't think we fully understandall the potential hazards yet . "
Earthworm Jim's hi-def port to Xbox Live Arcade arrives Wednesday .

BRASILIA ( Reuters ) -
The winner of a $ 16 million lottery jackpot in Brazil escaped his own father ’s plot to kill him after police caught two contract killers supposedly hired to carry out his murder , local media reported on Friday .
Police informed Fabio de Barros of the plan by his father , Francisco , to have him killed in order to keep the winnings the two had fought over since Fabio won the prize in 2006 , O Globo TV and the Agencia Estado reported .
A legal battle began after Francisco , 60 , refused to hand over the winnings Fabio had deposited in his account .
They had not spoken for about three years , Fabio ’s lawyer said .
Francisco was arrested in Cuiaba in western Brazil on Wednesday .
Agencia Estado said police learned of the murder plot during monitoring of phone conversations between the two men accused of working as guns - for - hire .
The Glaciers Disappear : The Startling Photos of David Breashears
by Lakis Polycarpou | July 19 , 2010
Mountaineer , photographer and documentary filmmaker David Breashears is obviously a tough man — he has , after all , reached the summit of Mount Everest over five times , one of the very few people in the world to even attempt such a feat .
In person , though , the soft - spoken Breashears comes off less like an indomitable mountain conqueror than like a gentle soul who is deeply alarmed about the state of the planet he lives on .
Breashears is perhaps best known as the co-director of the IMAX film Everest , a movie that tells the story of one of the deadliest seasons on the mountain .
For his latest project , though , Breashears abandoned stunning ascents in favor of a very particular documentary project — recreating precisely the Himalayan photographs of explorers past , in order to visually document what climate change is doing to the glaciers at the top of the world .
To do this , Breashears followed in the footsteps of some of the greatest mountaineers and mountain photographers who ever lived — including George L. Mallory , Major E.O.
Wheeler and others .
Using prints of their photographs — ranging in time from 1899 to the 1950s –Breashears painstakingly located the exact spot where each photograph was taken to duplicate it .
In each case , the shrinking of the glaciers was visually apparent .
An exhibition of these photographs is currently on display at the Asia Society in New York .
Last Wednesday , Breashears joined a panel of climate experts and activists to talk about his photos and what they signify .
“ Most frozen things on Earth are melting , ” said well - known climate activist Bill McKibben , “ there should be nothing mysterious about what is happening here . ”
The melting of the glaciers is just one of many “ obvious symptoms of a disease that we have more than enough evidence to diagnose . ”
Indian climate scientist and glaciologist Syed Iqbal Hasnain spoke about the problems of collecting good , on - the - ground , time - series data from a region as unforgiving as the high - altitude Himalayas , and the need for much more precise fieldwork .
Challenges researchers face include a lack of willingness by Himalaya border nations –each of whom have border security concerns–to cooperate and share data .
Breashears seconded Hasnain ’s assessment , and pointed out that because of these difficulties he , who is not a scientist , has “ seen more glaciers than any scientist in the region . ”
While much can be done with climate models and satellite imagery , Breashears said , on the ground observation by more scientists was also vital .
Satellite photographs , because they are shot from above , can provide insight into the horizontal ablation of glaciers , but do not do a great job at measuring vertical ablation .
In other words , someone has to see the sides of the mountains — with all their peaks , ridges and crevices — in person .
Hasnain also spoke of the regional problem of black carbon , commonly thought of as soot .
Because of the rapid increase in industrialization , including widespread coal - burning for home heating and cooking , much of Asia now sits under a “ brown cloud ” of particulate matter , which — aside from it ’s negative health effects on the population — also accumulates in Himalayan snow , darkening it .
This darkening decreases snow reflectivity , or albedo , causing it to heat up and melt faster from the sun , in a positive feedback loop .
Hasnain believes that the black carbon problem is particularly acute in the Himalayas because of extensive military activity — mostly in diesel trucks — on the borders between India , China and Pakistan .
Orville Schell , a journalist who has traveled in and written extensively about Asia , spoke about the potential regional effects of Himalayan glacier melt , emphasizing the problem of seasonal water flow .
Many areas in a Himalayan watershed receive the vast majority of their precipitation in a very short period ; that seasonality is mitigated by low water flows from the glaciers .
Schell was particularly concerned about the Yellow River , “ without which there would be no Chinese civilization , ” he said , but which in recent years has been so dry that it fails to even reach the sea .
Several panelists addressed the paradox of dams , which were built in part to deliver clean , renewable energy , but had the effect of drying up the country .
( For more on the complex effects of glacier melt on the region , see Columbia Water Center Director Upmanu Lall ’s piece , “ Himalayn Glacier Melt : The Real Problem ” )
At the end of the question and answer session , one member of the audience rose to challenge the validity of what appeared to be irrefutable evidence of climate change .
Claiming to have a PhD in physics , the gentleman suggested that the clear change in glacier cover on the mountains could just as easily be explained by tourism .
He then questioned the credibility of Dr. Hasnain ( several years ago , Dr. Hasnain was misquoted in a journal to the effect that the Himalayan glaciers would all be gone by 2035 ) .
The questioner concluded by stating that “ basic Archimedes ” told us that the melting of the Arctic ice would not raise sea levels .
( It is not Arctic ice that will raise sea levels , however , but the melting of land - based ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland ) .
McKibben was incensed .
“ This just shows what we ’re up against with the climate deniers , ” he said .
In the face of stunning visual confirmation of 350 to 400 feet of vertical ice loss from glaciers , that the questioner could suggest the ice loss was cause by tourism seemed incredible .

How to end the blockade of Gaza
Back in May 1967 , the Egyptian government led by Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered a blockade of the Straits of Tiran , cutting off Israeli shipping in the Gulf of Aqaba .
This action crossed a " red line " for Israel , and was a major escalatory step in the crisis that led to the Six Day War .
President Lyndon Johnson considered sending U.S. warships or some sort of international flotilla to challenge the blockade and defuse the crisis .
But even though the United States had previously given Israel certain assurances about protecting freedom of navigation in the straits , Johnson ultimately declined to take decisive action to defend Israel ’s navigation rights .
The United States was already bogged down in Vietnam and Johnson feared getting trapped in another volatile conflict .
So he dithered , and Israel ultimately chose to go to war instead .
Had Johnson used U.S. naval forces to challenge the blockade , the Six Day War might not have occurred .
Egypt would not have dared to challenge U.S. warships , of course , and sending a U.S. fleet to break the blockade would have given Nasser a way to back down but save face ( i.e. , he would have been backing down to a superpower , and not to Israel ) .
And had the Six Day War been averted , many of the problems we are wrestling with now — including the disastrous occupation of the West Bank — might never have arisen .
Remembering this previous failure got me thinking : why does n’t the United States use its considerable power to lift the blockade of Gaza unilaterally ?
It ’s clear that the blockade of Gaza is causing enormous human suffering and making both the United States and Israel look terrible in the eyes of the rest of the world .
It has also failed to achieve any positive political purpose , like defeating Hamas .
So why does n’t the United States take the bull by the horns and organize a relief flotilla of its own , and use the U.S. Navy to escort the ships into Gaza ?
I ’ll bet we could easily get a few NATO allies to help too , and if money ’s the issue , we can get some EU members or Scandinavians to help pay for the relief supplies .
And somehow I do n’t think the IDF would try to stop us , or board any of the vessels .
The advantages of this course of action seem obvious .
The United States has been looking both ineffective and hypocritical ever since the Cairo speech a year ago , and many people in the Arab and Islamic world are beginning to see Barack Obama as just a smooth - talking version of George W. Bush .
By taking concrete steps to relieve Palestinian suffering , Obama would be showing the world that the United States was not in thrall to Israel or its hard - core lobbyists here in the United States .
What better way to discredit the fulminations of anti-American terrorists like Osama bin Laden , who constantly accuse us of being indifferent to Muslim suffering ?
The photo ops of U.S. personnel unloading tons of relief supplies would go a long way to repairing our tarnished image in that part of the world .
Remember the Berlin airlift , or our relief operations in Indonesia following the Asian tsunami ?
Doing good for others can win a lot of good will .
Second , having the U.S. and NATO take charge of a relief operation would alleviate Israel ’s security concerns .
The Israeli government claims the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from being smuggled into Gaza .
That is surely a legitimate concern , but if the United States and its allies are bringing relief aid in , then we can determine what goes on the ships and we obviously wo n’t bring in weaponry .
But wait a minute : would n’t bringing relief aid to Gaza end up strengthening Hamas ?
Not if we arrange for the relief aid to be distributed through the United Nations or other independent relief agencies .
Some of it might end up in Hamas ’s hands indirectly but most of it wo n’t , and reducing the level of deprivation and suffering would undercut the influence Hamas gains as a provider of social services .
It ’s true that a relief operation of this sort will probably require some U.S. officials to have some minimal dealings with Hamas , but this would actually be a good thing .
If the United States is really serious about a genuine two - state solution , it is going to have to bring Hamas into the political process sooner or later and this is a pretty low - key , non-committal way to start .
And while we ’re at it , we can tell them to get busy fixing that Charter of theirs and take a humanitarian gesture or two of their own , such as releasing captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit .
In short , using American power to end the blockade of Gaza could be a win - win - win for everyone .
The United States ( and Obama himself ) would demonstrate that we really did seek a " new beginning " in the Middle East , and correct the impression that the Cairo speech was just a lot of elegant hooey .
Israel ’s security concerns would be addressed , it would look flexible and reasonable , and we would be providing Netanyahu with an easy way to extricate himself from a position that is increasingly untenable .
( It ’s one thing for him to lift the blockade himself , but quite another to do it at Washington ’s behest ) .
And of course the long - suffering population of Gaza would be much better off , which should make us all feel better .
The more that I think about it , the more attractive this approach looks .
All it takes is an administration that is willing to take bold action to correct a situation that is both a humanitarian outrage and a simmering threat to regional peace .
That probably means that it has zero chance of being adopted .
And of course you all know why .

The latest craze to affect the property market is “ sell to rent back scheme ” .
You ’ll see lots of adverts on national television ( usually during the daytime ) and it seems every week there is another leaflet through the door .
These schemes have a bad reputation , but is that justified ?
In this article we ’ll look at the pros and cons of sell to rent back schemes .
How do Sell to Rent Back Schemes Work ?
A company will purchase your property and then rent it back to you under an assured shorthold tenancy agreement , which will usually have a term of six months , at a market rent .
There will often be an option for you to buy the property , though of course the company would expect to make a profit .
It is common for the company that buys the property to pay your legal fees .
They often seem to make a big deal of the fact that they will pay the valuation fees , though in reality you would expect this of any purchaser .
What are the Advantages of Sell to Rent Back Schemes ?
The basic principle of these schemes is that they allow you , at least initially , to stay in your home .
Obviously if you sold on the open market you would expect to have to vacate your property on completion .
In addition , these companies will usually be able to complete quite quickly since they will often have finance in place and will not be in a chain .
What are the Risks ?
Firstly , the price the sell and rent back company pays for your property will be well below market value , typically no more than 75 % but often even less with the more unscrupulous companies .
Secondly , the tenancy agreement you will enter into will usually be for just six months .
After that , the company may offer a further tenancy or they may evict you in order to sell the property .
If a further tenancy is granted this may be at a higher rent .
In fact , the initial monthly rent may be artificially low in order to entice you into a deal .
[ ad name = ” In content post 300 × 250 ″ ]
If the company buys your property with the aid of a mortgage and fails to keep up the repayments , or in any case if it becomes insolvent , it is likely the property will be repossessed and sold , so tat obviously you will have to leave .
You may find that you are unable to claim housing benefit following the sale , for up to 5 years .
The Buy Back Option
Many schemes offer a “ buy back option ” , which allows you to buy the property back should your financial circumstances improve .
Unfortunately , this option is likely to have no practical value since it will often only last for six months .
If your financial difficulties are that temporary then you probably should n’t be entering into this sort of scheme in the first place .
Can I Sell to Rent Back If I ’m in Negative Equity ?
No .
With the money you receive from the sale you ’ll need to pay off all of the debts secured against the property in full , and the company will not pay more than the market value to enable you to do this ( in fact they will pay substantially less ) .
What Should I Check Before Selling to Rent Back ?
You should understand before entering into this type of arrangement that you will be selling your and you will no longer be the legal owner .
You may have a right to occupy for a short period under a tenancy agreement but beyond that you will have no legal interest in the property .
You should also get answers to the following questions :
How long will the initial term of your tenancy agreement be ?
How often will the rent be reviewed and what formula will be used ?
Is the initial rent a fair market rent and if it is below market rates , is it likely to increase substantially upon expiry of the initial tenancy ?
If there is a buy back option , how long will it be valid for and how much will you need to pay ?
Will you be able to claim housing benefit following completion ( if you are unemployed ) ?
What percentage of the market value of the property will the company pay ?
( although the company will obtain a valuation , you should also obtain your own to check they have not undervalued your property )
Conclusion
Sell to rent back schemes are rarely the best way forward for home owners .
The option is only available when there is significant equity in the property and if this is the case then it is usually better from a financial standpoint to sell on the open market and rent another property elsewhere .
The equity received can be used to pay off other debts or saved to use as a deposit for your next house purchase when your financial circumstances improve .
If you are tempted towards these schemes because you are in mortgage arrears and do n’t think you ’ll have time to find a buyer on the open market then it can be a useful solution as a large portion of your equity is likely to be swallowed up by arrears and fees if you are repossessed however speak to your lender first .
Explain you are trying to sell and try to come to some type of temporary arrangement .
If you do decide to sell and rent back , it is unlikely you will be able to stay in your home forever .
At some point it will be the right time for the company to sell and most likely you will then have to move on .
The company may sell the property back to you but you will probably end up paying an inflated price and they will take advantage of the sentiment factor .

Planning permission is to be sought for a Luas line linking the existing Sandyford and Tallaght lines in Dublin .
An application for a new line running from St Stephen ’s Green to Broombridge is to be lodged with An Bord Pleanala by the Railway Procurement Agency .
The forecast journey time between the Green line terminus and the Broombridge station is expected to be approximately 24 minutes , with 20 trams serving each direction per hour during peak periods .
The BX line is planned to run from St Stephen ’s Green to O’Connell Street via College Green before doubling back and travelling along Marlborough Street across a specially constructed bridge over the River Liffey to Hawkins Street .
Stops along this line will be located at Dawson Street , Westmoreland Street , O’ Connell Street , Marlborough Street and College Street .
Using the BX line , members of the public will be able to transfer between the Sandyford and Tallaght lines at Middle Abbey Street .
The BX line would also form part of Line D which will run from O’Connell Street to Broombridge via Broadstone and Grangegorman .
Stops along Line D include Parnell Street , Dominick Street Lower and Broadstone .
At Broombridge the Luas line will interchange with Iarnrod Éireann ’s Maynooth railway line services .
Dublin Chamber of Commerce has said the city centre would face an eight year construction period if the Luas Metro North and Dart projects are not properly integrated .
Chief executive Gina Quin said it was critical that construction works are managed effectively so that the projects are delivered together as quickly as possible , while still ensuring the city remains fully open for business .
“ The benefits of these major transport projects are clear , " she said .
" They will transform the way in which people move around and through Dublin , but we need to be sure that construction is controlled from day one so that it is still easy for residents , commuters , shoppers and tourists to get into and around the city centre in particular . "
Many Veggies , Less Meat
WebMD Feature
Nov. 13 , 2000 --
Scan the menu at your local Chinese restaurant and you 're apt to find dozens of meat - centered dishes -- General Tso 's chicken , orange beef , twice - fried pork .
But do n't be fooled .
Most Chinese living in China do n't eat such a meat - centered diet .
For centuries , for reasons both economic and historic , the traditional Chinese diet has been primarily vegetarian -- featuring lots of vegetables , rice , and soybeans -- and containing only shavings of meat for flavoring , says Lan Tan , owner of Lan Tan 's Chinese Cooking School in Durham , N.C. Many Chinese simply can't afford mega slabs of meat -- or the cooking oil with which to prepare it .
Just as Americans may ask , " Where 's the beef ? " when visiting a traditional Chinese restaurant in China , the traditional Chinese might wonder , " Where are the vegetables ? " when visiting a Chinese restaurant in the U.S .
" Even I forget just how healthy Chinese food really is until my mother visits from Taiwan , " says Tan , who came to the U.S. more than a decade ago .
" My mother will use one - third pound of meat to feed six people . "
Indeed , the traditional Chinese diet is far healthier than the traditional American diet , which often features meat as the focus of the meal , says T. Colin Campbell , PhD , professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y .
But you do n't have to travel to rural parts of China to eat healthy .
Simply incorporate the Chinese way of eating into your diet , which can be done no matter where you are -- whether you 're dining at a restaurant or preparing Chinese dishes at home .
The Meat Myth
Unlike the meat - heavy plates featured in many Chinese restaurants in the U.S. , the traditional Chinese diet consists mainly of plant foods , small amounts of fish and poultry , and only occasionally red meat , says Campbell , the director of the Cornell - China - Oxford Project on Nutrition , Health , and Environment , a long - term study comparing the diets of rural China with average American ones .
He has been tracking the eating habits of people living in 100 Chinese rural villages since the early 1980s .
According to Campbell 's research , the traditional Chinese diet is comprised of only 20 % animal foods -- far less than the amount in the typical American diet .
As a result , the Chinese diet contains a formidable team of disease - fighting antioxidants and plant - based nutrients called phytochemicals -- all of which contribute to a healthier way of eating .
In rural China , in fact , the rates of major chronic diseases including breast , colon , and rectal cancer are mere fractions of those reported in the U.S.
" There are some regions in China in which breast cancer and heart disease are almost unknown , " Campbell says .
Moreover , type 2 diabetes also is much less prevalent , as is bone - weakening osteoporosis , even though the Chinese consume far fewer dairy products than we do in the U.S. , he says .
Just what do the traditional Chinese actually eat ?
" For breakfast , it 's often congee , a thin rice porridge , " says Shiny Qin , a 31 - year - old account executive at a New York City advertising agency who grew up in a rural village near Shanghai .
" Lunch might be rice with vegetables flavored with bits of pork , even at school . "
And dinner ?
" My mother always served rice and four other kinds of dishes , which we call main dishes .
At least one main dish would be all vegetables -- different kinds of greens , sweet potatoes , or tomatoes .
The rest were vegetables or tofu with a little bit of beef or pork . "
Importing " The Chinese Way " American - Style
Crowding your plate with complex carbohydrates , such as rice and vegetables , and using meat as more of a flavoring for these healthier options , is the Chinese recipe for good health .
And the best part is you can work this healthy diet into your everyday meals , no matter where you are .
Just follow this traditional Chinese food for thought :
DETROIT --
If Ilari Filppula is ready for the NHL , he might find himself playing alongside his younger brother at some point next season for the Detroit Red Wings .
The Red Wings signed Ilari Filppula , a 28 - year - old free - agent forward from Finland , to a one - year contract .
He is the older brother of Detroit center Valtteri Filppula .
" He adds some depth to our organization , '' Red Wings assistant general manager Jim Nill said .
" His career has blossomed in the last 2 - 3 years .
He was one of the better players in Finland .
It 's time to see if he can play in the best league in the world . ''
Filppula , a winger who can play center , will compete for a job in training camp .
If he does n't make the team , he will be assigned to the Grand Rapids Griffins .
He inked a two - way contract for $ 500,000 ( $ 105,000 in the AHL ) .
Filppula ( 5 - foot - 11 , 191 ) has played his entire pro career in Finland , the last seven seasons in the top league ( SM - liiga ) .
He won the Jari Kurri Trophy as playoff MVP this season , helping TPS Turku win the championship by picking up two goals and 12 assists in 15 playoff games .
He had 12 goals and 37 assists for a team - high 49 points in 58 regular season games .
" He has really good puck skills , '' Nill said .
" He 's a good playmaker , not as good a skater as ( Valtteri ) .
Skating is his biggest challenge .
We 're hoping it 's not as big an issue because of his hockey sense and playing on smaller ice . ''
The staggering level of " discouraged workers " as the government calls them has swelled to historic proportions in 2010 , past the million barrier for the first time since the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been tracking the number .
Though a bit off its all - time high of 1.2 million recorded in February , the metric stands as perhaps the most daunting statistic of last Friday 's gloomy jobs report , which showed that almost all the new employment is coming from temporary government Census jobs and not the kind that will sustain an economy .
" The fact that people are sitting down indicates just how bad the market is for some categories of people , " says Peter Morici , professor at the University of Maryland 's Smith School of Business and the former chief economist at the US International Trade Commission .
That picture is unlikely to get any better , particularly in terms of the headline unemployment rate number on which most people focus .
That figure actually dropped from 9.9 percent to 9.7 percent in May , but was as much a reflection that many people simply dropped out of the jobs market and are no longer counted as unemployed .
Even if those who have quit searching come back to the market , that will only keep the headline number high as the labor force increases .
" Now you 're going to have the woodwork effect , " Morici says .
" All the people who were discouraged will be coming out of the woodwork to find jobs . "
As the headline number has dropped from 10.1 percent in October 2009 , the number of discouraged workers has jumped 34 percent , from 808,000 to 1.08 million .
The decline in active job - seekers , in fact , may be helping pad the employment picture at least on the surface .
" If it were n't for the plunge in the labor force , the US unemployment rate would have climbed to 10 % in May , " Gluskin Sheff chief economist David Rosenberg says in his morning note Monday .
" [ T ] he household survey actually flagged a 35,000 outright decline in employment last month . "
And the growth in discouraged workers — technically defined as those who have n't looked for work in four weeks — could well stay high for the foreseeable future .
The long - term unemployed — those who have n't worked for at least 27 weeks , or more than half a year — remains mired at 6.8 million , a number that accounts for 46 percent of the total jobless figure .
Ramifications of the credit crisis and the ensuing efforts companies made at doing more with less have helped depress employment as well .
Company productivity rose 2.8 percent in the first quarter .
" We do n't expect any substantial improvement to the labor situation at all , " says Richard Hastings , macro and consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities in Newport Beach , Calif .
" Companies just do n't need as much labor to drive as much output from technology and machinery .
If you 're in the wrong industry and you do n't have a track record in the right skills in other industries , you 're going to be a long - term stat . "
Trauma can lead to vengeance ( Image : David Brauchli / AFP / Getty Images )
THE past two decades have seen an increase in mass violence around the world , including wars , armed conflicts , human rights abuses and terrorism .
Effectively dealing with these problems requires an understanding of the motivations that drive people to violence – sometimes to the point of self - sacrifice , as in the case of suicide bombers .
Unfortunately , attempts to develop such an understanding rarely go beyond value judgements , ideological beliefs and vacuous labels such as “ fanatic ” or “ religious extremist ” .
What we need instead is a scientific analysis .
Acts of violence do not occur in a …
London , England ( CNN ) --
Protesters armed only with vuvuzelas were planning to converge on BP's London headquarters Tuesday in a noisy protest over the company 's handling of the Gulf oil disaster .
" BP is not feeling the pain they are causing in the Gulf , " said Adam Quirk , a New York - based video producer who was organizing the protest .
Quirk said he hoped to have at least 200 vuvuzela players for the noon ( 7 a.m. ET ) demonstration .
He said he also hoped to raise $ 10,000 through the event , dubbed Vuvuzelas4BP , to help with the Gulf recovery efforts .
" If you know someone who either hates BP , loves the Gulf of Mexico , hates vuvuzelas , or has a sense of humor , please send them our way ! "
Quirk wrote on his website last week about the event .
The event will " exact a bit of revenge on one of the companies that caused this destruction , " Quirk said .
It was n't clear how many planned to show up for the event .
Quirk has been advertising it on his Twitter page , where he has more than 1,000 followers .
BP said it was aware of the planned protest but had no other comment .
Have you ever walked into a neighborhood restaurant , with only your debit card in hand , ready to order lunch for $ 7.95 , but are stopped by the handwritten sign next to the cash register : credit cards , $ 15 minimum .
Although , this is supposed to be against the rules , small businesses often do it because of high fees .
Visa and MasterCard , the credit duopoly , charge merchants “ swipe fees ” for using their vast , electronic network .
These fees , also called “ interchange fees ” – some would call it loan - sharking – are huge cash cows for the Visa / MasterCard empire .
The credit card companies set the fees , and raise them at will .
Merchants are forced to either swallow the cost or pass on the fees to their customers , and they complain they have no ability to negotiate with the titans of plastic .
As part of the finance reform package in Congress , Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , got an amendment through the Senate to curb these fees on debit cards .
He has now negotiated compromise language in the House - Senate committee that is working on reconciling the Senate and House versions of the bill .
The House version , passed earlier , contained no such curbs .
Most of the opposition to curbing these fees comes from the Visa lobby .
Visa and MasterCard control 80 percent of the market and fear any kind of regulation .
They can use their profitable fees to push consumers to get more credit cards and take on more debt .
Retailers – large and small – favor the regulation as do consumer groups .
Georgetown law professor Adam Levitan explains that fees are charged based on the transaction amount , not the cost of the transaction to the processor .
“ This means that it costs a merchant $ 4.15 to accept a $ 200 debit transaction – twenty - two times as much as the 45 ¢ it takes for a merchant to accept a $ 20 debit transaction , ” he says , even though the processing cost is identical .
If stores see a reduction in the fees , retailer associations claim they would pass the savings onto consumers .
Cynics may doubt that claim .
But according to Levitan , when similar regulations went into effect in Australia , “ merchants passed on significant cost savings to consumers : around $ 1.1 billion a year . ”
The U.S. has the highest swipe fees in the world .
Underlying this fee fight are divisions between the credit / finance industry on one hand , and the merchant class – large and small – on the other .
Retailers are seeing their profit margins shrink .
It ’s a sluggish economy with huge numbers of unemployed .
In order to survive stores need more consumers of goods .
That means more customers using credit and debit cards .
But the fees merchants have to pay cut into their profit margin and their ability to lure consumers with discounts .
The Merchants Payments Coalition , which according to their website represents 2.7 million “ Main Street stores across America , ” took aim at Visa ’s attempt to “ gut the swipe fee deal . ”
They said card fees cost them $ 20 billion in the last year alone .
Visa and MasterCard pass on 80 percent of the processing fees to the banks that issued the cards .
Fee caps would apply only to debit cards issued by banks with more than $ 10 billion in assets .
That group of about 120 of the largest banks controls roughly two - thirds of debit card transactions .
This retail coalition may agree with the finance / credit industry on other issues .
For example , they both oppose the Employee Free Choice Act , a bill that would make it easier for workers to organize themselves into a union and bargain collectively .
But on fee regulation the retailers and the finance industry have different interests .
It underlines the fact that the “ ruling class ” is heterogeneous in its interests , and multi-class coalitions can be formed for this or that reform fight .
And it especially underlines the splits over the financialization of the economy , over the deep penetration and almost total control Wall Street / finance capital has over other sectors of the economy .
Because of this , significant ruling sectors are lobbying for government regulation !
For this fight , the merchants are aligning themselves with small businesses and their customers in calling for government regulation .
Interestingly enough , a great majority of customers are working - class people who would benefit greatly from a higher level of unionization , which the Employee Free Choice
Act would advance – another kind of government regulation that the merchants group opposes .

( CNN ) --
Six months after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti , most governments that promised money to a special fund to help rebuild the country have not delivered the cash , a CNN investigation has found .
Donors promised $ 5.3 billion at an aid conference in March , about two months after the earthquake -- but less than 2 percent of that money has been handed over so far to the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission .
Only four countries have paid anything at all to the commission : Brazil , Norway , Estonia and Australia .
The United States pledged $ 1.15 billion to the commission .
It has paid nothing , with the money tied up in the congressional appropriations process .
Venezuela promised even more -- $ 1.32 billion .
It has also paid nothing , although it has written off some of Haiti 's debt .
Former President Bill Clinton , a U.N. special envoy for Haiti , said he plans to put pressure on governments that have been slow to deliver on their promises .
" I 'm going to call all those governments and say , the ones who said they 'll give money to support the Haitian government , I want to try to get them to give the money , and I 'm trying to get the others to give me a schedule for when they 'll release it , " Clinton told CNN 's Anderson Cooper earlier this week .
He said the worldwide economic crisis was at least partly to blame .
" I think that they 're all having economic trouble , and they want to hold their money as long as possible , " Clinton said .
Many governments and aid agencies have , of course , given money to Haiti through means other than the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission .
For example , the U.S. State Department said it has given about $ 675 million through the U.S. Agency for International Development .
Altogether , about $ 506 million has been disbursed to Haiti since the donors ' conference in March , said Jehane Sedky of the U.N. Development Program .
That 's about 9 percent of the money that was pledged for 2010 - 11 , about $ 200 million of which has been committed or disbursed to the government of Haiti to help it get back on its feet , Sedky said .
About another $ 200 million was money that had been in the pipeline for aid work before the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission was up and running .
That has left the commission with about $ 90 million in donations since the conference , Sedky said .
There is some dispute about the World Bank 's contribution .
The bank said it has made available $ 479 million , and of that $ 56.6 million has " already been used " for different government - led projects .
The World Bank said this money was provided directly to the Haitian government and did not go into the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission .
CNN compiled the information for this report by reviewing commission figures and surveying the donors that had made pledges to determine the disposition of those pledges .
Spain , France and Canada are also among the countries that have not yet followed through on their pledges to the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission , CNN found .
No countries told CNN they do not plan to deliver the money eventually .
The pledges are for fiscal year 2010 - 2011 , so the donors have until the middle of next year to get the funds to the Haiti recovery commission , Sedky said .
U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Wednesday that aid delivery to Haiti is going relatively well compared with other disaster relief efforts in which the world body has been involved .
" Compared with other disasters , coordination systems in Haiti have actually functioned reasonably well , " he said , adding that there was no requirement for aid efforts to work within systems .
" But within that constraint , what we 've been trying to do is coordinate the aid responses as best as we can , and we are trying to provide food as quickly as possible , " he said .
Some charities , meanwhile , are spending money as fast as they get it , while others are planning long - term projects .
Doctors Without Borders -- primarily a disaster - relief organization -- has received $ 112 million and spent $ 65 million , it said .
The group plans to spend more than $ 109 million by the end of the year , spokesman Michael Goldfarb told CNN .
The Red Cross has spent $ 148 million of the $ 468 million it has taken in , and is holding some money in reserve for more permanent projects such as shelter and water .
Private money has also come in from the Clinton Foundation , from Mexican telecommunications billionaire Carlos Slim Helu and Canadian mining investor Frank Giustra , but that 's not part of the $ 5.3 billion pledged by countries at the conference in March .
The January 12 quake left more than 220,000 dead , 300,000 - plus injured and more than 1 million homeless .
According to recent U.N. reports , the quake destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable .
Six months later , more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps .
According to the United Nations , 1,300 camping sites and 11,000 latrines have been built , and thousands of kilos of food and humanitarian resources have been delivered to those in need .
CNN'S Richard Roth at the United Nations contributed to this report .
Oh , it ’s not an iPad .
Not even close to the smoothness and sleekness of one .
However , consider these points :
1 ) It ’s less than half the price of the least - expensive iPad .
That ’s $ 500 for a 16GB iPad versus less than $ 200 for something you can stick an SD card into — one up to 32GB !
2 ) It ’s Android — which you can now make your own apps for .
Want a silly app with a picture of your cat meowing just for your own amusement ?
You can do that .
3 ) It ’s in the price point of a crappy eInk device — yet it combines the features of three of them !
Forget buying a Kindle or a Nook or a Kobo Reader .
This can do all three of those !
4 ) It will be on sale all over the place .
Staples , Target , Office Depot , Best Buy , and many , many other places .
What is this mystery device out of nowhere ?
It ’s the Pandigital Novel .
And a very easy method has been discovered to turn it into a full seven - inch screen Android tablet !
No rooting is involved !
Click = huge
This weekend , Nate the Great of The Digital Reader was kind enough to give me a sneak peek of a video he ’d done of his modified Pandigital Novel .
My jaw dropped .
There it was doing not only the included Barnes & Noble Nook eBook software , but also the Amazon Kindle software and the Kobo Reader software !
This turned it into three eBook devices !
But Nate did n’t try Aldiko , so I asked him to .
He went and re-did the video with that .
Here are some screensnaps from the original unpublished video :
When I asked him what was involved in rooting the device to do that , he revealed no rooting is necessary !
All that ’s involved is installing a different device driver and then a new Home launcher !
This makes modifying the device just about as easy as it can get for nearly everyone !
This is going to shake up everything .
1 ) The Pandigital Novel will be on sale in more places than the iPad or even the Archos 7 Home Tablet .
2 ) The Pandigital Novel is allegedly running Android 2.0 — not the 1.5 the Archos 7 Home Tablet is stuck with .
3 ) This is the cheapest seven - inch tablet out there , period .
4 ) The screen ’s aspect ratio matches that of the iPad , which makes it better for reading .
What are the downsides ?
What does a sub -$ 200 price really mean ?
1 ) It ’s a resistive screen .
It simply wo n’t be as responsive as an iPad .
2 ) It ’s not a very bright screen , like the iPad .
But if you intend to do a lot of reading , this is a plus .
3 ) It ’s not a blazing fast CPU .
The specs have n’t been published , but I suspect this is in the 400 - 600M Hz range .
It was originally designed primarily for reading , which does n’t require a lot of horsepower .
4 ) It ’s limited for video .
Unlike the Archos , this will only do MP4 and 3GP video .
It ’s unknown yet if this new Android video player software will work — or work well .
5 ) It will be heavier than most eInk devices .
Apple iPad : 9.56 ” x 7.47 ” x 0.5 ” – 24 oz
Pandigital Novel : 5.5 ” x 7.5 ” x 0.5 ” – 16 oz
Barnes & Noble Nook : 7.7 ” x 4.9 ” x 0.5 ” – 12.1 oz
Sony Reader Touch : 6.9 ” x 4.8 ” x 0.4 ” – 10.1 oz
Archos 7HT : 8 ” x 4.2 ” x 0.5 ” – 13.7 oz
Camangi WebStation : 4.72 ″ x 7.87 ″ x 0.57 ″ – 13.75 oz
Sony Reader Daily : 5 ″ x 8 - 1/8 ″ x 19/32 ″ – 12.75 oz
Sony Reader Pocket : 6.25 ” x 4.25 ” x 13/32 ” – 7.6 oz
Archos 5IT : 5.64 ” x 3.10 ” x 0.4 ” – 6.4 oz ( 32GB Flash )
Apple iPod Touch : 4.3 ” x 2.4 ” x 0.33 ” – 4.05 oz
6 ) There ’s no 3G , it ’s WiFi-only .
But does that really matter ?!
Tether or MiFi , if you can .
However , keep this in your mind : it ’s a full - blown Android tablet for less than $ 200 freakin dollars !
Where are you going to match that ?!
Everything else I ’ve seen in that price range has been from shady sellers on eBay hawking fall - apart hardware from China .
Pandigital is based here in America and has even embarrassed themselves to do the right thing for its customers .
And , oh , here ’s how to make an Android app with your kitty meowing :
OK , now are you sold ?
This cheap tablet , combined with Google ’s new app tool , is really going to make a huge different in the Android eco-system .
People will be able to inexpensively see how they should design software for larger - screen devices .
And by the time more expensive and more powerful Android tablets arrive , there will already be a library of apps available for them .
Apple really should get to work on reviving HyperCard .
Why should n’t I be allowed to make a personal kitty - meow app for myself ?!
Go to The Digital Reader post , see the new video , and download the simple instructions !

Pandigital ’s Strange Android Tablet
Two days after Mozilla sextupled the bug bounty paid to security researchers to $ 3,000 , Google has upped the ante for vulnerabilities that are reported in its Chrome browser .
In a continuing play on elite hacker speak , Google will begin paying as much as $ 3,133.70 for the most critical bugs that are brought to its attention , the company announced Tuesday .
Google began paying rewards in January with a sum of $ 1,337 for the most critical vulnerabilities .
At the time , Mozilla was paying only $ 500 for the most serious flaws brought to its attention .
“ It has been approximately six months since we launched the Chromium Security Reward program , ” Google 's announcement stated .
“ Although still early days [ sic ] , the program has been a clear success .
We have been notified of numerous bugs , and some of the participants have made it clear that it was the reward program that motivated them to get involved with Chromium security . ”
The bidding war is good news for private security researchers who frequently complain they are uncompensated when they warn software makers of serious bugs that imperil their users .
That longstanding arrangement allows the companies to benefit off the work of others and creates a sense that they are entitled to the information , the researchers have said .
To date only a handful of software makers offer security bug bounties .
They apply almost exclusively to open - source projects such as Mozilla 's Firefox and Daniel J. Bernstein 's djbdns .
TippingPoint 's Zero Day Initiative and VeriSign 's iDefense also pay for vulnerabilities with fees topping out at about $ 10,000 .
The firms use the details to protect customers who subscribe to their services from the vulnerabilities before they 're patched .
So far , Google has paid just one researcher the coveted $ 1,337 fee , while it has doled out six $ 1,000 payments and 15 $ 500 rewards , which are paid for reports of less severe bugs , according to this accounting .
The company will continue to pay the lower amount for lower severity bugs , although it will consider offering higher bounties when researchers for “ high - quality bug reports , ” such as those that include “ a careful test case reduction , an accurate analysis of root cause , or productive discussion towards resolution . ” ®

Jerusalem ( CNN ) --
The Israeli government 's press division is apologizing for circulating a link to a video that mocks activists aboard a ship headed to Gaza earlier this week that was blocked by an Israeli raid .
" Due to a misunderstanding on our part , earlier ( Friday ) we inadvertently issued a video link that had been sent for our perusal , " according to a statement from Israel 's Government Press Office , which distributed the link to media outlets .
" It was not intended for general release , " the statement said .
" The contents of the video in no way represent the official policy of either the Government Press Office or of the State of Israel . "
The video , titled " We Con the World " -- set to the tune of the 1985 hit , " We are the World " -- was put together by Caroline Glick , a former member of the Israel Defense Forces and columnist for the Jerusalem Post .
In the video , up to a dozen members of the so - called " Flotilla Choir " -- some wearing a variation of traditional Arab dress -- sing satirical verses , such as : " There 's no people dying , so the best that we can do is create the biggest bluff of all . "
On her blog , Glick , who briefly appears in the video , says , " We produced a clip in English .
There we feature the Turkish - Hamas ' love boat ' captain , crew and passengers in a musical explanation of how they con the world . "
" We think this is an important Israeli contribution to the discussion of recent events and we hope you distribute it far and wide , " she adds .
Nine Turkish citizens were killed Monday after violence erupted on one of six ships in a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to the Palestinian Gaza Strip .
A number of other people were wounded .
Israel said the passengers initiated the attack ; the passengers blamed the troops .
That incident drew widespread condemnation and cast a spotlight on the dynamics of the Gaza crisis .
On Saturday , Israel intercepted the final boat that was part of the flotilla , though the incident aboard the Irish - owned MV Rachel Corrie ended peacefully about 22 miles off the Gaza coast .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev dismissed the the video link , saying , " The GPO sends out lots of articles .
It does n't mean they like it . "
Regev said he first noticed the video on the New York Times website .
" I called my kids in to watch it because I thought it was funny , " he said .
" It is what Israelis feel .
But the government has nothing to do with it .
The GPO distributes non-government items , things that we think that show our side of the story . "
It was not the first time the Israeli GPO stirred controversy with its public communications on the Gaza flotilla .
Prior to the storming of the Turkish ship , the GPO sent an e-mail to journalists sarcastically recommending that while covering " alleged humanitarian difficulties , " journalists should dine at one of Gaza 's few restaurants .
" We have been told the beef stroganoff and cream of spinach soup are highly recommended , " the e-mail said .
The message included an internet link to an old promotional video for the restaurant .
The e-mail drew criticism from the foreign press and pro-Palestinian activists .
In an interview with the Jerusalem Post , GPO director Danny Seaman defended the communication , arguing that foreign media coverage of Gaza was not balanced .

Alvin Greene is the proverbial enigma wrapped in a riddle surrounded by mystery .
He 's also the new Democratic candidate for Senate in South Carolina .
Greene admits he had no campaign headquarters , no party support , no contributions , no job , no computer and no cell phone .
Yet , somehow , he managed to pull off the most unlikely of victories , and -- unless state Democratic Party officials have their way -- will face incumbent Republican Sen. Jim DeMint in November .
Greene 's improbable victory over Democratic candidate Vic Rawl , a former state legislator who officials expected would win , has unleashed a flood of questions , including how the unemployed Army veteran managed to pay $ 10,400 to get on the ballot before running a " low budget " campaign with no ads , website or fundraising .

Voters also are wondering how the 32 - year - old Greene , facing a felony charge for allegedly showing pornographic images to a college student last October , managed to capture 59 percent of the primary vote .
In an interview Thursday with FoxNews.com , Greene said he won by " simple , old - fashioned campaigning " that included traveling the state and speaking to voters " wherever I could find them . "
Greene said his " self - managed " campaign was personally funded and cost well under $ 2,000 .
He said he held no " formal events " and employed the help of family and friends to promote his platform : job creation , better education and " justice in the judicial system . "
Among his proposals , Greene said he wants to create jobs through Department of Transportation projects , like widening and repairing major interstate highways in South Carolina .
He also said he supports President Obama 's massive health care overhaul because " the best minds are behind it . "
The Democratic candidate said he got no help from the South Carolina Democratic Party .
" From day one , they just did n't have confidence in my campaign , " he said , adding that the state party wrote him off as a serious candidate because he had no funds and was unknown .
In fact , the South Carolina Democratic Party is so dumbfounded , one leading elected official is wondering if Greene is one of theirs at all .
U.S. House Majority Whip James Clyburn , D - S.C. , called Greene a " plant " and has demanded an investigation into his candidacy .
" There were some real shenanigans going on in the South Carolina primary , " Clyburn told the Bill Press radio show on Thursday .
" I do n't know if he was a Republican plant .
He was someone 's plant . "
The South Carolina Board of Elections told FoxNews.com that it has no plans to investigate how Greene pulled off the upset , even though the South Carolina Democratic Party now wants him off the ballot because of a pending felony charge that he allegedly showed obscene Internet photos to a 19 - year - old college student .
Camille McCoy , a chemistry student from Summerville , said she told police that a man , whom she later identified as Greene , approached her last October in an on -campus computer lab at the University of South Carolina and showed her dozens of pornographic images from a computer .
" He just sat down next to me and asked if I liked football , " McCoy told FoxNews.com .
" He then said ' well look at my computer ' and it was porn . "
McCoy said after she told Greene that the images were " offensive , " he said , " Let 's go back to your room . "
Greene , who received a degree in political science from USC in 2000 , refused to comment on the incident to FoxNews.com , saying only , " I'm innocent until proven guilty . "
" Right now I am innocent , " he said .
" The people of South Carolina have spoken .
They 've chosen me as their nominee and we have to be pro-South Carolina -- not anti-Greene . "
The candidate , who lives with his father in Manning , S.C. , and has been receiving unemployment benefits for nine months since leaving a 13 - year career with the U.S. Army , said he 's not quitting the race .
Under South Carolina law , convicted felons are prohibited from holding state office , but they can serve in federal office -- though the U.S. House or Senate can vote to expel or not seat him if he wins election in November .
Like Clyburn , McCoy 's mother said she wonders how Greene qualified to be on the ballot .
" It 's ridiculous and a mockery of the voting process , " Susan McCoy said in an interview with FoxNews.com .
" He was given a public defender and certainly did n't have $ 10,400 at his bond hearing . "
Among the few requirements for candidates to get on the ballot is a $ 10,400 registration fee collected by the parties and a statement of an intention to run .
The South Carolina Democratic Party also requires candidates to pledge that they are Democrats .
Greene told FoxNews.com that he got the registration fee from his personal funds and he was not given the cash .
" That was my money , " he said , adding that no one paid him or approached him about entering the race .
South Carolina Democratic Party Communications Director Keina Page said Greene told the party when he filed that " it was his personal money -- that he had been saving it . "
She said he originally brought a personal check but was told by party officials that he needed to file using a campaign check .
He left and returned with a campaign check .
Party officials said Thursday that if Greene stays in the race , he will be on his own .
They will not provide assistance .
Greene 's history is also little known .
He was discharged from the Army in August 2009 after being promoted to specialist .
He signed up for the Army for a three - year stint in February 2007 , and his discharge came six months short of his military obligation .
" It was an honorable discharge , but it was involuntary , " Greene said .
He declined to elaborate , saying , " Things were n't working out ... it 's a long story . "
The Army did not disclose the reason for his discharge because of Privacy Act rules .
It confirmed that Greene was awarded several service medals and ribbons , including an Air Force Good Conduct Medal , National Defense Service Medal , Global War on Terrorism Service Medal , Non-Commissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon and Army Service Ribbon .
Greene , who was last stationed with the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley , Kan. , served with the South Carolina Air National Guard from July 1995 to June 2002 and in the South Carolina Army National Guard from July 2006 to February 2007 .
On Wednesday , South Carolina Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler cited the pending court case in calling for the candidate to withdraw from the race .
" Today , I spoke with Alvin Greene , the presumptive Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate , and asked him to withdraw from the race , " Fowler said in a statement .
" I did not do this lightly , as I believe strongly that the Democratic voters of this state have the right to select our nominee .
But this new information about Mr. Greene would certainly have affected the decisions of many of those voters . "
In the present study , positron emission tomography with the tracer alpha -[ 11 C] methyl - L-tryptophan ( 11 C - AMT ) was used to compare 5 - HT synthesis capacity in two groups of adult males from a 21 - year longitudinal study ( mean age ± SD : 27.1±0.7 ) : individuals with a history of childhood - limited high physical aggression ( C - LHPA ; N = 8 ) and individuals with normal ( low ) patterns of physical aggression ( LPA ; N = 18 ) .
The C-LHPA males had significantly lower trapping of 11 C - AMT bilaterally in the orbitofrontal cortex and self - reported more impulsiveness .
Despite this , in adulthood there were no group differences in plasma tryptophan levels , genotyping , aggression , emotional intelligence , working memory , computerized measures of impulsivity , psychosocial functioning / adjustment , and personal and family history of mood and substance abuse disorders .

The present study is part of a series of studies that applied a significant paradigm shift , from clinical studies of patient samples to a developmental epidemiological and longitudinal approach .
Bio -psycho - social factors and outcomes were investigated with a population - based longitudinal cohort of young males from low socioeconomic area schools in Montreal ( Canada ) [ 19 ] .
More specifically , the current study tested the hypothesis that adult males who were on a high physical aggression trajectory during elementary school and desisted during adolescence ( childhood - limited high physical aggression , C - LHPA ) still maintained lower regional brain 5 - HT synthesis during adulthood compared to males who had a more normal pattern ( low ) of physical aggression ( LPA ) [ 3 ] .
Based on results from previous neuro - imaging studies in animals and in patients with impulsive - aggressive behaviors [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , the OBFC was chosen as primary volume of interest ( VOI ) .
All participants were assessed clinically , with a particular emphasis on current and recent impulsive aggressive behavior , frontal lobe function , emotional intelligence and psychosocial adjustment .
Genotyping for the rate - limiting 5 - HT synthesis enzyme , tryptophan - hydroxylase2 ( TPH 2 ) and prospective measures of early and late life adversity were also collected in order to explore genetic and environmental influences on 5 - HT metabolism .
Brain 5 - HT synthesis was estimated by means of positron emission tomography ( PET ) in combination with the injection of the synthetic analog of the 5 - HT precursor tryptophan , alpha -[ 11 C] methyl - L-tryptophan ( 11 C - AMT ) [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
Genetic epidemiology studies of aggressive behavior demonstrate that childhood physical aggression is highly heritable [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
The neurobiological substrates underlying the individual variability in the development of physical aggression and violence are many , although there seems to be little agreement about their relative importance [ 17 ] .
Generally , heuristic models support the view that gene by environment interactions manifest their effects through changes in brain structure and / or function , resulting into deficits in cortical top down control and / or facilitation of bottom up signalling triggered from limbic circuits [ 18 ] .
One proposed mechanism contributing to reduced top down control and behavioral disinhibition is lower brain serotonin ( 5 - HT ) neurotransmission in the orbitofrontal cortex ( OBFC ) [ 18 ] .
In contrast to popular belief , longitudinal epidemiological research indicates that the sudden onset of physical aggression in adolescence is unusual [ 1 ] .
Rather , physically aggressive behaviors can already be detected by 12 months of age , and their frequency peaks between the end of the second and fourth years [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
In the majority of children , the frequency of physical aggression gradually decreases , starting before elementary school entry [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] .
However , others start desisting only at the end of elementary school and others not until the end of adolescence [ 4 ] .
A 60 - year longitudinal study of juvenile delinquents concluded that very few show life - span high frequency of violent offending [ 5 ] .
Among those who do express chronic physical aggression , impaired executive functioning is evident in adolescence and early adulthood , even after controlling for other cognitive - neuropsychological domains , intelligence quotient ( IQ ) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) symptoms [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
Longitudinal follow up of elementary school children with high levels of physical aggression demonstrates that they are at greater risk for substance abuse , anti-social personality , suicide , depression , spouse abuse and neglectful and abusive parenting [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
However , the long - term outcomes for the physically aggressive children who desist with adolescence have not been studied [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
Given the finding in the C- LHPA group of higher self - reported impulsiveness relative to the LPA group , and studies showing that low 5 - HT neurotransmission is a biological risk factor for both aggressive behaviors and behavioral disinhibition , ( e.g . [ 18 ] , [ 28 ] ) , the primary VOI analysis was rerun , including the BIS score as a covariate .
The results of aggression trajectory on normalized K* in the OBFC were only slightly attenuated , indicating a multivariate effect of aggression trajectory ( F( 8,16 ) = 3.82 , P = 0.01 ; partial eta squared : 0.66 ) , and univariate statistics showing lower normalized K* in the left lateral OBFC ( F( 1,23 ) = 15.68 , P = 0.001 ; partial eta squared : 0.41 ) and in the right lateral OBFC ( F( 1,23 ) = 6.29 , P = 0.02 ; partial eta squared : 0.22 ) in the C - LHPA group , relative to the LPA group .
A significant difference in the expected direction was observed between the C- LHPA and LPA groups on a retrospective measure of aggression in childhood and adolescence , but no significant difference was observed for current aggression ( Table 1 ) .
However , the C- LHPA group exhibited significantly higher self - reported scores for impulsivity ( Barratt Impulsivity Scale ; BIS ) .
Nonetheless , the two groups did not differ for the total number of commission errors ( CE ) , nor for the number of CE in the Reward - Punishment component of the Go / NoGo task , a measure previously reported to be increased in clinical samples endowed with high impulsivity and / or aggression [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
Discussion
The present study investigated brain 5 - HT synthesis in a community sample of healthy adult males characterized by high levels of physical aggression during the primary school years and a desisting pattern during adolescence ( C - LHPA ) .
We compared them to males recruited from the same cohort with a normal ( low ) physical aggression trajectory during childhood and adolescence ( LPA ) .
We found no differences in aggressive behavior , mood state , social status and neuropsychological measures of working memory , emotional intelligence and impulsivity between the C- LHPA and LPA groups , yet the C - LHPA group demonstrated markedly lower 5 - HT synthesis in the bilateral OBFC in adulthood relative to those with a normal aggression trajectory .
In fact , the magnitude of the reduction of 11C - AMT uptake and trapping in the OBFC was about twice the one previously reported in patient samples with impulse control disorders [ 27 ] , [ 33 ] .
This observation forces a re-examination of the low 5 - HT hypothesis as a central tenet of the biology of violence .
5 - HT plays a significant role in neurodevelopment .
In humans , 5 - HT neurons are constituted approximately 5 weeks after gestation [ 34 ] , 5 - HT fibers grow in the cortex prenatally , and within a short period of time , between 12 – 14 weeks of gestation , the thalamocortical axons transiently express the 5 - HT transporter , crucial for the fine - tuning of cortical development [ 35 ] .
5 - HT levels continue to increase throughout the first two to five years of life and then gradually decrease until adult levels are reached ( approximately age 14 ) to a level approximating 50 % of the peak values of early childhood [ 36 ] .
Research in mice has shown that altered 5 - HT availability during a critical window of early development , through genetic or pharmacological manipulations and / or environmental events , can result in structural and / or functional alterations in brain neurotransmission with deleterious consequences on emotion regulation in adulthood [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
We presume that relatively low 5 - HT synthesis capacity partially accounts for high levels of physical aggression in childhood .
However , the substantial decrease in frequency of physical aggression during adolescence , as observed in our C - LHPA group , cannot be directly attributed to a relative increase in 5 - HT synthesis capacity , at least not from the level observed at 27 years of age .
We suggest that low brain 5 - HT in the C - LHPA group may operate as a vulnerability trait , but other protective environmental factors , as well as brain maturation and new learning , may have come into play with adolescence and early adulthood to support impulse control despite low 5 - HT .
Indeed , a 20 year longitudinal study of pre-pubertal adolescents examining sensation - seeking and impulsivity found that by age 15 , both measures demonstrated a steady linear decline , fitting well with the developmental pattern of other self - regulatory tasks that tap self - regulation ( Go / NoGo , Stroop , Antisaccades ) , as well as the maturational time course of the brain circuits that subserve impulse control [ 39 ] .
Consistent with this study , many of the differences in the behavioral phenotype noted between our two groups in childhood had disappeared at the 21 year follow - up ; and both groups were indistinguishable on the basis of psychosocial status in adulthood .
We suggest that , while 5 - HT neurotransmission tends to remain stable over time , from childhood to adulthood [ 40 ] , experience , brain maturation and / or environmental support play a major role in the near universal reduction in frequency of physical aggression with age , even in the most delinquent males [ 5 ] .
The validity and significance of the observations presented in this study , however , rest upon the following considerations : ( 1 ) When the technique was originally implemented , it was argued that the brain regional uptake of 11C - AMT might reflect blood - brain transport rather than brain 5 - HT trapping and thereby , 5 - HT synthesis [ 41 ] .
Experimental evidence accumulated over more than 10 years [ 23 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] now provides a firm basis for a consensus that brain regional 11C - AMT trapping represents an acceptable index of 5 - HT synthesis .
Of particular interest is the report of Patlak plots of 11C - AMT brain uptake estimated in primates , with a slope significantly different from zero , and providing unequivocal evidence for brain trapping of the tracer [ 24 ] .
( 2 ) The study was conducted between 2002 and 2007 .
An older version of the SPM software ( SPM99 ) was used for exploratory image analysis .
However , reanalysis of the image data with a newer version of SPM ( SPM2 ) yielded similar results .
Newer versions of SPM have now been released ( SPM5 and SPM8 ) , although much of the add - on functionality ( ies ) are for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) analysis .
The use of pre-processing steps ( co- registration / realignment ) relying on tools developed and validated in - house ( MINC tools ) at the Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) has made the use of newer versions of SPM less critical for PET investigations .
( 3 ) The interpretation of the results rests upon the assumption that normalized K* is a stable measure over time [ 47 ] .
Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) concentrations of 5 - Hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5 - HIAA ) in humans and monkeys are highly correlated over time [ 40 ] .
In addition , in humans , low levels of CSF 5 - HIAA have already been found in infants ( age between birth and 3 months ) from parents with anti-social personally disorders [ 48 ] .
These studies support the idea that lower 5 - HT synthesis in young adults as observed in the present study would most likely indicate a neurochemical vulnerability present since childhood .
( 4 ) Our study was limited to males .
The developmental pattern of aggressive behavior [ 49 ] , as well as many aspects of brain 5 - HTneurotransmission , including 11C - AMT uptake and trapping , are influenced by gender [ 22 ] , it would be of much interest to investigate the extent to which the present results generalize to females .
( 5 ) 5 - HT neurotransmission exercises an inhibitory tonic control on behavior ; low central 5 - HT facilitates behavioral disinhibition and its most extreme clinical manifestation , impulsive aggression [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .
Whether aggressive behavior at school reflected increased impulsivity was not specifically tested at that age .
This was however , unlikely , since measures of impulsivity collected in the laboratory in adolescence and during early adulthood , by and large , did not discriminate between trajectories .
Furthermore , co-varying out the PET data for BIS scores measured in adulthood in both trajectories , did not affect the results .
In summary , this study compared brain regional 11C - AMT uptake and trapping , a proxy measure of 5 - HT synthesis , in a group of young adult males on a childhood - limited high physical aggression trajectory and in a group of young males from the same population who were on a normal ( low ) trajectory of physical aggression during childhood and adolescence .
As predicted , the C- LHPA group exhibited lower 11C- AMT in the OBFC , with an effect size about twice of what was previously reported in patient samples endowed with an impulsive aggression phenotype .
Surprisingly however , in the presence of relatively low 5 - HT synthesis in the C- LHPA group , neither groups differed markedly in adulthood in their levels of aggressive behavior , nor in their behavioral , neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes .
This observation is interpreted as reflecting the mitigating effects of brain maturation , learning and supportive environment in the case of participants from the high aggression “ desisters ” trajectory .
Altogether , these data emphasize a less deterministic model with a role for familial and other environmental factors operating at different developmental time periods .
More generally , these observations may lead to a re-examination of the low 5 - HT diathesis theory , as a risk factor in the pathogenesis of impulsive aggression .
Dave leads a guided tour of three Linux software packages designed for making music by the numbers .
Over the next few weeks my articles will focus on software systems designed with special consideration for music composition by the use of algorithms .
Wiktionary defines an algorithm as " ... a precise step - by - step plan for a computational procedure that begins with an input value and yields an output value in a finite number of steps " .
By that definition algorithmic music composition is the process of using such procedures to generate values for the pitches , dynamics , rhythm , instrumentation , and other formal aspects of the composition .
The packages I 'll describe are systems that bind together a set of tools that typically include a language component , some form of graphic I/O , and a compiler for a broad variety of output targets .
These systems impose no particular rules regarding the composer 's use of either the system itself or its generated data .
Whole compositions may be produced through algorithmic means , or a system may be used to generate a series of variations on a single phrase within an otherwise strictly deterministic piece .
The software obeys the plan of the algorithm (s ) employed , produces the results of its calculations , and hands those results to the composer .
The composer obeys the demands of the creative impulse and remains free to dispense of the generated material as he or she prefers .
In this article I 'll review Professor Heinrich Taube 's Grace .
Following articles will profile Michael Gogins ' CsoundAC and Christopher Ariza 's athenaCL .
Each system has its unique characteristics , and each one is a valuable addition to the algorithmic composer 's software armory .
Grace
Common Music / Grace is a software system designed to assist composers working in music styles that employ chance , random , fractal , and other stochastic methods of generating values for their musical materials .
Common Music is a music programming language that includes a variety of functions and routines particularly important to algorithmic composition .
Grace is the Graphic Realtime Algorithmic Composition Environment , a JUCE - based GUI for Common Music that includes code editors for the Sal and Scheme language dialects , a set of predefined instruments , an interactive plotter with playback and various display options , a variety of output targets , and access to the host system 's audio and MIDI I/O services .
Common Music is transparently integrated into the Grace system so throughout the remainder of this article I will refer simply to Grace , with the same case as shown in the GUI splash screen .
Figure 1 . The Grace console
Incidentally , Dr. Taube began the Common Music project in 1989 at Stanford University 's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics , better known as CCRMA ( pronounced just like karma ) .
In 1996 Common Music won 1st prize at the Concours International de Logiciels Musicaux in Brussels , and the system continues its evolution today at the University of Illinois at Champagne / Urbana .
Installation & Configuration
If you run Fedora or Ubuntu the easiest way to get Grace for your system is to download the precompiled binary .
If you need or want to build it yourself the process is n't terribly difficult , but you will need to install an uncommon dependency or two .
See the Common Music Web site for complete instructions for building the system .
There is no need to install the binary for system - wide use .
To run it just enter the directory where you opened the package file and launch the binary there , i.e. :
cd $ HOME / Grace ./ Grace
You 'll soon see the Grace console as shown in Figure 1 .
Now you 'll need to configure its audio and MIDI settings from the dialogs under the Audio menu ( Figure 2 ) .
The Linux version of Grace supports ALSA and JACK audio .
Personally , I prefer JACK , but the system works well with either engine .
However , if you decide to use JACK you may need to increase its buffer period size .
I usually run my M - Audio Delta 66 with a small period ( 128 ) for low latency performance .
Alas , with that setting the Grace audio file player suffered audible discontinuities during playback - xruns in JACK - speak - so I adjusted the period size to 1024 and eliminated the xruns .
Figure 2 . The Grace Audio Settings dialog
The MIDI configuration dialog lets you select the preferred MIDI input and output ports , but unfortunately the configuration is somewhat confused .
Regardless of which ports I selected in the configuration dialog only the Juce Midi I /O ports ( Figure 3 ) sent and received data .
As long as those ports are correctly configured everything works fine , but the confusion can be annoying .
Figure 3 . Grace MIDI connection in QJackCtl
Once the audio and MIDI ports are configured you 're ready to compose with Grace .
Coding Grace
I 'm going to jump straight into programming Grace at the code level , so bear with me if I leave some things unexplained for now .
Sal is a programming language , but it does n't require a degree in computer science to master its essentials .
Editing existing code and building my own library of useful code fragments proved to be my best way into the language .
I wo n't claim mastery of the entire language - there are many aspects I have n't yet required in my work - but I have found it easy to learn the parts I needed / wanted to know .
Of course your way into Sal will be made even smoother if you have some experience with another programming language .
We 'll begin our explorations by using one of the system 's code editors to create some MIDI data and send it to the MIDI output port .
Open a new editor from the File menu .
Our examples are written in the Sal2 language , so open the editor 's Options menu and set the syntax to Sal2 .
You can choose to set it as the default syntax , or you can set it to Lisp , the original Sal , or plain text if you like .
Grace began life as Common Music , a clearly Lisp - derived language designed for music composition .
Common Music is still supported in the GraceCL version of the system , and the Scheme implementation retains enough parentheses to satisfy most hard - core Lispers , but I believe that new users are more likely to enjoy the relative ease of programming in Sal .
Like the original Common Music language , Sal includes tools for phrase generation and manipulation , pattern ordering / reordering , spectral composition , cellular automata , and many other interesting processes .
It also has the appeal of an uncluttered syntax .
Consider this Sal code fragment culled from the midiout.sal tutorial :
loop repeat 8 for t from 0 by .125 send ( " mp:midi " , t , key : between ( 40 , 90 ) ) end
Nice .
No parentheses or other syntactical botheration .
Copy that fragment and paste it into your open editor ( Figure 4 ) .
The code is run by selecting the code block in the editor - or simply placing the cursor after the end marker - and pressing the Ctrl +
Enter key combination .
Alternately , you can select the Execute item from the editor 's Eval menu .
Given a properly configured connection you should be able to route the newly created MIDI messages from the editor to whatever MIDI device (s ) - software or hardware - that you have available to your system .
For the examples here I recommend a synthesizer or sampler with a General MIDI sound set .
Figure 4 . The Sal2 editor
Some of the code 's functions might be obvious even to non-programmers .
A loop repeats itself 8 times and performs the instructions within the loop , a for statement and a send command .
The for statement defines a variable t by starting its value at 0 and increasing it by .125 in each iteration of the loop .
The send command sends a MIDI message in the following format :
send ( midi_port:midi_note_event start_time MIDI_keynumber )
In the code block the message start time is defined by the variable t.
On each repetition of the loop the message start time will increase by .125 seconds .
The MIDI note number is defined by a function called between , which selects a random integer between 40 and 90 ( MIDI notes are numbered frm 0 to 127 ) .
An explicit MIDI note - off message is not required , Common Music will automatically end the message at the end of its duration , i.e. after the message has lasted for .125 seconds .
Thus , our code fragment creates a different randomly selected MIDI note event eight times at evenly - spaced intervals and sends each event to the MIDI port chosen for the task ( see the Audio / MIDI Out menu item ) .
Where it goes from there is up to the user , though in this instance I suggest routing the MIDI output to a synthesizer or sampler .
Let 's make some simple changes to the code at three access points .
We 'll change the number of repetitions of the loop , we 'll redefine the duration of t , and we 'll expand the range of numbers for the between function .
loop repeat 16 for t from 0 by .250 send ( " mp:midi " , t , key : between ( 32,96 ) )
end
At this point the savvy MIDI musician might wonder about other information that commonly attends to a MIDI note event .
Have no fear , the other information - velocity , controller data , pitch bend - is all there in default values unless specified otherwise .
For example , if the key : slot had not been filled its default value of 60 would have been used .
For a final touch we 'll add a random MIDI Program Change number to select a new instrument per run .
We 'd like to save the output to a MIDI file , so we 'll also add a mechanism to do so :
file " midi-loop-01.mid " ( ) loop repeat 12 for t from 0 by .125 send ( " mp:prog " , val : random ( 16 ) ) send ( " mp:midi " , t , key : between ( 32,96 ) ) end end
Now when the code is executed it will perform its actions in realtime as before and create a MIDI file of the performance .
By the way , in the example the file will be written to the current directory , but you can specify any path you prefer .
I leave it to the reader to experiment further .
Consult the Common Music reference documentation in the Grace Help menu to see what other randomization routines can replace those used in our example code .
Load other examples and tutorials from the Help menu , experiment with the code , then experiment some more .
Composing With The Plotter
The Plotter ( Figure 5 ) is a normalized 2D graph that functions something like a piano - roll sequencer display , minus the tracking cursor .
You add a point on the graph by holding the Ctrl key while clicking with the mouse ( any mouse button will do ) , and you can delete a point by selecting it and then pressing the Delete key .
Double - click on a point to open a precision editor , double - click anywhere else within the graph to open an editor for the current layer .
Figure 5 . The Plotter
You can play your graph through the Play Plot dialog in the Audio menu .
This dialog determines the playback length , note duration and amplitude values , MIDI channel , and other playback functions .
You can also save the plot 's output as a MIDI file via this panel .
Figure 6 . Plotting a MIDI file
The data display can be set for points alone , connected points ( an envelope display ) , unpointed lines , vertical and horizontal boxes , and other representations .
The Plotter 's data can be converted to Sal , Lisp , or XML via the Export dialog under the Plot menu .
The data can be formatted as an envelope list or a points record and sent to your current code editor , to a new one , or to the clipboard .
You can load a MIDI file into the Plotter - in which case the display is no longer normalized ( Figure 6 ) - and that data can be edited and exported at will .
This feature opens some fascinating possibilities for transformative processes over large data sets , but alas , space forbids further exploration of the Plotter .
We must move on to describe the Grace targets .

The debate over the events of the G20 summit weekend has unfortunately been narrowed down to a single question : are you for the police or against them ?
This is distracting us from the broader issues involved .
Toronto City Council last week voted 36 - 0 to “ commend the outstanding work ” of Police Chief Bill Blair and his force during last month ’s summit .
Premier Dalton McGuinty said the police “ conducted themselves remarkably well . ”
Conservative Leader Tim Hudak accused activists of trying to “ demonize our police services ” and added : “ I proudly stand behind the men and women of our police services . ”
All well and good .
But it is also beside the point .
Critics of the mass arrests and other police actions over the G20 weekend — including this newspaper — are not blaming Blair and his officers , or at least not them exclusively .
They were just a part of a much bigger force – the so - called Integrated Security Unit -- that occupied Toronto during the summit weekend , including the RCMP and OPP .
The various police forces , in turn , were working within a framework of decisions made by the three levels of government — including the famous “ secret law ” imposed by McGuinty ’s cabinet .
The organizing committee for the summits ( G8 and G20 ) was primarily made up of federal bureaucrats , who were given strict instructions by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to keep a lid on unruly demonstrators .
They proceeded to spend a staggering $ 900 million on security measures and to turn Toronto ’s downtown into an armed camp for the weekend .
Given this multi-layered operation , only a broad public inquiry would have the capacity to follow the decision - making trail that led , first , to the apparent strategy to let a few hooligans run amok , and later , to the arrest of more than 1,000 people ( the vast majority of whom were let go with no charges , but only after spending the rest of the weekend in detention ) .
But by suggesting those favouring an inquiry are anti-police , our political leaders are deflecting attention from these broader questions , and from themselves .
As a result , we are left with a piecemeal process .
Last week , the Toronto Police Services Board , the civilian oversight body , announced plans to set up an external “ review ” of the events on the G20 weekend .
The review ’s mandate is not yet public , but it will be difficult for the board to go beyond narrow questions about the Toronto police force , which , according to a report in the Star on Saturday , was out of the decision - making loop .
As well , André Marin , the provincial ombudsman , announced last week he would investigate the circumstances surrounding the secret law .
And in Ottawa today , the federal New Democrats will push for the Commons committee on public safety and national security to hold public hearings on “ all issues surrounding security at the G8 and G20 summits . ”
These are welcome developments , but no substitute for a full inquiry .

An unlucky punter is no doubt ruing a last minute decision to drop a whopping $ 40,000 on Slovakia to beat the All Whites - just one minute before betting closed .
The internet bet , placed in the 87th minute , was made as Slovakia was paying just $ 1.02 for the win .
The punter would have taken home a profit of just $ 800 had the bet came through .
However a 93rd minute goal by Winston Reid saw the All Whites draw even .
TAB bookmaker Mark Stafford said this morning 's match was the most popular game of the tournament , so far .
" The expectation was that Slovakia would win that . "
Live bidding goes right up until " a few minutes before the end of the game , " said Stafford .
The TAB was about to shut the bidding when the last - minute , large - scale bid came through .
He said at the same time the unlucky bidder placed the bet , the odds for a draw were $ 11 .
Around 65 percent of all TAB bets placed on the game backed the All Whites to win , while around 15 percent backed Slovakia and 20 percent went for the draw .
Stafford said betting on the Fifa World Cup was " really popular " .
" It 's forced the other sports off the back pages , " he said .
" It 's their [ All Whites ] turn to shine . "
He said free - to - air live television and extra choices in commentary meant Kiwis were eager to watch the games .
" We 're a good gauge - people like watching their money go around . "
This morning 's result has n't changed the All Whites chances of qualifying through to the next round though according to the TAB , still paying $ 9 .
Meanwhile Slovakia 's odd have been pushed out from $ 2.20 to $ 3.50 to get through to the next round .
For years , the Collier County School district allowed a local Christian organization , World Changers of Florida , to distribute free Bibles to interested students during off - school hours on January 16 for Religious Freedom Day .
Now the group is filing suit after being told by the school board that it can no longer distribute the Bibles on campus because they do not provide any educational benefit to the students .
The school board and superintendent “ have denied World Changers access for no other reason than the religious content and viewpoint of the literature it wishes to distribute , specifically Bibles , ” the lawsuit contends .
“ This unequal treatment , based upon the religious nature of the literature World Changers wishes to distribute , is unconstitutional content - based discrimination ,
because World Changers ’ materials otherwise fit within the parameters Defendants set for the forum . ”
The group goes on to say that the school allowed other secular organizations to distribute literature but prevented World Changers from doing so even though it complied with all of the school ’s guidelines .
“ We are compelled to sue to protect the right simply to make free Bibles available to students in public schools , ” Mathew Staver , founder of Liberty Counsel , the legal group representing World Changers said in a statement .
“ Many of our founding fathers were taught to read using the Bible .
If it had no educational value , then many of them would have been illiterate .
The distribution of religious literature in a forum opened for secular literature is constitutionally protected . ”
The lawsuit seeks to have the school district ’s actions declared unconstitutional and requests legal fees and unspecified nominal damages .
Collier County School District did not respond to requests from FoxNews.com for comment .

CHICAGO , May 11 ( Reuters ) - Playboy magazine , a pioneer in featuring photographs of naked women on its pages , said on Tuesday its June issue ’s 3 - D centerfold will be an eye - popping collectible .
It was an idea the Playboy Enterprises ' PLA.
N founder Hugh Hefner says he had a half - century ago when he created the monthly , but could n't afford .
HBO , a unit of Time Warner Inc TWX.N , is helping out with the cost of 3 - D glasses bound up with the issue , which hits newsstands on Friday .
Playboy ’s Playmate of the Year , Hope Dworaczyk , can be seen like no centerfold has been seen before .
Her offering of a glass of wine appears to come off the page , along with the rest of her .
The 3 - D craze has exploded with viewers donning glasses to take in movie hits “ Avatar ” and “ How to Train Your Dragon . ”
In a crowded field of magazines , Playboy has seen its circulation decline to less than 3 million from 6 million in the 1970s .
“ You ’re constantly competing for people ’s time , you ’re competing for their attention , ” said Playboy editorial director Jimmy Jellinek .
“ You have five seconds to reach them .
In order to force them to physically go to the newsstand and buy your product , you have to give them a reason .
And this is a reason ...
“ It ’s tactile .
It ’s something that uses the platform and the medium for which it was created , ” he said .
This is a dino cover - up tattoo .
As you can see , it went from a lotus - blossom mermaid I would n't touch with Poseidon 's penis to a dapper t- rex I would touch with anybody's .
There 's a worthwhile animated gif after the jump that shows the change ( including the line work in - between ) , so be sure to check it out .

Gerald Vernon says he did everything he should have to obtain a permit to hold a meeting at the Tuley Park field house on the south side .
He told the park supervisor he expected 150 to 200 people to attend , filled out the paperwork she gave him , paid a $ 100 fee , and walked away thinking he 'd reserved a meeting room for the evening of June 30 .
The group that would be convening was Illinois Carry , an organization advocating for the right to bear concealed firearms .
But on Wednesday , a week before the scheduled date of the event , he got a call telling him his permit had been revoked .
Vernon says a Tuley Park official informed him he has to submit a new permit application that will be reviewed before he gets approval for the meeting .
But when I contacted the park and asked about it , I was told the event had been canceled altogether .
Says Vernon : " This just sounds a whole lot like Daley 's bullshit . "
Vernon has reasons for sounding impertinent .
Mayor Daley 's view of guns , gun manufacturers , gun-rights advocates , and people who ask questions about his views of same are well established : he does n't like them , he does n't want to hear from them , and he blames them for causing the violence in the streets .
Other top city officials , including the police chief and leading aldermen , follow his lead .
In recent weeks the mayor has repeatedly dodged questions about the city 's ban on handguns , which the Supreme Court is expected to strike down before the end of the month .
At the same time , Chicago has been in the throes of the annual surge in violence that arrives with warm weather .
Some of the most highly publicized recent incidents , including the slaying of a police officer last month , occurred in the Chatham neighborhood near Tuley Park .
" People want the ability to defend themselves and Daley wo n't let them , " Vernon says .
" And last weekend we had more than 50 shootings ! "
Vernon , a south - sider who teaches at Northeastern Illinois University 's Center for Inner City Studies , says he 's been in favor of conceal - and - carry laws for years but became more active in the issue after his girlfriend was robbed last year .
The organization has been holding public meetings across the state to discuss its support for gun ownership rights .
" We worked our way into Cook County and held a meeting in Lansing with the whole intention of doing them in Chicago , " says Valinda Rowe , a spokeswoman for the group .
" Where we decide to go is based on feedback .
We 've been hearing from people in that neighborhood [ Chatham ] , especially after the tragic death of the young police officer — people were saying , ' We need to have this conversation here .
We need to be able to protect ourselves . '"
" We wanted to have the event in Chatham as a result of Officer Wortham being killed there and the publicity generated by it , " Vernon says .
He says the group figured the best place to hold it would be in a meeting room in the Tuley Park field house , so three weeks ago he went there and told park supervisor Donna Jones what he wanted .
" Miss Jones was very helpful , " he says .
He got a receipt for his payment and thought everything was good to go — until Jones called him on Wednesday to say his original permit had been " rescinded . "
He 'd need to fill out another set of paperwork to apply for a special events permit .
" She said it could be another two weeks and then a committee would review it , " Vernon says .
As luck and poor planning would have it , I went to the Tuley Park field house myself Wednesday night .
I 'd heard about the meeting at a City Council hearing last week , but I mistakenly thought it was scheduled for the 23rd instead of the 30th .
Jones let me know that I was a week early — and more important , that the event had been scotched altogether .
" It 's not going to happen here , " she told me .
I asked if she knew why and she said she was n't sure .
" I just recycled their flyers , " she said .
She walked over to the recycling bin and fished one out .
The rest of them remained in the can .
When I reached Rowe she sounded surprised that I 'd been told the event was off .
She said all she knew was that there had been a " glitch " in the permitting process .
" Threw flyers in the bin already !
Sounds like she 's pretty sure it 's not going to happen at Tuley ! "
Rowe said her group was working on a " plan B " but asked if I had any suggestions .
( I did n't . )
I got back in touch with Jones .
She was certain there would be no gun-rights meeting at Tuley next week .
She said Park District officials had decided that the Tuley Park meeting room could n't accommodate Illinois Carry , but she would n't say who specifically had given her the orders .
" You would have to call the marketing director , " she said , meaning the Park District press flack downtown .
I got Park District spokeswoman Jessica Maxey - Faulkner on the phone .
She said she did n't know anything about the situation but would look into it and get back to me .
So far she has n't .
UPDATE : I first heard about the planned town hall meeting when Sixth Ward alderman Freddrenna Lyle groaned about it during a City Council hearing .
But when I followed up with her Friday , she said she had nothing to do with the decision to yank the permit .
" I have never spoken to anyone about this , " she says .
Tuley Park is in Lyle 's ward .
Lyle is a strong backer of gun control but said Illinois Carry should be allowed to hold its meeting .
" They want to go into a community touched by the violence because it's an easier sell , " she says .
" But those people have a right to meet and it's up to us who disagree with them to show up and make another argument . "
Washington -- Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , called Wednesday on President Barack Obama " to call Israel to an accounting " for its attack Monday on a Turkish ship that was traveling in international waters laden with humanitarian goods for Gaza .
Israel 's conduct " constitutes an act of belligerence against Turkey , which at one time Israel considered an important ally , " the Ohio Democrat wrote .
" It also undermines United States troops ' efforts in Iraq , since your administration 's efforts to achieve stability in the region and to withdraw troops from Iraq has depended upon Turkey 's cooperation through use of its air bases . "
He called for the United States to " begin to redefine its relationship " with Israel and for Israel to face diplomatic and financial consequences for the attack , which killed nine people .
" If our nation fails to act in any substantive way , the United States licenses the violence and we are complicit in it and our own citizens will be forced to pay the consequences , " he wrote .
A number of Republicans issued statements in support of Israel , including the co-chairmen of the House Republican Israel Caucus .
" As the facts trickle in and we learn more and more about the questionable nature of the crew aboard the Turkish - sponsored Marmara ship , it has become clear that it is false to characterize the nature of this mission as ' humanitarian , ' " said House Republican Whip Eric Cantor , R- Virginia .
" Rather , this was an attempt to provoke Israel , create international uproar and force an end to an Egypt - Israel blockade meant to stop Hamas from arming . "
" The United States has no greater friend in the Middle East , and it is important that we stand with our strategic and democratic ally in the face of sanctimonious international pressure , " said Rep. Peter Roskam , R - Illinois .
In addition , Rep. Mike Pence , R - Indiana , weighed in with support for Israel .
" No one likes to see the loss of life ; no one likes to see military confrontation , but Israel has a right of self - defense , and the reality is that Gaza is essentially an isolated , smaller version of a terrorist state , " he said .
" It launched lethal attacks against Israeli citizens in the form of thousands of rockets and this blockade has saved lives . "
He denied a humanitarian crisis exists in Gaza .
" Hospitals are fully stocked , food markets are fully stocked , " the five - term congressman said .
But the World Health Organization on Tuesday renewed its call for Israel to allow the unimpeded access into Gaza of medical supplies and described a different situation .
Hundreds of items of equipment procured by WHO and other organizations have been waiting to enter Gaza for up to a year , said Tony Laurance , head of WHO 's office for Gaza and the West Bank .
The items include CT scanners , x-ray machines , fluoroscopes , infusion pumps , medical sterilization gasses , laboratory equipment , uninterrupted power supply batteries and spare parts for support systems like elevators , he said .
" It is impossible to maintain a safe and effective healthcare system under the conditions of siege that have been in place now since June 2007 , " Laurance said .
" It is not enough to simply ensure supplies like drugs and consumables .
Medical equipment and spare parts must be available and be properly maintained . "
In addition , medical staff cannot leave Gaza for training , he said .
Disruptions of power , water and sanitation services also affect health conditions for Gazans , he said .
Gaza 's second - largest hospital , the Gaza - European Hospital , operates with only one of its three elevators functioning because of disrepair , he said .
Because many specialized treatments are unavailable in Gaza , patients are often sent to hospitals outside Gaza .
Several have died awaiting permission from Israeli authorities to travel , he said .

Historical and Present Anarchist Movements and Societies .
Since the beginnings of anarchism there have been countless attempts to manifold anarchist theory into social structures .
The few major anarchist - style societies that have arisen in the late centuries , have been fairly short lived .
However the increasing popularity of anarchist philosophy and the global trend towards left - leaning thought has produced a wide variety of anarchist experiments , although the importance and impact of these are negligible .
As more and more people in various communities decide to organize their world under principles of self - management and mutual aid , cooperation and direct democracy , Anarchism has the potential for a reemergence as a popular political philosophy .
Examples of projects and other movements with anarchist qualities [ edit ]
Icelandic Commonwealth ( 930 - 1262 ) [ edit ]
Main article : Icelandic Commonwealth
Anarcho - capitalists cite this as an example of society where police and justice were guaranteed through a free market .
They also cite the law merchant , international trade law , some traditional justice systems ( as in Somalia ) and other historical examples of order happening outside of government ( and sometimes against government ) .
Most anarchists reject the claim that there is anarchism in Somalia , given that there exist proclaimed states who are governed by local war - lords .
Further many anarchists contend that anarcho - capitalist communities are not truly anarchistic in nature , and that the " anarcho - " part of the name is a misnomer .
Holy Experiment ( Quaker ) Pennsylvania ( 1681 -1690 ) [ edit ]
When William Penn left his Quaker colony in Pennsylvania , the people stopped paying quitrent , and any semblance of formal government evaporated .
The Quakers treated Indians with respect , bought land from them voluntarily , and had even representation of Indians and Whites on juries .
According to Voltaire , the Shackamaxon treaty was " the only treaty between Indians and Christians that was never sworn to and that was never broken . "
The Quakers refused to provide any assistance to New England 's Indian wars .
Penn 's attempt to impose government by appointing John Blackwell , a non-Quaker military man , as governor failed miserably . [ 1 ]
The " / b / , " or random , board on many Chan Imageboards exhibits anarchist qualities .
While they have formal leadership ( moderators ) , they rarely exert any of their authority over users , other than , for example , shutting down a thread that contains child pornography , which could get the board shut down by the government or ISP .
Most users choose to post anonymously , making it nearly impossible for one user to gain a higher position than another , even socially .
The lack of an overall focus for the board makes it entirely unstructured .
Squatter Movements [ edit ]
Many of the squatter movements around the world and throughout history have been founded on anarchist principles with the simple goals of land and freedom .
Free Software Movement [ edit ]
The Free Software movement is an example of an emergent movement with anarchist characteristics .
The nature of the GPL and many other Open Source licenses is such that there is a collective sharing of resources ( in this case , source code ) between all developers , thus some anarchists see this as putting into practice their perspective on private property and economic organization .
Galt 's Gulch ( Frontierist ) Movements [ edit ]
Some people seek to avoid existing States by setting up societies that are hidden or far enough away from power centers to be relatively safe from statist attack .
( Cf : March region . )
The term " Galt 's Gulch " comes from Ayn Rand 's novel " Atlas Shrugged . "
Traditional anarchists are more likely to call this " frontierism " due to their rejection of capitalism .
One of the more well - known attempts was Laissez Faire City , which attempted to buy 100 square miles from a third - world country along the Hong Kong model .
Counter Economic Movements [ edit ]
Counter Economics is a theory advocated and practised by Agorists that proposes to bring about an Anarchist society through the use of black and grey markets .
Movements , predominately agorism , state that counter economics can be used to wither away the power of the state by depriving of it of the tax money it needs to survive .
In this way counter economic movements seek to establish a new society within the shell of the old .
Data Havens , Cyberspace , and Permanent Travelers [ edit ]
With the advent of computers , the internet , and strong cryptography , a demand for servers and data storage not subject to statist regulation and expropriation developed .
One such data haven , Sealand , is an entity in the English Channel .
The official site and the Wikipedia article both clearly claim that Sealand is a monarchy , but it is sovereign from outside statism .
These technologies also made anonymous digital currency practical .
With redundant servers in many non-public locations , digital money provides protection from taking and regulation , statist or otherwise .
In " The Sovereign Individual , Davidson and Rees - Mogg argue that technology now favors freedom , allowing people to ignore the State .
They predict an evolution to smaller States competing for customers ( tax - payers ) by offering various services and citizenship programs .
As States get more competitive in pricing and the cost of switching to a new " product " declines , there will be de- facto anarchy , i.e. the States will essentially evolve into anarchist PDAs ( Private Defense Agencies . )
Some anarchists live as PTs ( permanent travelers , perpetual tourists , prior taxpayers ) by residing in one State , holding wealth in a second State , and if necessary holding a passport from a third , with none of these three being the State attempting to tax them .
This is also called the Four Flag strategy .
States with liberal residency or tourist requirements , like Costa Rica or the island of Roatan , are popular expat havens .
( See www.escapeartist.com for an example of a PT information site . )
Seen a fly in your soup lately ?
Well , that 's nothing compared with what you do n't see in your strawberry yogurt or the sprinkles on your doughnut .
Crushed bugs .
You 've been eating them for years .
You just did n't know it .
That 's right .
The " color added " ingredient in some red , pink and purple foods is carmine , the dried and crushed bodies of the female cochineal insect .
The cactus - loving insect is used to color ice cream , yogurt , fruit juices and more .
" They 're harvested in Mexico , processed in large plants .
I 've seen them , " said Gary Reineccius , professor of food science at the University of Minnesota .
You may not have known , because they were hiding under the " color added " listing on the label , but you soon will .
Starting in January , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) is requiring manufacturers to switch from the " color added " label listing to " carmine " or " cochineal extract . "
Consumers should know what 's going into their food " to promote safe , healthy diets , " said Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) and part of the effort to require manufacturers to change their product labels .
Ingredients such as carmine have come under fire because they have been known to cause severe allergic reactions in some people .
Those allergic reactions , along with a few subsequent lawsuits , have led some manufacturers to stop using carmine .
Other people with dietary restrictions , such as Jews and Muslims , may not consider some products kosher if these ingredients are included .
But even those without restrictions might be a little squeamish if they knew just what was going into some of their food .
The CSPI wants the FDA to go even further , labeling carmine as insects on packaging .
After all , few people recognize carmine or cochineal as something that comes from insects , and even fewer would be curious enough to look it up online or in a dictionary to find out exactly what they 're eating .
Earlier this week we reported on a story that had been doing the rounds -- another Steve Jobs email thread with an irate customer .
Like many other stories about Jobs ' emails to customers , this yarn centered around a user disappointed with his iPhone 4's service , and Steve 's flippant responses .
The first time we saw the story crop up , we were suspicious of its validity ( and frankly , newsworthiness ) , and we became even more suspicious after AppleInsider ran an article claiming that the source of the supposed emails had been shopping the tale for cash ( Engadget was not contacted by the source ) .
We did eventually cover the story , but only after Apple itself responded to the tale , claiming -- first to Fortune and then to us -- that the emails were false , and the exchange had not happened .
That struck us as particularly newsworthy , because in all our years of reporting on Steve Jobs ' wild personal emails ( of which there are many many examples ) , we 'd never heard Apple refute that the emails were coming from him .
Now , Boy Genius Report ( where the original story appeared ) has fired back , emphatically claiming that the emails are real , and that the proof is in the original message headers which the site has been given access to by the source .
BGR goes one step further as well , and essentially accuses Apple PR of spinning this story to news outlets to suit its needs .
And let 's not mince words -- the claim is that Apple PR is lying to the press .
The proof which BGR offers is no more or less convincing to us than the site 's previous post on the subject ; email headers and timestamps can be faked .
Still , it is notable that Boy Genius is pushing back on this story , and we certainly do n't believe the blog would knowingly publish a false email thread .
As TechCrunch points out in its take on the matter , PR reps often give vague , sugarcoated , or misleading information to news sites , but there has never been a time when Apple 's PR has outright lied to major publications ( that we know of ) .
That would be a mess of epic proportions , and we can't really fathom why they would go to the trouble .
The company has obviously let stuff like this slide for years -- this seems like an odd time ( and a relatively minor story ) to get up in arms about it .
We 've reached out to Apple for further statement on this , and will report back as soon as we hear something .
In the meantime , take a look at the source link and see what BGR has to say on the matter .
For much of his career , comedian , actor , writer , and director Louis C.K. was better known for failure than success .
He infamously wrote the Bill Clinton - breastfeeding - puppies sketch that began the ill - fated run of the fabled but quickly canceled Dana Carvey Show .
He wrote and directed Pootie Tang , a resounding commercial failure that picked up a dedicated cult following .
And he created and starred in Lucky Louie , an homage to blue - collar 1970s Norman Lear sitcoms , which divided critics and audiences , and was cancelled after a single season .
Advertisement
C.K. ’s fortunes seem to be on the rise , however .
He recently appeared in a multi-episode story arc on Parks And Recreation , saw his aptly named new movie Hilarious become the first stand - up - comedy film to be accepted into Sundance , and played Ricky Gervais ’ best friend in The Invention Of Lying .
He has become one of the most respected , consistent stand - up comedians in the business .
He ’s currently starring in Louie , which premières June 29 on FX ; the series is loosely based on his life as a newly divorced single father raising two daughters .
The A.V. Club recently spoke with C.K. about the craft of comedy , getting a pilot deal without a script , making a show with a network that ’s at his mercy , and why he has no plans to stop using the word “ cunt . ”
The A.V. Club :
The last two times I talked to you , we did post - mortems for Pootie Tang and then Lucky Louie .
But now it seems like everything is going well for you .
Advertisement
Louis C.K. :
This is pre-mortem .
AVC : Does it worry you when things seem to be going too well ?
LCK : Not at all .
I expect there to be a cycle and to be back out on the street again at some point .
That ’s the nature of it .
The good thing about living that cycle a lot , like I have , is that you survive the downside , and make use of the downside , so you do n’t fear it anymore .
I ’m not worried about that .
I ’m enjoying the work while I get it right now .
This is really great , and I have high hopes for [ Louie ] , but not expectations .
[ Laughs . ]
Actually , in this case , I do , but I ’ve had high expectations before , and so much of it is n’t up to me that I ’m just enjoying the work .
If I lose any of the stuff I ’m getting right now , I ’ve always got the road .
Stand - up makes you so autonomous and self - sufficient that it really helps with that part of show business .
Advertisement
AVC : You have complete control .
LCK : I can go out on the road .
I can make money .
I can do what I do in its purest form without asking anybody for permission .
You ca n’t cancel my stand - up tours .
It ’s impossible .
There ’s too many separate bosses .
There is no “ bosses . ” I rent these theaters now .
When I worked the clubs , it was very different .
Pretty much you needed to please the Improvs , but if I get cancelled , I can put together a stand - up tour and go on the road and continue generating .
I do n’t worry that way anymore .
I do n’t know what it ’s like to be an actor , where if your show gets cancelled , really you ’re just a bum .
[ Laughs . ]
It must be really awful .
You ca n’t go out and do a little acting , you know what I mean ?
If I ’m not on tour , I can run down to the comedy club and do a little stand - up .
If you ’re an actor , you ca n’t go — I guess there ’s forms of it .
Advertisement
AVC : You ca n’t run out and perform Hamlet on the streets .
LCK : Yeah , exactly .
AVC : You ’ve built this foundation and fan base that will help sustain you through the dry periods .
Advertisement
LCK : Yeah , I hope so .
Also , they do n’t always sustain me through the dry periods , they get me to the next place .
This show has my stand - up actually in it , and if it succeeds , it ’s going to be partly because of the audience from the last three years on the road .
All the success I ’ve gotten through the last couple of years has been through people in theaters .
When you put people in theaters for a high ticket price , that is an infallible proof that you ’re worth taking a chance on .
AVC : It ’s concrete validation .
LCK : Exactly , so if you hang around Hollywood for a couple of years and keep asking , people might say , “ Okay , go ahead and try a show . ”
But to go out on the road and sell tickets and spend one day in Hollywood getting a show is a much better way .
And again , it ’s because people are waiting , and I do n’t take any of it for granted .
Being popular with an audience is a very rickety ladder to be on .
Because people can decide that they just do n’t give a shit anymore .
That ’s one reason I ’ve spent the last three years working the way I have , generating all this new material .
Advertisement
When I did Shameless , my first hour special , that was the first thing that got me selling big theaters out .
And when I went back on the road , I decided that maybe I needed to do a totally different show , do n’t show them any of the same material , just keep going , make a new hour , do n’t go back into a theater until I have a new hour .
That was my instinct .
I was talking to Chris Rock about it , and he said “ If you do a special people love and they buy tickets and come see you , and at that show you do a totally different show , those people will never let you go .
That ’s it .
You got them .
Because they just know that when they see you , you ’re going to do something new , something better than what they ’ve seen before , and that ’s huge . ”
If people pay to see you because they like your special , and they pay money to see the exact same show , they ’ll actually be very happy .
They wo n’t complain .
They ’ll go , “ Ah , that was exactly as great as I thought it would be , because I ’ve seen it . ”
But they wo n’t see you again .
If you come through town , they ’ll go , “ I know what he does .
I do n’t need to see that three times . ”
AVC : In Steve Martin ’s memoir , Born Standing Up , he talks about how one of the things that made him want to stop doing stand - up was that he would perform at the Hollywood Bowl , and the audience would be performing his set along with him .
Advertisement
LCK : Yeah that ’s no fun .
And sometimes when I ’ve been onstage , people would yell out “ Suck a bag of dicks ! ” from my special , and I would just say , “ No , that ’s old material .
I want to give you new material . ”
And every time I said that , I would get applause .
I got the sense through this kind of ad hoc polling that 95 percent of the audience would really like to see new stuff .
So if you ’re always working on material that is new to you and new to your audience , and because it ’s new to both of you , there ’s a precarious feeling like maybe it ’ll work , maybe it wo n’t , that keeps it exciting also .
I always feel like I ’m proving myself to the audience .
I never feel like they ’re carrying me through the show .
Because I ’m not perfectly confident in any of this material .
It ’s never older than a year .
So that puts you on uneven ground , and that ’s exciting .
That ’s positive .
AVC : On your blog , you recount a show you did in Dublin where you bombed .
It seems surprising that people would spend $ 20 to go to a show for someone they did n’t already like .
Advertisement
LCK : Problem with the situation for me lately — one of the reasons I go to the UK is because it ’s not my audience .
They ’re new people , and that ’s good , getting out of your element .
I go to Birmingham , Alabama for the same reason , although I have a great crowd there .
Dublin was a festival .
It was n’t me doing a concert somewhere .
It was me at a comedy festival and people just come in droves to see whatever is there .
I was definitely not the attraction at that show .
Actually , the attraction at that show was a guy named Des Bishop , who is an American .
He ’s from Queens and he expatriated to Ireland .
He ’s lived there for years .
And he ’s a young , good - looking guy who people in Ireland just fucking love .
Des Bishop makes girls scream .
He ’s energetic .
He ’s a funny guy .
But he has a cult there , and I was on his show .
And the purpose I was given on that show was basically making people wait to see him .
And they did n’t want to hear from me to begin with .
And the show , I ’m sitting there pacing out this material that I can do for hours that I ’m trying to get done in 20 minutes .
I ’d just gotten to Ireland .
I was n’t into it , and these people just fucking …
You know what ’s funny , though ?
I listened to the tape .
I made a recording of it on my digital recorder , and I did fine .
I was killing for part of the set .
But the time where I got heckled and it started to feel stale , felt so bad .
[ Laughs . ]
It just felt so rotten , and it ’s also unusual for me to feel that way onstage these days .
I remembered it as bombing .
I blogged about it , I wrote about it , like “ This is what it felt like . ”
And I think it ’s such an interesting and unique experience to bomb .
And then it got picked up by a bunch of other comedy blogs , saying , “ Louis C.K. bombed ! ”
And it was kind of publicized as “ Hey , guess what , this is a secret that it happened , he would n’t want you to know this . ”
I was like , “ Well , I put it on my own fucking website . ” [ Laughs . ]
You know about it because I told you .
I do n’t care .
All of it is fun and interesting to me .

AVC : In Comedian , the Jerry Seinfeld documentary , there ’s a part where he bombed , and this was post - Seinfeld , and there was something incredibly refreshing about the fact that people would see Jerry Seinfeld in 2004 and not laugh just out of respect .
It seems like nobody ever gets to the level where people just laugh automatically .
LCK : No , no .
AVC : Though with someone like Andrew “ Dice ” Clay , the audience seems primed to laugh at anything he does .
Advertisement
LCK : Yeah but even Dice , I see him all the time at The Comedy Store , and he struggles through his sets .
But he does it on purpose .
Dice is a really interesting case , because he really likes the dark side of comedy .
I have a lot of respect for that guy .
The act that he packaged into this ridiculous character is very boring to me , the stuff that ’s on his albums .
But seeing him live in a club in front of like 12 people is a great study .
He really knows what he ’s doing , and he is really interesting doing stand - up when he is more himself .
He actually has a double album that nobody really knows about called The Day The Laughter Died .
It ’s him on Christmas Eve , and there ’s almost no one in the crowd , and he ’s fucking dying , and he ’s fighting with people in the audience and getting heckled .
People are walking out .
He put it on an album , and this was at the height of his fame .
The fact that every stand - up — a guy like Jerry goes onstage and gets huge ruckus applause just for being there .
He has two jokes to keep it , that ’s it .
If by joke No. 2 , he ’s not funny , then fuck him .
They do n’t give a shit , that ’s the way it is , especially in New York .

AVC : Has performing stand - up gotten easier for you over the years ?
LCK : Well , no , because I have n’t let it become easier , I try to keep it challenging .
It ’s easier if you cull from all your greatest hits and just do them .
That ’s easy , but it ’s also probably suicide .
[ Laughs . ]
It ’s harder now than it was earlier , but it ’s way more compelling and inspiring and fun .
It ’s worth the traveling and everything now .
I got really burnt out on travel , but not anymore .
Because I do n’t really care — unless I ’m on some stupid train to Buffalo or somewhere , I ’m not thinking of comfort .
I ’m poring over notes , listening to some old tapes , and being sure I make use of that show , because I start every year with a target date for that special , and it ’s always a little too soon , so I ’m always in the theater .
So it ’s harder , and I ’m always trying to cull together material that I do n’t really know well .
If it works out , at the end of the year , I ’ve got a completely honed , perfect sweet set .
I know right where the sweet chunks are .
I know right where the heavy artillery is , and I ’ve got a reliably great hour .
And I do it in front of a polished , perfect crowd and get it on tape .
And that ’s easy and fun and great , but it takes a year to get there .
And when the special is done , I ’m back to nothing , literally no material , not even a single joke I can tell onstage .
So that keeps the cycle .
Advertisement
AVC : You have to start from scratch .
LCK : Yep , and I ’ll be there .
Right now , I ’m using the material that would have been a special for the show I ’m doing , because there ’s stand - up in the show .
But when I ’m done with the series , the next target is , I ’m doing Carnegie Hall in November .
And I want to tape that .
I want that to be the next one , so I ’m going to have no jokes in May or June of this year , and I ’ll have from then ’til November to build a set .
But it ’s worth it , performing in Carnegie Hall for a filmed audience .
Advertisement
AVC : Carnegie Hall has quite the vaunted reputation .
LCK : Yeah , definitely , because otherwise , it ’s a shitty deal .
[ Laughs . ]
The old joke goes , “ How do you get to Carnegie Hall ?
Practice . ”
It ’s not true .
You get to Carnegie Hall by selling Town Hall out twice .
And the day you ’re offered Carnegie Hall , the promoter always tells you , “ This is not a good room .
It ’s expensive .
It ’s got good acoustics for music , but it ’s not great for stand - up , and you can make way more money at the Beacon .
There are more seats , and the rent is lower , and it ’s a non-union crew . ”
So it ’s actually a bad deal to play Carnegie Hall , and the way you get there is just by proving that you can sell that many tickets .
But I ’m doing it because it ’s Carnegie Hall .
Jesus Christ , you know ?
I wanted to be able to say some basic things about how things went for me that are easy to understand .
“ I played Carnegie Hall . ” Hooray .
Advertisement
AVC : No one can ever take that away from you .
LCK : Yeah , it ’s fun .
I like everybody who ’s played there , all that stuff .
But it ’s funny when you realize there is n’t some kind of committee of guys where they sit at a long table like in Flashdance .
There is n’t some big moment where an old man calls you .
It ’s just “ Hey , you ’re selling mad tickets , and that ’s a room you would fit in this year .
You could play another room that ’s better , but I know you want to play Carnegie Hall , go ahead . ”
It ’s funny how that works out .

AVC : In a recent podcast , you were asked about the Conan / Leno situation and you asked why The Tonight Show was such an incredible prize for Conan O’Brien in the first place .
Like Carnegie Hall , The Tonight Show has symbolic value , but it sounds like you do n’t have the same reverence for it that Conan O’Brien did .
LCK : Well , I just think that if you have your own real estate , your own shingle , if you have the Nathan Rabin Store on Main Street , and everybody goes there and it ’s huge , and the Sunglass Hut next door says , “ Hey , you ’re doing so well , why do n’t you take over the Sunglass Hut instead of your own store ? ” [ Laughs . ]
I do n’t know .
To me it ’s a weird .
Advertisement
AVC : The Tonight Show is the same class act .
LCK : Exactly .
I mean , it ’s a brand .
And it was a brand that was created by Jack Paar and the network .
You know , Leno was a terrific comedian .
He was one of the best , and he never really showed that as the Tonight Show host .
Even when he was a guest host , he was better .
He was freer and more himself .
And then when he took it over , there was sort of a responsibility .
I remember reading an interview with him saying that you make changes on The Tonight Show very slowly , because it was like a big ship that you have to turn , slowly and carefully .
And I just remember thinking “ Ugh .
Who can watch that ? ”
Advertisement
AVC : That ’s a recipe for shitty , safe comedy .
LCK : And you know what ?
Everybody has different tastes and different wants .
The fact is that he made those turns , and he took that show to a place where it belonged to him , and it was his , and he still had it despite losing it .
I remember when I was in Iraq with the USO , I did a tour there , and we flew in these huge C17 planes , and I hung out with the pilots , and they let me hang out and talk because I love airplanes .
And I asked them if they really wanted to be pilots , because I just assumed anybody who was a pilot would want to be a fighter pilot , like if you ’re a pilot in the military , you always wanted to be the Top Gun guys .
You fly an F16 , you become Tom Cruise and all that stuff .
But these guys were a different breed of pilot .
They loved the heavy stuff .
They call it the heavy stuff , just these massive planes .
And the pilot of the plane I was in , the main pilot , his big dream is to fly Air Force One , that ’s where he ’s heading .
He ’ll probably get it , too .
He ’s getting rated on bigger and bigger planes until he can’t fly anything bigger , and they ’ll give him Air Force One .
So that ’s that way .
I personally would rather be in a fighter jet , although I ’m 42 now — I ’d rather just stay home and watch these people do these things on television .

AVC : I recently found a clip of Leno on Letterman in the ’ 80s and it ’s remarkable how affectionate they are with each other .
LCK : He was goddamned funny .
And you know what the thing about Jay is ?
He ’s hilarious in those little Letterman jokes , just doing those because he just does n’t give a shit .
And he ’s still the same guy , but he ’s like , “ I ’m not going to stop talking about airplanes until I run out of funny shit to say about them . ”
His humor was so pedestrian and basic back then , but it was undeniably great , and I learned to respect that from him .
It does n’t matter what your subject is , you do n’t have to be edgy in your subject matter .
That ’s just superficial horseshit , that you want to be talking about things nobody else does .
If you have a strong point of view about something , choose that to talk about .
He was so fucking good .
No , he was amazing .
You could see Dave lose control and fall apart laughing during his sets on that show .

AVC : How did your USO tour come about ?
LCK : That was pretty intense .
It was great .
It was hard traveling and hard work to get you up at all hours .
Sometimes you go to sleep at 2 in the afternoon and wake up at 6 in the afternoon , but then you push on to the next invaded nation .
[ Laughs . ]
I was in Kuwait , Iraq , and Afghanistan .
And we were in two different parts of Iraq .
One of them was a place called Balad , which is not even a place , it ’s like a place that ’s been created in the desert by the army .
And these are really strange places to be , so the personal experience was bizarre and educational .
But the shows were phenomenal , because the audience were these soldiers who were just so happy to have something to do .
It ’s all the things you would expect from a USO tour .
They ’re happy you ’re there .
They ’re happy to see somebody from home .
And they ’re also , because they ’re in the army , they have a sense of responsibility .
They ’re a different type of audience .
They ’re in a supportive role .
They want the show to go well .
It ’s a really weird feeling .
[ Laughs . ]
They ’re not customers who paid money , and they ’re not , you know , that thing that came from the Internet , that “ meh ” people with that attitude .
These guys do n’t feel that it ’s their prerogative to say something like that .
They feel like “ We ’re the audience here , we ’re going to give you the best show that we can , rather than the other way around , ” and that ’s a really interesting place to be .
Advertisement
Coming from people who feel like they ’re customers all the time , that gets a little grating .
Not to me as a comedian .
I do n’t have that problem with my audience , but just seeing how people — I put a thing on YouTube recently that was just a set I did at the Comedy Cellar , trying new material , so it was about a 40 percent hit rate — a lot of it bombed .
I was just going up with a notebook and trying stuff .
So for the hell of it , I put it on YouTube .
I took it down .
I only put it up there temporarily .
I ’ve kind of gotten into doing that lately , like putting something up and then taking it down rather than just letting it live there for forever .
And some people that know me said , “ Hey , some of this stuff is working .
It ’s interesting . ”
Other people were like , “ This kinda sucked . ”
Or “ Less than half of that was any good . ” I actually wrote that in the introduction .
That ’s why I put it there .
[ Laughs . ]
That is exactly what I said , and I put it there , but people were writing in comments , like , “ Nah , it ’s unpolished . ”
Yeah , exactly .
That was the whole point .
AVC : Is it just a way of road - testing your material without actually going on the road ?
Advertisement
LCK : Yeah .
Also , I used to just post videos on the Internet , before YouTube .
I used to post material on the Internet that I was unlikely to do onstage again .
Or other little things that happened , little riffs that were probably not going to grow to full material , I would post them to have them live somewhere .
Because it was like “ This thing happened , and I doubt I ’ll ever do them again , and I ’ll at least let it be out there in that one form . ”
I do n’t do it as often as I used to , because all that stuff these days usually grows into material .
I do n’t waste anything anymore .
I eat the whole pig , basically .
AVC : What can you say about the new show ?
LCK : Well , I was in L.A. to meet with big network people .
It had really come from this one show I did at the Wiltern .
I sold out the Wiltern , and had an amazing show there .
My manager brought all these TV - development managers to the show , so I got a bunch of interest from NBC , Fox , and the networks .
They were trying to develop a series , and we were just trying to drive up the quote .
To make money — that was really the point of it .
I needed the cash , because I ’d just gotten divorced ; that was kind of where I was coming from .
[ Laughs . ]
But then my manager , Dave Becky , had me meet with John Landgraf , who runs FX , and he said “ You can come do a show here , which will give you a lot of freedom , and it would just be a very cheap show . ”
He said he would give me $ 250,000 per episode to do a show there .
That ’s an enormously low number .
It ’s a gigantically small budget for a TV show .
Most TV shows are around a million or so , and that ’s cheap .
Advertisement
So I did n’t really want to do it , because I really did n’t want to struggle .
Also , he said he wanted me to use the same sort of material I was going to use for — I said I wanted to do a sketch show , and he said “ No , we want you to do what you do onstage , which is talk about being a dad and stuff . ”
And I was like “ Well , that ’s got a high price tag on it over at NBC .
They ’re offering to pay me half a million bucks just to write the thing , let alone the cost to make it . ”
So he called me at home and talked to me for about three hours about his model for making television .
And he said , “ We just take a little bit of money and we throw it at somebody who is funny .
We can do this without asking anybody , we can make this deal right now .
You do n’t have to pitch anything , and I ’ll just write you a check , and we make a pilot . ”
And I said , “ The only way this is interesting to me is if you literally wire me $ 250,000 .
I ’m pitching you what the show is about .
I do n’t want to write a script for a pilot , and I do n’t want to show you anything until it ’s finished .
So if you give me $ 250,000 , I ’ll give you a pilot in two months . ”
AVC : That ’s a ballsy thing to do .
LCK : Well , from my standpoint , I was on a tour doing really well , and I was just about to shoot the special I shot , and I had offers from other networks for way more money .
[ Laughs . ]
Advertisement
AVC : Which equals power .
LCK : Yeah , and I felt like I could do this to the guy .
He ’s a very smart guy .
Also , he could have said no , and I could have said , “ Well , let me look at it another way , ” and I could change my mind .
But you can always say stuff , so I said it .
I said “ That ’s the way I ’ll do the show , the pilot , ” and he said , “ Fine , I do n’t care . ”
And I have this personal connection with him , because then I would get calls from him .
We got the money .
We formed the company , and I did n’t even have anything written down .
I did n’t even know what I was going to make .
But I started thinking of places to shoot , and I hired a location scout , and got locations , and I started renting cameras and producing without a script , which is a motivating way to work for me .
Advertisement
And I started getting calls from people from FX , and they said , “ We want to know who you are casting , so we can make deals with them , ” and I said , “ Well , I ’m not telling you .
I only deal with John Landgraf . ”
And I called him and said “ Listen , tell them not to call me , because I do n’t want to tell them who I ’m casting , and I want to make the deals with my cast through my company .
I do n’t want them to have anything to do with you . ”
And he said fine , and he just called them off .
We just kept working that way , and I shot the pilot , and they loved it .
And I was told we ’d get another four episodes , but then they said “ We ’re going to make the whole season , ” and gave me 12 more .
The budget went up to $ 300,000 per episode , which is still very low .
And my deal is that I get the money , and I make the show , and nobody tells me how to do it .
I only showed them two episodes , because I finished them last week , but I shot four episodes without showing them a script or even pitching stories .
So that ’s how this is working .
AVC : Was stand - up always going to be a part of the show ?
LCK : In the beginning , I was n’t sure I wanted to use stand - up .
I knew I wanted the show to have different little pieces and not just be a standard sitcom with an arc .
I was really tired of writing two - act sitcoms , and it ’s hard to write without doing that .
I knew I did n’t want to have a writing staff , I knew I did n’t want to have an institution of a show .
And I wanted to have something handmade .
I wanted to use what I used as a filmmaker .
I wanted to go back to independent filmmaking in New York with the people — I ’m using the same people that I made short films with in the ’ 80s here .
I wanted to stay at home .
I wanted to employ a lot of New Yorkers , and I wanted to find a way to incorporate stand - up .
I did n’t want to take away from stand - up ; I did n’t want to stop doing it .
I gotta give John Landgraf credit for what the show turned out to be , because when he called me that day , he said , “ Is there something you can do that feels like a sketch show in terms of having a loose format , in terms of having an unconventional format , but that has your specific autobiographical and personal take on things in it ?
It is n’t just sketches about anything . ”
And I thought , “ That ’s very limiting for a sketch show .
But it ’s very liberating for a sitcom . ”
Advertisement
That ’s sort of the seed of when I started things , “ Yeah , if I open this up ” —
Because I ’ve always made short films , but they ’ve always been crazy , like the Catholic Church being all about blowing boys or whatever .
It ’s never been about what I do , and I thought “ If I make a short film instead of these stories , a lot of the stuff I think of is one idea , but it ’s part of a whole .
So I want to be able to do just like I do onstage — some bits are 20 - minute stories , some bits are 10 - second one - liners , and if I could do the same thing with a visual that ’s a really interesting format and let the films be part of — I would narrate the show .
And when I first sat down to write the pilot , I wrote my name at the top , like ‘ Louis talks into a camera . ’
And then I though “ Ugh , I ca n’t do that . ” I was sort of picturing Annie Hall .
The way he opens Annie Hall , when he ’s just talking as Woody Allen to his film audience , then starting to show them what he ’s talking about in little pieces .
I thought “ That ’s kind of what I want to do , a TV show like Annie Hall . ”
AVC : There was a similar structure in Whatever Works , with Larry David spending a lot of time directly addressing the camera .
Advertisement
LCK : I did n’t see it , but it ’s something Woody Allen really innovated to me — just talking .
“ Here ’s what I want to talk about , ” and shooting , and then coming back and saying , “ This is how I felt about that . ”
It ’s a very direct way .
It ’s a no- bullshit way , non-pretend -y way to do this kind of thing .
So I started to write it that way , but I got sick to my stomach at the idea of me talking to a camera .
I ’ve never been able to do it , and it just feels dumb .
And then I thought , “ Well , what if I did stand - up ? ” My first thought was , “ What material would I use ?
Because I ’ve got a new hour , but that was going to be my next special , and that stuff is really good , but I ca n’t tap it for this .
It ’ll be wasted . ”
Then some voice in me said , “ What are you , a fucking idiot ?
This is a huge shot .
This is a TV show .
Just use your top of the cream material in the show .
That ’s gonna take down the amount you have to write to a huge amount , anyway . ”
So I started taking from the stuff I had developed up to that point , and then putting it on paper and adding film to it .
It just came to life .
Then I just knew what the show was .
It just became very clear to me that I could churn this shit out forever .
That ’s where it is now .
AVC : I ’ve only seen the pilot .
LCK : It ’s got these two segments about two different things .
The stand - up relates to the films , but not directly .
I ’m not setting up a short film .
It ’s not like Chappelle ’s Show , where I talk about a subject and then say “ Watch this . ”
It ’s just stand - up about a certain subject , and then the film relates to it as another piece of stand - up coming subsequently might — peripherally or directly , sometimes not .
Some of the episodes coming up are different .
They ’re a little more story - based .
I ’ve hit a rhythm where the first half of a show is a more balls - funny , profane short film about my life , putting myself into these weird situations .
Then the second half is more grounded .
The pilot is almost that , because the date is pretty crazy , with the helicopter and stuff .
Then the story of the bus is more a story you ’re following .

AVC : Were you worried about Seinfeld comparisons ?
LCK : I do n’t really care , because what people say and what people enjoy is two different things .
I think my show has a gigantically different voice from Jerry ’s , just like onstage I ’m different from him .
I think people hearing a synopsis about what the show is might say that , but I do n’t think that would turn people away from it .
At the outset , I think everything new gets compared to something else , favorably or unfavorably .
Nobody believes there can be a new show , amazingly still .
People think , “ We have what we have , and the new guy ’s a piece of shit . ”
So the easiest way to haze the new guy is “ Trying to be like Jerry , eh ? ”
Advertisement
AVC : When Seinfeld first came out , critics labeled it as a knock - off of the It ’s Garry Shandling ’s Show .
When Friends premièred , critics said it was ripping off Seinfeld .
No matter how new a show might seem , it is inevitably compared to something that came before it .
LCK : Yeah , and I think you have to resist worrying about the first wave of reactions , because there ’s nothing you can do about it , and if you react to that and try to make that your success , it ’s very short - sighted , and has very little to do with what you actually want to do on the show .
I did n’t think about Jerry when I did this show .
I did n’t watch that show that much .
I respect him enormously , and he ’s been a friend to me in the past .
It ’s like when — and I ’m not trying to compare myself highly here — but I learned a lot from Barack Obama , personally .
I think he ’s a really smart guy .
When he picked Joe Biden to be his vice president , I think he knew he was going to make Hilary Secretary Of State , which is way , way more powerful than vice president .
And so everybody that said , “ Oh , you ’re going to totally lose everybody that liked Hilary .
You ’re going to lose every woman , ” he said , “ Well , Joe ’s great .
I like Joe . ”
And he just let people say it .
It did n’t matter .
And then after he got elected , based on that choice , he said , “ By the way , I ’m making Hilary Secretary Of Fucking State . ”
He did n’t get any political hate for that .
It was a smart thing to do .
He picked her , because he wanted her , but he did n’t go , “ Look , I ’m going to make her Secretary Of State , so please do n’t … ” [ Laughs . ]
What I saw from that , when I saw that happen , was he ’s willing to let people go ahead and say what they will , and not let that talking - head spinny thing happen .
I do n’t believe I ’m going to get canceled because somebody said the show is like Seinfeld .
So I ’ll go ahead and let that happen , and get canceled because nobody ’s watching instead .
That ’ll be easier .

AVC : The pilot does n’t establish the usual domestic - sitcom features , like a supporting cast .
Will that become clearer as the show develops ?
LCK : There ’s been one or two people that have come back to do more than one episode .
But what I ’ve learned from doing the show is , there ’s an amazing pool of actors in New York City .
There are literally thousands of gifted and originally voiced actors , and I have n’t come even close to exhausting them yet .
This one episode where there ’s a city worker , and this guy says one line to me , and it ’s such a fucking beautifully delivered line , I remember thinking , “ God , I wish this guy was on every episode . ”
But that ’s it .
We ’re done with him .
He did one line , and we ca n’t use him again .
I really like that about the show , that there ’s a lot of actors and nobody knows who they are , but they ’re doing beautiful things on the show .
I ’m going to let it happen organically .
If somebody is interesting enough to use again , I ’ll use them a second time , and keep going show - by - show that way .
The reason casts seem like such a big deal on shows has so little to do with how a show works creatively .
A lot of it is financial pressure .
When they cast shows in Hollywood , there ’s a much smaller talent pool that ’s certified approvable network cast members .
When you do these series , you have to go to the same fucking pool every year .
And they have these monster agents .
You have to make these series deals with them , and you have to promise to put them in every episode .
They ’re enormously expensive , and the networks are only willing to take a shot clearly on 20 or 25 people per year .
You end up with the same voices , and you write them because you have to .
In the writing staff , they call it , we have to “ service ” these characters .
You ’re servicing the people you ’re writing .
Advertisement
AVC : There ’s a sexual connotation as well .
LCK : Yeah , exactly .
But if anybody ’s going to be blowing anybody , it ’s the fucking character that should be blowing the writer .
And I ’m not talking about the actor .
I ’m talking about the character .
You ’re writing for this character because you have to , because there ’s pressure to , also because the networks like having this idea of these people on an easy chair , looking lazy and funny .
So they want you to pump each character up , and that ’s awkward .
I remember when I was on the set of a show I was working on , some time ago — I do n’t want to name anybody .
There is a scene being shot of two characters talking that made no sense .
It was just useless .
They kept shooting it over and over again , because they could n’t get it to work , because it did n’t need to exist .
And I asked one of the writers , “ Why are you doing this ? ”
And he said , “ Because they do n’t have anything to do in this episode , these two .
So we just have to do something with them . ”
It was so depressing , and it took way more time than it did to shoot the valid dialogue between the main characters .
Those are the kind of mistakes I ’m avoiding with this , because literally nobody talks to me from the network except to say , “ We hope you ’re doing well . ” I do n’t have to do that .
Nick DiPaolo , he ’s a comedian friend of mine , he ’s in one episode and he did really great , and I think I ’ll probably bring Nick back .
Pamela Adlon , who played my wife on Lucky Louie , she plays a mom who has a kid in my kid ’s class , and she ’s in a couple episodes right now .
So there ’s a little bit of that , but there is n’t a central cast .
Advertisement
AVC : There are a lot of forces in the industry that foster homogeneous programming .
Louie seems to be bucking that trend .
LCK : Yeah .
For instance , my show is probably skewing a little older than FX ’s usual fare .
They ’re definitely a young man ’s network .
I ’m 42 and divorced .
There ’s not a lot of 42 - year - old divorced guys with two kids .
So while that is a lot of my audience , young men who come to my shows and stuff , I ’m not their usual thing .
If I were on Comedy Central , they would say , “ Change the show .
It ’s too old . ”
That ’s what they ’d do over there .
They just force it down your throat .
“ You ’re skewing too old .
Write other shit , please . ”
But these guys are n’t doing that .
And we discuss it .
We talk about where they want to put the show in their lineup and stuff .
They ’re making decisions in the other direction :
How can they accommodate the show to fit that audience , instead of telling me to conform to what they do ?
The whole process of dealing with the network is a very arduous process .
And I ’m not even complaining about it , like it should n’t be that way .
These people invest a huge amount of money in their shows , but that ’s a big part of it .
If you want to do a show with a huge , premium price on it , if you want to do a $ 3 - million - per - episode sitcom , and if you want to get paid half a million dollars to develop it , you want to get paid $ 100,000 per episode , then they ’re going to need to look after that money .
You know what I mean ?

When you write the show , they ’re going to need to see drafts .
They ’re going to need to give you notes and have you rewrite the script before you go into production , because it ’s costing them millions of dollars .
They ’re also going to need to come to the set .
You have to put the show on for the network and the studio .
You have to do these run-throughs that are a huge effort , before you ever get to shoot the show .
I would say that 60 percent of the effort you make on a network show is spent making the networks feel comfortable about what you ’re shooting , and I do n’t blame them .
You ’re asking for a huge amount of money .
These people in Hollywood , they make so much money to produce these films — they ’re fucking themselves .
These guys are literally giving me a 10th of what most shows cost , and the risk is very low for them .
If I make a piece of shit , they ’ll flush it through their system .
They ’ll make a little money back on some Hulu deal , and it ’ll be over with .
It ’s not a big deal .
Landgraf is a very smart guy that he ’s willing to do that .
He has , whatever , $ 10 million to develop with .
He ’d rather break it into little pieces and try with a bunch of different people and let them do whatever they want and see which monkey with a typewriter comes up with a good show than to have this corporate science go into making two pilots that nobody wants to watch .
AVC : Did they do any test screenings for the series ?
LCK : They tested the pilot .
I had one phone call with John where we talked about the last piece of stand - up , where I talk about my dog dying .
The last thing I say in that episode is about having to put my dog to sleep , and then he came back in my dream , and then we realized again , we have to put him to sleep .
That ’s the end of our show , and he said a large portion of our test audience found that really depressing .
And he said , “ That ’s the one piece of feedback I can give you from the pilot , because people thought that should n’t be the end of the show , because it ’s such a downer . ”
And I started to feel depressed , and he said , “ I also think it ’s hilarious , and I think you should leave it in and ignore them . ” [ Laughs . ]
So that ’s the kind of pressure I get from the network .
“ We have data that this is bad .
Please leave it in the show . ”

AVC : On the show you play a divorced father named Louie C.K .
On what level are you playing yourself ?
LCK : Well I ’m playing me , but I ’m not depicting my real life .
I ’m not reenacting moments that I ’ve lived , but I ’m playing myself .
I ’m projecting myself into these situations that I write for the show .
That ’s the best way to describe it , I think .
Also , I do let myself make mistakes on the show that are mistakes I would n’t make , because it ’s just more interesting .
Advertisement
AVC : Like what ?
LCK : There ’s an episode I have with Nick DiPaolo where we have this political argument .
He ’s very conservative .
I ’m somewhat liberal .
To make that a more interesting argument to have , I called him a Nazi .
So he ’s Himmler , and he hates minorities .
I do n’t believe anything I said .
As a liberal , I think that flawed liberals are more funny , so that ’s what I ’m being on the show .
On the other side of it , there ’s a gay father on the show , a gay guy who has a kid in my class , and I shot a scene the other day where I ’m trying to relate to him , and I ’m not doing it well , because I ’m uncomfortable .
So I ’m trying too hard to get along with this gay guy , and it ’s not working because I ’m trying too hard .
I ’m having trouble relating to a gay guy .
That does n’t exist at all in my life .
There ’s a lot of gay fathers at my kids ’ school , and they ’re friends of mine .
I do n’t think of gay people as a separate category of persons .
I do n’t go , “ Oh my God , it ’s a gay guy .
What do I say ? ”
But to me it ’s a funny thought , a guy that would do that .
And I could understand somebody feeling that way , so it ’s an interesting thing to reveal .
That awkwardness , even with the willingness to be one with everybody , that if people are new to you , it makes you feel awkward and makes you feel stupid when you try .
Instead of just walking up to somebody and saying , “ Hi ” because they ’re a person , thinking , “ Oh it ’s a gay guy , better say the right thing . ”
That ’s a very stupid thing , and I would n’t do it , but I ’m willing to do it as myself on television , because it ’s a worthwhile thing to explore .
Advertisement
I think I do that a lot onstage during my stand - up too .
I ’ll take points of view and positions and stuff and stories about myself that are n’t true , but they ’re worth revealing , and I ’d rather reveal them as myself than criticize other people .
I ’d rather take on the stupid behavior to reveal it , even though it ’s in other people I ’ve seen it in .
Because for one thing , you ’re kind of infallible when you ’re using yourself .
You ’re not attacking anybody .
And also , it helps me relate to it better .
Rather than depicting somebody like “ There ’s that character over there being a piece of shit . ”
These straw - dog moments like in West Wing , where they make conservatives just stand there and get pummeled .
[ Laughs . ]
It ’s almost more interesting for me to play the guy I ’m putting down — not putting down , but revealing , because I do n’t think any of these behaviors come from a bad place .
I think they just come from confusion .
I think most homophobia and racism is just from fear and cultural pollution and lack of experience — and selfishness and stuff .
A lot of the stuff I do onstage lately , I talk about what a piece of shit I am .
I ’m better than the guy I ’m talking about , but I think it ’s a valid way to reveal these things .
AVC : Your stand - up material can be pretty brutal in its depiction of human nature .
How do you separate your stand - up persona from your offstage personality ?

LCK : [ Laughs . ]
Well , I would say I ’ve learned about that as I ’ve gone along .
The first couple of specials I did where I talked about my family , I really just talked about them .
I do n’t think I would do that again .
I think I was too direct .
I mean , my kids are different .
When I talk about my kids onstage , I create characters of them that do n’t really exist .
I have two daughters , and they ’re unbelievably great .
We ’re partners , the three of us .
We do a lot together , and they ’re reasonable , and they listen .
They ’ve always been that way , and I ’ve had tough moments with both of them .
Any kid has a right to a lot of totally unfair , ridiculous behavior .
But when I talk about kids onstage , I feel like I ’m being more a part of a collective of all parents saying what it ’s like for us to raise these kids .
If you really love your kid and you really make a huge effort with them , you ’re going to have moments when you ’re intensely angry at them and resent them .
It happens .
It ’s part of really trying .
I ’m not ashamed to say that about my kids onstage , and I know that in their future , they ’re going to understand that , because they ’re being raised by me .
If I was a father who was absent from them , and I was saying stuff onstage and that ’s all they knew of me , I think that ’d be painful for them .
But I ’m with them all the time .
My kids are with me half of every week or more , because we share custody .
That ’s one of the reasons I ’m doing this show , is because I ’m able to do it inside a child - custody schedule .
Because if I had a show on NBC , I ’d have to go out there seven days a week .
I was n’t willing to do that when the rubber hit the road .
I ’d say that was 70 percent of the reason .
I know I ’ve been talking percentages a lot , but I think that was 70 percent of the reason I took this deal , because of knowing I do n’t have to do anything that ’s purely for the show , so I can distill the experience down to a few days a week .
It drives my production crew crazy , but every Wednesday at 1 p.m. , no matter what ’s going on , we wrap , because I have to go pick up my daughter , and I do n’t work Wednesdays , Thursdays , or most Fridays , because those are my kid days .
I do n’t get a nanny .
I do n’t get a babysitter .
I take care of them .
I feed them .
I do their homework with them .
When my kids are in my home , I ’m a full - time dad , and that ’s a really big deal to me , and I ’m not willing to let go of that .
Advertisement
I started that as a stand - up , because when I was just on the road , I was able to go on the road half the week and be with them half the week , and I found a way to do this show that way .
And there are times when my line producer says , “ I need more focus from you , ” and I tell her , “ You ca n’t have it .
This is the way I ’m doing this . ”
And it ’s working so far .
I ’m juggling it .
So that ’s who I am to my kids , and they know me , and they ’ve seen some of my stand - up from earlier days .
Most of the stuff I ’ve done lately is not okay for their age , but the stuff I always used to do about their mom , I always saw it as a thing that was about a couple that loves each other , and is in a marriage struggle .
So this is what that ’s like .
I learned something there as far as talking very specifically about things that have happened with another grown - up person in your life .
I would n’t do that again .
I do n’t talk about her anymore onstage or in the show .
She ’s not represented in this show .
She ’s like Charlie Brown ’s mother in this show .
You never see her , and I ’m not going to cross that line with her , because she and I are n’t in a relationship anymore , so there ’s no implied contract that I can talk about her .
But also , I ’ve changed .
I ’ve looked at the show carefully , okay .
I ’m telling stories about being a dad and having kids in public school .
I am a dad , I have kids in public school , so I wanted to make a conscious effort to make these two separate worlds .
Like I said , I ’m the same guy in both worlds .
But in the show ’s world , my two daughters are very different from the daughters I have in real life .
And the characters that are in the school do n’t exist at my kids ’ school .
They ’re not knock - offs .
They ’re just different people I ’ve created for this show .
So to me now , they ’re separate .
It used to feel like it was kind of a mess , and I learned from it , and I do n’t do that anymore .
Lucky Louie was never my marriage .
I never had a marriage like that .
That was very different .
[ Laughs . ]
Lucky Louie was a totally different life than I was living at home at the time .
So that ’s where I had started to learn that already .

AVC : When you create art or entertainment out of your life , you tend , by default , to turn human beings into characters .
Which can be a good and a bad thing .
LCK : Yeah , definitely .
That ’s why , on this turn , I decided to really deliberately not do that .
I think I ’ve succeeded .

AVC : As a viewer , it ’s nice to see parenting done without sentiment .
I feel like any time a stand - up comic has a child , suddenly a lot of their act seems to dissipate and becomes “ Here ’s this funny thing my child did ! ”
It seems like you ’ve gone in the opposite direction , if anything , going a little darker .
LCK : Yes , because if you ’re really putting the time in and raising your kids , it ai n’t generally that cute , and it ai n’t that easy .
[ Laughs . ]
And also , the parts that are cute and easy are n’t funny .
So I ’ve had plenty of lovely moments with my daughters .
It ’s been most of their lives that I ’ve had joyful , nice , sweet exchanges .
I do n’t want to see none of that shit on TV .
Nobody wants to see that .
What fun is that ?
[ Laughs . ]

AVC : It turns into a big episode of Kids Say The Darnedest Things .
LCK : Yeah , exactly .
I mean , somebody ’s doing that , and let them do it .
But I ’m not interested .
Advertisement
AVC : Since we last spoke , you ’ve done a lot of acting .
LCK : Yeah .
I do n’t think I ’m going to be doing much more of that .
I ’m really hoping that if this series becomes a real job for me , if this keeps going , that I ’ll never have to be in anybody else ’s show .
[ Laughs . ]
Because again , it takes me away from home .
I got offered a pretty big arc on that [ New Adventures Of ]
Old Christine show , and I just said no , because it was going to be three weeks away from home .
I just did n’t want to do that .
I do n’t like sitting in a trailer , waiting for somebody to tell me to come shoot something .
It ’s a really boring life .
On my show , I do n’t sit in a trailer .
Being on the set ?
I love that .
But being in a trailer and eating craft services ?
I do n’t like that life .
So I probably wo n’t be in a lot more movies .
[ Laughs . ]
Honestly , my agents were begging me to audition for this movie once , the lead in a movie that ’s probably going to be a really big movie by a great filmmaker , and they wanted me to audition for the lead , and I said no .
They said , “ You know , he knows who you are .
He really likes you .
You have a really good chance to make this movie . ”
And I said , “ Yeah , that ’s why I do n’t want to audition . ”
It would have meant spending …
I mean , these movies that I have been in , I ’ve managed to just do a week or two weeks on the picture .
But to go — this movie was going to shoot in Hawaii — for two months ?
How the fuck am I going to live in Hawaii for two months ?
How am I going to not see my kids for two months just to be in a movie ?
You know what I mean ?
It ’s not worth it .
I ’ve got a job .
I work .
I do n’t need the job , so fuck it .
It ’s not worth it .

AVC : You had a big role in The Invention Of Lying .
LCK : That was , from what I understand — Ricky [ Gervais ] and Matt Robinson , his co-director / writer , they both saw me on YouTube , they loved my act , and they just decided to give me the part .
I mean , I never auditioned for that .
I never auditioned for anything I got , basically .
They ’re all just things that people sought me out for .
Ricky ’s people called me and said “ We want to put him in this movie , ” and I was in it .
Advertisement
AVC : It ’s a pretty big role .
LCK : It is .
I was really amazed that I got that .
And I love Ricky , so I could n’t believe that happened .
I remember at one point , my agent said that the deal was n’t closed yet , because he said , “ You ’re getting fucked , because everyone else in the cast is getting points . ”
He said , “ You ’re like sixth guy down on the billing , and you ’re like the biggest part after him and Jennifer .
So we ’re saying ‘ Fuck you ! ’ ”
And I said , “ Shut up , you idiots !
That ’s how they ’re populating the film .
That ’s how they ’re getting it made .
I would n’t put me any higher in the credits , either . ”
Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Bateman , all bigger than me .
So what did I care ?
Advertisement
AVC : Your name is above them on the credits of the DVD .
LCK : Yeah , on the DVD box I did okay .
I do n’t care .
It was so fun to make that movie .
I lived in Lowell , Massachusetts , like 20 minutes from where I grew up , for two weeks .
I went to Celtics games .
They got me tickets on the floor for Celtics games every night .
I hung out with Ricky Gervais .
It was a fucking ball .
It was great .

AVC : In Hilarious , you use “ cunt ” an awful lot .
Are there any words you ’re gun-shy about using ?
LCK : My feelings about “ faggot ” are starting to change .
I did this long bit about the word “ faggot ” in my last special , and about how to me it ’s always just meant “ annoying . ”
I grew up with a different meaning to it .
So I ’m not talking about gay when I call people faggot .
But I know I ca n’t ignore the way that it makes gay people feel .
It ’s not really responsible to just pretend other people are n’t offended .
I ’m not worried about offending people , but I do n’t want to offend them for no fucking reason .
Just because I ’m being lazy .
So I ’ve cut down on “ faggot ” a little bit .
“ Cunt ” I feel differently about , honestly , because “ cunt ” is culturally different in England and here .
When I do something where I call a deer or a telephone or a man a cunt …
“ What is it with taxis today ? ”
When I call an object or a man a cunt , and women get offended , it ’s puzzling to me , because I ’m like “ I was n’t talking about you . ”
I do n’t think that these groups of people get to just own words and say when you can and ca n’t say them .
I think a lot of being offended is very narcissistic .
If you ’re telling a story about a pony — I remember I was telling the story that ’s in the show about my daughter getting bitten by a pony , and there was a time that I told that story onstage where I called the pony a cunt , and this woman hissed at me .
I said , “ What ’s your problem ? ”
She said , “ It ’s offensive to women . ” I said , “ First of all , I ’m talking about a fucking pony .
Who was male .
Who bit my daughter .
And why are you getting in the middle of this ? ”
You know what I mean ?
Advertisement
AVC : “ This is between me and the pony . ”
LCK : Yeah , exactly .
“ What does this have to do with you ?
How do you step into this and say you ’re offended ? ”
So that ’s the way I feel sometimes .
But I do n’t know .
Everything is context , I think .
I do n’t think there ’s any word where I ’m “ I wo n’t say this , ” but I do n’t say them without reason .
On my show , FX is extremely liberal about language , but they do have words that they want you to justify using .
It ’s an interesting exercise , and I think it ’s worthwhile to make sure you ’re not just throwing something out there just to say it .
I do n’t do that onstage as a stand - up .
I just say whatever the fuck I want .
[ Laughs . ]
It just comes out of my mouth .
Often it ’s just in the heat of the moment .
Often it ’s just a guttural feeling I ’m wanting to get out .
The thing about “ cunt ” is , to me , it is the absolute atom bomb or neutron bomb of language .
It gets you there quick .
It ’s the express train of emotions , you know ?
So I like to take it sometimes .
I am trying to limit “ fuck , ” because I ’m bored of it .
When I watch myself or listen to myself saying it just as a condiment , I think it gets really dull .
It just sounds like a drag .
It ’s just like using any word too much .
It ’s like teenagers saying “ like ” all the time .
It ’s just boring .
So I ’m trying to take that one down .
I also think it comes out of me not getting …
Sometimes I use “ fuck ” because I ’m not getting the point across .
I think that ’s a bad reason to use any word , because the real words are n’t getting you there .
I guess what I ’d rather do is take “ fuck ” down to almost nonexistent , and replace it with , where I would have used three “ fucks , ” I ’d like to use two “ cunts . ” [ Laughs . ]
Advertisement
AVC : There ’s a calculus to it .
LCK : Totally , totally .
Because if you take “ fuck ” out , and you lose that frequency , “ cunt ” falls hard and fast , and “ cunt ” has much more bite to it .
It ’s like not using too much cilantro so the jalapeño will have more bite , something like that .

AVC : In Hilarious , there are times where it seems like you ’re surprising yourself .
LCK : Those moments do happen .
Hilarious came at the end of a long year of refining that material , so the surprise that you ’re seeing is pretty fabricated , but at the moment that originally happened , I was surprised .
When I created most of that material — that really actually comes from having done this thing of doing a different show every year , that I do n’t really know what I ’m going to say , because I do n’t have a full hour of material , and I ’m in front of an audience that ’s expecting one .
So I tend to reach and try stuff and let myself go in weird directions .
So sometimes I end up saying stuff that I go “ Wow , Jesus .
Why the fuck did I say that ? ”
Then , a year later , I ’ll do the exact same moment and the same feeling .
Because the audience is a new player — the audience in front of me is new , it actually does feel new .
So there was definitely a couple of moments like that in Hilarious .
I think there were one or two moments that were genuinely new .
I do n’t remember what they were .
But I was still screwing around on that show .

AVC : Why do Hilarious as a film ?
LCK : I really wanted to try this thing of concert film , to be seen in the theater .
I think it ’s totally different .
I think it ’s just in how you approach it .
You can shoot something that feels like that .
I approached it as a director and had a very specific design of how I shot it , so it would feel like a live performance to people in the live theater .
[ Laughs . ]
I just think it ’s a totally different world than watching a DVD and eating a tub of ice cream , basically .

AVC : I ca n’t remember what the last comedy stand - up film was .
LCK : Well , the last one that was a big success was [ The Original ] Kings Of Comedy .
I saw that in the theater , and I loved being in the theater , watching it .
I loved being in an audience watching these guys in front of an audience .
It was a really unique experience .
It used to be the way you could see a comedian was that way .
Most people could n’t afford to see comedians in concert .
It was a lot of fucking money ; it still is .
When Bill Cosby and Pryor and these guys made stand - up films , you could all the sudden go for five bucks and see Richard Pryor Live In Concert .
There was n’t an HBO thing then , you know ?
That was it .
You could listen to Richard Pryor ’s records , if you were rich and lucky , you could see him in concert , or you could go to his movie .
The making of those movies was designed for film , for a theatrical audience .
Then it went to HBO , and it became George Carlin and the specials , and everybody else was doing specials .
But even Eddie Murphy made Delirious , which was an HBO special , and then Raw as a theatrical film after that .
They ’re very different , because they have different approaches .
Anyway , there has n’t been one that worked in a very long time .
To me , it was worth trying , because I figured , at the worst , if we get into a festival , and we get a little bit of press on it being theatrical , then maybe it goes to the Angelika in New York and that ’s it , it ’s still going to be a more interesting birth of the special than just having it start showing on Comedy Central after Weekend At Bernie ’s , to no fanfare .
So far , it ’s worked out well .

AVC : It was apparently the first stand - up film to make it into Sundance .
LCK : Yeah , and then when I saw it at Sundance , I realized “ Shit , this really does work . ”
A lot of people that wrote about it said “ It ’s interesting , the feeling of seeing it live ” ; it made me think “ Now I really want people to see it theatrically .
I really hope it gets distributed . ”
But I have no idea if we will .
If we do n’t , then we do n’t .
We ’ll see .

AVC : The Dana Carvey Show just came out on DVD .

LCK : No .
I ca n’t really watch that show .
It represents too much pain in my life .
It was a very difficult thing to go through .
It was a struggle .
I ’m very proud of the work we did there , but that was a hard show to work on .
It was just taxing in my life .
It was just difficult .

No , no .

LCK : There ’s just some stuff you just do n’t look back at .
You just let that — I do n’t care .
I ’m glad people like it , but we were fighting our network every week , and that was a very painful place to be .
In the late afternoon on June 27 , 1844 , a mob craving its own frontier form of justice crept across an Illinois pasture and surrounded the jail at Carthage .
The militia that had been mustered to keep the peace mounted no resistance .
A small pack of the attackers stormed up the stairs and swiftly fired shots into the second - floor cell that housed the Mormon prophet , Joseph Smith , his brother Hyrum , and his friends John Taylor and Willard Richards .
The melee ended as quickly as it had begun .
A dispatch from Willard Richards to the anxious citizens in nearby Nauvoo reported the grim news : " Joseph and Hyrum are dead .
Taylor wounded , not very badly .
I am well .
Our guard was forced , as we believe , by a band of . . . 100 to 200 .
The job was done in an instant . "
For fourteen years Joseph Smith Jr. had led a religion born on America soil .
Though he had built his church on the western frontiers New York , Ohio , Missouri , and finally Illinois this American prophet was a phenomenon that attracted national attention .
His was more than a religious movement .
It was , as described in 1842 by the editor of the New York Herald , " a spiritual system , combined also with morals and industry , that may change the destiny of the race . "
Joseph explained his sense of mission in 1844 : " I intend to lay a foundation that will revolutionize the whole world . "
That change embraced what he considered was a calling from God to restore the true church , translate records from ancient plates and publish them as new scripture called the Book of Mormon , organize a lay priesthood , build holy temples , and establish " the kingdom of God on earth . "
Thousands from the New England states , Canada , the East Coast , and the British Isles flocked to the message of Jesus Christ , a restoration of His gospel , and the coming Millennium .
Such an orientation challenged religious pluralism and demonstrated people 's dissatisfaction with an increasingly sectarian society .
The Mormons took refuge in building a sacred Zion .
Their efforts sparked controversy time and again until the fateful days of late June 1844 , when the Prophet Joseph was charged with treason and ordered by Illinois Governor Thomas Ford to turn himself in at Carthage , the Hancock County seat .
That community , twenty - five miles southeast of the Mormons ' city of Nauvoo , had been agitated for days .
Bands of vigilante townsmen and farmers from surrounding areas had been pressing for the arrest of their archenemy , Joseph Smith .
When he arrived , the Carthage Greys the local militiaunruly and decidedly anti-Mormon , were commissioned to keep the peace .
In the days that followed , Joseph was paraded before the troops , brought before a judge , and then locked in Carthage Jail .
Eight of his friends elected to stay with him .
On June 27 , a guard at the jail boasted to one of Joseph 's companions of the imminent end of the prized prisoner : " We have had too much trouble to bring Old Joe here to let him ever escape alive , and unless you want to die with him you had better leave before sundown . . . and you 'll see that I can prophesy better than Old Joe . "
That afternoon a mob of men stormed the jail .
In a flash they were up the stairs and firing through the door into the room where the prisoners were held .
Hyrum Smith fell first , struck in the face .
Joseph got off three rounds at the assailants ; his gun misfired the other three barrels .
A bevy of shots poured into the room from another party of aggressors positioned on the ground outside .
John Taylor received several bullets , including one from outside that hit the watch in his vest pocket , stopping it at 5:16 P.M. Willard Richards was grazed but essentially unharmed .
Joseph was struck from behind as he ran for the window .
He fell to the ground outside , having been hit four times , twice in the back .
The fatal incident lasted less than three minutes .
Joseph 's younger brother Samuel , fearing for the safety of his older siblings , had saddled his horse and headed for Carthage that afternoon .
He arrived to find his brothers dead and the town deserted .
Fearing a reprisal from the Mormons , Joseph 's foes had fled to the country , as had many of the townspeople .
From house to house the cry spread , " The Mormons are coming . "
County officials packed up the county records and moved them to Quincy for safekeeping .
Governor Ford , returning from having delivered a strong rebuke to the Mormons in Nauvoo , made a hasty exit too .
The roads heading south and southeast the opposite direction from the Mormon stronghold were crowded with both those who had joined in the assault and those who had waited and watched .
Willard Richards 's missive to the Mormons had warned , " The citizens here are afraid of the Mormons attacking them .
I promise them no ! "
The response from the Nauvoo faithful was stunned silence .
While they doubled the watch and fortified their guard stations , Joseph 's followers wrestled with a grief they had never known .
Lucy Meserve Bean Smith reflected on the mood that horrific night : " On the evening of the 27th of June such a barking and howling of dogs and bellowing of cattle all over the city of Nauvoo I never heard before nor since .
. . .
I knelt down and tried to pray for the Prophet , but I was struck speechless , and knew not the cause till next morning .
Of course the awful deed was already accomplished , when the spirit refused to give me utterance to the prayer the evening before . "
The Smiths ' cortege left Carthage early the next morning , Friday , June 28 .
Each wagon carried a grim cargo in a lidless pine box ; prairie brush and branches masked the corpses from the summer sun .
Richards , flanked by a handful of militia , escorted the wagons home .
The procession reached Nauvoo about 3:00 p.m .
A line of mourners had begun to form about two o'clock that afternoon .
Men , women , and children , still in shock from the news , waited quietly in the streets for the return of their leader .
William
Hyde observed , " My soul sickened and I wept before the Lord and for a time it seemed that the very Heavens were clad in mourning . "
Said Maria Wealthy Wilcox , " It can be well imagined , the sorrow and darkness that seemed to pervade the whole place . "

Fisher described the melancholy , " Everything seamed to turn as black as ink . "
Aroet Hale , who later played the snare drums at the funeral , said of the sight , " To See Stout men and women Standing around in group [ s ]
Crying & morning for the Loss of their Dear Prophet and Patriarch was Enough to break the hart of a Stone . "
" The love the saints had for him was inexpressible , " said Mary Alice Cannon Lambert .
" Oh , the mourning in the land ! " she lamented .
" The grief felt was beyond expressionmen , women and children , we were all stunned by the blow . "
An estimated ten thousand farmers , laborers , housewives , children , businessmen , newcomers to Nauvoo , leaders of the church , members of the City Council , and officers and volunteers from the Nauvoo Legion thronged the streets .
Many of the new converts from Britain , Ireland , and Wales raised a melancholy moan , a keening that could be heard beyond the borders of what was later called the " City of Joseph . "
He had been their townsman , political leader , general , friend , and , in their eyes , an instrument in God 's hand to restore the gospel of Jesus Christ and His true church .
Jane James , a young black woman who had been employed at the Smith home , described her feelings of loss : " Yes , indeed .
I [ knew ] the Prophet Joseph .
That lovely hand !
He used to put it out to me .
Never passed me without shaking hands with me wherever he was .
Oh , he was the finest man I ever saw on earth .
. . .
When he was killed . . .
I could have died , just laid down and died . "
Poetess Eliza R. Snow expressed in verse the anguish of all the followers :
Had nature 's self a heart , her heart would bleed
At the recital of so foul a deed
For never , since the Son of God was slain
Has blood so noble flow'd from human vein
The grim procession advanced down Main to Water Street and on to the Mansion House where Joseph and his family had lived since August 1843 .
The people were told to return at eight o'clock in the morning to pay final respects .
Three men prepared the bodies for private grieving and public viewing .
They treated the wounds with camphor - soaked cotton and dressed the bodies in " fine plain drawers and shirt , white neckerchiefs , white cotton stockings and white shrouds . "
The family was then admitted to see the martyred men .
The dead prophet 's oldest son , Joseph III , age eleven , later described their sorrow : " My mother and we children were in the living room in the Mansion mother overwhelmed with her grief , and we children sympathizing as children will without fairly comprehending the importance of such an event .
. . .
After leaning over the coffin , [ mother ] placed her hand upon the cheek of my father , and in grief - stricken accents said , " Oh , Joseph !
Joseph !
Oh , my husband !
My husband !
Have they taken you from me at last ! "
" Yea I witnessed their tears , and groans , " wrote Vilate Kimball to her husband , Heber .
" Every brother and sister that witnessed the scene felt deeply to sympathize with them . "
The bodies were placed in coffins lined with white cambric .
The rough slats were covered with black velvet fastened with brass nails , and a glass lid was set over each face .
For nine hours the next day , people filed through the dining room of the home where Joseph had hosted church officers , visitors to Nauvoo , and his family and friends .
Close to ten thousand mourners paid their respects that day .
The coffins were buried in a public ceremony conducted by church leaders .
The boxes that were interred , however , were filled with bags of sand and rocks .
Joseph and Hyrum 's remains were entombed in the middle of the night in the cellar of the Nauvoo House , a hotel then under construction across the street from Joseph 's home .
Such a deception was prompted by fears that the graves would be robbed because there was a price on Joseph 's head .
News of the death of Joseph Smith raced through the country .
His close associates , including most of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , were away on missions and other assignments .
Parley P. Pratt , serving in New York , was on a canal boat with his brother William when he felt a powerful , sinister presence .
He later learned " it was the same hour that the Carthage mob were shedding the blood of Joseph and Hyrum Smith , and John Taylor , near one thousand miles distant . "
Heber C. Kimball , who was in Baltimore pursuing an effort to place Joseph Smith 's name in nomination for president of the United States , recorded : " The papers ware full of News of the death of our Prophet .
I was not willen to believe it , fore it was to much to bare .
The first news I got of his death was on Tuesday morning . . . it struc me at the heart . "
" It has been a time of mourning , " said Brigham Young , president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and now senior officer of the church , who rushed home from the East when he heard of the slaying .
" The day that Joseph and Hyrum were brought in from Carthage to Nauvoo it was Judged by menny boath in and out of the church that there was more then five barels of tears shed .
I can not bare to think enny thing about it . "
Not everyone was saddened by Joseph 's death , however .
Those who opposed him believed that the Mormons had been held captive by the Prophet 's diabolical powers , and if he were gone , the Mormon effort would collapse .
The New York Herald , for example , predicted : " The death of the modern mahomet will seal the fate of Mormonism .
They can not get another Joe Smith .
The holy city must tumble into ruins , and the ' latter - day saints ' have indeed come to the latter day . "
Rival clergymen were quick to commend the mob action .
An exultant Alexander Campbell , whose congregations had been " raided " by Mormon missionaries and who had been vilifying Joseph since his New York days , boldly announced in his Millennial Harbinger that the murder was an act of God :
" The money digger , the juggler , and the founder of the Golden Bible delusion , has been hurried away in the midst of his madness to his final account .
' He died not as a righteous man dieth . '
The hand of the Lord was heavy upon him .
An outlaw himself , God cut him off by outlaws .
. . .
It was the outrages of the Mormons that brought upon the head of their leader the arm of justice .
. . .
Religion or religious opinions had nothing to do with it .
It was neither more nor less than the assassination of one whose career was in open rebellion against God and man . "
Reverend William G. Brownlow of the Jonesborough
Whig scorned the lamentations being printed by some papers : " Some of the public Journals of the country , we are sorry to see , regret the death of that blasphemous wretch Joe Smith , the Mormon Prophet .
Our deliberate judgement is , that he ought to have been dead ten years ago , and that those who at length have deprived him of his life , have done the cause of God , and of the country , good service . "
Reverend Brownlow did not hide his enthusiasm when he concluded , " Smith was killed , as he should have been .
THREE CHEERS to the brave company who shot him to pieces ! "
Other accounts were more tempered .
The Iowa Bloomington Herald said , " Assassins may plunge the dagger to the heart of the innocent and unsuspecting savages may torture , kill and slay , but their crimes are virtues in comparison with the heart of the reputed civilized man who in cold blood murders the victim who has voluntarily placed himself in the hands of his enemy , to be tried and dealt with according to law . "
The Missouri Republican , speaking from the state that had brutally expelled the Mormons only a few years before , now sounded a more penitent tone , referring to the killing of the Smiths as " perfidious , blackhearted , cowardly murder so wanton as to be without any justification so inhuman and treacherous as to find no parallel in savage life under any circumstances . "
A few newspapers boldly spoke with admiration for this American prophet .
The New York Sun suggested , " It is no small thing , in the blaze of this nineteenth century , to give to men a new revelation , found a new religion , establish new forms of worship , to build a city , with new laws , institutions , and orders of architecture , to establish ecclesiastic , civil and military jurisdiction , found colleges , send out missionaries , and make proselytes in two hemispheres : yet all this has been done by Joe Smith , and that against every sort of opposition , ridicule and persecution . "
About two weeks after the Carthage incident , the New York Weekly Herald reported , " Thus died the plowboy Prophet of America at the hands of an assassin , the object of intense , local persecution within Hancock County , where feeling ran high in the communities of Carthage and Warsaw against Nauvoo , its balance of power and the Prophet .
Yet , out beyond the vineyards of Hancock County , beyond that beautiful bend in the Mississippi , he was a respected and an admired Prophet and statesman . "
From around the country came messages of support for those with friends and family in Nauvoo .
" What earthly power has ever yet stood before the overpowering energies of a religious creed ? " queried a highly respected gentleman from Fair Haven , Connecticut , of his friend in Nauvoo .
" Indeed , we do not know which has the worst effect on the community , the doctrines of Smith or the ten thousand false rumors constantly put in circulation against him .
One thing is certain , his name will survive when those who grossly misrepresent him have become blanks on the page of the future . "
Governor Ford later noted in his History of Illinois , " Upon the principle that ' the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church ' , there was now really more cause than ever to predict its success .
The murder of the Smiths , instead of putting an end to the delusion of the Mormons and dispersing them , as many believed it would , only bound them together closer than ever , gave them new confidence in their faith and an increased fanaticism . "
Weeks before his death , the Prophet Joseph was visited by Josiah Quincy , soon to become mayor of Boston , Massachusetts .
Years later , in his book Figures of the Past , Quincy judged Joseph Smith to be a force of surprising significance :
" It is by no means improbable that some future textbook , for the use of generations yet unborn , will contain a question something like this :
What historical American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his countrymen ?
And it is by no means impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written : Joseph Smith , the Mormon Prophet .
And the reply , absurd as it doubtless seems to most men now living , may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants . "
I first turned to the pickup artists after losing in love .
Or , to be precise , winning — and then losing .
Rachel and I had followed each other silently around our university ’s campus in the way that only a university campus allows .
We had “ fortuitous ” meetings in the café ( where we each knew the other would be ) ; tried to overhear conversations in the stairwells ( where we formed ridiculously false portraits of each other ) ; and , closest of all to real contact , sat next to each other once in the library ( where we got no work done ) .
This went on for the better part of a year , during which she kept the top position in my imagination ’s rankings , the position we reserve for the woman we are going to marry , but who just does n’t know it yet .
And then one day we met .
One of my friends knew one of her friends ; they came over to talk ; we were introduced .
I was the older , wiser graduate student , she the impressed undergraduate — but not too impressed , because she was from New York City — and she later admitted that when she asked me out the next week she was nearly certain I would turn her down uncomfortably .
We met for drinks at the bar where no one goes , walked back to my house , started drinking again , and eventually made it out to my back porch .
The kiss was the giveaway .
Rachel was frantic — not sexually , but passionately — and I was so cocky that I calmed her , like a skittish horse : “ easy … easy . ”
And so , from that moment , I was dissatisfied : her ass did n’t look right in her jeans , her breasts were too soft , her underwear was bizarre .
I told my friends the following day it was a good thing she was leaving town for most of the summer , so I could get out guilt - free after a few weeks .
For those who had ears to hear , what I was saying was , essentially : “ Her ass did n’t look right in her jeans . ”
It did n’t take long for everything to change .
I came by foot to pick her up , walking down a street whose trees were finally becoming lush in the heat of May , and then up to a garden just as green .
And there she was , in a white dress , only a few strands of hair falling to her neck .
It was a moment of paralysis — like Werther ’s first vision of Lotte , handing out bread to her siblings , in her white dress — but it was all mine , just for me .
In that split second , I was lost .
It would be difficult to narrate the coming weeks , because they were a descent by small degrees from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows .
We began happy , or at least I did .
We spent an hour once cataloguing with astounding detail each of those times we had seen each other on campus .
We spent another hour lying on the floor of my unfurnished living room , listening to Sigur Rós , kissing each other ’s faces .
I was handsome , she was beautiful ; people told us we looked like each other .
But little by little I began to lose control .
I called her house too frequently , to the point of pestering her roommates .
When we were together I could n’t tear myself away : I would suggest picking up food and eating it at her house so that we did n’t have to be apart .
Eventually it became clear that she was indulging me to avoid confrontation before she left for the summer .
Not yet entirely out of my mind , I had a sense for what was going on , but it took a while for me to start hating myself .
That began , properly , on the night we said goodbye .
As she lay on her bed , already sleepy , I stood by the door , and she uttered what were assuredly the most poetic words I ever heard from her , before or since : “ Remember , as you walk home through the night , be bold . ”
She chuckled afterwards , aware of her own pretense , but the message had already been sent .
Several painful months later , she told me in a parked car — we were already having frank philosophical conversations about our past — that once upon a time she had seen me in the library , at the head of a group of my friends , and thought : “ That guy is a badass . ”
She thought that I was a man , just like her powerful father .
The implication of the statement was obvious : I once was a man , but I was n’t anymore .
To be honest , I ca n’t say I disagreed with her at the time .

The pickup craze began in 2005 , with the publication of Neil Strauss ’s The Game : Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists .
The book remained high up on the New York Times Bestseller List for over a month , sold hundreds of thousands of copies , and spawned not only a follow - up by Strauss himself , but also countless imitations in print as well as a cable television show .
Despite being packaged like a bible — leather - bound , gold leaf pages , and a tassel for a bookmark — and despite its chapter headings —
“ Select a Target , ” “ Approach and Open , ” “ Demonstrate Value , ” “ Disarm the Obstacles , ” and so on — The Game is less a how - to book ( say , a pickup “ bible ” ) and more a narrative of the author ’s time spent in the ( then - underground ) “ pickup community . ”
And what a narrative it is : within the space of two years , Strauss was transformed from a short , skinny , balding , let ’s - just - be - friends type into one of the greatest pickup artists in the world .
At the height of his “ gaming ” activity he had eight steady sexual partners — who all knew about each other — and was maneuvering himself into threesomes on a regular basis .
The Game is the Great American Success Story for the testosterone - driven , club - going male ; it is easy to understand its popularity .
But the book has an unsettling and enchanting effect on the more old - fashioned among us as well , and in this the theme of manliness is front and center .
Strauss ’s primary contact in the world of the pickup artists , the man who indeed becomes his friend over the course of the narrative , is “ Mystery ” — the pseudonym of one Erik von Markovik , then already among the acknowledged leaders of the seduction community .
And although Mystery is clearly indebted to the legends of seduction who preceded him — most prominent among them Ross Jeffries , the guru who applied the techniques of neurolinguistic programming to the hypnosis of women — his own method forms the basis of nearly every interaction in the book .
Mystery is responsible for many innovations , to be sure , but the key to the method is , unquestionably , that the pickup artist ignore , tease , or even insult the targeted female , accustomed as she is to constant , beleaguering attention from men .
That is , the message of the pickup artists is at its core an age - old one : women love men who are mean to them — or at least a little mean to them .
If you believe that women want to be flattered , wooed and obeyed , we are told , guess again .
Women want limits to be set , they want to be played with , they want manliness — and it is best to establish the dynamic right from the start .
As Mystery puts it : “ I do n’t alienate ugly girls ; I do n’t alienate guys .
I only alienate the girls I want to fuck . ”
And when the age - old message is tied to a comprehensive system that brings superior results —
Mystery shows his students a portfolio of the models , actresses and strippers he has seduced — that message becomes difficult to resist .
The good - hearted reader struggles as he feels his cherished notions slipping away : “ If this is what women really want , then why should n’t I ? … ”
Or : “ Should n’t I get on board , while I am still young ?
Should n’t everyone experience this kind of life once ? ”
Or , most painful of all : “ If only I had done some of this when I met so - and - so … ”

So how does it work ?
It begins in a bar .
PUAs ( pickup artists ; this will be the first in a long line of acronyms and other assorted jargon ) do often ply their trade during the day , sometimes even on the street — this is called “ day game ” and has its own nuances — but the classic location for seduction is the trendy club or bar .
For the most part the pickup artist “ sarges ” alone ( i.e. , operates alone — the term comes from the name of one of the cats of an early pickup artist ) , but a “ wingman ” or “ wing ” can play a role as well ( among other things , he makes the pickup artist who is “ running the set ” look good ) .
After a target is chosen , she must be approached within three seconds — this is the “ three - second rule , ” one of Mystery ’s inventions .
The thought behind it is twofold : first , if a man looks for too long at a woman , she might begin to think he is creepy , or , possibly worse , a coward ; and second , if a man looks for too long at a woman , he might indeed become a coward , he might lose his nerve .
When it is time for an approach , the approach always comes from an angle , from ten o’clock ; this is less intimidating , but also conveys sufficient confidence .
The pickup artist always smiles .
The first words spoken to the group ( and it will usually be a group , because “ women of beauty are rarely found alone ” ) are an opener , which is delivered along with a false time constraint .
The time constraint — ” my friends are waiting for me so I have to go in a few minutes , but … ” — serves to eliminate anxieties that the pickup artist will never leave ; anyone who has been approached in a bar , male or female , knows this feeling .
The PUA opener — what follows the “ but ” in the time constraint — is unlike the come - on lines we have always heard : “ Come here often ? ” ; “ What ’s your sign ? ” ; “ I must be in heaven , because you are an angel . ”
The PUA opener seeks instead to start a conversation , nothing more , nothing less .
Typically , it asks for an opinion , which both makes the intrusion plausible and , even better , allows women to offer their advice ( because who does n’t love giving advice ? ) .
One opener that has been “ field - tested , ” the “ jealous girlfriend ” opener , asks the group what a friend ( imaginary , of course ) should do in the following situation : his new girlfriend has become more and more opposed to his continuing contact with his ex-girlfriend from college .
Now , of course it makes sense that the current girlfriend should have pride of place .
But the ex-girlfriend is just a friend at this point — and anyhow , they are still such important figures in each other ’s lives !
Is that really fair ?
In the meantime , of course , the pickup artist needs to watch his body language — or train himself into the proper body language beforehand .
PUAs are quite fond of watching movies with famously “ alpha ” protagonists — James Dean , Tom Cruise , Brad Pitt — and routinely copy their stances and gestures , practicing in front of a mirror .
They seem to know everything that one could possibly desire to know : where to put their hands , where to put their feet , what to do with their weight .
They know how to manipulate a woman out of her barstool so they can slide into the seated position ( the position of power ) .
They know how to rock backwards slightly when delivering openers — again , so that their interlocutors fear they might leave at any moment .
Soon it is time for a “ neg . ”
Here is the insulting , the teasing — the alienation , as Mystery put it .
When the opportunity arises , the pickup artist finally acknowledges his target , whom he has either been ignoring or only addressing as part of her group .
But it is hardly an acknowledgment : it is a mild insult , or a backhanded compliment , and always delivered in as casual a way as possible so that the intention to insult can never be detected .
At the target ’s first attempt to join the conversation : “ Whoa , your friend is pushy guys , is she always like that ? ”
Or after she smiles : “ Your nose is so cute ; I love the way it wrinkles up . ”
The thought is that depriving a woman of attention and validation will lead her to seek it from you ;
Strauss puts it best when he says that to neg a woman is to treat her like a bratty little sister .
But the victory of the pickup artist can only be guaranteed by demonstrating value .
In the abstract , this involves establishing that the pickup artist is different from other men , intriguing in some way , superior .
Most of the time , however , because of the historical accident of the culture ’s foremost practitioner having been interested in magic as a child , this is achieved via a number of pseudo - mystical “ routines ” : ESP , handwriting analysis , various personality tests .
( In Mystery ’s own case , there are actual magic tricks involved , but he knows better than to introduce them as “ magic tricks . ” )
In one routine , “ the cube , ” the target is asked to picture a cube in the desert .
Then she is asked :
How big is it ?
What is it made of ?
What color is it ?
Then she pictures a ladder , a horse , flowers , a storm .
Sure enough , the cube represents her ego , the ladder her friends , the horse her lover ( or her own sexuality ) , the flowers children , the storm her problems .
Is the ladder leaning on the cube ?
Her friends depend on her .
Is the horse bigger than the cube ?
She wants her lover to dominate her .
And so on .
That the details of the routine are purely arbitrary is not lost on the pickup artists — there exist bountiful variations , in which the terms are shifted around according to whim , the flowers representing one thing , the ladder another .
The idea is just to get the target talking about herself , and in a style that comes naturally ; after all this is “ chick crack , ” catnip to women , who according to the pickup artists love any and all psychological speculation , particularly when tinged with the supernatural .
And the pickup artist displays his value by engaging the opposition precisely in that territory , the realm of fog and intuition ; but he does n’t just engage her in this realm , he dominates it , beating her at her own game .
That is value .
The playbook has many , many pages left at this point : the target must be isolated ; a connection must be made ( something traditionalists try to do first but the pickup artist knows to do later ) ; and comfort must be built to allow for an eventual transition to the “ sex location . ”
( And on all of these subjects , and indeed on those above as well , there are thousands and thousands of posts on various internet forums . )
But there is one more wanton and controversial play in the book that deserves mention : the neutralization of LMR — last - minute resistance .
When the time comes , returning to the pickup artist ’s house should be easy , since the target is familiar with the place from dropping by earlier in the night ( the pickup artist needed to stop off quickly for something he forgot ) .
Once she is in the front door , he accomplishes her transfer from living room to bedroom through an excuse like “ I want to show you a video — but the television is in my room . ”
At this point in the seduction both parties know what is going on , but excuses do need to be made .
In the bedroom ( where there are no chairs ) , the pickup artist sits on the bed with the target , but nowhere near her ( how confusing ) .
When the time comes for physical escalation , he makes sure to always take two steps forward and one back .
But at some point he could hit a wall — this is LMR .
A woman , the pickup artists tell us , desires sex just as much as a man does ; but because sex represents more of an investment for her , and because she has been culturally “ programmed ” to avoid the label “ slut , ” she will resist right up until the end .
At the first sign of obstruction of this kind , the pickup artist can “ blast ” it with a “ freeze - out . ”
The pants go on , the light goes on , the candles go out .
The pickup artist is sorry , but when a woman tells him to stop , it kills the mood for him ; he knows very well that no means no .
Teased by something just out of her reach , the girl will eventually relent .
If necessary , the pickup artist will again let his words take care of political correctness while his body takes care of what it wants : he will agree with her — ” I know , this is so wrong , we should n’t be doing this ” — all the while removing her clothes and encouraging her body along the path of its desire .
In this as in all things the pickup artists are closers ; they close the deal .
They number - close , they k - close , they f-close .
Number closing is getting a number from a girl ; k - closing is short for kiss - closing ; and f-closing , officially , is short for full - closing .
But the “ f ” stands for that other word as well .

The pickup juggernaut has been rolling on vigorously since the publication of The Game .
Mystery finally came out with his VH1 television show , The Pickup Artist , and published his own book , The Mystery Method : success that would seem deserved , considering what he has done for the industry .
The story of Erik von Markovik ’s metamorphosis into Mystery is astounding .
For seven years ( sometimes it is ten ) , he went to bars and clubs and slowly honed his method into what it is today .
Every part of the method received fine tuning as necessary : if women were losing interest , say , because he waited too long to move from the final stage of the “ attraction phase ” to the opening stage of the “ comfort phase , ” he would shave off a few minutes or a few stories , then try again with the new settings for a couple of months .
For years he endured rejection after rejection , eventually enjoyed successes , then systematized his results and unleashed them on the world .
To this day , every pickup artist , master pickup artist and would - be pickup artist is sarging the clubs using his techniques , and boasting about it using his vocabulary .
Mystery has something in common with other men of genius in that he does not always seem aware of his true calling ; like Franz Liszt angling for the priesthood , he has always insisted that he is a magician , and has always had a David Copperfield - like fame as his ultimate career goal .
But make no mistake about it , he is a marvel of charisma and a demon of charm .
A popular YouTube clip shows Mystery in a series of “ sets ” in various bars and clubs .
In one , he interrupts a woman with a long , drawn - out “ aaaaaand … back to me , ” then fills the shocked silence with a story of his own .
The three women in the group are indeed stunned , but smiling , and far from objecting ; they are in the presence of some kind of greatness , even if it is not clear exactly what kind .
Mystery ’s pseudo - intellectual rants can irk , to be sure , but his antics make up for it .
When Neil Strauss is invited by two women to their hotel room in the early stages of The Game , he goes to Mystery for advice .
Go over to the hotel , he tells him , and as soon as you arrive run a bath , then take off your clothes and get in .
The crowning detail ?
Mystery prefaces this advice with : “ Just do what I always do . ”
Mystery handed over the reins of his website to his partner Nick Savoy ( a.k.a. Savoy ) in 2007 ; mysterymethod.com now redirects to lovesystems.com , a slickly designed operation that advertises $ 1,500 “ workshops ” and $ 3,000 “ bootcamps ” on its front page .
The men at Love Systems have an ambivalent relationship to the outside world that is shared by much of the pickup community .
On the one hand , true to their theorizing , they are brash and unapologetic in the way they talk about women and sex ; on the other they recognize the need for some measure of restraint and a presentable public face .
In this latter regard Love Systems has certainly been trying : in addition to the boot - camp announcements , their front page features their various media appearances prominently , media appearances in which they generally behave themselves like gentlemen .
In April of 2008 Nick Savoy and Scott “ The Don ” made their case on Dr. Phil , and were well - received , largely .
Dr. Phil , for his part , supported their endeavors , comparing the approach techniques to a woman ’s toilette or her pushup bra .
( He did say “ full close ” once — but sadly the viewer cannot see the reaction from Savoy and The Don. )
Dr. Phil ’s producers devised an experiment , sending two women to a bar in which a handful of Love Systems trainees were operating .
The women , approached presumably along with others , were then brought on the show to give their feedback .
Valerie and Holli said a number of things — they liked hearing stories , they did n’t like that the men neglected to talk about themselves — but the highlight is clearly the demeanor of Savoy and The Don .
These are men who live and breathe the difference between what a woman says and what she really thinks .
And indeed , these men also live and breathe the difference between what they themselves say and think .
To see them in the audience , giving encouraging responses to the women , smiling at Dr. Phil ’s jokes , applauding as the camera pans through the crowd during the closing credits — these are delicious moments for one who is in the know .

When The Game was released in 2005 , the majority of the newspaper reviews dismissed it out of hand .
The reviewers were intrigued by the phenomenon , and in many cases even joined Strauss for a night on the town .
But their elbows did plenty of work , nudging the reader , who of course was on the same side of the joke as the reviewer : both reader and reviewer knew that these men were not worth taking seriously .
And even if they were taken seriously , they were kept far , far away from the reviewer ’s own world .
One very perceptive writer , who saw first hand the frighteningly easy success of the techniques , closed his review with an awkward joke .
Strauss assured him that if he met the journalist ’s girlfriend he’d be sure to tell her that he behaved like a good boy .
The journalist responded : “ You are never , ever meeting my girlfriend . ”
But are the pickup artists really all that far away from our world ?
Consider for example the PUA principle of “ abundance . ”
The pickup artist never gets hung up on a particular woman — this would be “ one - itis , ” which almost always leads to rejection ; women can smell the desperation and instinctively avoid a pained lover .
Instead , the pickup artist operates in abundance as a “ frame of mind , ” in an almost Zen - like state of simultaneous avowal and denial .
Women want men who do n’t need them ; this is as sure a sign as any that the men are worth something , higher up in the hierarchy than they are .
And so the pickup artist keeps as many leads and partners going as he can , in a sense never desiring any one of them , but in another sense desiring them all .
But even among non-PUAs these principles apply : everyone knows that it is more difficult for a man to find a girlfriend when he is in a “ dry spell ” ; and , like it or not , women of all shapes and sizes find men more attractive when they know that other women find them attractive .
The pickup artist ’s practice is only a hyperbolic exploitation of these principles .
And even if this practice can still be criticized , precisely because it is hyperbole , there are many cases in which the pickup artists end up on top plain and simple : pursuing the same ends as the rest of us , just doing it better .
When two people have met each other and enjoyed each other ’s company , when should they call each other again ?
What should their emails and text messages say ?
Should they go to dinner ?
Try to run into each other ?
The pickup artist knows the answers to these questions , knows how to act in each of these situations in a way that is more elegant , more confident , and more advanced than the ways we act — in a way that is , simply put , more effective .
Strauss cautions as well against the assumption that the pickup artist ’s craft will only beguile the less intelligent .
If anything , he says , intelligence brings with it greater imagination , and therefore greater enjoyment of the pickup artist ’s talking points : thinking about psychology is more fun for those who are better at thinking about psychology .
( And if the “ routines ” the pickup artist “ runs ” still seem a bit silly , one could easily imagine a souped - up version of the Game , a Mystery Method for women with intellectual interests . )
And what about “ classiness , ” a good upbringing ?
When Strauss and Mystery travel to Belgrade to visit Strauss ’s childhood friend Marko — and to sarge some women , of course — they meet Marko ’s Serbian one - itis , Goca .
Marko wants to marry her , and is careful to do everything “ right ” : he buys her flowers , takes her on dates , holds open the car door for her .
But Strauss attracts her despite himself , and one night she slides into bed next to him .
Marko is “ sweet , but just a friend , ” she tells him , as she sucks his lip into her mouth .
Strauss does eventually extract his lip , and himself , from the situation , but the lesson remains ; it is a passage that will rankle every skeptical reader of The Game , because we have all had a Goca , and it turns out that she is a woman like any other .
Pop - science classics like Richard Dawkins ’
The Selfish Gene are standard reading for the pickup artists ; and all the evolutionary theory that serves their purposes makes its way into their discourse .
Women are women just as much as men are men ( or more so , if that is possible ) : they respond to cues unconsciously , whether they want to or not .
They respond with their hearts , their minds , and — as is frequently intimated , more or less darkly — with their genitals .
That one is the dagger .
If the pickup artists have often been dismissed for being tacky — for lack of a better word — the deeper critique has always been a moral one .
Accusations of rape have come from a few voices in the feminist front , but for the most part there is agreement that the business of the pickup artists is to some degree disrespectful and exploitative .
Even if much of the PUA language can be explained away by their boys - will - be - boys mentality , indulged with a smile as their hands are caught in the cookie jar , some of it seems to bring misogyny to new , absurd heights .
For example , in a section of his book entitled “ Punishment / Reward , ” Mystery explicitly compares conversation with a female human being to the training of a dog :
The solution dog trainers have formulated is this proven procedure :
After the correction for bad behavior , structure a challenge for the dog to do something correctly .
Right after you shake the jar [ of pennies , to punish the dog ] , say , “ Sit , ” and help the dog sit .
Then reward it with love and affection : “ Good girl ! ! ! ”
“ Yes , good boy ! ” … Humans are the same way . … [ W ] hen we correct a woman ’s misbehavior , we must then immediately structure an opportunity for her to jump through an easy hoop , thereby rewarding her for it .
The pickup artists , however , would and do defend their theory and its rhetoric — and possibly even a passage like this one — by emphasizing once again that profound gap between what women say they want and what they really want .
Talk is cheap , or at most an aphrodisiac ; at the end of the day , all that matters is who is sliding into your bed .
On another score , the pickup artists even come out ahead in the moral reckoning .
Up front as they are about their intentions ( seen but not heard , of course ) , they do not operate as so many non-PUAs do , lulling a woman , perhaps a social inferior , into the expectation of commitment — only to discard her after some suitable number of weeks with the usual breakup song and dance .
The pickup artists are playing a game , the game that lends Strauss ’s book its title , and according to them women are playing it also .
They are all partners in the same enterprise .
If the pickup artists are getting all of the sex , it ’s simply because they are better at playing : they have trained at home and practiced in the field , and now are reaping the rewards .
True , occasionally the game claims a victim , normally a player who , alas , did n’t know she was in a game and fell in love accidentally .
But this is a lesser evil than that other , systematic deception , and so the pickup artists can say with a ( relatively ) clean conscience : all is fair in love and war .
But even if one accepts all of the PUA rebuttals , even if one is allured again and again by the very real possibility of all the perfume , slender waists and blowjobs one can shake a stick at — even then there is the creeping feeling that something is n’t quite right here , that something must be wrong , that something is missing .
And what is missing is : love .
Despite the PUA coarseness in this matter — their recasting of love as mere one - itis — love has a chance in this battle because it can appeal to the pickup artists ’ own interests .
Arguments that turn on fairness or altruism just are n’t going to cut it here , and so , taking a page from Plato ’s Republic , we are better off looking into the souls of the pickup artists themselves .
Indeed , the best commentators on the phenomenon — Wesley Yang in n+1 , for example — have always pointed in this direction , as has every internet spectator who has ever complained vaguely of “ shallowness . ”
And to be fair , Strauss himself levels this same accusation in The Game : by the end of his book he has performed an about - face so complete that we might accuse him of stacking the deck by playing up the debauchery of the book ’s earlier pages .
He falls in love with Lisa , a bandmate of his new friend Courtney Love , and the experience poisons him against his former pastime .
While Mystery descends into a world of insanity , infidelity and bickering , “ broken on the inside ” as all pickup artists have come to seem , Strauss recognizes that “ to win the game is to leave it ” and proceeds to do just that , embracing his new monogamy .
And , by the way : Marko eventually gets his Goca .
But what does this celebrated romantic bliss really look like ?
It is , sadly , a little disappointing .
In Strauss ’s hands , love becomes merely the opposite of whatever the pickup artists are doing : so , for example , he spends every day with Lisa instead of making her wait to hear from him , as a true pickup artist would in his LTR ( long - term relationship ) management .
In fact , despite the admittedly genuine affinity between the two of them , Lisa ’s primary value for Strauss seems to lie in her impermeability to the wiles of pickup technique .
But , details aside , it really does n’t matter what amount of abandon Strauss can muster to tell his love story ; that story will always look tepid beside the novelty , incisiveness and sleekness of the pickup - artist narrative .
It ’s just too overwhelming .
Other responses to the pickup artists on behalf of love are not much help either , amounting at most to an unreflective gesture of pity for the pickup artists ’ wasted lives .
The trouble with all of this is that the failure to provide a thorough defense of “ our ” values — not just an explication of them , but a rhetorically effective affirmation of them — leaves the way clear for the pickup artists to triumph .
We need to make sure that love can stand a chance against the bounty promised by PUA technology ; that love can genuinely quell our anxieties about manliness .

It may be true that the world has changed — our pickup artist literature and our reality dating shows announce a brave new one , at least when it comes to interaction between the sexes ( or within them , for that matter ) .
But one element of the old world , the ideal of romantic love , survives in quite a few forms in our popular , bourgeois culture .
Not least among these is of course the Hollywood film ; the experience of a heart warmed despite itself in a darkened theater is as good a reminder as any that love still has a place in our twenty - first - century jumble of values .
But love in Hollywood , even if it exceeds in scope and exuberance the reflections on love by Neil Strauss and the pickup - bloggers , is nevertheless only a remnant , a leftover from a discourse even more exuberant .
To meditate on popular film and other contemporary manifestations of the love - ideal , even if informative in its own right , would be to miss an opportunity to cut out the middleman and return to the source .
The best expressions of love , it turns out , came to pass long before our time .
The Western obsession with passionate love is generally acknowledged to have its roots in the phenomenon of “ courtly love , ” that rare and highly mannered practice of twelfth - century French nobility .
Known to us today through the poetry of the troubadours and explored in the complex Roman de la Rose , the typical case involved the chaste pursuit of an unattainable woman of the court by a knight or lesser nobleman — a spiritualized endeavor that had little or nothing to do with sex .
A second , modern , bloom begins with the great pre-Romantic theorist of love , Jean - Jacques Rousseau , who maintains this tradition of spiritualization and indeed intensifies it , attempting to bind romantic love to marriage , and — perhaps thereby — putting love on a pedestal higher than any it had ever before occupied .
His epistolary novel Julie , ou la Nouvelle Héloïse , though largely forgotten today , was one of the most - read books of the entire eighteenth century ; it exercised a commanding influence not only over Rousseau ’s properly Romantic successors but also over any number of the great novelists of the nineteenth century : Austen , Flaubert , Tolstoy , and so on .
But among all these descendants of Rousseau , the one best suited to our purposes is undoubtedly the Frenchman Marie - Henri Beyle — an author better known by his pseudonym : Stendhal .
Though his reputation today rests on his novels The Red and the Black and The Charterhouse of Parma , Stendhal was also a prolific writer of essays , novellas , biographies ( of Mozart and Rossini , among others ) , travel literature , literary criticism ( including the influential Racine et Shakespeare ) , and , perhaps most important next to his novels , autobiography .
He is often noted for his early introduction of realism in the development of the novel , or his general psychological acuteness in the depiction of his characters , both of which accomplishments are indeed impressive — but just as impressive or more is what he has to say about love .
To an attempted debunker of love , Stendhal is a terror .
Secure in his conviction that passionate love is the only worthwhile activity for man , he is nevertheless deeply versed in the theories and convictions of the other side ; it would seem , then , that he has chosen his allegiances for good reason .
He is one of love ’s great theorists , and one of its most vivid painters .
As a sample , consider the romance of Fabrizio del Dongo and Clélia Conti in The Charterhouse of Parma , Stendhal ’s hymn to his beloved Italy , published in 1839 , just three years before his death .
Fabrizio , a young Lombard aristocrat , is the book ’s ambiguously heroic hero .
As the story opens , he leaves his family to join Napoleon in the republican cause ; he bumbles his way through Waterloo , wandering among the fields , buying horses and having them stolen , and eventually convalescing in an inn , partly from wounds suffered in a fight with fellow soldiers .
This is hardly an auspicious beginning for a romantic lead , and it is never quite clear ( and not in a particularly interesting way ) whether Stendhal is parodying Fabrizio or not — this just one of the many infelicities the novel is so often criticized for , criticism made easier by the knowledge that it was written — dictated — by an infirm Stendhal in less than two months .
But Fabrizio does redeem himself , and in a deeply Stendhalian way .
Thrown in prison for an alleged murder that was in fact a very brave act of self - defense , he manages to land squarely in his life ’s fundamental adventure : he falls in love .
As he is being carried off to his cell , Fabrizio catches sight of Clélia Conti , who it turns out is the daughter of General Fabio Conti , the Minister of Police in Parma and therefore the Governor of the prison .
Clélia ’s face is a familiar one , however ; seven years before , when Fabrizio was 16 and Clélia was just 12 , the two met on the road from Lake Como to Milan .
In a police mix - up , Clélia and her father had been pursued from the lake ; since they now needed to go with the police to Milan , but were on foot , Fabrizio ’s family offered to take Clélia in their carriage , saving her from an unpleasantly dusty walk .
In a moment of confusion , while stepping on the footboard to climb into the carriage , Clélia accidentally fell into Fabrizio ’s arms .
Fabrizio thought to himself : “ What a fellow - prisoner she would make … She would know how to love . ”
Later , in the carriage , they blushed with every glance .
This history is still fresh in the minds of the two when they meet again at the prison ; when Fabrizio sees Clélia , he takes the opportunity to remind her of their common past , but she is stricken , unable to speak .
Soon enough we discover that she did n’t need to speak , because her eyes have done all the work for her — Fabrizio is climbing the stairs to his prison in the sky , not yet even in his cell , when he discovers that the look of authentic , impassioned pity from her face has erased all the despair he might have felt at being imprisoned .
He now cares only about seeing her again , and soon enough is given the opportunity .
In one of the more charming inventions to have come from Stendhal ’s spatial imagination ( his autobiographical writings are filled with hand - drawn maps of houses and streets ) , Fabrizio ’s cell is located in a tower that is itself placed on top of another tower : the tower - above - the - tower has its base 180 feet in the air .
Arriving in his new home , Fabrizio discovers that he can see very clearly all the way to the Alps , almost a hundred miles away .
But he can also see Clélia .
Just as fantastical as a tower sitting on the roof of a tower ( and just as fun ) , there is also a residence , sitting on the same tower : the General ’s palazzo , in which his daughter is visible for a brief period of every day , tending to her birds .
The two lovers begin an intricate visual courtship , with carefully rationed looks from Clélia and inventive attempts at communication from Fabrizio .
When wooden blinds are installed in the cell to block the prisoner ’s view of the Alps ( and to destroy his morale ) , Fabrizio first bores a hole through them , inserting a wire to give Clélia a sign of his presence ; then he cuts out an entire hand - sized chunk of the blind and pokes his face through .
Later he writes letters on his palm with a piece of charcoal .
Details are laid upon details — the inner lives of the two characters are artfully wrapped around their physical circumstances .
Clélia is convinced that Fabrizio is in love with his aunt , the duchess ; Fabrizio is ignorant of the various rumors of his impending execution , and cannot understand the resulting fluctuations in Clélia ’s mood ; they grasp at the meaning of each other ’s gestures , filling in the gaps with their own imaginations .
Through it all , Stendhal convinces us that this love is of the utmost seriousness for both of its participants .
When Fabrizio first removes the section of the blind that he has cut away and shows his face to Clélia , she trembles so much that she spills the water intended for her plants ; and Stendhal tells us , matter - of - factly : “ This moment was incomparably the finest in Fabrizio ’s life . ”
Fabrizio , until this point in the narrative the master of every heart he encountered , “ was all too aware that the eternal happiness of his life would oblige him to reckon with the Governor ’s daughter , and that it was within her power to make him the most wretched of men . ”
It is sentiments like these that Stendhal claimed to find in the hearts of real Italians , and it is sentiments like these that help redeem Fabrizio .
As Balzac puts it in a famous 1840 review , Stendhal , in order to uphold Fabrizio as his hero , “ was under an obligation … to endow him with a feeling which would make him superior to the men of genius who surround him . ”
Fabrizio does not need genius : “ Feeling , in short , is equivalent to talent . ”

The greatest statement of Stendhal ’s ideas on love is his much earlier work , the 1822 On Love .
Part fiction , part philosophy , part memoir , part collection of aphorisms , it is a book impossible to categorize .
To go along with the eccentricity of its structure , the status of its authorship is ludicrously difficult to figure out : Stendhal treats the book as his own work in his many prefaces , then disowns it in a footnote to the very first section , attributing it to the recently deceased Italian Lisio Visconti — who is later , inexplicably , referred to in the third person in the text itself .
At another point Stendhal uses the word “ I , ” then adds a footnote ( presumably in some later edition ) begging the reader to forgive the mistake .
But even if the book can seem a bit of a free - for - all , it is packed with gems .
For instance , in the chapter “ Concerning Glances ” : “ Glances are the big guns of the virtuous coquette ; everything can be conveyed in a look , and yet that look can always be denied , because it can not be quoted word for word . ”
Or the brilliant advice on curing love ( if it can be done at all , that is ) :
“ The healing friend must always be on hand to keep commenting as much as possible on the events which have taken place in the love affair , and to ensure that these reflections are long , wearisome , and pointless , so that they begin to sound like commonplace . ”
And the more radical option : “ The unkind woman may be accused of some embarrassing physical defect which it is impossible to verify ; if the calumny could be verified and found true it would very soon be disposed of by the imagination , and forgotten .
It is only imagination that can resist imagination … ”
Yet the book participates in Stendhal ’s mission all the same : it is a celebration of passionate love .
This is announced in the prefaces , where Stendhal warns that any reader who has never experienced the “ foolishness ” of love , or who is concerned only with money or scholarship , should throw the book away immediately .
And in Stendhal ’s famous quadripartite categorization of different kinds of love , passionate love comes out on top ; it is the original of which the other three are pale shadows : physical love , “ mannered love ” and “ vanity - love . ”
The essence of passionate love , what grants it the nobility that the others do not possess , is what Stendhal callscrystallization .
Just as the naked branch of a tree will gather diamond - like crystals if it is dropped into a salt mine , a lover will gather perfections about the crooked timber of his beloved .
Needless to say , the concept is familiar to us — consider Freud ’s “ overvaluation of the love object , ” or the general psychoanalytic category of “ idealization . ”
It is Stendhal , however , who spins it out into a rich texture of observation and insight , an achievement with few equals in the history of writing on love .
●
And Stendhal knows the pickup artist already , in 1822 .
Not our pickup artist , but a figure very similar to him .
There had always been pickup “ theory ” of some kind or other , such as Ovid ’s frank advice on meeting women at the theater , or Jean de Meun ’s completion of the Roman de la Rose — nothing approaching today ’s pickup artists in efficiency and attention to detail , but enough to form a tradition of sorts .
And in Stendhal ’s time as in our own , the seducer was an acknowledged character type : the nearest literary model for Stendhal was the Vicomte de Valmont , in Laclos ’ Liaisons dangereuses ; the nearest personal model Stendhal ’s own uncle , Romain Gagnon , a ladies ’ man who was something of a big fish in the small pond of Grenoble .
But Stendhal not only knows the pickup artist , he also keeps him close , even defining himself in relation to him .
In one of the first sections Stendhal wrote for On Love , the chapter “ Werther and Don Juan , ” he introduces Don Juan , remarkably , as follows : “ Allow me to sketch the portrait of my most intimate friend . ”
That portrait is given alongside Werther ’s , and Stendhal presents it in all fairness .
He admits that Don Juan possesses genuine virtues : fearlessness , resourcefulness , poise , wit — all of which allow him to avoid the many embarrassments his counterpart will inevitably endure .
His very real brilliance even prevents Stendhal from deciding in Werther ’s favor .
In fact , by the end of the chapter Stendhal declares a relativist - style toss - up : “ But after all , if he takes the trouble to examine his own mind , each man has his beau idéal , and it always seems to me a little absurd to try to convert one ’s neighbor . ”
That may be so , but there is no secret about how Stendhal feels , and whether he wants to or not ( he wants to ) , he delivers a well - nigh fatal blow .
Don Juan , it turns out , has spent his life in a special kind of ignorance .
The lover knows something of the experiences of Don Juan , but the opposite cannot be said :
From the point of view of the Don Juan passionate love may be compared to a strange road , steep and difficult , which at first , it is true , leads through delightful groves , but soon loses itself among jagged rocks not the least attractive to ordinary eyes .
Gradually the road climbs among high mountains and through a dark forest whose huge trees shut out the light with their thick towering foliage , bringing terror to the hearts of those unaccustomed to danger .
After many painful and humiliating wanderings as if through an endless , tortuous labyrinth , suddenly one turns a further corner and comes upon a new world , Lalla - Rookh ’s wonderful valley in Kashmir .
How can the Don Juans , who never set out along this road , or at most take only a few steps along it , how can they have any idea of the view at journey ’s end ?
The great mistake of the pickup artists , of Don Juans , of seducers in general , is to think that the lover is a failed version of themselves .
The lover , they say , tries to “ get the girl , ” but just does n’t know how — and if he learned their techniques he would .
The trouble is that there is no agreement on just what this “ getting ” is .
And , in fact , if the lover were to adopt the techniques of the pickup artists , his “ getting ” would become impossible .
For a woman ’s sexual surrender does not count as “ getting ” for the lover .
Nor , for that matter , does her love , if the lover does not love her also .
The lover ’s “ getting ” requires his own experience : his own adventure , his road through the mountains and forests .
And the reward in the valley is not sexual satisfaction ; it is a proof of love .
The greatest moment in Fabrizio del Dongo ’s life is not a conquest , sexual or military .
It is the sight of the woman he loves , shaking before his eyes .
For Stendhal , love ennobles because it makes all else beautiful ; both nature and art take on a new glow when one is in love , in part because one sees the beloved in every sunset , every painting .
Because she has been made perfect in the process of crystallization , all that is beautiful in the world becomes part of her , a larger her , spread out over the world — naturally , then , anything beautiful will remind one of her .
Love is reverie , it is akin to the artistic process .
And akin to the artistic product as well : if music were always perfect , Stendhal tells us , we would never need to fall in love .
Then again , he admitted almost in the same breath , perfect music only ever deepened his intoxication with his beloved .
●
And yet in all of this there is a note of desperation .
Or more than a note — a theme of sadness in love that at times overwhelms its exaltation , and always at least threatens to do so .
There are passages in On Love where Stendhal seems to equate unrequited love with love in general , as if this were its purest form : consider the choice of Werther as the antipode to Don Juan , for example .
The book is filled with discussions of jealousy and attempts to get over despair which show the dark side of love , the brutal suffering that we necessarily risk when we make a real go of it .
And in Stendhal ’s reports from the early nineteenth - century aristocratic social scene of Europe ’s great cities , there are so many suicides that one wonders if there was anyone left standing by the time the book went to press .
Is Stendhal just being true to his phenomenon , or is there something more going on ?
There is in fact something more , for On Love was a brave but failed attempt by its author to overcome an oppressive passion .
Stendhal would never fully recover from his one great love , Métilde , the woman whose image , even after her death , would appear to him persistently as “ a tender , profoundly sad phantom . ”
It all began with Stendhal ’s arrival in Milan in 1814 .
Fresh from his rather extraordinary brush with history — he was present at Napoleon ’s retreat from Russia — he found his way to the city that had already captured his soul , having resolved to live there on his veteran ’s half - pay and the small annuity left to him by his grandfather .
( Restoration France was not so hospitable to Bonapartists , Stendhal correctly surmised . )
At the outset of this period of cultural tourism Stendhal took up again with the woman who was something like the Rosaline to his Juliet , Angela Pietragrua , who had previously been happy enough to entertain him on his visits to Italy , but now began to chafe under his new semi-permanent residence .
Their eventual break features as its highlight a story that may or may not be apocryphal , but in either case resembles the drama , maybe even the histrionics , that would find its way into Stendhal ’s novels : having gained the confidence of one of Pietragrua ’s maids , Stendhal was informed that his beloved had taken other lovers besides him .
To confirm , he arranged with the maid to hide himself in a closet — from which vantage point he then observed an entire rendez - vous , not three feet away .
He was initially amused , apparently , then deeply depressed .
Small potatoes , however ; the deepest depression was yet to come .
Stendhal met Matilde Viscontini Dembowski , the wife of a Polish general , in early 1818 , and promptly fell in love with her .
Métilde ( the French form of her name , the one used by Stendhal ) was an intelligent and resolute woman , the type Stendhal had been waiting for .
The two once conversed , memorably to him , of “ Dante , love , Saint - Preux , and the letters of the Portuguese nun . ”
And Métilde was a freedom fighter , associated with the Carbonari , the revolutionary group working to expel the Austrians from Italy : she had even successfully endured an interrogation by Metternich ’s police — surely for Stendhal a woman could not get any stronger than that .
His love for Métilde went to farcical , touching extremes .
He once followed her from Milan to Volterra — a journey of about 200 miles — where she was visiting her children .
Snooping around in his “ disguise , ” a new jacket and a pair of green glasses , Stendhal was nevertheless discovered , rebuked , and punished : from that point forward he was not allowed to pay visits to Métilde in Milan more than once a fortnight .
Stendhal ’s entire being then became dependent on whatever mood Métilde happened to have during his visit ; each two week period of his life was shaped by the few hours with her that preceded it .
( The incident is narrated in On Love — with the names changed , of course . )
Métilde , for her part , wanted nothing to do with Stendhal , other than to harvest some of his flattery , perhaps .
Mostly she took pains not to allow any rumors to be generated .
For Métilde was a previously fallen woman : fleeing her abusive husband , she was known to have associated with the liberal poet Ugo Foscolo during her stay in Switzerland .
The affair was no affair at all , in fact only a friendship , but her departure from her marital home made conditions ripe for scandal ( an affair under “ normal ” conditions would probably have been overlooked ) .
And so Métilde avoided Stendhal in part because of his libertine reputation — which was most likely alternately a wound and a consolation for him .
His letters tell the real story , however , and it is mostly a story of wounds .
In one of them he writes : “ There are moments during the long lonely evenings when , if it were necessary to murder in order to see you , I would become a murderer . ”
After he had returned to France — expelled from Italy , more or less , because of his friendships with Carbonari , and questionable passages in his writings — he briefly considered assassinating Louis XVIII .
Stendhal founded his theory of love on imagination .
That especially human faculty was for him the source of all that is valuable in love : he thought that without it we would be mere animals , or mere savages , and — in his more extreme but also perhaps more lucid moments — he also thought amorous possession could itself be an evil , since it did away with the unique pleasures of the imagination .
How can we “ crystallize ” perfection once we have become familiar with imperfection ?
Of course , in light of the abject desperation Stendhal suffered at the feet of Métilde Dembowski , all of this appears a bit suspicious .
There is authenticity in loving when that love is not requited ; to stick to one ’s guns in this way is to stay true to one ’s own desires , a possibility closed off to a seducer .
But although this pain might be praiseworthy , although one might decide that living life without the pain just would n’t be worthwhile — even then , surely , we can still say that requited love would be better .
The lover , even the perversely Stendhalian lover , would have to admit this .
If he did n’t , there would be something disturbingly paradoxical , possibly soul - destroying , about the whole thing .
Why spend all that time loving if one does n’t actually want what one claims to want ?
But once we accept this much , there is no very big step to the next question :
What exactly can we do to get what we want ?
In a sense , both Fabrizio del Dongo and Stendhal did as much as they could .
Fabrizio presses his suit with all the urgency available to him , trying the limits imposed by his jail cell ; and Stendhal , in addition to writing impassioned letters , becomes his beloved ’s unwitting travel partner .
But in another sense Fabrizio and Stendhal are doing nothing : each is merely subjecting himself with greater and greater intensity to the will of his beloved — and then hoping for the best .
Fabrizio is successful and Stendhal is unsuccessful , probably because Fabrizio is a handsome nobleman and Stendhal is not .
From the seducer ’s perspective , however , this is just dumb luck , and we can certainly imagine a situation in which Fabrizio would be unsuccessful ( consider , for example , that during all of his persistence Clélia thought that he was his aunt ’s lover ) .
Is subjection then the only option ?— a subjection that risks the slide into a possibly years - long misery like Stendhal ’s ?
Can we not do something ?
Can we not somehow change our behavior , even our being — but stop short of full - blown seduction ?
Or , put another way :
Can we become better at love without becoming pickup artists ?

Stendhal has one more story to tell us .
It is an unsettling story , from the unsettling life of Julien Sorel , the protagonist of Stendhal ’s masterpiece , The Red and the Black .
One of the great characters in the history of Western literature , Sorel is full of complex and varied motivations , capable of crippling timidity , but also lofty and incomprehensible deeds .
He begins the novel as a humble carpenter ’s son and ends up a celebrity of sorts , capturing the imagination of all of France .
Born in Verrières , “ one of the prettiest towns in all Franche - Comté , ” he manages to find an escape for his sensitive soul from the horrors of his brutal , petit - bourgeois family : he becomes tutor to the children of the town ’s mayor , thanks to his superb knowledge of Latin and his freakishly powerful memory .
There he meets his first love , the lady of the household , Madame de Rênal .
The affair proceeds in fits and starts , clumsy beginnings and , indeed , endings ; most importantly , it is a first love for both of the parties involved , despite Madame de Rênal ’s marriage and children , and despite the Napoleon - obsessed Julien ’s attempts to view the affair as a strategic victory on his part .
After some time the two eventually achieve a real purity of feeling , which persists , both in Julien ’s mind and in the mind of the reader , as a counterweight to what happens in the second half of the novel .
After a detour at a seminary in Besançon — the book ’s title refers to the red of the military and the black of the clergy , the life Julien would have wanted and the one he was forced to accept , respectively — the setting shifts to Paris .
There Sorel accepts a position as secretary to the influential Marquis de la Mole , a man who seems to have dedicated his life to changing his title from Marquis to Duke , but who is nevertheless an exemplar of the oldest , most established nobility of France , the legitimate cream of the crop .
In his house in the Faubourg Saint - Germain there will play out a love affair described by Stendhal with such force that a reader cannot but wince in recognition .
For the Marquis has a daughter , Mathilde ( this is surely not a coincidence , even with the slight difference in spelling ) , and she is as beautiful and intimidating as they come : a perfect “ 10 , ” her value compounded by her stratospheric social status ; the most desirable woman in the most desirable neighborhood , the prom queen for all of Europe .
Julien intrigues her with his intellectual ’s arrogance , so refreshing beside the flattery of her insipid circle of admiring half - men , a group of young nobles who quake at the thought of liberalism ’s return ( the story is set just before the events of 1830 , which loom over the novel just as World War I does over Thomas Mann ’s The Magic Mountain ) .
Mathilde wants a man of action , a man who recalls the times of Richard III , and finds him , oddly , in Julien .
The two begin to exchange letters , which is surely a tribute to Rousseau ’s Nouvelle Héloïse , since Julien and Mathilde have the leisure and the privacy to speak to each other whenever they want .
Soon there are suspicions on Julien ’s part — it is a woman who also takes down his model , Molière ’s Tartuffe — but he agrees to an assignation .
One does in fact occur , and then another , but eventually , sure of being loved , Mathilde loses interest , and Julien is cast into a misery he had not previously known to be possible .
In a passage uncomfortably chilling to anyone who has even once experienced the rejection of a fickle lover , Stendhal describes a decisive moment in their affair :
After this terrible blow , frantic with love and misery , Julien attempted to argue himself back into favor .
Nothing could have been more absurd .
Argue yourself out of being disliked ?
But reason no longer had any control over his actions .
Blind instinct compelled him to delay this final determination of his fate .
He felt that , while he was still talking , it would not be all over .
Mathilde did not listen to him ; the sound of his words irritated her .
She could not have believed he ’d have the audacity to interrupt her .
Mercifully , Julien is distracted from his suffering by a top - secret diplomatic mission in the service of the Marquis , which after some adventures carries him to Strasbourg .
There he runs into an acquaintance of his , a Russian , Prince Korasoff — and not a moment too soon .
Julien thirsts to share his story with someone , and he could not have found a better interlocutor .
Korasoff , delighted that a Frenchman is actually listening to him , proceeds to advise Julien on the proper way to regain Mathilde ’s heart , surprised all along that Julien could be so naïve ( apparently all Russian gentry were pickup artists at the time ) .
The heart of Korasoff ’s counsel is the recommendation that Julien actively pursue some other woman in the extended social circle of the de la Mole family , a plan he helps realize with a very special gift : a series of 53 letters .
Julien is to copy the letters out and send them to the new target — an assault on propriety beginning with highfalutin trivialities but gradually incorporating riskier intimacies .
Having taken a real liking to his new friend , Korasoff even offers Julien a cousin ’s hand in marriage ; Julien refuses the offer , and takes the advice instead .
The experiment , then , is set to go .
It is clear on the one hand that Julien is not a pickup artist , or not merely one : he is deeply in love , wracked with one - itis , with his aim firmly in sight .
But on the other hand he is not leaving matters in Mathilde ’s hands : he is playing the game he is forced to play .
Can we not excuse him because he loves her ?
Is this not the solution we have been seeking all along ?
Has Julien not become a synthesis of sorts , both a lover and also an “ artist ” — a passionate man who tames his passion for the right end ?
Come what may , Julien does not falter .
He returns to Paris , and to Mathilde ’s surprise he does not beg , and he does not plead — he just goes about his business seducing the pious Madame de Fervaques .
This includes a strategy session with a previous suitor and an exiled Spanish count ; and regular , extraordinarily insincere , conversation with the new object of his affection in the drawing room of the de la Mole mansion .
Julien fulfills his duty , but wearily , not bothering to open many of Madame de Fervaques ’ letters to him , and even forgetting to change the names in one of Prince Korasoff ’s letters when copying it into his own hand .
His strategy is successful nevertheless : on one occasion , receiving an envelope from Madame de Fervaques ’ porter , he is observed by Mathilde .
She guesses correctly the source of the communication , loses her composure and cries out to him .
Julien , stunned , almost yields to her as she throws herself in his arms .
But the warnings of Korasoff remain with him in his time of need ; he knows that if he just once reveals his true feelings he will be despised , and so he spurns her , coolly and diplomatically .
The charade is kept up in the weeks to come , even as the two resume their former intimacy : Mathilde is finally in love and could not be happier ; Julien is also in love , but his eyes only show it when hidden .
Absurdly , the state of affairs is maintained all the way up to Mathilde ’s pregnancy .
Julien does finally confess his love to Mathilde , but at that point the game is over ; he is her master , and she is his slave .
No matter what the outcome , however , what remains with us is the disjunction between the two lovers , the sense that they are like two people taking part in two completely different conversations , even though their words are directed at each other .
The experiment , then , ends in a disquieting paradox : Julien can only have the woman he loves if he does not , for all intents and purposes , love the woman he loves .
He has tried to become simultaneously lover and pickup artist , but his failure makes him , when all is said and done , only a pickup artist .
He “ gets ” the girl in the one way — but not the other .
Stendhal is not known for his flowery prose .
It is true that the plumbing of psychological depth in Red and the Black affords more occasions for this sort of thing than the spare , show - don ’t - tell realism of Charterhouse ; but we could nevertheless describe Stendhal ’s style in Red and the Black with words like “ breezy ” or “ brisk . ”
Yet it is hard to imagine a more moving evocation of Julien Sorel ’s dilemma than the one Stendhal gives us , as the young man feigns love for Mathilde ’s rival , Madame de Fervaques .
Unable to show his passion for Mathilde , but overwhelmed by that passion all the same , he is caught :
“ Ah , ” he said to himself , hearing the empty words his mouth had pronounced , as if he had been emitting strange noises , “ if I could cover those pale cheeks with kisses , and you never felt them ! ”
●
If it is impossible to combine the two extremes , lover and pickup artist , we might do better trying to find some ground between them .
This is easier said than done , certainly , or easier sketched than filled out — but at least we can expect some help from Stendhal , even if that help will be a little difficult to locate .
Stendhal , as we have seen , is something of a double agent , even if his allegiances ultimately lie on the side of the lovers .
But just as he knows the shortcomings of Don Juan , Stendhal also knows the shortcomings of Werther .
Julien Sorel is a response to this painful knowledge , an attempt in fictional form to overcome this separation .
This attempt may fail , but there are others in Stendhal ’s oeuvre .
It is a commonplace in the reception of On Love to call attention to Stendhal ’s uniquely binary , or ambivalent , approach to his subject matter : he seems to be both fully absorbed in the phenomenon of love and also a detached observer of it ; both “ emotional ” and “ analytic . ”
Often in the making of the observation it is the trivial aspects that are emphasized — that Stendhal excelled in mathematics as a young man , that he is fond of categorizing , etc . — but the core is deep : Stendhal has somehow , someway , succeeded in being both part of something larger , swept away by it , and so to speak controlled by it ; and also larger than the same thing , sweeping it up , controlling it .
In a handful of places in the book , this intriguing authorial strategy finds itself reflected in Stendhal ’s advice about love .
These moments are the book ’s real treasures .
The best among them may be the curious chapter of On Love entitled “ Concerning Intimacy . ”
The chapter ’s stated theme , unaffectedness , first leads to some head - scratching : Stendhal of all people is counseling transparency in the transactions of love ?
Has he not shown us already that this is suicide ?
But slowly he explains himself , and a fascinating paradox takes shape .
According to Stendhal , being natural is not at all , well , natural — it is an art .
It takes effort .
The kind of thing he has in mind is familiar enough once he spells it out , but an extraordinary thing nonetheless : unaffectedness in conversation ( or “ naturalness , ” in a more literal and more awkward translation of the French ) is something one needs to work toward , step by step .
One must set the stage carefully for the right moment to present itself ; and then , when it does , one must speak from the heart .
And not too late , either — there is a right time for everything .
It is as if the mood between two partners in a conversation has a will of its own .
The challenge is to be attuned to it .
As Stendhal writes : “ The whole art of loving seems to me , in a nutshell , to consist in saying precisely what the degree of intoxication requires at any given moment . ”
This unnatural naturalness , this choreographed approach to the clumsiness of truth , is a perfect illustration of the synthesis we have been narrowing in on : the elaborate preparations for naturalness are an attempt to master a situation , but the moments of naturalness are themselves an act of surrender .
One prepares for intoxication ; but one is nevertheless intoxicated .
One yields carefully ; but one nevertheless yields .
This precarious mixture of the active and the passive is the middle ground between a yearning , hopeless love and a ribald pickup artistry .
It is love mediated through art , an artistry of love .
●
The lover should take his cue from Stendhal .
The balancing act called for must be duplicated at every level and at every moment : always a genuine passion , and always a compensating restraint .
If the lover is truly in love , he will be bursting to ask , bursting to tell , bursting to know and to make known .
But he must always be patient , always willing to bide his time , to keep his sweet sentiments and his ardent gestures to himself until the time for them arrives .
And though the beloved may waver in her affection , the lover cannot let his faith be shaken .
Like Stendhal ’s ideal conversation with its moments of preparation and moments of naturalness , the love affair as a whole contains moments of distance and moments of closeness ; the lover must always adapt , stay ready , and roll with the punches .
Words are especially dangerous .
Not only must the “ I love you ” be indefinitely postponed , but a whole lot else as well .
The love affair should be an escape from the everyday , from the routine of the discursive ; whoever does not understand the importance of what is unsaid in love does not understand love at all .
When , in one of the decisive moments of The Charterhouse of Parma , Clélia Conti ’s father falls ill in a near - poisoning , she realizes just how high are the stakes in her love for Fabrizio , and swears on the spot to the Virgin Mary that she will never lay eyes upon him again .
Much later in the story , the ever - daring Fabrizio manufactures a ruse that lands him in the same room as Clélia , in the house where she has taken refuge .
As soon as she sees through the disguise he has assumed to gain entrance to the house , she runs to the corner of the room and hides her face in her hands .
But nearly immediately she gives him a hint :
“ It is already a great deal more than you deserve if , by some distorted and probably criminal interpretation of my vow , I consent to listen to you . ”
Fabrizio requires a few seconds , but eventually he understands .
He snuffs out the candle .
Clélia throws herself in his arms and — her vow intact , because she cannot see him — exclaims : “ Dear Fabrizio , how long it has taken you to get here ! ”
When their affair resumes , they meet in the dark , and make love in the dark .
Always .
Clélia and Fabrizio show that the most earnest love can go hand in hand with the most cunning eroticism .
Even if the pickup artists have developed the craft of seduction to a degree of refinement not yet seen under the sun , they still cannot claim the erotic arts for themselves .
The pleasure and duty of restraint belong just as much to love as they do to mere seduction .
And so the proper antidote to the poison of the pickup artists is not a staid , predictable courtship absent of vitality , followed by an equally staid and predictable relationship .
The antidote is rather to have the best of both worlds , love and eroticism .
In an important sense , “ the game ” belongs to the lover much more even than it belongs to the pickup artists , because with the lover the game is redeemed and heightened .
The lover ’s eroticism is always subject to a greater end , an end greater than himself : it is flirtation in the service of commitment , complication in the service of sincerity , playfulness in the service of seriousness .
But remember that love cannot simply be the seduction of someone who happens to be the lover ’s beloved : that path leads to paradox and despair , as Julien Sorel was kind enough to show us .
Julien ’s crucial error was to separate his love from his “ technique , ” to use eroticism like a tool for the attainment of some unrelated end .
And he paid the price : crying in his arms , Mathilde was in love with someone , to be sure — but it was n’t really Julien .
There is only one way out .
The lover must combine his passion and his restraint , as much as possible , in the very same moment .
In other words , it is not enough that playfulness be taken up in the service of seriousness ; the seriousness must always be present alongside the playfulness , bound up with it in a constant synthesis .
This means that the lover will have to show his hand every once in a while , even if he is quick to hide it again .
And this also means that love will always bring with it some portion of terror .
Because his heart is at stake , the lover will feel the terror of losing the beloved , even in the moment she gives herself to him .
This is the terror the seducer believes he has bypassed .
Maybe he has — but in doing so the chance for love has slipped through his fingers .
Because he does not sow , he can not reap .
There is no way around this .
●
When I look back now on what happened with Rachel , I am still filled with regret .
But my disappointment with myself is tempered by the knowledge that my greatest failure was not the failure to acquire her , but rather , odd as it seems , the failure to do justice to the erotic itself .
Another way to put this is that I spoiled the chance the two of us had to create something beautiful .
Not the chance I had , but the chance we had .
Nobody knows how many more times we would have reveled in the details of the flirtation that brought us together , how many more albums we would have listened to on my living room floor , how many more people would have told us we looked like each other .
But also — nobody knows how many times we would have trembled in fear at each other ’s absence .
I only regret not being prepared for all of this then .
Which is not to say that Rachel was wrong when she gave me that peculiar command , on that last night : “ Be bold . ”
She was right ; I should have been bold , and I was n’t .
But the boldness needed was not the excessive manliness of the pickup artists .
It was a manliness at once more humble and more daring ; it was the courage to face up to whatever is greater than us in love , and the presence of mind to spring into action when the time comes .
●
I am a passionate lover .
You might be too .
We might have been born that way , even .
I was very , very young — prepubescent — the first time I was so captivated by a girl that I could not speak in her presence .
When I was in college , I suffered a debilitating passion that frequently kept me in my darkened dorm room for an hour at a time , writhing in hope and despair .
She and I once ended up trapped in a bathroom together when we were drunk at a party .
She was clearly interested in making out ; I wanted a declaration of love .
As the knocking and complaining on the other side of the door became more and more distracting , she got fed up and left .
When I told a friend how I was feeling , he said : “ You mean you ’re like a 12 year old girl ? ” I was as a matter of fact 22 at the time , and I was ashamed .
I am not any longer .
Stendhal turned 36 in the year that he succumbed to Métilde Dembowski , and Goethe seemed to spend an entire lifetime falling in love .
These men do not have a special dispensation because they are uncommonly good at putting words next to each other ; the Romantic temperament is available to the rest of us as well .
If you are a passionate lover , then , know that you are not alone .
And do not lament your condition .
Yet you should also know that you are one of a dying breed .
True , the reach of Romanticism is long and profound — it is undeniable that we in the West are still the descendants of Stendhal .
But love is fading fast .
Long ago , the world provided much of our eroticism for us , by leaving us few options other than restraint .
Now we no longer have Madame de Rênal ’s happy home , or Fabrizio ’s prison walls , to do us the favor of getting in our way .
Were Stendhal to visit us today , this would no doubt be one of his first observations : love has become too easy .
Or , rather , love has become too difficult , because sex has become too easy .
If you take up love today , then , you take on an extra burden : the burden of creating your own eroticism , of conjuring up walls and limits out of thin air to replace the ones we have lost .
You have no choice in the matter .
Love was hard enough already ; it has only gotten harder .
Your love will exhaust you .
But it will be worth the trouble .
Currently , the PC games torrent tracker scene is dominated by a few large torrent sites – Blackcats Games , bitGAMER , Underground – Gamer , etc .

Army of God adherent and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Neil Horsley is under arrest for a series of bizarre diatribes against pop star Elton John , and is increasingly focusing his active anti-gay and anti-choice activities abroad .
A correction was made to this article at 6:33 pm Monday , May 3rd , 2010 .
In the earlier version , Kenya was incorrectly described as a “ western ” African country .
It is in East Africa .
Army of God adherent and Georgia gubernatorial candidate Neil Horsley is under arrest for a series of bizarre diatribes against pop star Elton John .
Gay rights activists are also demanding an investigation into perceived death threats directed at a gay New York travel agent on a website bearing an eerie similarity to Horsley ’s infamous “ Nuremberg Files . ”
Kenyan abortion providers are named on the site under “ not - wanted ” banners sporting animated illustrations of dripping blood .
Horsley ’s most recent legal problems though stem from a rant - filled protest staged outside the singer ’s Atlanta high - rise condominium where he hoisted a sign proclaiming “ Elton John must die .
Hebrews 9:27 . ”
The openly gay pop star apparently angered Horsley after telling Parade magazine in a Feb. 17 interview :
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

I think Jesus was a compassionate , super - intelligent gay man who understood human problems .
On the cross , he forgave the people who crucified him .
Jesus wanted us to be loving and forgiving .
I do n’t know what makes people so cruel .
Try being a gay woman in the Middle East — you ’re as good as dead .
Later , in the video posted Feb. 28 on YouTube , Horsley was joined streetside by Jonathan O’Toole , a long - time associate in the Army of God , an organized confederation of militant anti-abortion activists around the nation .
Horsley and his Georgia - based cell are fairly unique within the terrorist group for incorporating anti-gay threats into their grisly anti-choice activities .
Horsley was arrested March 10 by the Atlanta Police Department ’s fugitive squad and the U.S. Marshal Service .
The putative candidate of the Creator ’s Rights Party has been charged with “ terroristic threats , criminal defamation and using the Internet to disseminate threats , ” according to the Atlanta Journal - Constitution .
Bond was set at $ 40,000 on all three charges .
Should Horsley make bond Magistrate Judge James Altman ordered the notorious anti-abortion activist to reside with his son , Nathanael , who is serving as his father ’s lawyer , and to maintain a household telephone land - line .
It ’s unknown if Horsley currently remains in the Fulton County slammer but he ’s long been a fixture in the federal court circuit .
In 1999 , Horsley unsuccessfully sued Gloria Feldt and Kim Gandy , then - presidents of Planned Parenthood and the National Organization for Women , respectively , for libel , assault and slander .
He demanded a whopping $ 107 million judgment .
A similar suit against TV talk show host Gerald Rivera was also dismissed .
Along with other Army of God members , Horsley was the subject of a 2003 court injunction granted to a Buffalo women ’s clinic after a protester invasion blockaded its entrance .
In 2002 , Horsley was ordered by a federal appeals court to take down the “ Nuremberg Files ” website , a thinly - veiled hit list of 12 abortion providers containing personal information , maps and photographs of family members .
To encourage further violence , Horsley marked the images of those who had been killed or maimed by fellow extremists in a macabre death tally .
Active links to the “ Nuremberg Files ” remain on Horsley ’s other website , Christian Gallery , which is replete with gory photographs , graphic illustrations of sex acts , fiery Biblical justifications for murder and his secessionist platform for the State of Georgia .
Project SEE , the group ’s newest Internet threat , borrows heavily from that not - so - disbanded site .
One page contains photos of and calls for information about 26 women ’s health care providers in the African nation of Kenya accusing them of participating in an international abortion conspiracy .
Kenyan laws restrict abortion care only to prevent maternal death .
Like the previous U.S. website , the “ not wanted ” posters are simply designed to inflame political tensions between health care providers and fundamentalist vigilante groups .
Also featured on the site is a threat directed specifically at Kenneth Hieber , the owner of Gay2A frika , Inc. , a New York - based firm that organizes excursions for gay and lesbian travelers .
An English language “ not wanted ” poster bears Hieber ’s image and a homosexual slur .
The Swahili version contains a crude depiction of anal sex .
The website lists his address , phone number and email .
It also claims the firm is promoting gay sexual tourism , a claim Hieber vigorously denies .
Same - sex relationships are illegal in Kenya and subject to long prison terms .
Recent news reports document a steep increase in anti-gay violence near the capital city of Mombasa .
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , Hieber contacted the New York City Police Dept . but “ they did not believe the Web site constituted a direct threat . ”
The hate crimes watchdog group also notes :
Meanwhile , the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Campaign , the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) and other human rights and faith - based groups are discussing how to challenge the Web site without further endangering the leaders in Africa who are being targeted by it .
Hieber lodged an abuse complaint with GoDaddy.com , the Internet host for Project SEE .
However , the firm refuses to remove the site because it claims while the content could be perceived as obscene it is not illegal .
The individuals involved in Horsley ’s latest terrorist effort should give the GoDaddy legal department plenty of room to pause over the group ’s violent history .
The local Kenyan supporters are affiliated with The Ark of Kenya , a militant fundamentalist Christian group led by Pastor Peter Bushnell .
O’Toole who also appeared in the Elton John protest video , is reportedly married to Esther Njenga , a Kenyan woman he met while scouting the eastern African nation for the new Army of God outpost .
The site notes that O’Toole is the site editor .
Rev. Michael Bray is also listed as contact for the group and posted an endorsement of Horsley ’s new Christian mission .
Bray , a founding member of the Army of God , was convicted in 1984 and was sentenced to six years in federal prison for a series of bombings at abortion clinics in the mid-Atlantic states and the Washington , DC , offices of the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Abortion Federation .
All of the men have signed a letter condoning the vigilante - style execution of abortion providers as Biblically justified .
The Army of God is linked to dozens of murders , assaults , bombings , arsons and clinic blockades throughout the U.S. over the last two decades .
And right now Thad Allen is down there , because I think he -- it's his view that some of the allocation of boom or other efforts to protect shorelines has n't been as nimble as it needs to be .
And he said so publicly .
And so he will be making sure that , in fact , the resources to protect the shorelines are there immediately .
But here 's the broad point :
There has never been a point during this crisis in which this administration , up and down up the line , in all these agencies , has n't , number one , understood this was my top priority -- getting this stopped and then mitigating the damage ; and number two , understanding that if BP was n't doing what our best options were , we were fully empowered and instruct them , to tell them to do something different .
And so if you take a look at what 's transpired over the last four to five weeks , there may be areas where there have been disagreements , for example , on dispersants , and these are complicated issues .
But overall , the decisions that have been made have been reflective of the best science that we 've got , the best expert opinion that we have , and have been weighing various risks and various options to allocate our resources in such a way that we can get this fixed as quickly as possible .
Jake Tapper .
Q : Thanks , Mr. President .
You say that everything that could be done is being done , but there are those in the region and those industry experts who say that 's not true .
Governor Jindal obviously had this proposal for a barrier .
They say that if that had been approved when they first asked for it , they would have 10 miles up already .
There are fishermen down there who want to work , who want to help , have n't been trained , have n't been told to go do so .
There are industry experts who say that they 're surprised that tankers have n't been sent out there to vacuum , as was done in ' 93 outside Saudi Arabia .
And then , of course , there 's the fact that there are 17 countries that have offered to help and it's only been accepted from two countries , Norway and Mexico .
How can you say that everything that can be done is being done with all these experts and all these officials saying that 's not true ?
THE PRESIDENT : Well , let me distinguish between -- if the question is , Jake , are we doing everything perfectly out there , then the answer is absolutely not .
We can always do better .
If the question is , are we , each time there is an idea , evaluating it and making a decision , is this the best option that we have right now , based on how quickly we can stop this leak and how much damage can we mitigate -- then the answer is yes .
So let 's take the example of Governor Jindal 's barrier islands idea .
When I met with him when I was down there two weeks ago , I said I will make sure that our team immediately reviews this idea , that the Army Corps of Engineers is looking at the feasibility of it , and if they think -- if they tell me that this is the best approach to dealing with this problem , then we 're going to move quickly to execute it .
If they have a disagreement with Governor Jindal 's experts as to whether this would be effective or not , whether it was going to be cost - effective , given the other things that need to be done , then we 'll sit down and try to figure that out .
And that essentially is what happened , which is why today you saw an announcement where , from the Army Corps ' perspective , there were some areas where this might work , but there are some areas where it would be counter - productive and not a good use of resources .
Militarism and democracy : the implications of the McChrystal affair
By Patrick Martin
24 June 2010
The political crisis in Washington , sparked by the publication of inflammatory comments by General Stanley McChrystal , the overall commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan , culminated in the firing of McChrystal Wednesday morning and his replacement by General David Petraeus , the former US commander in Iraq .
McChrystal was summoned from Afghanistan to a White House meeting where he submitted his resignation over the publication of a lengthy article in Rolling Stone magazine , in which he and his top aides were quoted making disparaging references to President Obama and nearly all the administration ’s top national security officials .
Obama accepted the resignation , and McChrystal left the White House immediately .
After three hours of meetings with his national security council and Pentagon brass , Obama appeared before television cameras to announce McChrystal ’s ouster and the nomination of Petraeus to succeed him .
In his brief remarks , with no questions allowed from the media , Obama emphasized that he remained fully in support of the program of military escalation and counterinsurgency warfare with which McChrystal is identified .
He pledged to do “ whatever is necessary to succeed in Afghanistan , ” adding , “ This is a change in personnel but it is not a change in policy . ”
General Petraeus , who was McChrystal ’s superior as head of the U.S. Central Command , was closely involved in the administration ’s Afghan policy deliberations and fully supported the decision last December to dispatch an additional 30,000 US troops .
Two aspects of the McChrystal affair deserve consideration .
First , and most obviously , the firing of McChrystal demonstrates the worsening position of the US intervention in Afghanistan .
The general would not have been summarily dismissed over a magazine article if the war had been going well .
The day McChrystal was fired , the death toll for US and NATO troops rose to 76 in June , making this the worst month for the foreign occupation forces since the US first invaded Afghanistan in October 2001 .
Among the Afghan people , President Hamid Karzai is widely reviled as a corrupt American puppet .
Antiwar sentiment is mounting in all the European countries with military contingents in Afghanistan , as well as in the United States , where a majority in opinion polls now say the war is not worth fighting .
A report issued Monday by a congressional committee found that the supply chain for US troops in Afghanistan funnels hundreds of millions of dollars into the coffers of corrupt local warlords , many of whom in turn pay Taliban insurgents not to attack their trucks .
The Pentagon is thus indirectly financing the insurgency , to the tune of $ 2 million a week according to one estimate cited in the report .
On Tuesday evening , three of the most pro-war US senators , John McCain and Lindsey Graham , both Republicans , and Independent Democrat Joseph Lieberman , issued a joint statement condemning McChrystal ’s comments as “ inappropriate and inconsistent with the traditional relationship between commander - in - chief and the military . ”
They effectively endorsed his dismissal in advance , declaring , “ The decision concerning General McChrystal ’s future is a decision to be made by the president of the United States . ”
The backing for Obama from congressional Republicans and many right - wing media pundits shows that significant sections of the ruling elite have lost confidence in McChrystal and his counterinsurgency strategy .
There was growing criticism for the past month , following the evident failure of the US intervention in Marjah and the forced postponement of the planned offensive into Kandahar , Afghanistan ’s second largest city and a Taliban stronghold .
Obama ’s selection of Petraeus to replace McChrystal is a clear effort to appease these right - wing critics .
Petraeus directed the US military escalation in Iraq in 2007 - 2008 , which is credited in ruling circles with salvaging the US intervention there , although some 90,000 US troops still remain .
The appointment of Petraeus was suggested in advance by neoconservative columnist William Kristol , and hailed by the right - wing media as a political masterstroke .
The second key element in the McChrystal affair is what it has revealed about the internal state of affairs in the US military .
An entire layer has developed in the officer corps and high command , which is openly contemptuous of civilian authority , while their nominal superiors are themselves thoroughly intimidated by military opposition .
The Army plays an ever - growing role in American political life , fueled by an endless succession of wars .
The US military has been continuously engaged in combat operations for nearly nine years , the longest such period in American history , and the Pentagon operates under a “ Long War ” doctrine , which envisions a more or less indefinite continuation of such warfare .
A few of the more perceptive press commentators have pointed out this aspect of the McChrystal affair .
Simon Tisdall , writing in the British Guardian , observed , “ The disrespectful behaviour of the US commander in Afghanistan and his aides was symptomatic of a more deeply rooted , potentially dangerous malaise , analysts suggest .
This week ’s events might thus be termed a very American coup . ”
Liberal
Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman , writing in the Los Angeles Times about “ An increasingly politicized military , ” argued that the McChrystal affair is more ominous than the celebrated Truman - MacArthur clash of 1951 , which ended with MacArthur ’s dismissal in the midst of the Korean War .
That is because McChrystal voices openly the sentiments an officer corps that has become , through a political selection over the past three decades , overwhelmingly oriented to the right - wing of the Republican Party and to Christian fundamentalism .
Ackerman cites surveys showing that “ a majority of active - duty officers believe that senior officers should ‘ insist ’ on making civilian officers accept their viewpoints ” and that “ only 29 % believe that high - ranking civilians , rather than their military counterparts , ‘ should have the final say on what type of military force to use ’ . ”
The ominous implications of this trend were expressed in two reports published Wednesday in the New York Times .
An article by correspondent C.J. Chivers describes growing frustration among field officers , NCOs and rank - and - file soldiers in Afghanistan with McChrystal ’s counterinsurgency tactics , which , in the name of reducing civilian casualties , call for “ further tightening rules guiding the use of Western firepower — airstrikes and guided rocket attacks , artillery barrages and even mortar fire — to support troops on the ground . ”
Chivers claims the rules “ have shifted risks from Afghan civilians to Western combatants , ” leading to widespread resentment among the troops over “ being handcuffed ” in the fight against the Taliban and other insurgents .
His unstated conclusion is that the replacement of McChrystal should be welcomed as a step to unleashing the full power of American weaponry on the Afghan population .
A commentary by correspondent Robert Mackey , published on the Times web site , takes note of the Chivers article and poses the question , “ Is a Culture War Between American Soldiers and Civilians Inevitable ? ”
Mackey points to the growing gulf between the American population and an all - volunteer military , much of its leadership recruited from the families that have provided several generations of military officers .
McChrystal himself , he notes , was the son of a major general who served in the US occupation government in Germany after World War II and later at the Pentagon .
All five of McChrystal ’s siblings either joined the military or married into it .
What such commentaries begin to reveal is the emergence in the United States of a distinct military caste , virulently hostile to democracy , civilian control and any form of popular opposition to American imperialism .
The firing of McChrystal and his replacement by Petraeus represents , not a blow against this trend , but the means by which Obama and the Democratic Party adapt themselves to the demands of the military brass .
McChrystal ’s only crime — his “ error in judgment ” , in Obama ’s parlance — was to express in too blunt and unguarded a fashion the sentiments of broad sections of the US officer corps .

This is a list of video games that have been censored or banned by governments of various states in the world .
Governments that have banned video games have been criticized for a correlated increase in digital piracy , limiting business opportunities and violating rights . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
Afghanistan [ edit ]
During the five year reign of the Taliban government in Afghanistan , Western technology and art was prohibited , which included all video games .[ citation needed ]
Argentina [ edit ]
Name Reason Carmageddon Banned in the city of Buenos Aires because it depicts people being killed by motor vehicles .
[ 4 ]
RapeLay
Banned because the object of the game is to stalk and rape a woman and her two daughters , at least one of whom appears to be underage . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Australia [ edit ]
Brazil [ edit ]
Brazil has banned many video games since 1999 , mainly due to depictions of violence and cruelty , [ 7 ] making it illegal to distribute and otherwise sell these games . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
Additionally , the Brazilian advisory rating system requires that all video games be rated by the organization , where unrated video games are banned from being sold in Brazil .
Often , bans do not extend to digital platforms .
China [ edit ]
A very large number of video games are banned in the People 's Republic of China .
Games that depict drugs , sexual themes , blood , organized crime or defamation of the Chinese government are almost always banned .
Because of the large size of the Chinese video game market , many studios edit the content of their games to conform to the government 's standards .
Home gaming consoles were banned in mainland China from June 2000 [ 17 ] [ 18 ] until 2013 ; when the ban was lifted , next - generation consoles such as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were allowed in the country . [ 19 ]
As of April 2019 , after implementing a new mandatory local rating and approval system , any and all games containing depictions of violence , blood , gambling and imperial history are de facto banned from all accessible platforms in the nation ( unless otherwise changed to comply with local standards ) .
[ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ unreliable source ? ] [ dubious – discuss ]
Notable games banned in this region are :
Denmark [ edit ]
EA Sports MMA was not released in Denmark because of a law prohibiting marketing for energy drinks , which EA chose not to remove from the game . [ 29 ]
However , distribution is not illegal , as the game can still be found on shelves as an import .
Germany [ edit ]
A video game can be banned in Germany if it is confiscated by court order because it violates a section of the Strafgesetzbuch ( criminal code ) .
Private possession ( and thus playing it ) and acquisition ( such as downloading a demo from the Internet ) are still legal , but any dissemination is not .
The seller would break the law if a sale took place , not the buyer .
However , on 10 December 2002 , one German court ( Oberlandesgericht Hamm ) decided that a single sale of a single copy does not qualify as dissemination . [ 30 ]
Unlike indexing by the BPjM , which restricts the sale of all content - equal versions , the versions that are confiscated are enumerated in the court order .
Being put on the index by the BPjM or , since April 1 , 2003 , being refused a rating by the USK , does not equal a ban .
Rather , it imposes strict trade restrictions on the title .
While only very few games have been confiscated , the list of indexed games is very long . [ 31 ]
In December 2006 , just one month after the Emsdetten school shooting , Bavaria and Lower Saxony proposed legislation , to be presented to the national parliament , that would make even playing any game that featured “ cruel violence on humans or human - looking characters ” punishable by fines and up to a year in prison . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
§ 86a outlaws the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations , § 130 Volksverhetzung ( agitation of the people ) , and § 131 instructions for committing crimes .
In the official lists , these three sections are always bundled , so any game that contains swastika flags and / or any depiction of Adolf Hitler is listed alongside racist propaganda pieces .
This law was lifted 8 August 2018 .
§ 131 outlaws representation of excessive violence in media " which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human or humanoid beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity " . [ 35 ]
§ 130 and § 131 make it a criminal offence to do the following with corresponding scriptures :
distribute / sell them issue in public , demonstrate or otherwise make them available leave them to a person under the age of 18 produce , buy , deliver , store , offer , announce , praise , import or export them within the meaning of points 1 to 3 .
This means that import or purchase and possession for personal use of such games is still legal for persons over 18 years of age .
In the case of video games that contain pornography with children or minors , where a real or realistic event is depicted , the possession of the video game or working towards possessing it would be illegal under § 184b or § 184c StGB .
Otherwise , if the work depicts a fictitious event , the distribution of such material is illegal .
In August 2008 , Sega confirmed that The House of the Dead : Overkill and MadWorld would not be released in Germany , [ 36 ] due to the likelihood that they would be refused to get a rating by the USK . [ 37 ]
Sega also announced in November 2009 that they would not distribute Aliens vs. Predator for similar reasons . [ 38 ]
A " Beschlagnahmung " ( ban ) is enforced for a minimum of ten years , after which a request for review may be submitted . [ 39 ]
Although the bans usually do n't extend to the digital versions , local versions are still toned down in depictions of violence and similar content to be classified by the USK without any rulings .
Greece [ edit ]
No known games have been banned in Greece .
A law banning all electronic games in public places was passed in 2002 , but eventually disregarded . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ]
Many games were censored in Greece , such as GTA 4 in 2010 when the Greek government claimed the game was full of extreme gore and even referenced a scene where one of the characters , [ citation needed ] Jimmy Pegorino , killed a couple .
Half - Life 2 was also pulled off the shelves in Greek video game stores in 2006 , due to its dystopian setting .[ citation needed ]
India [ edit ]
Iran [ edit ]
Iran typically bans any game that contains violence , depicts cruelty , features strong sexual content , nudity , or portrays the Middle East negatively .
Battlefield 3 was banned because it presented a fictional U.S. invasion on Tehran .
Even before the ban , many retail stores were removing copies of the game from their shelves . [ 51 ]
Pokémon
Go was banned due to security reasons . [ 52 ]
Valkyrie Drive : Bhikkhuni was banned for excessively glorifying homosexual and immoral values .
The ban does not extend to digital distribution , however . [ 53 ]
Blur was banned in the country when many people were worried that this could lead to people thinking they are in the game , resulting in a threat for pedestrians and other road users , this ban , however , has been met with an uproar from parents , resulting in the ban being lifted .
Republic of Ireland [ edit ]
The IFCO rarely rates video games , and leaves decisions to PEGI and the BBFC .
Manhunt 2 was banned for " gross , unrelenting , and gratuitous violence " , but the ban was later lifted and the game was given a PEGI 18 rating . [ 54 ]
Italy [ edit ]
In 2006 , following the release of the trailer to the game Rule of Rose , the magazine Panorama ran an article claiming live burials of children at the protagonist 's hand .
Shortly after , then - mayor of Rome , Walter Veltroni , called for a ban of the game in Italy .
The game 's European publisher , 505 Games , dismissed these claims , [ 55 ] and the game was not banned following Veltroni 's comments .
In 2007 , following the decision of the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland , the Minister of Communications Paolo Gentiloni publicly expressed the desire to ban the distribution of Manhunt 2 in Italy , due to the gratuitous violence and excessive cruelty in the video game , but the ban was never put into practice . [ 56 ]
Japan [ edit ]
Video games are rarely banned in Japan , and it holds the place as one of the top video game producers in the world . [ 57 ]
However , Fallout 3 was edited in Japan due to two reasons : a quest named " The Power of the Atom " which gave the player a choice to nuke a city named Megaton , which caused part of the quest to be removed , and a weapon in the game called the Fat Man .
Because of its relation to the real historic event , the weapon was renamed to the Nuka Launcher in the Japanese version of Fallout 3 . [ 58 ]
Japan 's Spike removed all references to Kim Jong-il and North Korea in Homefront , as well . [ 59 ]
Resident Evil 4 , Call of Duty : Black Ops , Bulletstorm , Gears of War 3 , Grand Theft Auto V , Dead Island , Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance and numerous other violent titles [ citation needed ] , distributed physically and digitally , were heavily edited for excessive violence , but only on the localization level ; the games can still be played if the locale is switched from Japanese to English .
The Mortal Kombat series was subsequently banned in Japan , including its newest release , due to heavy amounts of violence [ citation needed ] .
On 13 March 2019 , the sales of Judgment had stopped producing future sales in Japan , following Pierre Taki 's arrest on suspicion of cocaine use .
As a result , Sega had replaced both the voice actor and the character model having been subsequently removed .
Kenya [ edit ]
Name Reason Valkyrie Drive : Bhikkhuni Banned because of sexual content and glorification of homosexuality . [ citation needed ]

[ 61 ] [ 62 ]
In February 2010 , one week after Dante 's Inferno was released , the game was banned by Jabatan Agama Islam ( JAIS ) in Malaysia for offensive depictions of cruelty , hellish visions , sexuality and content that was against Sharia .[ citation needed ]
In 2016 , Pokémon Go was banned by the Federal Territory for Muslims for promoting the search for power , which leads to gambling and safety issues related to playing the game .
The ban was later lifted following massive backlash on social media and an update that slightly modified security measures on the app .
In September 2017 , the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ( MCMC ) blocked access to the entire Steam store following the discovery of a controversial fighting game involving religious deities , Fight of Gods . [ 63 ]
The ban was lifted one day later after Valve agreed to block the game in Malaysia . [ 64 ]
Mexico [ edit ]
Though no video games have ever been banned in the country , Tom Clancy 's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 was banned in the state of Chihuahua due to Mexican rebels being depicted as antagonists and stereotyping the cities of Chihuahua City and Ciudad Juárez . [ 65 ]
However , the game can still be found in shelves in other states .
Nepal [ edit ]
Name Reason PUBG
Banned because of delinquency issues involving youths . [ 66 ]
Currently , the ban has been lifted [ 67 ]
New Zealand [ edit ]
In New Zealand , games are classified by the country 's Office of Film and Literature Classification .
If they are dubbed " objectionable " in all cases , they are banned .
In this case , the game in question is not only illegal to sell , but also to own , possess , or import .
Games are typically banned and classified as " objectionable content " when they contain extreme violence , offensive depictions of cruelty , animal cruelty , sexual content involving children , or graphic depictions of sexual content , including sexual fetishes that are " offensive & abhorrent " ( depictions of urination , bestiality , necrophilia , urophilia , coprophilia , and / or incest ) .

Despite the law being technically in effect following the EDSA Revolution , it has since been disregarded and unenforced .[ citation needed ]
While no video games are banned nationwide so far since 1986 , at least one title , Defense of the Ancients , has been banned at a barangay in Dasmariñas , Cavite following complaints of delinquency issues , and two murder incidents involving youths in the area resulting from brawls in relation to the game . [ 82 ]
Russia [ edit ]
In Russia , games are classified by the " On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development " federal law .
No known games have been banned in Russia due to excessive violence , nudity , negative portrayal of people of Russia or expression of religious views of any kind because of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia .
Media in the United States and Europe have incorrectly reported that Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , which features a storyline in which Russian " ultranationalists " take control of the country and invade the United States , was banned in Russia .
Activision called these reports ' erroneous ' . [ 83 ]
In 2019 , Sony Interactive Entertainment Russia refused to sell Call of Duty : Modern Warfare digitally .
Name Reason Call of Duty : Modern Warfare
Not officially banned , but Sony Interactive Entertainment refused to sell the game digitally on PlayStation 4 . [ 84 ]
Saudi Arabia [ edit ]
Most banned games can be found in many stores ( often at a substantial price ) due to the government failing to enforce the bans of these games .
However , some major stores will not stock banned titles . [ 85 ]
Singapore [ edit ]
Singapore rarely bans games .
With the implementation of the Video Game Classification in 2008 by the Media Development Authority , most games are widely available for purchase to their respective age group , such as those containing full frontal nudity or strong graphic violence under an " M18 " rating .
Games that were previously banned such as Mass Effect were re-rated either " Age Advisory " or " M18 " after the implementation of the classification system .
Name Reason Half - Life Banned because of violence . [ 88 ]
The ban was met with uproar as the local gaming community and retailers scrambled to start petitions to save the game .
The government decided to lift the ban after a week , as the game had been released for more than a year and the ban would impact the local LAN gaming and retail market . [ 89 ]
Mass Effect Banned because of a homosexual encounter between a feminine alien and female human . [ 90 ]
The ban was later lifted and the title re-rated M18 . [ 91 ]
The Darkness Banned because of excessive violence . [ 92 ]
The ban was later lifted and the title re-rated M18 . [ citation needed ]
South Korea [ edit ]

However , Manhunt , Manhunt 2 , and Mortal Kombat are still banned because of violence and cruelty .
Grand Theft Auto III , Grand Theft Auto : Vice City and Mercenaries : Playground of Destruction were previously banned , but the bans were later lifted . [ 93 ]
The Game Rating Board requires that all video games be rated by the organization .
Unrated titles are absolutely banned from being sold in the country , and websites selling them can be blocked .
Thailand [ edit ]
Thailand will typically ban any games with excessive violence , and sexual content , such as many eroge from Japan , for the same reasons as its ban on any pornographic films .[ citation needed ]
Additionally , since August 2008 , all video game titles of the Grand Theft Auto series have been completely banned in Thailand , [ 95 ] because of a case where an 18 - year - old Thai player supposedly influenced by Grand Theft Auto killed a taxi driver from Bangkok . [ 96 ]
The ban , however , does not extend to the digital PC versions of Grand Theft Auto V. [ 97 ]
Tropico 5 is yet another banned title .
The ruling military junta claims that it could " affect peace and order " within the country . [ 98 ]
United Arab Emirates [ edit ]
In the United Arab Emirates , a branch of the government called the National Media Council ( NMC ) works to control the media and entertainment industry in the country , and they have the authority to issue bans on any specific media products , including video games , to comply with the country 's legal and cultural values .
Usually , the NMC do not explicitly state their actual consensus for any kind of issued ban on a product , so official reasons behind their bans remain unclear .
However , bans issued by the NMC apply only to the sale of those products through local outlets ; they do not make private ownership illegal .
There are certain exceptions , notably for Spec Ops : The Line ( see below ) .
Some banned games may be available and sold on the nation 's grey market .[ citation needed ]
In 2018 , the NMC introduced a localised rating system for various media , including video games . [ 99 ]
The following titles are banned from mainstream physical retail .
United Kingdom [ edit ]
Games in the UK usually only receive a ban when they contain real sex scenes and / or gratuitous violence .
BBFC age ratings are compulsory and backed by legislation , taking effect 30 July 2012 . [ 127 ]
It is illegal to sell , buy or rent , but not import , a game that has not been classified by an approved age rating organisation in the UK .
This only applies to games stored on physical media , not downloadable media . [ 128 ]
Name Reason Carmageddon
Was threatened with being refused certification in its uncut form .
Was subsequently altered to replace pedestrians with zombies . [ 129 ]
The restriction was later lifted , and a patch was released to restore the original human content .
Manhunt 2
The uncut version was the only game to be refused classification by the BBFC ( therefore banned ) , due to excessive graphic violence and cruelty .
[ 130 ]
After this , a modified version was made and submitted for certification – this was initially refused classification as well , but was allowed to be sold after an appeal ( despite a successful challenge to this ruling ) .
The Punisher The version of the game that had been edited for the American market was further censored for the British release .
The interrogation scenes were deemed graphically controversial and edits were made at the request of the BBFC to further mask these scenes . [ 131 ]
The edited version received an 18 certificate .
United States [ edit ]
In the United States , the Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ESRB ) — a self - regulatory organization , issues ratings for video games and enforces voluntary regulations on how they are marketed and sold . [ 132 ]
The Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association — which challenged a California law restricting the sale of " violent video games " ( defined using a variation of the Miller test separate from ratings assigned by bodies such as the ESRB ) to minors , insisting that video games were considered a protected form of expression under the First Amendment , meaning that federal or state law cannot be used to regulate their distribution based on content . [ 133 ] [ 134 ]
However , games can still be recalled as the result of court orders ; a nude model featured in The Guy Game sued its developer and publisher over use of her likeness , as she was underage at the time of filming and thus could not personally consent to her depiction .
All remaining copies of the game that contained her likeness were recalled from stores . [ 135 ] [ 136 ]
In 2012 , a court found that Silicon Knights had plagiarized Epic Games ' proprietary Unreal engine , and had used it in Too Human and X - Men : Destiny , along with other unreleased projects .
The studio was ordered to recall and destroy all remaining copies , materials , and source code relating to the games . [ 137 ] [ 138 ]
The ESRB 's highest rating , " Adults Only " , has been considered a total ban on the mainstream sale of certain games , as most retailers refuse to stock games carrying the rating , and they cannot be published on major video game consoles due to company policies . [ 139 ] [ 140 ] [ 141 ] [ 142 ]
The release of Thrill Kill , an AO - rated fighting game with strong sexual themes , was outright cancelled by Electronic Arts ( who had acquired its developer ) due to objections over its content . [ 143 ]
Following the discovery of an incomplete sex minigame that was not included in the final game but could be accessed using a modification or cheating device , Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas was re-rated Adults Only and recalled by Rockstar Games , in favor of a new revision of the game that omitted the offending content entirely and carried the original Mature rating .
[ 144 ] [ 145 ] [ 146 ]
Venezuela [ edit ]
In November 2009 , the Government of Venezuela announced that it would ban all video games in which the objective was to shoot people .
The ban was due to widespread violence in the country .
The bill was later published in the public journal of that country on 3 December [ 147 ] and went into effect 3 months later , [ 148 ] 3 March 2010 , making Venezuela the first country to completely ban violent video games in the world and make their manufacturing , distribution , selling , rental , exhibition and use illegal .
Even though the proponents were not from the Venezuelan Government 's political party , Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela ( PSUV ) , President Hugo Chávez supported the ban , [ 149 ] claiming there are some Internet games featuring him so players can " kill them " ; and even calling video game consoles , including Nintendo DS and Sony PlayStation , " poison " and values of capitalism , which he considers " the road to hell " .
According to reports of the Venezuelan National Guard , more than 13,000 objects , including violent video games , have been massively destroyed in the states of Lara [ 150 ] and Portuguesa . [ 151 ]
The ban is criticized by gamers and experts alike for its ambiguity and lack of clarity on its penalties , aside from being too harsh and indoctrinating a negative point of view . [ 152 ]
On the other hand , Sony expressed their hopes for the government to make changes for the law for good . [ 153 ]
The ban extends to the digital versions of these games . [ 154 ]

I tried the Soluto program , and by following its recommendations , cut my boot time to 1.44 minutes from 2.40 minutes .
I removed some applications from the boot sequence , letting them run after the boot was over .
I “ paused ” other applications that I do n’t use on a daily basis  for instance , an application that automatically updates Google products .
Instead , I ’ll wait until the company lets me know when there is an update .
( Soluto divides the possible changes in the boot into “ no brainers , ” “ potentially removable apps ” and “ required , cannot be removed . ” )
The company is also working on solutions to other slowdowns , like interruptions while working on Excel or typing in Word when another application suddenly commands Windows resources , causing a timeout .
Finding the source of delays is often tricky , Mr. Adler said , because Windows runs on many different computer models ; each has its own complement of downloads and devices , all jockeying for attention .
To find the source of each slowdown , Soluto uses a statistical approach , Mr. Dvir said .
“ Over millions of machines and millions of users , the problems start to repeat themselves , ” he said .
“ There may be 10,000 people with the identical problem , and one of them will find a solution . ”
Those millions of users are still in the future , as are their solutions to Windows problems .
To acquire those users , Soluto plans to offer free versions of all its products , Mr. Adler said .
As it runs on users ’ machines , the program will analyze problems and publish solutions .
The program wo n’t reach in and fix the problem directly ; the user will have to do that .
But if the initial program for boot optimization is any guide , Soluto will be offering suggestions for fixes , letting users know what others have chosen .
A premium version that fixes problems automatically will be available for a charge , he said .

Arizona voters will have yet another chance to vote on whether they want medicinal marijuana legalized in this state , thanks to the efforts of a statewide advocacy group that 's collected hundreds of thousands of signatures over the last several months .
Only 153,356 signatures were needed to get the measure on the November ballot , but the Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project turned more than 250,000 petitions into the Secretary of State 's Office last month , and it's now been confirmed by that office that the initiative will go to the voters in November .
The use of medical marijuana has been approved by Arizona voters twice in the last 15 years , but in each case , the wording of the measure prevented it from becoming law .
We spoke to AMMPP campaign manager Andrew Myers in April about past problems with the law , and he says they should n't be a problem this time around .
" We have the benefit of experience now , " he says .
Some of the problems that Myers says are now ironed out are the issue of how to tax the marijuana , certain regulations that dictate where the weed can be smoked , and the number of marijuana dispensaries -- which , he says , are several of the problems facing California 's medical - marijuana program .
" Right now , in Los Angeles , there are more marijuana dispensaries than there are Starbucks , " Myers says .
Under the guidelines of the new initiative , the number of dispensaries would be limited to about 120 statewide , and smokers would only be allowed to smoke in a private place , not at the dispensaries .
" [ Medical marijuana ] is overwhelmingly supported in Arizona , " Myers says .
" In the past , voters have supported it , and polls show that about 65 percent of voters would support it this time . "

We hear a lot about the “ rules ” of relationships – especially when it comes to marriage and family .
If you are married , think back to the advice you got on the day of your nuptials .
Chances are you got advice like “ do n’t go to bed angry ” and “ do n’t let your kids see you fight . ”
There are also family rules and practices in society that revolve around the idea that children must always come first , or that healthy families do everything together .
While some aspects of these rules make sense , they are n’t hard and fast .
And they can actually be damaging to family relationships in the long run .
Here are 6 family relationship rules that you can break sometimes to build stronger connections :
1. Be Completely Honest All of the Time
There are times that complete honesty is warranted .
When you are discussing your financial situation , complete honesty is a good thing .
However , you do n’t need to be honest about everything all the time .
Details about past relationships are not necessary .
If there is something you feel the need to disclose , do it quickly , and move on .
No need to linger , or to be completely honest about how maybe you liked someone else a little bit better in bed , or admired his or her more adventurous spirit .
2. Make Up Before You Go To Bed
I heard this a lot when I was preparing to marry my husband .
And I found early on that maybe staying up until two or three in the morning trying to resolve some issue was n’t the way to do things .
Instead , agreeing that you both need to sleep on it provides some time to step back , and refresh yourselves .
You ’re both more reasonable when you ’re rested , rather than being tired and stressed .
Sometimes , after sleeping on it , my husband and I wake in the morning , and realize that what seemed so important the night before was silly and not worth being angry over any more .
3. Never Let Your Kids See You Disagree
Yes , you want to present a mostly united front .
But that does n’t mean that they ca n’t see how disagreements can be resolved rationally .
Showing your children that you can discuss things calmly , without resorting to personal attacks and yelling , sets a positive example for conflict resolution .
You can be good examples of compromise and working out relationship differences by showing your children how to disagree constructively .
Of course , it means that you and your partner have to have practice at positive outcomes before you demonstrate them to your children .
4. You Should Do Everything Together
We know that quality time with our families is important , but that does n’t mean that every vacation or activity has to be attended by everyone .
Indeed , sometimes it can help for you to go on separate vacations , especially if there are some divergent interests involved .
My husband hates camping , but it was part of my growing up , and I love it .
So my son and I meet my parents and siblings ( and their families ) once a year for a camping trip .
My son and I have a good time , and my husband gets some buddy time in with friends by going to a movie , or enjoys himself by sleeping in and vegging out with video games and baseball on TV .
My husband gets away with one of his cousins regularly , for a road trip of a few days to spend quality time together .
Yes , you need to do family activities for health relationships , but sometimes it can help to have separate activities , so that family members are n’t miserable doing something they really dislike .
5. Your Kids Should Always Come First
Actually , your partner ’s emotional needs should come first .
This does n’t mean you neglect your children ; just that you show them that your partner is the most important person in your life .
Go on dates , leaving the kids with a babysitter , on occasion .
One of the most important lessons I learned after having my son is that my husband needed attention , too .
After I went back to work when my maternity was up , I would come home and immediately go to my son and pick him up and feed him and hold him .
My husband felt I cared more about our son than him .
He spoke to me about his feelings , and I realized that our son could wait 10 or 15 minutes while I greeted my husband first , and asked after his day ( as a primary caregiver ) , listening to him .
We also frequently tell our son to wait when he tries to interrupt conversations we are having with each other .
We pay attention to our son , and make efforts to encourage him , but we make it clear that we love each other first .
6. You Need Things to Be Exciting
Yes , it ’s fun to go on vacations , or to have a red - hot intimate relationship .
But it does n’t need to be that way all the time .
Indeed , sometimes it ’s healthier to slow down and be boring a lot of the time .
The initial excitement you felt upon meeting will eventually wane .
That does n’t mean that you picked the wrong person .
Indeed , lifelong commitment with your partner can mean a deeper love , that does n’t depend on some feeling of excitement .
The same is true of family home life .
Your kids do n’t need to be constantly stimulated with activities and “ fun . ”
There is a lot to be said about finding contentment in home life , and viewing big vacations as “ extras ” rather than as necessities .
Can you think of other family relationship rules it could be healthy to break ?

With their top two off season priorities now on the back burner , the Detroit Red Wings have started to focus on signing their second tier of free agents .
By signing Nicklas Lidstrom and Tomas Holmstrom to deals last week , the Wings are now turning their attention to another veteran : Todd Bertuzzi .
Bertuzzi has stirred debate amongst
Wings fans ever since he first arrived here back in 2006 .
Back then , Bertuzzi was fresh off the Steve Moore incident and many wondered if having him on the roster put the integrity of the team at risk .
Bert 's first stint in Motown was a short one , lasting a combined 24 games ( 8 regular season , 16 playoffs ) , tallying a combined five goals and six assists .
After an early playoff exit , Bertuzzi was unsurprisingly let go .
He 's bounced around the league ever since , which have included stints in Anaheim and Calgary .
Now after a semi-successful return to the Wings , Bertuzzi is once again a free agent with an uncertain future .
Detroit wants him back , but only has a certain amount of cap space available for him .
Bertuzzi has said he will re-sign with Detroit or retire .
The question has become how badly he wants to keep playing .
Much like his previous time here , many Detroit fans were split when the Wings signed Bertuzzi last off season to a $ 1.5 million , one - year deal .
After contributing 44 points in the regular season and 11 in the playoffs , it seems that opinion about Bertuzzi has shifted in his favor .
He 's won over many fans with his hard work ethic , and willingness to be a secondary " Holmstrom " in front of the opposing goaltender .
In an injury plagued season , he was just one of three Red Wings to play all 82 games .
He still has his detractors , however .
Bertuzzi has a bad habit of taking untimely penalties , one of which cost the Red Wings a game back when they were fighting for playoff position .
Even worse , it seems half the penalties he has taken have been reputation calls .
He 'll make blind passes to no one at times , and is n't exactly the best skater on the team .
But then again , every once in awhile , he 'll do this :
There 's no doubt that Bertuzzi can contribute to this team .
When put on one of the top two lines , he 's definitely one of the Wings ' better producers .
But Bertuzzi's stats may suffer next season with the return of Jiri Hudler , who is certainly going to garner a spot on one of the top two lines .
That could mean Bertuzzi would be pushed down to the third line , a spot where he has struggled to produce .
General Manager Ken Holland finds himself in a tough spot here .
Holland wants him back , but with Bertuzzi pondering retirement he may talk him into it if he goes too low with his offer .
Then again , he can't spend too much or else he wo n't have enough money to re-sign other free agents like Darren Helm , Justin Abdelkader , Drew Miller and Patrick Eaves .
The best option for Detroit is to offer a contract in the same neighborhood of the $ 1.5 million range that Bertuzzi made this year , likely a little less than that .
At 35 , the biggest thing Bertuzzi wants is stability , so if the Wings offer him a two - year , $ 2.5 - $ 2.8 million deal he might be inclined to take it .
It 's a slight paycut , but he 'll be hard - pressed to find better offers on the open market .
No matter what happens , it will most likely start another debate amongst Wings fans about Bertuzzi 's role on this team .
Some will argue he does n't fit the system , will others will say that he brings a much - needed physical presence .
The only thing we can hope for at this point is that this eventually works out --- for Bertuzzi and the Red Wings .
UPDATE : There is now a poll attached to voice your opinion .
Pluzz.fr : France Télévisions lance son service de TV de rattrapage non lisible
Le 5 juillet ( hier donc ) , France Télévisions a lancé son service de télévision de rattrapage , qui ne permet pas de lire les vidéos .
À moins d’accepter d’installer un système d’exploitation particulier avec un logiciel particulier ( propriétaires évidemment ) .
C’est comme s’ils diffusaient leurs émissions uniquement pour les utilisateurs équipés d’une TV Sony ou Philips , et pas pour les autres …
France Télévisions a simplement oublié que c’était un avant tout un service public .
Formats
La lecture des vidéos nécessite soit Windows Media Player , soit Silverlight .
C’est dommage , il aurait été préférable que leur site soit du web , accessible à tous .
En plus de cela , les vidéos sont diffusées dans le format fermé WMV .
Certaines contiennent même des DRM .
Les DRM , pour rappel , c’est ce qui empêche les utilisateurs de lire le contenu proposé .
Certains prétendent que ça permet d’empêcher la copier ; ce n’est pas totalement faux : quand on ne peut pas lire le contenu on ne peut pas le copier .
Une autre technique plus efficace serait de ne pas le publier du tout .
En numérique , tout ce qui est lisible est copiable .
Par contraposée , tout ce qui n’est pas copiable n’est pas lisible .
outil d’accès
comme france télévisions n’a pas fait son boulot d’interopérabilité , et qu’a priori chacun a droit d’accéder à ce service ( public ! ) , nous sommes obligés de nous débrouiller par nous - mêmes .
j’ai donc écrit un petit script bash qui permet d’accéder relativement simplement à pluzz à partir d’un système libre ( où vlc doit ê tre installé , testé sur ubuntu 10.04 ) .
pour l’utiliser , rendez - vous sur pluzz .fr , cliquez sur l’émission de votre choix , et copier l’adresse de la page ( par exemple http://www.pluzz.fr/jt-20h.html ) .
ensuite , pour lire la vidéo , tapez :
pluzz play
http://www.pluzz.fr/jt-20h.html
pour l’enregistrer ( bah oui , tout ce qui est lisible est enregistrable ) :
pluzz record http://www.pluzz.fr/jt-20h.html
si vous voulez simplement l’url du flux :
pluzz url http://www.pluzz.fr/jt-20h.html
Ceci ne fonctionnera que pour les vidéos sans DRM : les vidéos avec DRM ne sont pas lisibles .
EDIT : Pluzz a récemment changé la manière dont les vidéos sont diffusées .
Le script que j’ai proposé ici ne fonctionnera donc plus pour une majorité de vidéos .
Chaoswizard en a créé un nouveau , en Python pour prendre en compte ces changements .
Le plus simple maintenant est d’utiliser l’outil youtube - dl ( qui , contrairement à ce que son nom pourrait laisser penser , ne télécharge pas que sur Youtube ) :
sudo apt - get install youtube-dl
Script
Le script est disponible sous licence wtfpl sur ce dépôt git : pluzz .
Pour fonctionner , le paquet flvstreamer doit être installé :
sudo apt - get install flvstreamer
Le plus simple pour l’installer est de créer télécharger le script pluzz et d’exécuter :
sudo install pluzz /usr / local / bin
Conclusion
Après s’être déjà fait remarqué par leur exclusivité avec
Orange , j’espère que France Télévisions acceptera un jour de permettre l’accès à tous à la télévision de rattrapage .
More than two - thirds of the respondents - 68 percent - agreed that " separation of church and state is a key principle of our Constitution , " although 49 percent also want to see " religion have more influence " on education .
Only 21 percent said religion should have less influence in public schools .
The research arm of the Texas Freedom Network , a liberal - leaning group that monitors the board , commissioned the poll .
The poll surveyed 972 likely voters and was conducted by Washington - based Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research .
It had a margin of error of plus- or minus - 4 percentage points .
" People are actually quite practical .
They want the best education for their kids , " said Anna Greenberg , senior vice president of the polling company .
" They are less guided by ideology than what we might assume .
They are guided by very practical concerns for their kids having the kind of education that prepares them to be successful in the future . "
Other poll highlights :
88 percent of the respondents believe public schools should be required " to protect all children from bullying , harassment and discrimination in school , including the children of gay and lesbian parents or teenagers who are gay . "
55 percent oppose using publicly funded vouchers that allow some students to attend private and religious schools .
72 percent want teachers and scholars to be responsible for writing curriculum standards for schools , not the elected Board of Education .
Initially , 32 percent of the respondents opposed the State Board 's revisions to Texas ' social studies curriculum standards .
The opposition climbed to 57 percent after the process was described .
The 15 - member board has triggered controversy in recent years by making substantial changes - criticized as driven by the board majority 's adherence to conservative ideology - to expert recommendations in the development of new curriculum standards for science and social studies .
Loudest critics
Among the loudest of those critics has been the Texas Freedom Network Education Fund , a nonpartisan research organization focused on public education , religious freedom and civil liberties .
" Texans want a cease - fire in the divisive ' culture war ' battles that have dominated education issues in our state and think what our schoolchildren learn should be based on the knowledge and expertise of teachers and scholars , not the personal agendas of politicians on the State Board of Education , " said Kathy Miller , the fund 's president .
The poll findings did not impress the Liberty Institute , which stands on the opposite end of the political spectrum .
Conservatives ' view
" Since the Texas Freedom Network takes anti-religious freedom and pro-abortion positions and constantly attacks abstinence education , the results of their survey of 900 people are no surprise and are routinely rejected by our elected officials and common sense values of Texas , " said Jonathan Saenz , legislative director and attorney for the Liberty Institute .
" If public school curriculum were left to Texas Freedom Network and their hand - picked list of academics and bureaucrats , we would have censorship in our science classroom and Christmas and Rosh Hashanah would have been cut out of our social studies teaching , while other religious holidays are taught , " Saenz said .

Manchester City are on the verge of taking their summer spending close to £ 80 m after Lazio accepted a £ 17 m bid for the Serbia international Aleksandar Kolarov today .
Kolarov is an attacking left - back renowned for his powerful shooting and ability from set pieces – his style has seen him being labelled as the Serbian Roberto Carlos – and he has been identified to take over from Wayne Bridge in a new - look defence also featuring Jerome Boateng , the £ 10.5 m recruit from Hamburg .
Bridge has not convinced the City manager , Roberto Mancini , that he is good enough for a team that aspires to challenge for the Premier League title in the coming season and the former England international can expect to start on the bench if the 24 - year - old Kolarov agrees to become the club 's fourth signing of the summer .
Real Madrid , Juventus and Internazionale have also approached Lazio but City are the only club to have reached an agreement and are hopeful Kolarov , who played in two of Serbia 's group games in the World Cup , will not be deterred by the fact that his potential new employer will not be involved in the Champions League .
If everything goes according to plan , he should take his medical in the coming days and will link up with the rest of Mancini 's squad on their pre-season trip to the United States .
City have also signed David Silva from Valencia and Yaya Touré from Barcelona , both for around £ 25 m , and the club 's transfer business since the Abu Dhabi United Group took control 22 months ago is likely to go through the £ 300 m mark in the coming weeks .
James Milner remains a target and City are hoping to reach a compromise with Aston Villa over a fee .
An opening offer of £ 20 m was turned down in May and Villa have said they want £ 30 m pounds , but it helps City that Milner is known to want the transfer to go ahead .
Similarly there will be new attempts to resurrect a deal for Wolfsburg 's prolific striker Edin Dzeko , despite the huge disparity in the valuation of the player .
Wolfsburg are asking for a fee of around £ 45 m whereas City are adamant they will not pay significantly above £ 30 m .
Mancini's players are currently in Portland and Joe Hart has cut short his holiday to join them for the start of their pre-season programme .
That begins with a game against Portland Timbers on Saturday and Hart hopes to convince Mancini that he should start the season in goal ahead of Shay Given , even if the Republic of Ireland international has recovered from the shoulder injury he suffered towards the end of last season .
Hart was not originally due to join up with the squad until they go to New York next Thursday but , mindful that this could be a season in which he also establishes himself as England 's first - choice goalkeeper , he has changed his plans to try to get a headstart on Given .

Almost year ago I had posted how to optimize Opera for large amount of tabs and one of the tweaks that came up in comments was about vertical ( sidebar - like ) tab bar .
I discarded that as non-mainstream tweak at the time .
Year later I wo n’t have my tabs any other way than on my right .
So , what is merit in such tweak and what ways of using browser ( not necessarily Opera ) it fits ?
Tab anatomy
Every tab carries number of elements :
site favicon ;
page title ;
unread indicator ;
close button .
Amount of open tabs affects how effective some of these are :
favicon – always ;
title – with low amount of open tabs ;
unread indicator – always ;
close button – never ( it ’s plain evil , just disable and close with middle click ) .
As for screen space that all of tab bar occupies – all modern monitors have widescreen format .
That means when display gets larger it gains more in width then it height .
So vertical space is precious , horizontal space is expendable .
Horizontal bar
Classic one .
Tabs are displayed in horizontal line ( or multi- line ) and their size is dynamic – they get smaller when there are more of them .
Disadvantage is clear – with large amount of tabs it is hard to distinguish between pages .
At least favicons make it easy to distinguish between sites .
Advantage is that you open a lot of tabs and it will be cramped , but always remains absolutely usable .
Vertical bar
To try it in Opera Right - click tab bar > Tab Bar Placement .
This one is geeky .
Tabs are displayed in vertical stack as sidebar .
Their size is static – width and height remain constant .
Disadvantage is that this view has limit of hitting screen bottom .
Since tabs ca n’t get smaller from there they can either go off - screen , or force bar to multi-column ( eating unreasonable amount of space on all but giant resolutions ) .
Advantage is that page titles are clearly visible at all times and favicons are close , instead of being spread .
This organization makes much easier to keep open group of pages from same site and still see their individual names .
Overall
Horizontal tab placement favors browsing large amount of pages from assorted sites .
Good fit for random browsing or just for following habit .
Vertical tab placement favors moderate amount of pages from few sites .
Good fit for research and reference browsing .
Had you ever tried vertical tab placement ?
What were / are your impressions ?

A new study from the University of Leicester Department of Economics reveals that highly educated people make wrong assumptions about their political leanings -- they are more likely to think they are left wing when they are more likely to be relatively conservative .
The study suggests that some people may end up voting for left of centre parties because they hold the mistaken belief that they are left wing .
The research by Dr James Rockey , a lecturer in Economics , used data from the World Values Survey and described the opinions and characteristics of 136,000 individuals , in 82 countries , over a period of over 20 years .
His study , Who is Left - Wing , and Who Just Thinks They Are ? , analysed whether people misperceive their relative ideological position by measuring on a scale from 1 to 10 what people think they are -- and measuring their opinion against a substantive issue ie how income should be divided .
" The most startling result is that the more educated tend to believe that they are more left - wing than they are measured as being , " said Dr Rockey .
" That is , well - educated individuals are more likely to think that they are quite left - wing but actually believe things that compared to the rest of the population would make them comparatively right - wing .
" The analysis suggests that the cause of this is different to the effect of gender , income , or job type .
Other results suggest that men and those with higher - incomes are more likely to both think that they are rightwing and to be measured as such . "
Dr Rockey said one speculative explanation is that people may hold on to their perception that they have left - wing views , but that over time as their circumstances and social network changes their actual political opinions drift rightwards .

This could be because they are comparing themselves against their immediate social / work circle rather than the population as a whole .
It remains the case that richer people , tend to be more right wing and are also aware of this .
Dr Rockey concludes : " It is clear is that , for whatever reason , an individual 's conception of their ideological position often differs from that predicted by a policy question .
" Many of these results merit further investigation .
Perhaps the most interesting question would be to consider why men and women see things so differently .
" The broad conclusion of the paper must be that individuals either choose not to , or are unable to , locate their ideological positions reliably compared to those of the positions of their compatriots .
" This is further evidence not just that voters are far from fully informed , but that somehow voters consistently misperceive where they lie on the ideological spectrum . "
Is it possible that given a clean slate and likely millions of dollars , engineers could come up with the ultimate in secure network technology ?
The scientists at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) think so and this week announced the Clean ‐Slate Design of Resilient , Adaptive , Secure Hosts ( CRASH ) program that looks to lean heavily on human biology to develop super - smart , highly adaptive , supremely secure networks .
For example , the CRASH program looks to translate human immune system strategies into computational terms .
In the human immune system multiple independent mechanisms constantly monitor the body for pathogens .
Even at the cellular level , multiple redundant mechanisms monitor and repair the structure of the DNA .
These mechanisms consume tons of resources , but let the body continue functioning and to repair the damage caused by malfunctions and infectious agents , DARPA stated .
15 genius algorithms
" The analog of the innate immune system will include combinations of hardware and software elements that constantly enforce basic semantic properties such as type safety , memory integrity , code / data distinctions , information flow , and access control constraints .
The innate subsystem will render impossible attacks based on vulnerabilities stemming from violations of these basic properties .
As with biological systems , significant resources should be dedicated to this task .
Since hardware resources are now plentiful , it would be reasonable to use hardware mechanisms where this will lead to more complete enforcement or to better runtime performance , " DARPA stated .
CRASH systems will feature the closely integrated hardware , system software , programming languages and design environments .
Often , making a small change in one of these domains can greatly ease the task of another .
For example , providing a uniform software support system for automatic memory management can reduce the task of analyzing memory safety .
Similarly , hardware tagging can systematically enforce code / data and other distinctions that might be more difficult and more costly to guarantee at other levels .
Programming languages and environments that capture design rationale , constraints , and invariants make it easier to implement self ‐checking and self ‐adaptive software systems , DARPA stated .
In designing CRASH , DARPA said it will be evaluating six critical technical areas :
Processor Architectures : Modest processor extensions may be the most appropriate mechanism for systematically enforcing basic semantic properties such as type safety , memory safety , and information control .
Such work may include , but is not limited to , tagging for information flow tracking , taint propagation , bounds checking , type checking , access control , and concurrency control .
Possible implementation techniques include Field Programmable Gate Arrays or instruction set level simulations .
The performance goal of the resulting implementation is only to be fast enough to support experimentation in this and other technical areas .
Costly and time consuming implementation techniques such as full custom chips whose only purpose is performance should be avoided .
Operating Systems :
The system will be designed around the enforcement of basic semantic properties such as memory safety , type safety , information flow , and access control .
It will work in concert with features provided by the hardware .
Cooperation between the operating system and hardware design is strongly encouraged if new hardware is being developed .
New operating system structures that do away with the concept of a single all ‐privileged kernel are what DARPA is looking for .
The operating system should provide techniques that lead to effective rollback and recovery , information flow tracking , and systematic logging .
The goal is not to produce a feature rich operating system competitive with commercial systems , but rather to build a prototype system capable of illustrating and testing core principles .
Machine Learning , Self ‐Adaptation , Diagnosis , Recovery and Repair :
The techniques to be explored in this area include , but are not limited to :
- Machine learning techniques that develop a model of the program 's intended behavior - Static analysis techniques for extracting models of the program 's intended behavior
- Detection techniques that help determine that the program has stepped outside the bounds of its intended behavior
- Adaptation techniques that allow a program to continue functioning even after a successful attack has corrupted some resources
- Diagnosis techniques to help isolate the underlying cause of the problem
- Recovery techniques that allow a program to roll back to a safe state from which it may continue
- Repair techniques that allow the system to fix the underlying vulnerability
Programming Languages and Environments : Language features and runtime support to guarantee important properties will be encouraged .
In addition , it will be of interest to provide language and / or programming environment features that facilitate the capture of important constraints on program execution such as information flow or invariants that must hold at specific points in the program .
In addition , language features that facilitate the capture of multiple methods for common goals and the trade ‐offs among alternative methods are also encouraged .
Formal Methods : Ideally , formal analysis of software and hardware designs will be used to verify that important properties are being preserved ; more importantly , information gathered from formal analysis should be a part of a continual evolutionary design process .
Techniques are sought that will allow formal proofs of program properties and other static analysis techniques to help build effective computational models of the intended behavior of a program .
Such techniques may include the extraction of efficiently checkable invariant conditions , as well as models of the allowable control flows and data flows .
Dynamic Diversification :
This technical area will focus on techniques that introduce diversity between different copies of the same system and within a single copy over time .
Topics of interest include memory randomization , data structure randomization , stack layout randomization , instruction set diversification , and the use of multiple alternative methods for achieving the same goal .
The need for such an advanced system is obvious : " Current computer systems are not resilient to attacks .
They lack the means to recover from attacks either by finding alternative methods for achieving their goals or by repairing the resources corrupted by the attack .
They also typically lack the ability to diagnose the underlying problem and to fix the vulnerabilities that enabled the attack .
Once a machine is corrupted , manual repairs by specialized personnel are required while the forensic information necessary to affect the repair is typically lacking , " DARPA stated .
While these problems are not new , they have not been adequately dealt with largely because designers have been intellectually and institutionally bound by the need to maintain compatibility with legacy systems , DARPA stated .
DARPA has other security projects in the works as well .
For example , in January the agency awarded almost $ 56 million to two contractors it expects will develop the second phase of technologies that it promises will be revolutionary and bolster current cyber security technology by orders of magnitude .
DARPA spent $ 30 million to develop Phase 1 .
The contracts are part of DARPA 's ambitious National Cyber Range program the agency says will develop revolutionary cyber research and development technologies .
DARPA states that the NCR will advance myriad security technologies and " conduct unbiased , quantitative and qualitative assessment of information assurance and survivability tools in a network environment . "

Oil floats on the surface in Pass A Loutre near Venice , Louisiana May 26 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Sean Gardner
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - BP
Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said on Wednesday it appears drilling mud , not oil , was gushing from a ruptured undersea well six hours into an effort to halt a growing oil spill .
“ What you ’ve been observing coming out of the top of that riser is most likely mud , ” Suttles said at a news conference broadcast from a Louisiana command center .
“ We ca n’t fully confirm that because we ca n’t sample it .
And the way we know we ’ve been successful is it stops flowing . ”
Residents along the Gulf Coast have been watching video of the leaking well since the “ top kill ” began about 1 p.m. CDT ( 2 p.m. EDT ) .
The effort involves pumping tons of drilling mud down the well bore to overcome the oil and gas flowing out .
Suttles and U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Mary Landry said they were cautiously optimistic about the effort to stop the leak that began with a drilling rig explosion April 20 .
The leak threatens the ecology of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the economies of four U.S. states .
“ We ’ve all been here a long time and been trying a lot of things and ridden a roller coaster , ” Suttles told reporters in Robert , Louisiana , and listening over the phone and Internet .
“ I think we just need to take the next 24 hours and see what the results are . ”
The goal is to halt the flow of oil long enough so cement can be pumped in to shut it off .
The mud , a substance specially created for the oil drilling industry and used in all wells drilled , weighs twice as much as water and is being pumped in by 30,000 horsepower compressors .
“ Ultimately , what we need to see is that the well ca n’t flow to surface , ” Suttles said .
“ That will be the way we know it ’s successful . ”
The mile - deep underwater gusher began flowing after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20 , claiming the live of 11 workers .
CHINESE officials said the opening of the World Expo in Shanghai on April 30th would be simple and frugal .
It was n't .
The display of fireworks , laser beams , fountains and dancers rivalled the extravagance of Beijing 's Olympic ceremonies in 2008 .
The government 's urge to show off Chinese dynamism proved irresistible .
For many , the razzmatazz lit up the China model for all the world to admire .
The multi-billion - dollar expo embodies this supposed model , which has won China many admirers in developing countries and beyond .
A survey by the Pew Research Centre , an American polling organisation , found that 85 % of Nigerians viewed China favourably last year ( compared with 79 % in 2008 ) , as did 50 % of Americans ( up from 39 % in 2008 ) and 26 % of Japanese ( up from 14 % , see chart ) .
China 's ability to organise the largest ever World Expo , including a massive upgrade to Shanghai 's infrastructure , with an apparent minimum of the bickering that plagues democracies , is part of what dazzles .
Scholars and officials in China itself , however , are divided over whether there is a China model ( or “ Beijing consensus ” as it was dubbed in 2004 by Joshua Cooper Ramo , an American consultant , playing on the idea of a declining “ Washington consensus ” ) , and if so what the model is and whether it is wise to talk about it .
The Communist Party is diffident about laying claim to any development model that other countries might copy .
Official websites widely noted a report by a pro-Party newspaper in Hong Kong , Ta Kung Pao , calling the expo “ a display platform for the China model ” .
But Chinese leaders avoid using the term and in public describe the expo in less China - centred language .
Not so China 's publishing industry , which in recent months has been cashing in on an upsurge of debate in China about the notion of a China model ( one - party rule , an eclectic approach to free markets and a big role for state enterprise being among its commonly identified ingredients ) .
In November a prominent Party - run publisher produced a 630 - page tome titled “ China Model : A New Development Model from the Sixty Years of the People 's Republic ” .
In January came the more modest “ China Model : Experiences and Difficulties ” .
Another China - model book was launched in April and debated at an expo-related forum in Shanghai .
Its enthusiastic authors include Zhao Qizheng , a former top Party propaganda official , and John Naisbitt , an American futurologist .
Western publishers have been no less enthused by China 's continued rapid growth .
The most recent entry in the field is “ The Beijing Consensus , How China 's Authoritarian Model Will Dominate the Twenty - First Century ” by Stefan Halper , an American academic .
Mr Halper , who has served as an official in various Republican administrations , argues that “ just as globalisation is shrinking the world , China is shrinking the West ” by quietly limiting the projection of its values .
But despite China 's status as “ the world 's largest billboard advertisement for the new alternative ” of going capitalist and staying autocratic , Party leaders are , as Mr Halper describes it , gripped by a fear of losing control and of China descending into chaos .
It is this fear , he says , that is a driving force behind China 's worrying external behaviour .
Party rule , the argument runs , depends on economic growth , which in turn depends on resources supplied by unsavoury countries .
Politicians in Africa in fact rarely talk about following a “ Beijing consensus ” .
But they love the flow of aid from China that comes without Western lectures about governance and human rights .
The same fear makes Chinese leaders reluctant to wax lyrical about a China model .
They are acutely aware of American sensitivity to any talk suggesting the emergence of a rival power and ideology — and conflict with America could wreck China 's economic growth .
In 2003 Chinese officials began talking of the country 's “ peaceful rise ” , only to drop the term a few months later amid worries that even the word “ rise ” would upset the flighty Americans .
Zhao Qizheng , the former propaganda official , writes that he prefers “ China case ” to “ China model ” .
Li Junru , a senior Party theorist , said in December that talk of a China model was “ very dangerous ” because complacency might set in that would sap enthusiasm for further reforms .
Some Chinese lament that this is already happening .
Political reform , which the late architect of China 's developmental model , Deng Xiaoping , once argued was essential for economic liberalisation , has barely progressed since he crushed the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 .
Liu Yawei of the Carter Centre , an American human - rights group wrote last month that efforts by Chinese scholars to promote the idea of a China model have become “ so intense and effective ” that political reform has been “ swept aside ” .
Chinese leaders ' fear of chaos suggests they themselves are not convinced that they have found the right path .
Talk of a model is made all the harder by the stability - threatening problems that breakneck growth engenders , from environmental destruction to rampant corruption and a growing gap between rich and poor .
One of China 's more outspoken media organisations , Caixin , this week published an article by Joseph Nye , an American academic .
In it Mr Nye writes of the risks posed by China 's uncertain political trajectory .
“ Generations change , power often creates hubris and appetites sometimes grow with eating , ” he says .
One Western diplomat , using the term made famous by Mr Nye , describes the expo as a “ competition between soft powers ” .
But if China 's soft power is in the ascendant and America 's declining — as many Chinese commentators write — the event , which is due to end on October 31st , hardly shows it .
True , China succeeded in persuading a record number of countries to take part .
But visitor turnout has been far lower than organisers had anticipated .
And queues outside America 's dour pavilion have been among the longest .

When waves -- regardless of whether light or sound -- collide , they overlap creating interferences .
Austrian and Canadian quantum physicists have now been able to rule out the existence of higher - order interferences experimentally and thereby confirmed an axiom in quantum physics : Born 's rule .
They have published their findings in the scientific journal Science .
In quantum mechanics many propositions are made in probabilities .
In 1926 German physicist Max Born postulated that the probability to find a quantum object at a certain place at a certain time equals the square of its wave function .
A direct consequence of this rule is the interference pattern as shown in the double slit diffraction experiment .
Born 's rule is one of the key laws in quantum mechanics and it proposes that interference occurs in pairs of possibilities .
Interferences of higher order are ruled out .
There was no experimental verification of this proposition until now , when the research group led by Prof.
Gregor Weihs from the University of Innsbruck and the University of Waterloo has confirmed the accuracy of Born ’s law in a triple - slit experiment .
" The existence of third - order interference terms would have tremendous theoretical repercussions - it would shake quantum mechanics to the core , " says Weihs .
The impetus for this experiment was the suggestion made by physicists to generalize either quantum mechanics or gravitation - the two pillars of modern physics - to achieve unification , thereby arriving at a one all - encompassing theory .
" Our experiment thwarts these efforts once again , " explains Gregor Weihs .
Triple - slit experiment
Gregor Weihs - Professor of Photonics at the University of Innsbruck - and his team are investigating new light sources to be used for transmitting quantum information .
He developed a single - photon source , which served as the basis for testing Born 's rule .
Photons were sent through a steel membrane mask which has three micrometer sized slits cut into it .
Measurements were performed with the slits closed individually resulting in eight independent slit combinations .
The data taken was then used to calculate whether Born ’s rule applies .
" In principle , this experiment is very simple , " says Gregor Weihs “ and we were quite surprised to find that nobody had n’t performed this experiment before . "
However , the physicists were struggling with measurement errors , which they were eventually able to overcome during their two year long Sisyphean task .
" Our measurements show that we can rule out the existence of third - order interference up to a certain bound , " says a happy experimental physicist Weihs .
His next step will be to considerably lower the bound with an improved experiment .
Master of light particles
The experiment was performed at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in Canada , where Prof. Gregor Weihs worked before his appointment at the University of Innsbruck .
Since 2008 he has been setting up his own research group at the Institute for Experimental Physics in Innsbruck , Austria , which now comprises twelve group members .
The group , whose members come from all over the world , investigates the development of novel single - photon sources and entangled photon pairs from semiconductor nanostructures .
The researcher ’s ultimate goal is to integrate quantum optical experiments with functions on semiconductor chips .

Holy crap , this has got to be up there as one of the best marriage proposals , ever .
Seriously , this guy raised the bar to the point where I sorta hate him .
Nonetheless , it ’s pretty amazing and I could n’t help but smile all the way through .

Angel Luis Pantojas was 6 when he saw his slain father ’s body in a casket and declared : Not me .
At my wake , people will see me on my feet .
So when he was shot 11 times , twice in the face , and tossed over a bridge in his underwear 18 years later , Pantojas got his wish .
Pantojas ’ family tethered his corpse to the wall , where streams of strangers came from throughout Puerto Rico to see the latest curiosity they dubbed el muerto parao — dead man standing .
“ You could n’t fit another soul in this room , ” his aunt Ana Delia Pantojas recalled , showing the holes in the housing project living room wall where the corpse was bound two summers ago .
“ All sorts of people came here to see him — lawyers , judges .
Everyone was talking , saying things like , ‘ For my wake , I want to be in my recliner with a cup of coffee . ’ ”
The buzz eventually faded , until last month , when David Morales Colon , another young homicide victim from the neighborhood , was embalmed hunched over on his motorcycle .
Morales , like Pantojas , was a member of San Juan ’s growing urban youth subculture in which guns are rampant and lives are often short .

Their “ exotic wakes ” caused such a sensation that authorities including the Department of Health and the state attorney started poring over the penal code .
Puerto Rico ’s House of Representatives convened special hearings .
The funeral home owners association held an emergency board meeting .
But even as the funeral directors decry exotic wakes as sacrilegious offenses to tradition , this much appears to be clear :
The practice is legal .
And when a third Puerto Rican man was embalmed on a motorcycle in Philadelphia last week , the trend , to experts ’ dismay , had come to be seen as a fad in a subculture marked by violence and bravado .
“ I see it as a challenge to the authorities : ‘ You killed me , but you did n’t knock me down , ’ ” said Jorge Lugo Ramirez , president of the Puerto Rico Funeral Home Assn .
“ These kinds of people are surrounded by easy money and guns .
We ca n’t be promoting that . ”

The association asked the Department of Health to investigate and make a rule prohibiting such wakes , requiring that viewings be conducted with the corpse in a coffin — horizontally .
Although the burials were normal , morticians fear that exotic wakes will become such a hit that the funeral homes that prepare the most outrageous cadavers will steal business from traditional competitors .
“ It could get out of control , ” Lugo said .
“ What if one of these guys kills a police officer and wants to be buried with his hands in the form of a V for victory ?
We ’d be supporting something very negative that ’s going on in our country .
The point is that we should not lose our traditions . ”
But Lugo acknowledges that people have been abuzz about it , requesting funerals on bikes , cars or buses they drove for a living .
“ I guess then we ’d have to conduct the wake in the parking lot , ” he said with a laugh .
Technically speaking , Lugo was impressed .

“ As a professional , I had to admire the work , ” he said .
“ The funeral director said she had a secret formula .
As an embalmer , let me tell you :
It should not be secret .
I would like to know how they did it . ”
The Marin Funeral Home , which handled the wakes for both Pantojas and Morales , is not telling .
At first , funeral home manager Elsie Marin talked to the media , and at Morales ’ motorcycle wake , even handled the body to show the gawking crowds and cameras that it was real .
When it was revealed that she does not have an embalmer ’s license , Marin hired a lawyer and declined further interviews , although she later said that the work was contracted to a licensed embalmer .
Morales ’ family also declined to discuss it .
“ We ’re done talking about that , ” said an uncle who would not give his name .

Cultural anthropologist Melba Sanchez , author of the Spanish - language book “ Death : Social Aspects and Contemporary Ethics , ” said the funeral directors should n’t be in such a tizzy .
They should know that funeral traditions change with the years and have evolved to suit individual tastes .
Graham Linehan is a man of contradictions : a successful writer of studio sitcoms for an ad- funded broadcaster who is nevertheless a huge fan of technology and an apparent defender of piracy .
All at the same time as believing that bands and filmmakers should still be paid for their work .
He should be a bit of a muddle , but somehow Linehan manages to put all these thoughts together .
In part , you can see that mix of ideas in his work .
Linehan , who co-wrote Father Ted and Black Books and now writes and directs Channel 4's
The IT Crowd , is a champion of Twitter – as @Glinner he has more than 50,000 followers – yet he remains a strong believer in old - fashioned sitcoms , recorded in front of an audience .
Linehan began his career as a music journalist , working for Hot Press in Dublin , before forming a TV writing partnership with Arthur Mathews that saw the pair create Father Ted .
He describes his favourite audience as " me and my dad watching the same thing together , watching Fawlty Towers and being able to laugh together " .
That is not to say that Linehan 's work is cosy or safe – quite the opposite .
His story of Moss , Roy and Jen , hidden away in the office basement and shunned by non -IT staff , manages to combine superb lines with great warmth for the characters .
IT people are " geniuses " , he says : " They 're working in offices and they 're barely noticed ; they 're tolerated because they do something that other people do n't really understand . "
His own obsession with technology is evident from his excited talk about a pen that records when it writes even before the interview begins , then midway through he takes out his iPad to demonstrate a brilliant app .
The third series of The IT crowd pulled in average ratings of 1.6 million viewers on Channel 4 and won a Bafta for best situation comedy .
The fourth series starts this Friday , with a fifth already confirmed .
Despite his earlier success , another sitcom had not been in Linehan 's plans following Father Ted and Black Books .
Instead , he was trying to write a film – admittedly without much success : " Basically if you 're trying to write films in England you might as well decide to hide for two years .
It 's just meetings with people who do n't really have any money but pretend they do . "
Meritocratic medium
So he was amenable when Channel 4 , the home of his previous hits , approached him .
He agreed to a new sitcom when he realised : " Wow .
If I do this I could have something on TV next year , " and found the idea for the show after calling a man to come round and fix his computer .
" My wife opened the door and instead of saying : ' Hello , I 'm here to see Graham ' , he just said : ' You 're not Graham ' .
Later , I asked him why there were n't more people doing this door - to - door IT stuff .
He replied : ' They do n't have the people skills . '
And I thought , OK – there 's a sitcom . "
The IT Crowd 's Moss , of course , would deliver those lines beautifully .
Played by Richard Ayoade , Moss is the ultimate geek – Linehan freely admits that " Moss was me when I was 14 , and Roy was me in my 30s " .
Which might explain Linehan 's emotional attachment to Moss : " We were shooting a scene where he was being bullied , and the kids who were bullying him really put their hearts into it .
And I looked at the monitor and burst into tears – I do n't know whether it was because I felt they were bullying Richard , or whether they were bullying Moss , but I felt really super - protective at that point . "
This season
The IT Crowd will feature extras sourced from Twitter – " they were brilliant , the best extras I 've ever worked with " – and Twitter will also play a part in recruiting talent for the show 's recently announced fifth series , for which he 's hoping to put together a writing team .
" Rather than them coming to me and asking for a job , I 'm tapping them on the shoulder and saying ' Listen , do you want to try this out ' , " he says .
" If people can spot talent rather than the talent having to come to us , then I think you might find that the quality of stuff goes up . "
Linehan is a great believer in the potential of Twitter both as a meritocratic medium in which new voices can be discovered and enjoyed , and as a social tool : " Facebook was just John the Baptist .
Twitter is the real deal . "
And he also has a faith in web users and filesharers as fundamentally honest , saying : " It 's probably not been the best thing for people to brand themselves as pirates … the image we should be concentrating on is sharing " – a view that informs his opinion that the media , music and film industries need to stop regarding filesharers as thieves , and accept that trying to patch up their current models is pointless .
Linehan 's argument that companies have got to stop trying to defeat filesharing and maintaining the status quo can be misunderstood .
" Someone the other day was introducing me to his wife , and he said ' Graham believes that newspapers should be free ' .
And I said ' No , no , no ' " .
So what does he mean ?
" That the current system is broken and everybody is pretending that it 's not .
Ca n't we talk about this and try and come up with something that is good for everyone ? "
The issue is not that filesharers just want everything for free , Linehan says , but that they want to cut out the marketing and promotional hype and judge things for themselves ; they want to circumvent the rules that say everybody should be buying a certain hyped album on a certain release day , or that things are released on different days in different territories , or that consumers can't buy music straight from those who make it .
Cyber-utopian
" With piracy , people think it 's about getting stuff for free , " he says .
" It 's not – it 's about getting rid of the middleman that stands between you and your enjoyment of the film or music . "
Linehan says he does n't advocate piracy : " But that 's the reason for it – companies have to meet people halfway .
I get contacted daily by people in America saying is there any legal way to download The IT Crowd , but the whole mechanism is too rigid to allow for things like that . "
A reluctance to really engage with the issue is not going to make it go away : " Consumers are n't going to put up with the old system , because it fucks them over too much . "
What Linehan does not have , however , is an answer as to what this new system might look like .
He admits it with good humour : " It feels like you 've bought a car and it 's not working properly .
And I can't fix the car but I can tell you when it 's fucking broken . "
It 's a slightly infuriating position , although not entirely without logic – at the heart of Linehan 's argument is the idea we need to throw out all preconceptions as to how these industries work , and create new ideas together .
He wants to start a conversation , rather than dictate the answers .
Yet he says : " The world at the moment seems to be divided into the people who get it and the people who do n't , and they 're the people making the laws . "
His position can seem a little at odds with his view of broadcasters .
If we 're no longer reliant on film companies or record companies to guide us to great content , do we still need television people telling us what to watch ?
" I think I would rather see commissioners with a really good sense of what people want , rather than always asking people what they want , " Linehan says .
" I want a captain who knows how to land the plane , I do n't want one who has to ask the passengers where he should land . "
There 's also the question of people pirating his content .
While he appears relaxed about people downloading The IT Crowd once it has aired , believing that the people who do so are often fans who will buy the DVD box set , Linehan would n't want the series to be leaked online ahead of broadcast : " I 'd hate that because they'd be ruining the experience of the show for themselves and others . "
So there is a balance to be struck between sharing because you 're a fan , and sharing because you do n't care about an artist 's work .
But Linehan is convinced that the positives of the web outbalance the negatives , that eventually it will become a meritocracy , uncovering talent that would otherwise stay hidden .
" You often get accused of being a cyber - utopian when you come up with this stuff , " he says .
" But I 'm not saying we can live in utopia , I 'm saying we could live somewhere just a little bit better . "

This is a captured " garbage truck " captured in Gaza earlier this year by Israeli troops .
The truck is set up to fire nine Kasem rockets and then drive off innocently .
The note pasted on the driver ?s door says - " In case of traffic violations , please contact The Palestinian Authority . "
The Israelis have evidence of ambulances and emergency vehicles set upthe same way .

Image caption Restrictions on cement has made reconstruction difficult in Gaza
Israel 's security cabinet has met to consider easing the blockade of Gaza , amid growing international pressure to end the embargo .
The cabinet is set to reconvene on Thursday after the meeting was adjourned without any decisions .
Israel 's policy on Gaza has come under scrutiny since its navy attacked a flotilla of ships attempting to deliver aid to Palestinians last month .
Meanwhile , the UN says Israel has agreed to let it distribute the aid .
New list
Israel 's security cabinet met to discuss how to ease restrictions on goods and materials allowed into Gaza .
The international Middle East Envoy , Tony Blair , has said that he was confident that Israeli leaders would agree to a partial lifting of the blockade .
GOODS ALLOWED INTO GAZA
Canned meat and tuna , but not canned fruit
Mineral water , but not fruit juice
Sesame paste ( tahini ) but not jam
Tea and coffee but not chocolate Guide : Gaza under blockade Q&A : Israeli raid on aid flotilla
Under a plan drawn up in co-ordination with Mr Blair , Israel could adopt a new list of banned items , rather than the current list of permitted goods , which critics claim is arbitrary .
Israel and Egypt tightened their blockade on Gaza after the Islamist Hamas movement took control of the Palestinian territory in 2007 .
Israel says the aim of the blockade is to prevent war material entering Gaza and to allow the entry of humanitarian aid .
But pressure has built on Israel to end the blockade since its troops shot and killed nine people on board a Turkish - backed vessel of an aid flotilla on 31 May .
The ships were attempting to break the naval blockade on Gaza by delivering 10,000 tonnes of aid to Gazans .
In a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday , EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said the blockade was counter - productive and needed to be lifted .
" The suffering of Gaza does n't make Israel more secure , " she said .
" This can not go on , things must change . "
Baroness Ashton called for the re-opening of the border crossings and the formulation of a " short agreed list of prohibited goods where Israel has legitimate security concerns " .
Aid delivery
On Tuesday , UN officials said that they had won Israel 's consent to deliver cargo from three of the aid ships to Gaza .
Israel agreed to release the cargo " on the understanding that it is for the United Nations to determine its appropriate humanitarian use in Gaza " , UN special co-ordinator Robert Serry said .
There was no comment from Hamas , which has refused to accept the aid for the past two weeks as a protest against Israel 's blockade of the territory .
Following the raid , Egypt opened its border with Gaza allowing people with valid passes to cross .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) has described the blockade as a clear violation of international humanitarian law .

An Idea for the RNC : Dump Steele , Hire Palin [ Kevin D. Williamson ]
Re : Steele and the RNC : Allow me to chime in with my usual observation on this subject :
This is a job for Sarah Palin .
Palin would be a much better RNC chairman than presidential candidate or freelance kingmaker .
She ’d raise tons of money and help recruit good candidates , i.e. , she ’d excel at doing the things Steele should have been doing instead of appointing himself Republican pundit - at - large .
A Chairman Palin would help set the right tone for the Republican party without having to get herself entangled in the minutiae of policy - development , which has not been her forte .
Sure , she ’d be polarizing , but so is Barack Obama , and these are polarized times .
And it ’s one thing to have a polarizing party chairman , another to have a polarizing candidate .
Anybody disagree ?
Political comedians everywhere will scream their delight .
As one comment put it : “ Oh please oh please oh please oh please oh please oh please oh please oh please ” .
UPDATE : NPR has a longer article about Michael Steele ’s troubles , and other supporters wanting to replace him with Sarah Palin .
Here ’s another right - wing blog that likes the idea :
The Israeli government announced some changes to its widely condemned blockade of Gaza last week .
It said it would allow potato chips , jam , biscuits , canned fruit , packaged hummus , halva , soft drinks , juice and shaving razors to be imported into Gaza , along with possible additional food items such as coriander and cardamom ( both basic Middle Eastern condiments ) , and cookies .
This was greeted with scorn by Palestinian officials .
“ They will send the first course .
We are waiting for the main course , ” Palestinian Economy Minister Hassan Abu Libdeh said in Ramallah , in the West Bank .
“ We are waiting for this unjust siege to end . ”
The Israeli authorities ’ move seems likely to further undermine their claim that the blockade has only been aimed at keeping potential rocket and bomb material out of the hands of terrorists in Haza .
Potato chips and hummus ?
But it indicates the difficulty Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s right - wing government is having in figuring out how to deal with growing world pressure , including from the White House , to end the blockade .
Israel is planning another adjustment , according to Ori Nir of Americans for Peace Now : instead of listing items that are approved for importation into Gaza , Israel will only list unapproved items .
That is hardly likely to deflect the pressure for fundamental change .
The Israeli nongovernmental organization Gisha : Legal Center for Freedom of Movement said it was “ pleased to learn that coriander no longer presents a threat to Israeli security . ”
“ However , ” the group said , “ Israel continues to prevent the transfer of purely civilian goods , such as fabrics , fishing rods , and food wrappers , as part of what it calls “ economic warfare ” aimed at crippling Gaza ’s economy .
In doing so , it denies 1.5 million human beings the right to engage in productive , dignified work .
“ It is not enough to permit Gaza residents to purchase Israeli - made cookies .
Israel should stop banning raw materials such as industrial margarine and glucose , so that Gaza residents can produce their own cookies and restart the economy that has been paralyzed for three years .
“ International law requires Israel to allow the free passage of goods and people into and out of the Gaza Strip , subject only to individual security checks . ”
Nir reports that , according to Israel Radio , the Israeli cabinet is looking into easing the land blockade while maintaining the sea blockade .
Others say Israel is considering tightening the land blockade but easing the naval one .
Another radio report says Israel will lift the blockade in coordination with the European Union .
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad called for Gaza ’s borders to be opened immediately in accord with a 2005 agreement that would restore a role for the West Bank - based Palestinian government in managing the crossings .
Fayyad told Reuters this would help reunify the West Bank and Gaza .
“ Reopening the crossings actually creates a much better environment for reuniting the country and the Palestinian institutions with it , ” he said .
Fayyad warned against any Israeli actions that would further split Gaza from the West Bank .
“ If the approach of reopening Gaza focuses on , let ’s say , … exclusively maritime traffic , I see a serious risk of that putting us in a situation where we end up having Gaza as a stand - alone entity , ” Fayyad told Reuters at his Ramallah office .
“ That is extremely dangerous from a political point of view , given our objective of ending the Israeli occupation and having a state of Palestine emerge from the territories occupied in 1967 , ” Fayyad said .
Meanwhile , as many as 10 ships may be heading toward Gaza seeking to break the Israeli blockade in the coming months .
They include a ship from Lebanon and one or more from Iran – sure to be seen as a provocation by the Israeli government – expected to arrive shortly .
The Lebanese ship is expected to have on board dozens of journalists and European activists including members of parliament .
The Iranian ship or ships are said to be carrying humanitarian aid collected by the Iranian Red Crescent .
The head of Israel ’s Shin Bet security / intelligence agency , Yuval Diskin , declared Tuesday that Gaza is not in a humanitarian crisis .
But the International Red Cross and the British aid group Oxfam both issued statements this week saying the blockade has created an economic and human disaster for Gaza ’s 1.5 million inhabitants .
The two groups said the blockade amounts to collective punishment of civilians , a violation of international law .
Interviewed on bitterlemons.org , Eyad Sarraj , a Gaza psychiatrist who heads the Gaza Community Mental Health Program , said , “ I invite any Israeli to come and live in a refugee camp here and watch his father be unable to find work and provide for his family .
I will go and live in Tel Aviv in the meantime .
If Netanyahu finds that conditions here are so good , he can come and stay here . ”

SP : Was coming out publicly as gay ever a real dilemma for you ?
RB : Not so much whether or not to do it — my mind was made up on that for a long time : pretty much from the beginning of going out on tour in 2007 .
But when and what context would make the most sense in terms of press– that was certainly something I thought about .
SP : Some high profile people who are still closeted believe that coming out might negatively affect their careers .
Did you ever thing this might happen to you ?
RB : I think the world is changing everyday .
Friends
I have that are just five years younger than me I 'm noticing have grown up in a less homophobic environment than I did .
In December we did a cover shoot for the magazine Time Out NY that was sponsored by the NHL .
We were wearing official hockey uniforms .
Are there any out members of the NHL ?
It was something that crossed my mind .
At that point in time I had talked about being gay in an interview for a profile in Rolling Stone , however that article would n't be on newsstands for a few weeks .
Truth be told I do n't think coming out has effected my career in a negative way .
I would hope that anyone who is deliberately closeted imagines a time when they will eventually come out .
SP : Your brother took you to see the movie Cruel Intentions as a 14 - year old .
You tweeted : " Looking back on it this is one of my favorite memories from high school .
He really saved me from a lot of stress . "
What was so great about it ?
RB : Something minor like a school dance can be a source of stress when you 're a high schooler .
You do n't have much of a sense of perspective .
My brother taking me to see that movie on a night where I would have otherwise felt like a complete outsider , I think it was a source of escapism .
And I think maybe that film being set in New York had something to do with it .
I 'm realizing more and more that I had my heart set on moving to New York from a pretty early age .
SP : How has success changed your relationship with your fellow Vampire Weekend band mates ?
RB : Being successful enough to afford our own hotel rooms when we 're on tour was a big step .
Everyone needs their alone time and on those early tours we were often four to a room so we did n't have that .
Making our first record so much happened organically and unconsciously .
Looking back on the making of the two records I think that ' success ' might have made us put our own methods under a microscope .
But ultimately the songs on the two records came together in similar ways .
A lot of work from the four of us in a room playing together and a lot of work from Ezra and I working together in front of an upright piano or in front of a computer .
SP : How did Discovery , your side project with Ra Ra Riot 's frontman Wes Miles , begin ?
RB : Wes and I started making music together one summer .
He approached me because we'd met through Ezra .
Wes was working as a kayaking instructor , I was interning at the OED .
Over the course of that year I had been getting interested in this genre Crunk and at the end of my internship I actually ended up defining that word for the dictionary .
If you look it up it should be credited to RXB2005 , " x " because I do n't have a middle name .
I downloaded a collection of 808 drum machine samples and I taught myself how to build the kind of synth sounds that I was hearing in Lil Jon 's music .
I was curious to see if I could write pop songs for myself to sing that were using the template of crunk as a starting point .
At the same time I had this idea of producing a solo EP for Wes that would be called " My Name is Wesley " – each song would feel like it came out of a different decade .
By the next summer we found ourselves committed to our respective bands so it made sense to pool our resources and cross pollinate the two projects , out of that came Discovery .
So Insane was supposed to have a 70s vibe .
Can You Discover ?
was at one point a surfy , sixties love song .
These songs went through different phases and revisions .
Our roles reversed when it came time for me to record vocals , Wes was serving as my producer .
And in the end some songs have us trading vocals back and forth .
SP : You told Out Magazine that you intended Discovery ' s song “ I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend ” to be a gay anthem .
Can we expect any gay themed songs in an upcoming Vampire Weekend album ?
RB : Well there 's Diplomat 's Son on Contra .
Who knows what the future holds .
I have started working on a song about a boy named Rudy .
I get a feeling his story needs to be told over the course of a bunch of songs .
I 'm not sure if they 'll exist in VW world or what .
SP : What are you currently listening to these days ?
RB : Bruce
Springsteen , Francis and the Lights , I think the new MGMT record is
great .
SP : How does it feel to be included in Advocate 's " 40 under 40 ? "
RB : I 'm pumped to learn more about the other people in that issue .
I was definitely honored to be in there .
I 'm turning 27 in November and there 's so much I 'd like to accomplish in terms of effecting change .
SP : Just we all get it right , how do you correctly pronounce your last name ?
RB : If you want to do it up right you would say : BOTT – MONN – GHEL – EECH .
The ' gh ' is a sound you do n't have in English , it 's similar to the R in French because it comes from the back of the throat .
In the 80s my parents simplified the spelling of our name , and I 'm grateful for that .
Any considered attempt at a phonetic pronunciation of " Batmanglij " is cool with me .

Jaw - dropping evidence has surfaced that suggests BP ’s Deepwater Horizon ’s top managers knew of problems with the rig before it exploded last month — a disaster at the heart of what has become the worst oil spill in American history , according to a new bombshell report .
Tony Buzbee , a Texas - based lawyer representing rig workers and fisherman , claims to have obtained a three - page statement from a crew member on the boat that rescued the burning rig ’s workers .
Buzbee told motherjones.com that the sailor , who he does not name , was on the ship ’s bridge when Deepwater Horizon installation manager Jimmy Harrell was speaking with someone in Houston on a satellite phone .
Buzbee said Harrell shouted , “ Are you f–king happy ?
Are you f–ing happy ?
The rig ’s on fire !
I told you this was gonna happen , ” according to motherjones.com .
Other rig workers have claimed that they were pressured by BP and their supervisors to cut corners .
Buzbee said his lawsuit will be his biggest ever .
“ It ’s the grandaddy of all cases .
This is going to define BP and whether BP survives , ” he said .
“ This is going to be the biggest case in the history of the United States , no doubt about it . ”
This comes as the cap placed over the broken wellhead at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico is collecting more gushing crude day by day — but that ’s about the extent of the details known as authorities try to pinpoint how much oil is escaping .
The cap on the stricken BP wellhead is helping to limit the leak , collecting more than 620,000 gallons of oil Monday , Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen said today in Washington .
Still , underwater video feeds continue to show a dark geyser .
“ I have never said this is going well , ” said Allen , who ’s monitoring the response effort for the government .
“ We ’re throwing everything at it that we ’ve got .
I ’ve said time and time again that nothing good happens when oil is on the water . ”
Authorities had earlier reported that the cap collected around 460,000 gallons Sunday and that it was capturing anywhere from a third to three - quarters of the oil spewing out after a damaged riser pipe was cut as part of the containment effort , increasing the flow as a side effect .
Meanwhile , a member of the Coast Guard team that ’s trying to determine how much oil is still leaking said it ’s possible that estimates the team will generate could be a bit higher than current government estimates .
The team member , University of Texas engineering professor Paul Bommer , said he understands why people might wonder why BP did n’t try the cap sooner , especially now that it appears to be doing its job .
“ Hindsight is always 20 / 20 , ” Bommer said .
“ I think we have to give some credence to the notion they were trying to make things better without making things worse . ”

Teller was a high school Latin teacher who did magic in his spare time .
It had gripped him with the force of an obsession since , as a five year - old laid up at home with a heart ailment , he had sent away “ 15 cents and three Mars bar wrappers ” for a magic kit advertised on television .
Penn was a student and a juggler with a fierce distaste for magicians .
“ Early on , Teller said to me that magic was essentially an intellectual art form which , when you picture the kind of dips ---s that do magic , sounds like an insane thing to say , ” he says .
“ Can you do magic without insulting the audience ?
Can you do magic that is intellectually satisfying ?
It is those questions , rather than the magic itself , that fascinates me .
Those are the question that we have been playing with for 35 years . ”
The ‘ Save Vui Kong ’ campaign aims for 100,000 signatures by Aug 23 to support a petition requesting clemency for Yong Vui Kong , a Malaysian who is on death row for drug trafficking in Singapore .
Some 2,000 signatures have been collected since the drive was launched two days ago in support of the 22 - year - old from Sandakan , Sabah .
Campaign coordinator Ngeow Chow Ying said the campaigners hope that all 222 members of parliament , 69 senators and 60 Sabah state assemblypersons will count themselves among the signatories .
“ We have prepared a card for them to sign and mail back using a stamped self - addressed envelope by ( July 31 ) , ” she told a press conference in Parliament House today .
The campaign is co-sponsored by the civil rights committee of the Kuala Lumpur - Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall and human rights NGO Suaram .
“ Concerned state assemblypersons from other states are also welcome to join in .
We will then present these personal plea cards together to the Istana - the Office of the President of Singapore . ”
Ngeow stressed that , contrary to what Singaporean authorities have said , clemency for Yong would be a boon for the city - state ’s anti-drugs campaign , as it would prove that wayward youths can be rehabilitated .
“ Vui Kong is a completely changed person after his arrest .
He has found his spiritual salvation in Buddhism and has vowed to use his remaining days to counsel lost souls like he once was and to campaign against drug trafficking and drug abuse .
“ He will do whatever he can to get his message of regret and redemption out to many young lives and save them from drugs .
A second chance for Vui Kong is therefore also second chance for many out there . ”
‘ Minister overstepped authority '
Singapore law minister K Shanmugam had previously been quoted by local media as saying that granting Yong clemency would “ seriously undermine ” the city - state ’s anti-drug policies .
“ We ( would be ) sending a signal to all drug barons out there : Just make sure to choose a victim who is your or a mother of a young child and use them as the people to carry the drugs into Singapore , ” he was quoted as saying .
Tunku Abdul Aziz , who was among four Pakatan Rakyat senators at the press conference , decried Shanmugam ’s statement , saying it has done damage to Yong ’s chances of getting clemency from the president of Singapore .
“ This is a case where a minister oversteps his authority .
He should allow the appeal to go through .
The comment is totally unhelpful , ” said Tunku Abdul Aziz .
“ I really hope the Singapore government , in its wisdom , will take into account the points we ( have ) raised , as well as the online petition . ”
The signatures must be submitted to Singapore president Sellapan Ramanathan before the deadline for Yong ’s clemency plea expires on Aug 26 .
Poverty cited
Yong ’s story is one of tragic youth as he fought his way out of a difficult childhood only to face the gallows for transporting a gift to a client of his “ big brother ” from Malaysia to Singapore .
The gift turned out to be 47gm of heroin .
He was only 18 years and 6 months old when arrested on June 13 , 2007 at a hotel in Singapore for having the drug in his possession .
Raised in a broken home , Yong was forced into back - breaking manual labour when only 12 , moving oil palm fruit on his grandfather ’s estate , as his mother could not support her six children on her meagre salary as a dishwasher .
Their poverty was also the reason why he did not complete his Year 6 education .
When he turned 15 , Yong moved to Kota Kinabalu in search of better opportunities to help his mother , who suffers from chronic depression .
While there , he realised the potential for even greater opportunities by moving to Kuala Lumpur , which he did after saving up enough money .
Arriving with just the shirt on his back , Yong worked at odd jobs - in the process , getting to know “ friends ” in secret societies .
The situation back home did not get better , especially after one of his sisters was involved in an accident .
The trauma pushed his mother over the edge and she attempted suicide .
The last time he was with his family was during a short holiday to celebrate his mother ’s birthday in Sandakan between May and June 2007 , before a “ friend ” in Kuala Lumpur made him an offer he could not refuse .
Given the promise of a big payout for simply delivering a “ gift ” , he took up the offer in the hope that he could finally help his ailing mother .
He was arrested and charged with drug trafficking .
The Singapore courts found him guilty and sentenced him to death on Jan 7 , 2009 .
His mother still does not know about his sentence , as family members fear that she will not be able to handle the shock .
A new survey out today says more American voters want an immigration law in their own state that 's similar to the controversial one adopted by Arizona .
The non-partisan Quinnipiac University Poll shows American voters say by 48%- 35 % that they want an immigration law like the one in Arizona , which requires law enforcement officials to ask someone 's legal status if there is " reasonable suspicion " to believe the person is in the USA illegally .
President Obama has condemned the Arizona law and the Justice Department is exploring legal challenges .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has said her state had to act because the federal government has failed to pass a comprehensive immigration law and help Arizona close its porous border .
" The Arizona immigration law has emerged as a major divide in the country , but the numbers are on the side of those supporting it , " said Peter Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
He predicted the Arizona law would be a factor in the November elections .
The survey also found that a majority of voters approve of the Arizona law , while 45 % think it will reduce illegal immigration .
Voters 18 to 34 said they were opposed to an Arizona - style law in their state , by 43% - 36 % , while a majority of voters over 35 supported such a measure .
Three out of four voters also say plans to boycott Arizona over the law are a bad idea .
Hundreds of people protested the law yesterday outside of Dodger Stadium ( see picture above ) , where the Los Angeles Dodgers were playing the Arizona Diamondbacks .
Some baseball fans want the Dodgers to move their spring training facility out of Arizona , and Adrian Gonzalez of the San Diego Padres has said he would boycott next summer 's All - Star Game in Phoenix if he is chosen to play .
The survey of 1,914 registered voters nationwide was conducted May 19 - 24 .
It has a margin of error of +/- 2.2 percentage points .

An ad featuring members of the Brisbane Broncos helping out in sponsor NRMA ’s office has been banned – because player Sam Thaiday is featured pinching chocolate bars from a vending machine .
The NRMA ad , created by the agency Human , was launched at the beginning of May .
But viewers objected to the behaviour of the league players .
One vending machine owner complained to the Advertising Standards Board : “ Why would they show stealing using so called children ’ role models such a Thiaday .
I own vending machines theft of product is always a concern . ”
The NRMA claimed that Thaiday had already paid for the chocolate , saying : “ The humour of the Advertisement is to show in a light hearted manner that the Broncos players are a bit out of place in a typical office environment due to their size , strength and inexperience .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In one scene , Sam Thaiday is shown jiggling a vending machine to dislodge a chocolate bar that he had purchased which had become stuck .
Consistent with the humour of the Advertisement , this action causes numerous chocolate bars to fall out of the machine because of Sam ’s size and strength . ”
However , the ASB ruled : “ The Board considered that there is no suggestion that the player has not paid for one of the products and that there is not necessarily a suggestion of theft .
However the Board noted it would not be the case that the man would have paid for the number of product that fell from the machine and that therefore there is a depiction or suggestion of theft . ”
And it added : “ The image of the man shaking the machine from the top is a depiction of an activity that can cause injury . ”
July 12 Update : NRMA
Insurance issued a statement saying :
Salt Lake City , Utah ( CNN ) --
The executioner says he was eager to join the firing squad .
Not because he was familiar with the 1996 case , or felt the need to deliver justice for a raped and murdered little girl .
It was n't even because his high school classmate was raped and killed just before graduation .
So why did he do it ?
Why choose to join four other men in executing a convicted murderer ?
" How often does this come along ? " he says , " ... 100 percent justice . "
It 's been more than 14 years since guns were last fired in Utah 's execution chamber .
But later this month , they may sound again , reviving a debate about the death penalty and the methods used to carry it out .
The one - time executioner met a CNN reporter in a Salt Lake City restaurant Tuesday to talk about his former role as Utah prepares to put Ronnie Lee Gardner before a firing squad June 18 .
Gardner was convicted of killing attorney Michael Burdell in 1985 during an attempted escape from custody at a Salt Lake City courthouse , where he was appearing for a pre-trial hearing in connection with another murder .
On Thursday , he will go before the state Board of Pardons and Parole in an effort to have his death penalty commuted .
The former firing squad member asked not to be named , as he remains a law enforcement officer in the state .
The man he helped execute , John Albert Taylor , was sentenced to death for killing an 11 - year - old girl in 1989 .
Charla Nicole King had been sexually assaulted .
A telephone cord was wrapped around her neck -- three times , her mother told authorities .
She knew because she counted as she unwound it , trying to revive her daughter
The officer agreed to recount his experience because he believes in the death penalty -- and thinks the firing squad method is plagued by misconceptions .
It is not like the scenes depicted in movies , with a condemned man tied to a stake and smoking a last cigarette before being riddled with bullets in a gruesome spectacle .
Instead , he says over coffee , toast with grape jelly and an omelet , the process is instantaneous and carried out with the utmost professionalism .
" It was anti-climactic , " he says .
" Another day at the office . "
He has brought with him a stack of photos from Taylor 's autopsy , including one of the man 's heart , blown into three pieces .
Does he have any lingering effects from his role in the execution ?
" I 've shot squirrels I 've felt worse about , " he says .
He volunteered to participate , he said , and would do so again , given the opportunity .
" There 's just some people , " he says , " we need to kick off the planet . "
The officer remembers feeling a sense of responsibility that day , as he awaited the countdown to fire at Taylor , strapped into a chair 17 feet away with a target pinned to his chest .
He remembers telling himself , " Do n't ( expletive ) this up . "
The five men selected for the firing squad had been given a month to prepare .
They practiced their shooting in the execution chamber .
On the day of the execution , four of the five were armed with live rounds .
The fifth received an " ineffective " round that , unlike a blank , delivers the same recoil as a live round .
No one knew who had the ineffective round .
Two alternate marksmen were on standby -- one to replace an officer who loses his nerve ( none did ) and a second to replace the alternate .
At the designated time , the five fired simultaneously .
Only one shot was heard .
" They do n't want to hear five shots , " the officer said .
The former executioner has brought someone with him to the interview : Chris Zimmerman , once the police chief in Roy , Utah , who investigated the King slaying , interrogated Taylor , arrested him and witnessed his execution .
Zimmerman recalls seeing Taylor clench his fists as a reflex .
His chest rose , and then sunk .
" The process was not gruesomely bloody , nor was it slow .
" We were there , and it 's not that way , " the officer said .
He remembers getting home at 3 a.m. --
Utah executions are conducted just after midnight .
Five hours later , he was kicking in a door to serve a search warrant .
A coworker who recently had struggled after shooting a suspect approached him to make sure he was OK , the officer said .
But a police shooting , where an officer must make a split - second decision , is " a whole different world , " he said .
" I 'm going .... ' Look , man , this is nothing like what you went through . '
" I do not want to downplay in any way what real cops do in real shootings . "
Zimmerman points out that an officer who saw Taylor running from the murder scene with a gun and shot him would have been considered a hero .
" Both ways , we killed him , " he said .
He remembers King 's mother telling investigators of finding her daughter 's body and trying to resuscitate her before realizing it was fruitless , gently unwrapping the cord from the girl 's neck .
" That woman has to live with that the rest of her life , and John Albert Taylor was put to death in seconds , " Zimmerman said .
The officer points out that both Gardner and another death - row inmate in Utah , Troy Kell , were already in custody when they killed again .
Gardner was charged with killing bartender Melvyn Otterstrom in October 1984 ; Kell was serving time for murder when he killed another inmate in a Utah prison .
No one executed for their crime , the officer points out , has ever killed again .
" It seems to be quite effective , " he says .
" Nobody 's heard from Gary Gilmore , " the first person executed after the Supreme Court lifted a ban on capital punishment in 1976 .
Gilmore died by firing squad at the Utah State Prison in 1977 .
" You 'll notice this did n't take two and a half hours , " he says , referring to a recent execution in Ohio , where personnel had trouble finding a vein on an inmate to administer a lethal injection .
" The death penalty , " the officer says , " is nothing more than sending a defective product back to the manufacturer .
Let him fix it . "
Asked about the arguments against the death penalty -- that one race receives it disproportionately , that the poor are more likely to wind up on death row -- the officer discounts them as procedural issues that should be fixed in the courts , not the execution chamber .
As soon as the death penalty is discarded , he believes , those same arguments will be turned against the alternative -- life in prison without the possibility of parole .
And , he and Zimmerman say , polls show that most Americans support the death penalty .
" The pulse of America is , ' Look , we 're tired of this stuff , ' " the officer says .
Utah was given permission to use the firing squad as a method of execution by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879 , according to the Death Penalty Information Center , a non-profit organization .
Although one other state -- Oklahoma -- currently allows firing squad as a secondary method of execution , it can be used only if lethal injection and electrocution are ruled unconstitutional .
Firing squads are still in use in other countries ; according to the Capital Punishment UK website , they are steadily declining .
The site says there were 30 such executions worldwide in 2007 -- 15 in Afghanistan , one each in Belarus , Ethiopia , Indonesia and North Korea , three in Somalia and eight in Yemen .
Some provinces in China are also thought to use the method .
Utah lawmakers outlawed the firing squad in 2004 , but a handful of death - row inmates who had already chosen it as their execution method were grandfathered in after family members of murder victims begged the state Legislature not to open another door for appeals , lengthening what in many cases has become at least a 20 - year wait for justice .
" The appeals process is a little out of control , " the officer said .
" Get it done in a couple of years and move on . "
Asked about cases in which people are freed from prison after being proved innocent , the officer says he doubts there have been innocent people executed since 1976 .
It 's hard to convict someone and put them on death row , he says , and it 's harder to keep them there through numerous appeals .
That process minimizes the risk of the innocent being executed , he says .
Taylor 's death , the officer says , was a homicide in that it came at the hands of others .
But it was not murder , he maintains , and the death penalty " needs to be used more often . "
" I have n't lost three seconds of sleep over it , " he says .
" ... it 's true justice . "
Chain e-mail hoax
The account of the JATO Rocket Car was one of the original Darwin Awards winners : a man who supposedly met his death in a spectacular manner after mounting a JATO unit ( a rocket engine used to help heavy aircraft to take off ) onto an ordinary automobile .
It was originally circulated as a forwarded email .
In 1996 , after numerous inquires , the Arizona Department of Public Safety issued a news release posted on their website concerning the story .
It termed the story " an Arizona myth . "
The story was also debunked in 2003 on the pilot episode of MythBusters , titled " Jet Assisted Chevy " .
It may have been debunked for this particular car , but in the 1980 ’s , an aircraft accident report was created for an event such as this .
Classified as an aircraft due to the solid rocket booster attached to the car , the car reached massively high speeds and did n’t have enough roadway , hitting a rock base at the end of a curve .
The driver applied brakes , which instantly melted off .
Check the reports from around 1981 - 1983 .
Usenet posting [ edit ]
This is the text as it appears , possibly most frequently , in usenet repostings :
You all know about the Darwin Awards – it's the annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way .
Last year 's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it .
And this year 's nominee is :
The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve .
the wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash , but it was a car .
The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene .
The lab finally figured out what it was and what had happened .
It seems that a guy had somehow gotten hold of a JATO unit ( Jet Assisted Take Off – actually a solid fuel rocket ) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra ' push ' for taking off from short airfields .
He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert and found a long , straight stretch of road .
Then he attached the JATO unit to his car , jumped in , got up some speed and fired off the JATO !
The facts , as best could be determined , are that the operator of the 1967 Impala hit JATO ignition at a distance of approximately 3.0 miles [ 4.8 kilometers ] from the crash site .
This was established by the prominent scorched and melted asphalt at that location .
The JATO , if operating properly , would have reached maximum thrust within five seconds , causing the Chevy to reach speeds well in excess of 350 MPH [ 560 km/h ] , continuing at full power for an additional 20 – 25 seconds .
The driver , soon to be pilot , most likely would have experienced G - forces usually reserved for dog- fighting F - 14 jocks under full afterburners , basically causing him to become insignificant for the remainder of the event .
However , the automobile remained on the straight highway for about 2.5 miles [ 4.0 km ] ( 15 –20 seconds ) before the driver applied and completely melted the brakes , blowing the tires and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface , then becoming airborne for an additional 1.4 miles [ 2.3 km ] and impacting the cliff face at a height of 125 feet [ 38 m ] , leaving a blackened crater 3 feet [ 0.9 m ] deep in the rock .
Most of the driver 's remains were not recoverable ; however , small fragments of bone , teeth and hair were extracted from the crater , and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel .
History [ edit ]
The original Darwin Awards were fictitious .
Both were contained in a 1990 Version[ citation needed ] [ 1 ] posted to rec.models .rockets of the JATO Rocket Car urban legend .
When this urban legend was debunked , it was specifically pointed out that the mentioned Darwin Awards were fictitious .
It contained a reference to the 1985 mention of a Vending Machine Tipover Darwin Award .
It was Paul Vixie who wrote this introduction to the JATO urban legend that first included the term " Darwin Award " .
Vixie credits Charles Haynes with making the ( informal ) Darwin Award Nomination , but it was Vixie 's specific wording , with the first sentence crediting Haynes stripped off , that was actually circulated and actually referred to the Darwin Awards as if they actually existed and were common knowledge , though the message was n't widely circulated until it was reformatted .
It remained fairly dormant until 1995 , when the message surfaced again [ 2 ] [ citation needed ] in rec.pyrotechnics with the email header stripped off the introduction , though the main story is still indented .
Three days later [ 3 ] the introduction is fully integrated into the story and it appeared on rec.humor in a form that made it a truly infectious meme .
Shortly after it was reposted in 1995 it quickly began to spread , being posted on Usenet 24 times within the next month .
In 1996 the legend was further embellished with references to the year of manufacture of the car and G - Forces and to the form which was widely circulated via email ( 55 % of all postings on usenet which included " JATO Rocket Darwin Award impala " also included " g- forces " . [ 4 ]
Cult of the Dead Cow , a hacker group and ezine , published an extensive elaboration in 1998 that claims to explain how the story came into being , describing the most common details of the Rocket Car legend .
Four males under 25 engaged in scouting , welding , drinking , and Rube Goldberg engineering to build a rocket rail car after they happened upon JATOs in a junk pile .
Supposed author CarInTheCliff also describes the car 's only test plus the elements he has added while discouraging repeats by example .
In this account it is also claimed that the story had first circulated long before 1990 . [ 5 ]
The Darwin Awards meme was also spread by Wendy Northcutt , who collected the Darwin Awards on a public website in 1993 , and circulated new stories in a regular newsletter . [ 6 ]
The MythBusters investigation [ edit ]
To test the story – the very first myth they tackled – Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage , with help from honorary MythBuster Erik Gates , procured a 1966 Chevrolet Impala , and after they were unable to obtain actual JATOs , they substituted three model rockets in succession to produce an equivalent amount of thrust ( 3000 horsepower for 15 seconds ) .
They also installed a rocket rack and reinforced the car so that the rockets would not tear off the roof , and even made use of a hydraulic system that the previous owner had installed on the car to lower the front of the car and make it more aerodynamic .
However , when tested in the Mojave Desert , the car did not go anywhere near the 300 miles per hour ( 480 km / h ) reported in the original story , and failed to become airborne .
The program has revisited the story twice , in 2007 's " Supersized Myths " ( the rockets exploded on the ramp ) and their 10th Anniversary episode " JATO Rocket Car : Mission Accomplished ? " .
The 12 motors were built by John Newman , Rick Maschek , and others with one motor first being static tested , successfully , at the FAR site ( Friends of Amateur Rocketry ) to avoid another ' Episode 90 ' incident .
On the two cars used , the motors were stacked vertically to keep the cars going straight in the event one or more of the motors did not ignite .
The car was weighted towards the front in an attempt to improve its aerodynamic stability but no attempt was made to ensure the center of thrust ( CoT ) of the rocket pack was being applied through the center of gravity ( CoG ) of the car .
The CoT proved to be far too high above the CoG causing the car to immediately nosedive as it left the ramp and smash into the ground .
The still firing motors propelled the car up into the air a second time where it did a rotation until smashing into the ground .
Dodge Coronet TV ad [ edit ]
To advertise the stopping power ( rather than speed ) of the 1958 Dodge Coronet 's ' total contact ' brakes , a JATO bottle was fitted to a Coronet and it was driven at speed across the El Mirage dry lake .
This commercial was broadcast during the Dodge - sponsored Lawrence Welk Show . [ 7 ]

Chemical reaction occurring when baking
The crusts of most breads , such as this brioche , are golden - brown due to the Maillard reaction .
Effects of the Maillard reaction on a starch - rich material ( potato slice ) .
The substrate is shown before ( left ) and after ( right ) being exposed to hot dry air ( 503 K , approx .
230 °C /445 °F ) .
The Maillard reaction ( my - YAR ; French : [ majaʁ ] ) is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its distinctive flavor .
Seared steaks , fried dumplings , cookies and other kinds of biscuits , breads , toasted marshmallows , and many other foods undergo this reaction .
It is named after French chemist Louis - Camille Maillard , who first described it in 1912 while attempting to reproduce biological protein synthesis . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The reaction is a form of non-enzymatic browning which typically proceeds rapidly from around 140 to 165 °C ( 280 to 330 °F ) .
Many recipes call for an oven temperature high enough to ensure that a Maillard reaction occurs .
[ 3 ]
At higher temperatures , caramelization ( the browning of sugars , a distinct process ) and subsequently pyrolysis ( final breakdown leading to burning ) become more pronounced .
The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the nucleophilic amino group of the amino acid , and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of aromas and flavors .
This process is accelerated in an alkaline environment ( e.g. , lye applied to darken pretzels ; see lye roll ) , as the amino groups ( RNH 3 + → RNH 2 ) are deprotonated , and hence have an increased nucleophilicity .
This reaction is the basis for many of the flavoring industry 's recipes .
At high temperatures , a probable [ 4 ] carcinogen called acrylamide can form . [ 5 ]
This can be discouraged by heating at a lower temperature , adding asparaginase , or injecting carbon dioxide . [ 4 ]
In the cooking process , Maillard reactions can produce hundreds of different flavor compounds depending on the chemical constituents in the food , the temperature , the cooking time , and the presence of air .
These compounds , in turn , often break down to form yet more new flavor compounds .
Flavor scientists have used the Maillard reaction over the years to make artificial flavors .
History [ edit ]
In 1912 , Maillard published a paper describing the reaction between amino acids and sugars at elevated temperatures .
[ 1 ]
In 1953 , chemist John E. Hodge , with the U.S. Department of Agriculture , established a mechanism for the Maillard reaction . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]
Foods and products with Maillard reactions [ edit ]
The Maillard reaction is responsible for many colors and flavors in foods , such as the browning of various meats when seared or grilled , the browning and umami taste in fried onions , and coffee roasting .
It contributes to the darkened crust of baked goods , the golden - brown color of French fries and other crisps , of malted barley as found in malt whiskey and beer , and the color and taste of dried and condensed milk , dulce de leche , the Sri Lankan confection milk toffee , black garlic , chocolate , toasted marshmallows , and roasted peanuts .
6 - Acetyl -2,3,4,5- tetrahydropyridine is responsible for the biscuit or cracker - like flavor present in baked goods such as bread , popcorn , and tortilla products .
The structurally related compound 2 - acetyl - 1 - pyrroline has a similar smell , and also occurs naturally without heating and gives varieties of cooked rice and the herb pandan ( Pandanus amaryllifolius ) their typical smells .
Both compounds have odor thresholds below 0.06 ng/l . [ 8 ]
Roast pork , browned using the Maillard reaction
[ 5 ]
The preparation of French fries at high temperature can lead to the formation of acrylamide
The browning reactions that occur when meat is roasted or seared are complex , and occur mostly by Maillard browning [ 9 ] with contributions from other chemical reactions , including the breakdown of the tetrapyrrole rings of the muscle protein myoglobin .
Caramelization is an entirely different process from Maillard browning , though the results of the two processes are sometimes similar to the naked eye ( and taste buds ) .
Caramelization may sometimes cause browning in the same foods in which the Maillard reaction occurs , but the two processes are distinct .
They are both promoted by heating , but the Maillard reaction involves amino acids , as discussed above , whereas caramelization is simply the pyrolysis of certain sugars .
Maillard reactions also occur in dried fruit . [ 10 ]
In making silage , excess heat causes the Maillard reaction to occur , which reduces the amount of energy and protein available to the animals that feed on it .
Chemical mechanism [ edit ]
The carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the amino group of the amino acid , producing N - substituted glycosylamine and water
The unstable glycosylamine undergoes Amadori rearrangement , forming ketosamines Several ways are known for the ketosamines to react further : Produce two water molecules and reductones
Diacetyl , pyruvaldehyde , and other short - chain hydrolytic fission products can be formed .
Produce brown nitrogenous polymers and melanoidins
The open - chain Amadori products undergo further dehydration and deamination to produce dicarbonyls . [ 11 ]
This is a crucial intermediate .
Dicarbonyls react with amines to produce Strecker aldehydes through Strecker degradation . [ 12 ]
Acrylamide , a possible human carcinogen , [ 13 ] can be generated as a byproduct of Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids , especially asparagine , both of which are present in most food products . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]

Prison Profiteering
WA taxpayers pay a million to imprison a man who stole $ 151
Meanwhile privatization and budget cutbacks create playgrounds for rapists and huge social costs for the future

" For 16 months , children in the care of the Texas Youth Commission ( TYC ) were [ allegedly ] molested by two employees , Ray Brookins and John Paul Hernandez .
The boys tried to tell members of the staff and also the TYC officials , by letter and through the school 's grievance system .
They did so knowing that they could be retaliated against by certain staff but their pleas were ignored by the TYC ....
In 2005 the boys approached a volunteer math tutor who called the Texas Rangers and a sergeant Brian Burzynski came by that afternoon to investigate ... finding semen samples all over the carpet , furniture , and walls of the office ....
Brookins and Hernandez quickly resigned .
The Texas Rangers forwarded the report to the local district attorney , Randall Reynolds but he did nothing .
The TYC conducted its own investigation absolving itself of any wrong doing .
Then the TYC superintendent , Lemuel " Chip " Harrison , who had ignored complaints of sexual misconduct ( complaints numbering to 750 since 2000 , but thought to underrepresent the extent of the abuse due to the children 's fear of retribution if they complained ) was promoted to director of all juvenile corrections of TYC .
Brookins found employment at an Austin hotel and Hernandez moved on to become principal of a charter school in Midland .
Neither of them yet to face trial , and , despite overwhelming evidence , they both claim innocence . "

f you 're starting to think that incarceration in America is better than being homeless , think again .
As more and more programs for the poor are eliminated in America due to budget cuts , the only one left standing is the most expensive one of them all : prisons .
Increasingly a privatized industry , prisons are also a growth industry in America , with a new prison opening every fifteen days over the last decade .
Just in 2003 , statistics from the Bureau of Justice recorded the building of prisons in America as costing $ 60 billion .
It is widely understood that the main priority of a corporation is to make as much profit as possible .
This is no different for corporate prison operators like Corrections Corporation of America ( CCA ) or GEO ( formerly Wackenhut ) , to name a couple .
The more prisoners there are in America , the better the profit margin is for these prison profiteers .
Publicly operated prisons can also have similar fiscal motivations .
This situation has helped to create a growth in America 's prison population to the point where the US .
has the distinction of having the highest incarceration rate in the world .
Out of 218 countries listed in the world prison rates from King 's College of London , England , rates for the US are over 5 prisoners per 1000 population .
In comparison , China has only about 1 prisoner per 1000 .
Numbers vary depending on the source , of course .
The Pew Center 's findings in March 2009 report that 1 in every 31 adults in America is under some form of correctional control ( about 32 per 1000 ) .
Bureau of Justice statistics in their " Key Facts at a Glance " of correctional populations , estimates the total number of all persons on probation , parole , in prison and jail in 2008 to be at 7,308,200 , or about 20 per 1000 .
By contrast , in 1980 when the Drug War was starting to get off the ground , the same figure was 1,842,100 , or about 6 per 1000 .
Prisons cost taxpayers a lot of money .
The prison industry is putting America into a vice grip by depleting more and more of its public funds away from preventative measures , such as schools and assistance programs for those trying to overcome debilitating poverty .
This results in a perpetual creation of new populations as fodder for the prison industry .
However , cutting costs inside the prison system has results that are far more costly in the long - term : 1. horrible health conditions inside the prisons that create health risks for society outside as well2 .
more incarcerations of nonviolent mentally impaired people who do not belong in prisons and who come out with far worse mental impairments3 .
a prison environment in which rapists are safe from punishment and allowed to rape at willRape is one of the most horrific , degrading prison experiences .
Rape happens more in American incarceration situations than anywhere else .
In 1996 , as reported in Joel Dyer 's book The Perpetual Prisoner Machine , the prison rape rates were 18 per minute .
Even with this evidence available in 1996 , President Bill Clinton in that same year signed the Prison Litigation Reform Act ( PLRA ) , which was purported to " safeguard against frivolous lawsuits by prisoners .
"
Unfortunately , what it really did was provide protection for rapists and all other human rights abusers , particularly employees and operators of detention centers , by making it practically impossible for prisoners to file suit against these abuses .
Fortunately , as reported by the Prison Legal News ( 25 August 2009 ) , the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission recently concluded that the PLRA law blocks access to the courts for many victims of sexual abuse .
Despite the PLRA , and other heavy restrictions of the outside world 's right to communicate with domestic prisoners , there have still been many exposures of the prison - rape epidemic , some of which were successfully brought to light in courtrooms throughout America by victim advocacy groups such as Prison Legal News ( PLN ) , Human Rights Watch , the ACLU and others .
They diligently document horrific abuses that occur on a regular basis in American domestic prisons .
It is important to keep in mind that these exposures are just the tip of the iceberg as there are many more abuses that are not exposed .
In just one report of recent 2008 - 2009 convictions of prison and jail staff for sexual abuse from 39 states ( posted at the PLN site 22 Feb 2010 ) , the reporter , Gary Hunter adds an explanation that " it would easily be possible to publish a monthly magazine consisting of nothing but substantiated reports of the sexual assault of prisoners by their captors ....
" While the situation is bad for adult prisoners , the situation for the juvenile prisoners is much worse .
Presently in America , if one is a child abuser and plays it smart , then working in a juvenile detention is plain common sense .
Here is a brief synopsis of a report by David Kaiser and Lovisa Stannow , in The New York Review of Books , posted 11 March 2010 : Dr. Terry Kupers has been a practicing psychiatrist since the 1960s and an established mental health consultant and expert on prisoner mental health issues .
He reported in his book Prison Madness that because of the cutbacks in services for the mentally ill , many of them are ending up in prison where they are subject to conditions that worsen their psychiatric disorders .
He reports that when mentally ill people — as well as nonviolent criminals with no prior mental illness — are imprisoned , they are brutalized so badly that upon release it is documented that many of them pose a worse threat to the public .
As a consequence , their re-arrest rates keep rising .
To avoid repeating this expensive vicious cycle , Dr. Kupers strongly recommends that communities return to investing in humane programs for people , which produce better results than prison and are much less costly to taxpayers .
He emphatically states that we must " put an end to prison overcrowding and STOP sending nonviolent and mentally disordered felons into prison yards with murderers and rapists .
" Over the years , Kupers has witnessed the constant cutbacks — along with short staffing and gradually diminished basic health care — to the point where , by all accounts , healthcare is virtually unavailable to prisoners .
This situation is documented in much more detail in a 2007 book called Prison Profiteers edited by PLN's Paul Wright .
Inevitably , this creates major health hazards to the general public when it comes to those communicable diseases that flourish in overcrowded , unsanitary settings .
Getting rid of overcrowding conditions would greatly alleviate these major health hazards to the public at large .
The implementation of the Three Strikes law is responsible for much of the prison overcrowding .
Mandating life imprisonment sentences to any and all offenders , no matter what their crimes are , is proving to be a drastic mistake .
In 1993 , voters in Washington state were persuaded to pass a Three Strikes law .
As reported by Paul Wright , in 1994 a 35 year old man put his finger in his pocket — pretending it was a gun — and robbed a sandwich shop of $ 151 dollars .
He was arrested an hour later drinking a beer a block away .
His prior " strikes " were stealing $ 360 from his grandfather in 1986 and robbing a pizza place of $ 100 .
He is now in prison for life .
His incarceration will cost taxpayers $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 per year ( as estimated in 1994 prices ) , not including the original average cost of $ 54,209 to build one prison bed space .
If he lives to be 70 , the costs will be up to approximately $ 1 million ( again , 1994 prices ) .
The Three Strikes law also makes the job of police work much more dangerous .
As Paul Wright says , " a suspect , knowing that if convicted of petty theft will spend the rest of his life in prison has , quite literally , nothing to lose if he has to kill a few people to avoid arrest . "
Is there any one of us who would n't do the same after knowing what prison life has in store for you ?
This is not lost on the police .
Wright quotes Seattle police Sgt. Eric Bardt as saying , " it now looks like some of these three strikes cases might try to get away or shoot their way out .
Believe me , that 's not lost on us .
We 're thinking about it .
" It should come as no surprise that the union representing California 's correctional officers ( the CCPOA ) , supports the Three Strikes law .
As one union officer put it , quoted in Dan Pen 's report in the book The Celling of America , " This is the career ... with Three Strikes and the overcrowding we 're going to experience with that , we 're going to need to build at least three prisons a year for the next five years .
Each one of those institutions will take approximately 1,000 employees . "
But correctional employees are not the only ones who stand to benefit from prison expansion .
Prison profiteers are constantly devising ingenious ways to get more funding from taxpayers .
Consider this one example from 1987 .
The California Department of Corrections ( the CDC ) developed a new policy for the Corcoran State Prison of forcing all rival groups together on the same exercise yard , resulting in a dramatic and rapid increase in prison violence .
The CDC then used this new statistic to justify construction of the Pelican Bay Prison .
This example barely scratches the surface of what still goes on behind closed doors today at great expense to American taxpayers ( you can read more about this type of ongoing problem at Then there 's the profit being made from prison labor with companies like Microsoft , Victoria 's Secret , Disney , the US Military , etc benefitting from the lowered costs of cheap prison labor , many of them disproportionally people of color ( almost 63 % of the nation 's incarcerated are blacks and latinos , who only make up a quarter of the general population ) .
Profiteering from prison labor was outlawed as result of the Great Depression because so many Americans were without jobs .
But now prison labor has come full circle and America is back where its started with regards to prison labor .
The racist criminalization of crack cocaine , as compared to the far more lenient laws for using powder cocaine , is a major reason why so many people of color are imprisoned compared with wealthier cocaine users , mostly white , who get away with a slap on the wrist for using the exact same drug .
With different cocaine laws applied to different types of people the Drug War is really just a cover for a war on people of color .
But the Drug War especially deserves a mention because of the Marijuana laws .
As former president Jimmy Carter once said , " Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself . "
The War on Drugs started in 1980 , the same year incarceration rates in America started rising .
Marijuana laws are responsible for putting a lot of nonviolent offenders , mostly people of color , into prison .
Despite the dangers of other drugs , like crystal meth , the main focus of the Drug War has always been marijuana .
Even though marijuana has numerous documented medical uses , we are still bombarded with anti-marijuana publicity campaigns in our schools and media .
The growth of the prison industry is out of control in America and it does n't have to be this way .
In looking for better alternatives Dr. Kupers is impressed with prison systems in Denmark and the Netherlands .
There is very little violence between the prisoners and correctional staff , and their commitment to one prisoner per cell is a major part of the reason why .
Our mainstream , or corporate , media hardly mentions any of the problems of prison - profiteering in America .
The reason it has been allowed to reach extremes is that most American 's do n't know about it .
Most Americans are decent people and would not tolerate this horrendous misuse of our tax dollars if they only knew .
Whenever American mainstream " news " does focus on " crime " it is always for ratings .
The worse the crime the higher the ratings and — duh — the higher the ratings , the higher the profits .
We all get manipulated into worrying that we'd better get " tough on crime " and build more prisons , and we consistently elect politicians who do just that .
And that , for starters , needs to stop .
The most positive attitude that a person can have is to believe that problems can be solved .
Naturally the first step towards solving any problem is knowing that they exist .
Therefore , it is not a negative attitude to examine problems in America like prison profiteering .

The feature is not yet live for everyone .
The functionality is much the same as traditional “ Likes . ”
In a blog post , Facebook writes that , “ when you click ‘ Like ’ on a comment the commenter will receive a notification .

Already the web ’s number one time sink , expect this feature to add a few more minutes per day to our collective use of Facebook .
Nigeria is fighting an unusual outbreak of polio caused by mutating polio vaccine , world health authorities say , but the only remedy is to keep vaccinating children there .
Officials of the World Health Organization fear that news of the outbreak will be a new setback for eradication efforts in northern Nigeria , where vaccinations were halted in 2003 for nearly a year because of rumors that the vaccine sterilized Muslim girls or contained the AIDS virus .
During that lull , polio spread to many new countries , although most have snuffed out the small outbreaks that resulted .
Officials deny suggestions that they kept the outbreak , which began last year , a secret , and say that they did not realize until recently that as many as 70 of Nigeria ’s last 1,300 polio cases stemmed from a mutant vaccine virus rather than “ wild type ” virus , which causes most polio .
“ It was an oversight on our part , ” Dr. Bruce Aylward , director of the polio eradication campaign for the W.H.O. , said yesterday .
The agency discussed the first 16 cases it knew of at meetings early this year and posted information on its
Web site in April , he said , “ but only in places where lab people would look . ”
Comic art has finally reached acceptance as a legitimate and important art form in its own right , and is a source of inspiration for musicians , fashion designers , and Hollywood directors .
OK , quick question …
Is comic book art better today than it was 25 years ago ?
I ’m betting most of you will say yes .
You may be right , but then again , you may be wrong .
It ’s an ages old argument when comparing eras .
You hear it in sports all the time .
Who is the better golfer , Tiger Woods or Arnold Palmer ?
It might be easy to say Tiger Woods but Palmer did n’t have the advantage of playing with today ’s precision engineered titanium clubs that allow golfers to hit the ball further and more accurate than ever .
When Palmer used a wood club , it was actually made of wood !
Much the same can be said of today ’s comic book art .
Artists today have the advantage of superior printing and coloring processes .
25 years ago , art could not extend to the very edge of the page and had to be enclosed within panels .
The colors were often dull and do n’t hold up very well over time thanks to the cheap newsprint paper .
It ’s virtually the first thing you notice in today ’s comics .
The art is bolder and brighter with an unlimited color palette .
The advent of computer programs like Photoshop and Corel Painter gives artists the ability to produce effects that they either could not do by hand , or would be too time consuming to do by hand .
What strikes you about the art in comic books ?
There is a wide range of style from ultra- detailed to simple minimalist , the computer has forever change the way comics are produced .
Is it the slick production ?

Wholesalers and states convince Congress to consider new legislation to prevent direct - shipping lawsuits in a campaign to protect the three - tier system
The battle over whether consumers can order wine directly from wineries is moving to the halls of the U.S. Capitol .
Members of Congress yesterday introduced a bill ( HR 5034 ) that could end direct shipping of wine and other forms of alcohol in the United States , or at least put major roadblocks in front of lawsuits by consumers and wineries trying to reduce restrictions on direct shipping .
Wine Spectator obtained a copy of a draft of the bill on Wednesday , which was crafted by the National Beer Wholesalers Association ( NBWA ) .
It would strengthen state governments ' control of alcohol sales , allowing them to protect the three - tier system of distribution while putting a much greater burden on people challenging it .
Talk of a bill first surfaced when a Congressional subcommittee held a hearing with little notice on March 18 .
During the session , wholesalers and state regulators argued that the three - tier system is under attack and that the U.S. faces " an alcohol epidemic " if Congress does not intervene and prevent deregulation of alcohol sales .
The hearing took many in the wine industry by surprise , and no winery - , retailer - or consumer - advocacy groups testified .
State leaders and alcohol wholesalers argue that a law is needed to prevent frivolous lawsuits and to allow states to maintain firm control of sales and prevent alcoholism and underage drinking .
Critics argue that the bill would allow wholesalers to protect their turf from competition and prevent consumers from being able to buy wines and other alcoholic beverages not carried by local wholesalers .
An original draft of the bill contained an antitrust exemption for wholesalers , but that was struck from the language .
" The whole idea [ behind the bill ] is to make it prohibitively difficult for wineries and consumers to challenge discriminatory and irrational laws that have little or nothing to do with the protection of the public , " said Kirkland & Ellis attorney Tracy Genesen , who has been the lead attorney on many direct - shipping lawsuits that have resulted in state alcohol laws being overturned .
Those lawsuits have been growing in number since the landmark 2005 Supreme Court Granholm decision , which ruled that states cannot discriminate between in - and out - of - state wineries in matters of direct - to - consumer wine shipping .
The Granholm decision argued that the 21st Amendment , which ended Prohibition and put states in charge of alcohol regulation , does not trump the Constitution 's Commerce Clause , which prevents states from restricting interstate trade .
Granholm has led to a wave of winery direct - shipping challenges and new laws ; direct - to - consumer wine shipping is now legal to varying degrees in 37 states and the District of Columbia .
A Bill to End the Legal Challenges
Wine Spectator obtained a copy of the NBWA 's draft bill earlier this week and the introduced bill , HR 5034 , on Friday .
They are largely identical .
Titled the Comprehensive Alcohol Regulatory Effectiveness
Act of 2010 , or the " CARE Act , " the proposed bill would effectively allow the 21st Amendment to trump the Commerce Clause , granting states immunity to litigation based on discriminatory alcohol distribution laws .
In the proposed bill , the Commerce Clause is weakened in respect to alcohol : " It is the policy of Congress that each state or territory shall continue to have the primary authority to regulate wine .
Silence on the part of Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier under [ the Commerce Clause ] to the regulation by a state or territory of alcoholic beverages . "
The bill also includes an amendment to the Act of 1890 , otherwise known as the Wilson Act .
The Wilson Act states " that all fermented , distilled or other intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any state or territory " are subject to the same rules as alcohol produced within the state .
The proposed bill calls for maintaining the states ' control over alcohol shipped in , but no longer requires the state to treat it the same as alcohol produced within the state .
Thus , in - state wineries could be given preference .
The proposed bill continues , " Notwithstanding that the state law may burden interstate commerce or may be inconsistent with an act of the Congress , the state law shall be upheld unless the party challenging the state law establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the state law has no effect on the promotion of temperance , the establishment or maintenance of orderly alcoholic beverage taxes , the structure of the state alcoholic beverage distribution system , or the restriction of access to alcoholic beverages by those under the legal drinking age . "
Genesen said that will make it much harder to challenge laws .
" To try to change the burden of proof to make it impossible to challenge these laws is turning the clock back 70 years . "
Setting the Stage
The first hint that Congress was considering the wholesalers ' proposed legislation was a Congressional hearing of the House Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy on March 18 .
Two panels of witnesses discussed the diminishing strength of the three - tier system for alcohol sales and the potential effects of deregulation of the alcohol industry .
Except for two Congressmen from wine - producing districts in California , no direct shipping advocates spoke .
" It 's pretty remarkable because it 's not exactly like we have a clamor to examine the state - based alcohol regulations , " said Tom Wark , executive director of the Specialty Wine Retailers Association .
Wark believes the NBWA used its lobbying clout to raise the topic .
Among those testifying in favor of the three - tier producer - wholesaler - retailer system , several claimed that increased deregulation of the alcohol industry would lead to alcohol abuse and underage drinking .
Pamela Erickson , an Arizona - based public policy advisor and a former Oregon state regulator , claimed that an " alcohol epidemic " has beset the United Kingdom due to deregulation of its alcohol industry .
Erickson testified that as the U.K. deregulated between 1980 and 2007 , " numerous nightlife centers sprung up …
These became scenes of drunken debauchery , with people spilling out at closing time vomiting , urinating and passing out . "
She offered no explanation of how the three - tier system prevents " nightlife centers " from springing up .
Nida Samona , chairwoman of the Michigan Liquor Control Commission said , " In 1941 , Supreme Court Justice [ Robert ] Jackson stated that liquor is ' a lawlessness unto itself . '
That was true then and is true today .
Alcoholic beverages must be highly regulated . "
Samona went on to cite the Granholm decision as a reason that states should be exempt from antitrust laws on alcohol .
" Because of this type of expensive and uncertain litigation , a federal statute is essential to confirm the primacy of state regulation , " Samona testified .
Congressman Mike Thompson , a Democrat who testified against the proposed bill and whose district includes portions of Napa and Sonoma counties , rejected Samona 's demand for protection against litigation .
" We do n't need a new federal law :
The litigation will stop when the states stop passing discriminatory laws promoted by the wholesalers . "
" For decades , wholesalers have expended great resources to protect their state - mandated distribution system in ways that have harmed wineries and breweries .
These efforts have stunted competition and weakened producers , which ultimately leads to fewer choices for consumers , " Thompson testified .
" States should encourage , not stifle , competition . "
" [ The wholesalers ] have done so well in exacting a monopoly for so long that they are now trying to pull out all the stops to make sure that we do n't make any more progress toward a regulated wine economy in the future . " — attorney Tracy Genesen
After the hearing , Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America president and CEO Craig Wolf praised the idea of strengthening states ' control over alcohol .
" Easy and cheap access to alcohol is certainly not the answer — we know this from the many social ills that deregulation has brought on in the United Kingdom , " Wolf said in a statement .
There was no testimony explaining how wholesalers , who never deal directly with consumers , prevent underage or excess drinking .
" When Craig Wolf theorizes that without a strict adherence to the three - tier system , all bedlam will break loose , he [ is ] doing so to scare lawmakers and society into keeping the three - tier system in place , " said Wark .
" This is nothing more than a scare tactic . "
" We have a very good system in this country .
It is the best in the world , " Wolf countered in an interview .
" It is the most consumer friendly , but at the same time the safest and the most balanced .
Look around the rest of the world and see the state of alcohol problems elsewhere that you do n't see in this country , and our three - tier system helps prevent those problems . "
" While we do n't like these [ direct shipping ] laws , we 're not out there trying to roll them back , " Wolf said .
" What we want to do is stop the litigation .
It 's got to stop . "
On March 29 , the National Association of Attorneys General ( NAAG ) sent a letter to Rep. Johnson and the Subcommittee in support of the bill .
The letter , signed by attorneys general from 38 states and American Samoa , stated , " We are writing to seek your help with the growing threat facing our states from unprecedented legal challenges that seek to eliminate our ability to regulate alcohol . "
" Alarmingly , legal challenges have been filed in over half of the states challenging their alcohol laws or regulations designed to encourage temperance , collect taxes and prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors , " the letter continues .
" All too often the judges hearing these cases have misinterpreted federal law and the intention of Congress regarding the states ' right to regulate . "
" I view this whole effort as a backlash to some of the successes that we 've had , including Granholm , " said Genesen .
" This is an effort by the beer wholesalers to make sure that the status quo is protected at all costs , including the costs to consumers , the wine industry and the general economic welfare of our country . "
" [ The wholesalers ] have done so well in exacting a monopoly for so long that they are now trying to pull out all the stops to make sure that we do n't make any more progress toward a regulated wine economy in the future , " Genesen said .
The Start of the Fight
Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett might have given an important signal of the security of the wholesaler business and the future of the three - tier system when he purchased Georgia - based wholesaler Empire Distributors in March .
" [ Buffett ] understands that alcohol wholesaling is one of the few government - protected industries in the country , " Wark said .
" When you find an industry where the state says these types of businesses must carry out all transactions , that 's pretty good . "
" The next step in this battle is to educate members of Congress on the importance of letting the federal courts around the country interpret the laws that currently exist , in light of Granholm , " Genesen said .
The likelihood of the NBWA 's proposed legislation coming to pass is still slight .
A hearing and an introduced bill are very different from a signed law .
But the lobbying battle is just beginning .
During the hearing , California Congressman George Radanovich , a Republican whose district includes parts of the Central Valley , urged the committee to closely examine whether the proposed legislation is " innovation or monopoly protection . "
He added , " [ The wholesalers ] present this committee with a very long , broad and , quite frankly , outrageous wish list .
There must be extraordinary reasons why states should get a free pass from the Constitution or antitrust laws . "
Homeland Security Mission Creep : “ Intellectual Property Crime ”
In recent columns I ’ve examined how the extraordinary powers granted to the national security state post - 9/11 for “ fighting terrorism ” have been used for much broader purposes : namely , increasing the state ’s control over its own citizenry , and suppressing economic threats to the corporate interests that control the state .
As we ’ve already seen , this mission creep includes the use of police state powers to suppress anti-globalization activism , and the use of the “ Drug War ” to control the domestic population while protecting the black market drug profits of the terror state and its allies .
Yet another example is enforcement of so - called “ intellectual property ” law ( which is not a legitimate form of property at all and is in fact utterly repugnant to the principles of a genuinely freed market ) .
As before , we take the scholarship of USAF Col. Jennifer Hesterman as a paradigmatic case .
Col. Hesterman treats “ intellectual property crime ” as an important component of the phenomenon she studies : the intersection of transnational crime with the funding of terror networks .
In her monograph “ Transnational Crime and the Criminal - Terrorist Network , ” she defines “ intellectual property crime ” as “ the counterfeiting and pirating of goods that are then manufactured and sold for profit without the consent of the patent or trademark holder . ”
IPC , she says , “ is more lucrative than drug trafficking , is less pursued by law - enforcement agencies , and the penalties if caught and prosecuted are far less severe than those for other criminal activities . ”
On her personal blog , Counter Terror Forum , she celebrates the increased dedication of federal law enforcement resources to combating IPC .
“ IPC , ” she writes , “ is a lucrative criminal activity with low initial investment and high financial returns , possibly even higher than drug trafficking .
For example , a Nintendo game costs $ 0.20 to duplicate and is resold for $ 20 at flea markets on online , thus recognizing enormous profit for the criminals . ”
Hence “ IPC … generates unbelievable amount of profit . ”
She quotes figures estimating counterfeit goods trade at $ 450 billion annually , resulting in US business losses of $ 200 to $ 250 billion .
I believe she ’s getting it backwards .
As with the drug trade , the main reason “ IPC ” is so lucrative is IP law itself .
The real “ intellectual property crime ” is that Nintendo , with the help of coercive enforcement of monopoly privileges by the state , is able to charge an enormous sum of money for a game whose marginal cost of reproduction is twenty cents .
The seller of “ pirated ” goods or knockoffs makes money by arbitrage : they compete by eliminating a major portion of Nintendo ’s markup , but can still ( thanks to competing with Nintendo ’s price ) charge a significant — if lesser — markup .
As with the drug laws , if copyright law were eliminated , both Nintendo ’s markup and the markup on the knockoff goods would evaporate , and the game would sell for marginal production cost .
So if the U.S. national security state really wants to eliminate black market funding of terrorism , all it has to do is repeal the drug laws and “ intellectual property ” law .
But when it comes to this , the U.S. government , Disney and Al Qaeda are all on the same side .
In any case , the primary focus of U.S. copyright enforcement — and particularly recent increases in enforcement efforts — is against digital “ piracy , ” on behalf of such parties as the RIAA and MPAA .
Such “ piracy ” is not lucrative at all — in fact the copyrighted work is downloaded free of charge .
So the claim that crackdowns on file - sharing will result in less money for terror networks just does n’t meet the smell test .
However transparently self - serving the “ counter - terror ” rationale , though , the national security state is indeed ramping up its enforcement efforts against ( primarily digital ) “ intellectual property crime . ”
Following a “ piracy ” summit in December at which Joe Biden ( formerly Senator from MBNA and now Vice President from Disney ) compared digital file - sharing to a “ smash - and - grab ” at Tiffany ’s , in February Attorney General Holder announced a new “ IP task force ” at the Justice Department .
And last month Biden announced the dedication of fifty FBI agents to anti-piracy enforcement , while Homeland Security boasted ( from Disney ’s offices ! ) of raids on nine movie - sharing sites .
Al Qaeda must be shaking in their boots .
I had not heard of this until today but a few years ago there was a diet created by General Motors called the GM Diet to get or at least keep the employees in shape ( to bad it did n’t help the bottom line ) and this diet was really popular even outside of General Motors .
The GM Diet is one of those older diets that seems to be based on heresay and fads more than anything and you can see this in the strange ideas about drinking certain alcohols and the idea of eating until you are “ stuffed ” can not be at all good over the long term .
Also funny is an all meat day as opposed to the fat loss 4 idiots all fruit day .
The GM Diet was originally created by GM and only for the employees and families .
Somehow GM ( biggest company in the world at the time ) got a grant from the FDA and the Department of Agriculture to create this .
Johns Hopkins was involved and the diet was approved and launched in 1985 .
This GM
Diet program is designed for a target weight loss of 10 - 17 lbs per week .
It will also improve your attitudes and emotions because of its cleansing systematic effects .
This can also be used over and over again although I am not to sure about the food balance as it seems to be extreme in a few ways .
The GM Diet is designed to flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well being .
The plan is designed to lose you 10 pounds or so in a week .
Has anyone tried and found this ?
GM Diet Plan
During the first seven days you must abstain from all alcohol .
You must drink 10 glasses of water each day on the GM Diet
Day One
All fruits except bananas .
Your first day will consist of all the fruits you want .
It is strongly suggested that you consume lots of melons the first day .
Especially watermelon and a loupe .
If you limit your fruit consumption to melons , your chances of losing three lbs .
on first day are very good .
Day Two
All vegetables .
You are encouraged to eat until you are stuffed with all the raw or cooked vegetables of your choice .
There is no limit on the amount or type .
For your complex carbohydrate , you will start day two with a large baked potato for breakfast .
You may top the potato with one pat of butter .
Day Three A mixture of fruits and vegetables of your choice .
Any amount , any quantity .
No bananas yet .
No potatoes today .
Day Four Bananas and milk .
Today you will eat as many as eight bananas and drink three glasses of milk .
This will be combined with the special soup which may be eaten in limited quantities .
Day Five Today is feast day .
You will eat beef and tomatoes .
Eat two 10 oz .
portions of lean beef .
Hamburger is OK .
Combine this with six whole tomatoes .
On day five you must increase your water intake by one quart .
This is to cleanse your system of the uric acid you will be producing .
Day Six Beef and vegetables .
Today you may eat an unlimited amount of beef and vegetables .
Eat to your hearts content .
Day Seven
Today your food intake will consist of brown rice , fruit juices and all the vegetables you care to consume .
Tomorrow morning from the GM Diet you will be 10 - 17 lbs.
lighter than one week ago .
If you desire further weight loss , repeat the program again .
You may repeat this program as often as you like , however , it is suggested that you are allowed two glasses of white wine in addition to the instructions on the program .
You may substitute champagne for white wine .
Under no circumstances are you to drink any other alcoholic beverages with the exception of beer which is allowed .
Any liquor ( bourbon , vodka , rum ) is forbidden .
Cream drinks are especially forbidden on the GM Diet .
You may have an occasional cordial such as creme de menthe or schnapps , but you must always limit yourself to two drinks .
If you wine , drink only wine that day .
If you have beer , drink only beer that day , etc .
Alcohol adds empty calories to your diet .
However , after the first week on the GM Diet it will help your digestion and settle your stomach .
GM Wonder Soup
The following soup is intended as a supplement to your GM Diet .
It can be eaten any time of the day in virtually unlimited quantities .
You are encouraged to consume large quantities of this soup .
28 oz , Water , 6 Large Onions , 2 Green Peppers , Whole Tomatoes ( fresh or canned ) , 1 Head Cabbage , 1 Bunch Celery , 4 Envelopes Lipton Onion Soup Mix , Herbs and Flavoring as desired .
GM Diet Additional Notes
Vegetables as may be taken in the form of a salad if desired .
No dressing except malt , white or wine vinegar , squeezed lemon , garlic , herbs .
No more than one tea spoon of oil on the GM Diet .
You have above a recipe for the wonder soup which can be eaten in unlimited quantities .
This soup is a supplement while you are on the program and it should be a pleasure to eat .
Not everyone likes cabbage , green peppers , celery etc .
This recipe is not inflexible .
You may substitute vegetables according to your taste .
You may add any vegetables you like : asparagus , peas , corn , turnips , green beans , cauliflower , etc .
Try to stay away from beans ( lima , pinto , kidney , etc. ) , however , because they tend to be high in calories even though they are very good for you .
Beverages you may consume while on the GM Diet program :
1. Water ( flavored with lemon / lime if desired ) .
2. Club Soda is OK .
3. Black Coffee .
No cream or cream substitute .
No sugar or sweetness .
4. Black Tea = Herb or Leaf .
5 . Absolutely nothing else except the fruit juices which are part of day seven .
No fruit juices before day seven .
How and Why the GM Diet Works
Day One –
You are preparing your system for the upcoming program .
Your only source of nutrition is fresh or canned fruits .
Fruits are nature ’s perfect food .
They provide everything you could possibly want to sustain life except total balance and variety .
Day Two – Starts with a fix of complex carbohydrates coupled with an oil dose .
This is taken in the morning for energy and balance .
The rest of day two consists of vegetables which are virtually calorie free and provide essential nutrients and fibre .
Day Three – Eliminates the potato because you get your carbohydrates from the fruits .
You system is now prepared to start burning excess pounds .
You will still have cravings which should start to diminish by day four .
Day Four – Bananas , milk and soup sound the strangest and least desirable .
You ’re in for a surprise .
You probably will not eat all the bananas allowed .
But they are there for the potassium you have lost and the sodium you may have missed the past three days .
You will notice a definite weight loss of desire for sweets .
You will be surprised how easy this day will go .
Day Five – Beef and tomatoes .
The beef is for iron and proteins , the tomatoes are for digestion and fibre .
Lots and lots of water purifies your system .
You should notice colorless urine today .
Your allowance calls for the equivalent of five “ quarter ponders ” .
Do not feel you have to eat all this beef .
You must eat the six tomatoes .
Day Six – Similar to day five , Iron and proteins from beef , Vitamins and fibre from vegetables .
By now your system is in a total weight loss inclination .
There should be a noticeable difference in the way you look today , compared to day one .
Day Seven – Finished off the program like a good cigar used to finish off Victorian meals , except much healthier .
You have your system under control and it should thank you for the flushing and cleaning you just gave it .
I am not sure of the value of the GM Diet but go ahead and try this and see if you are pleasantly surprised .
Make sure that if you try this that you also let us all know of the results good or bad in the comments below .
Maybe GM
Diet will me the legacy that General Motors will be remembered for instead ?
Every so often , Aalim Moody , 5 , and his twin sister , Aalima , break into a kind of secret code , chatting in a language their father does not understand .
Walking along Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn , they make out the lettering on kosher food shops and yeshiva buses , showing off all they learn at the Hebrew Language Academy Charter School in Midwood , where they both attend kindergarten .
Ask Aalim his favorite song and he will happily belt out :
“ Eretz Yisrael sheli yaffa v’gam porachat ! ” 
My land of Israel is beautiful and blossoming !
 and then he continues in Hebrew :
Who built it and who cultivated it ?
All of us together !
I built a house in the land of Israel .
So now I have a land and I have a house in the land of Israel !
Aalim and Aalima are not Jewish .
They worship at a mosque affiliated with the Nation of Islam .
But at the Hebrew Language Academy , they fit right in .
Constructing an entire alien language is the most challenging task in all of speculative fiction , and there are two examples that tower above the rest : J.R.R. Tolkien 's Elvish and Marc Okrand 's Klingon .
We 'll show you how to outdo even them .

When it comes to world - building , there 's no finer way to capture an alien culture than to give it a language that seems utterly strange to human ears .
It 's obviously a challenging task , and one that requires a decent working knowledge of linguistics .
So while we have to leave the nitty - gritty of language construction to a textbook , what we can do is examine the very different overarching approaches used in constructing the two most iconic alien languages - Elvish and Klingon - and then explain how you could create a language that combines the best of both .
So let 's look at each one a time ...
What J.R.R. Tolkien did with Elvish :
Tolkien , who considered himself a linguist and philologist first and an author second , once explained the true purpose of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings :
" Nobody believes me when I say that my long book is an attempt to create a world in which a form of language agreeable to my personal aesthetic might seem real .
But it is true . "
Advertisement
Tolkien 's legendarium included dozens of languages that are variously mentioned , alluded to , translated to English , and in a few cases actually presented in their original form .
Every race in The Lord of the Rings has its own language , although most remain largely unknown : the common speech of humans and Hobbits , known as Westron , is simply rendered as English in the books , the language of the Dwarves is a closely guarded secret that we only see glimpses of in character 's names and the mines of Khazad - Dum , the brutish tongue Orcish is still too difficult for most Orcs to be able to speak it , and the true language of the tree - like Ents is so ancient and subtle that it lies beyond our comprehension .
But even with so many languages left unknown , there still is left a language family of staggering complexity .
This is the Elvish languages , the very first things Tolkien created long before he came up with narratives to support them .
There are about eight to ten such languages in the books , but two were given special attention : the ancient , ceremonial " Elven - Latin " language Quenya , and the commonly spoken Elven " lingua franca " Sindarin .
As Tolkien said above , these were both attempts to create languages that reflected his own tastes in language , and so Quenya was based on Finnish while Sindarin was based on Welsh .
However , it was not enough for Tolkien to simply create two languages that happened to sound like Finnish and Welsh .
Instead , he had to build up a logical history of sound and structural changes from a common proto - Elvish source that could conceivably produce both languages .
As such , Tolkien approached language construction from the perspective of a historical linguist , one whose primary interest was charting the development of related languages over time .

His son Christopher , who has spent much of his own life compiling and analyzing his father 's work , once explained just how painstaking a process this was :
" He did not , after all , ' invent ' new words and names arbitrarily : in principle , he devised from within the historical structure , proceeding from the ' bases ' or primitive stems , adding suffix or prefix or forming compounds , deciding ( or , as he would have said , ' finding out ' ) when the word came into the language , following it through the regular changes in form that it would thus have undergone , and observing the possibilities of formal or semantic influence from other words in the course of its history .
Such a word would then exist for him , and he would know it . "
Advertisement
Even more simply , Christopher Tolkien wrote in the introduction to " The Etymologies " , a list of the basic Elvish building blocks Tolkien used to construct his languages , that " he was more interested in the processes of change than he was in displaying the structure and use of the languages at any given time . "
This is absolutely crucial , because it points to the basic shortcoming of Tolkien 's work : his languages are by design really , really unfinished .
They were a constant work in progress , and Tolkien changed his mind over seemingly minor points several times in the course of his work .
The list of definitive words and meanings that Tolkien left behind is relatively small , and though we know a little about how the Elvish languages sounded at many different points in their history , we do n't really know a lot about the languages at any one specific time .
Unsurprisingly , we have the best idea of how Quenya and Sindarin were spoken around the time The Lord of the Rings takes place , but even that is a very incomplete picture .
Advertisement
For our purposes , there 's another problem : Tolkien 's languages were not truly alien .
In his cosmology , all the various races of Middle Earth shared a common , albeit remote , ancestry , and so their languages did share certain universal features .
( It 's a little more complicated than that , but satisfactorily explaining any part of Tolkien 's world takes about a week , so I 'll simplify . )
That 's why Sindarin and Quenya could indeed be based on Welsh and Finnish , and indeed why Tolkien could amuse himself by suggesting certain proto -Germanic words of uncertain origin actually came from Elvish .
( If you 're a linguist , that sort of thing is absolutely hysterical . )
In other words , Tolkien 's work was a staggering achievement of historical linguistics and language construction , but it did n't leave us with complete languages , much less alien ones .
Now let 's take a look at our other iconic language ...

What Marc Okrand did with Klingon :
Whereas Tolkien 's work was simply a labor of love that could happily last a lifetime , Marc Okrand was working under a rather more firm deadline when he devised Klingon .
He first became involved with the Star Trek franchise when he helped out with the " dubbing " of Vulcan dialogue in The Wrath of Khan , and the filmmaker were so impressed with his work that they asked him to create an entire Klingon language for The Search for Spock .
Advertisement
Okrand , a former linguistics professor who was working ( and still works ) on closed captioning at the National Captioning Institute , leaped at the opportunity to invent Klingon .
He wanted to remain true to what little Klingon had been heard before , which was comprised entirely of a few character names from the original TV show and some lines of dialogue from the opening of Star Trek : The Motion Picture .
Using this meager data set as an entry point to Klingon , Okrand first figured out what sounds had already been used in Klingon , and then built up the phonetics of the language from there .
Advertisement
As he explained in a lecture video that we 've embedded below , he intentionally violated as many rules of human language as he could .
Human languages are unbelievably varied , and there 's really no such thing as a true universal , a rule that holds true in 100 % of cases .
However , there are a lot of features of language sounds , meanings , and grammar that are very common in almost all human languages , and it would be highly unusual if none of these appeared in a human language .
Of course , since Klingon is n't a human language , he tried to violate as many of these as possible .
Click to view
He explains a few such instances where he made intentionally odd sound choices : " So , for example , in Klingon , there 's the sound " v " and usually in a language if there 's a " v " sound there 's also an " f " sound .
Not in Klingon .
Why ?
Because usually that 's the way it works in human languages and Klingon is not a human language .
In Klingon , there 's a " t " sound and there 's also a " d " in Klingon , but the " d " does n't match the " t " – you make it putting your tongue in a different place .
That 's unusual from a human language point of view , therefore that 's a good thing to do in Klingon .
There 's a number of things like that which is violating the rules or tendencies of human phonetics . "
Advertisement
He took a similar approach with the grammar of Klingon :
" The basic order of the words , I had to figure out .
The three basic elements of a sentence are the subject , the verb , and the object .
The subject is who 's doing the action , the verb is what is the action , and the object is who 's receiving the action assuming that 's appropriate to the sentence .
Part of the grammar of English is knowing where in the sentence does the subject and the object fall because otherwise you do n't know who is doing what to whom .
If you look around at all the different languages , there 's all kinds of different orders these things can fall in – it does n't have to be the way English is .
In fact , in some languages it can be any old thing because you mark who 's doing it with little suffixes or something like that .
But ignoring that for the time being …
Mathematically , there 's six possible combinations : subject - verb - object , subject - object - verb , verb - object - subject , verb - subject - object , object - subject - verb , object - subject - verb , and object - verb - subject .
And all of these things are represented in languages in the world somewhere or other , although some are much more common than others .
So if you take this weird notion that the most common is the most human and the least common is the least human , then for Klingon I should pick the least common .
Not because for any other reason than it 's found in the fewest human languages .
And the least common are the ones with the object first , and [ object - verb - subject ] is the one I chose for Klingon .
I chose it -
It 's found in a few languages in the world , not very many , as the basic word order . "

The end result of this work was not limited to what Christopher Lloyd and companied barked in Star Trek III .
The Klingon Dictionary first appeared in 1985 and was updated in 1992 .
It 's sold a half million copies , spawned an iPhone app , and helped give rise to the Klingon Language Institute , dedicated to preserving the Klingon language .
( So it 's sort of like the French Academy , except , you know ... with Klingon . )
But Klingon , for all its comprehensiveness , is missing one rather gigantic aspect of any real language : it has no history .
That 's where you come in .

What You Can Do :
What we have here are two very different approaches to language creation .
Tolkien 's efforts are very much the work of a historical linguist , so paramount above all else is the construction of Elvish languages that show clear change and development through time .
Etymologies are crucial to Tolkien 's works , each word a work of art forming a rich tapestry that reaches back deep into the temporal dimension .
This was his life 's work , an ongoing project to which he devoted decades and likely would n't have completed if he had had centuries .
Advertisement
Marc Okrand , on the other hand , had a much more immediate task : to transform a handful of Klingon names and a few lines of dialogue into a fully - formed language in time for Star Trek III to start filming .
He approached this task as a structural linguist , concentrating on the phonetics and grammar to build up a fully - formed Klingon tongue .
The language he devised is far more comprehensive than either of the Elvish languages , and there 's a lot more you can say in Klingon than the other two .
( There would be absolutely no way to write an Elvish Hamlet while confining oneself to just Tolkien 's work , for instance , but Klingon Hamlet is ready to ship . )
Advertisement
What Klingon lacks , however , is history .
While we can use Tolkien 's etymologies to quite accurately reconstruct what Elvish sounded like millennia before The Lord of the Rings , Klingon remains time - locked in the 23rd and 24th centuries .
You only need to pick up , well , Hamlet to realize how much English has changed in the last few centuries , so there 's every reason to assume the way Klingons would speak their language in 2010 is very different from how they talk in Star Trek .
But there is n't really any way to guess at historical language change based on Klingon as it is now .
The etymologies just are n't there to make reconstructions possible , and any attempt to invent patterned language change would quickly reveal just how ad hoc the construction of Klingon was .
None of this is meant to diminish Okrand 's singular achievement but merely to point out this was n't what he was trying to do .

That 's where you , budding legend of speculative fiction , come into the picture .
Tolkien create historically rich languages that were essentially human .
Okrand create truly alien languages that had no history .
The next great alien language will be the one that combines the best of these two approaches , devising a language with both alien structure and alien history .
Klingon already provides the perfect tutorial on how to make a language sound like it's from another planet , so I 'll leave that aside .
But how do you make languages encode an unearthly history ?
That 's the puzzle I 'll leave you with , although I can offer a few possibilities to get you going .
In fact , Marc Orkand 's introduction to The Klingon Dictionary provides a great example of how Klingon reflects a truly alien culture :
" ... there are no words for greetings , such as hello , how are you , good morning , and so on .
It seems apparent that such words and phrases simply do not exist in Klingon .
When two Klingons meet each other ( except in cases where military protocol determines behavior ) , if anything of an introductory nature is said , it is an expression that can best be translated as What do you want ?
Unlike most speakers of English , who begin conversations with greetings , inquiries about the state of health of the conversants , and remarks about the weather , Klingons tend to begin conversations by simply stating the main points . "
Advertisement
That 's the sort of thing to think about , and then just add a historical dimension .
Did Klingon once have such greeting words , but then the complete militarization of its culture removed them ?
Or did perhaps meanings decay and change over time ?
If they never existed at all , what does that say about the origins of Klingon civilization ?
Moreover , just as Marc Okrand created Klingon by looking at features of human languages and turning them on their head , think about ways to invert the usual patterns of human language change .
I 'll conclude by looking at the biggest one , and the closest thing humanity has to a true language universal , and how flipping it could create an entire alien race .
As a rule , languages only split apart , never merge together .
French and Spanish came from Latin , but they could n't recombine into a neo -Latin .
But what if an alien culture was capable of bringing two languages together into a new , unified tongue ?
Would such an alien species have to be telepathic to negotiate the difficulties of merging meanings and structures together ?
The very exercise of creating a species that could conceivably merge two languages together would by necessity create an unusually rich and well - developed alien culture .
These are the sorts of challenges awaiting the constructor of the next great alien language , but I 'd say they would be well worth the effort .
When we first launched Drink Spirits we were very enthusiastic about white dog ( or unaged whiskey ) .
Our excitement in this space was further fueled by Max Watman and his book , Chasing The White Dog .
In addition to inspiring us , the book has been massively influential , helping move white dog into the national press spotlight , including the New York Times piece , “ Raw Whiskey Finds New Craftsmen and Enthusiasts “ .
We also got spoiled at the start of our white dog adventure with Fingerlakes Distilling ’s Glen Thunder Corn Whiskey and Charbay ’s Double & Twisted light whiskey , two exceptional and unique spirits that represent some of the very best in this category .
As we ’ve continued our adventure we ’ve found that our introduction into the space was atypical of the category , which is populated more by disappointing spirits than exceptional ones .
At it ’s best , white dog can be a very raw and explosive spirit .
It ’s the pure expression of the distilled grain before the whiskey starts its tango with the wood .
Presented at a high proof ( like Wasmund ’s Rye Spirit and Single Malt Spirit which are 124 proof ) , light whiskey can be a union of sweet and fire with deep apricot or banana notes zapped by fiery spice .
But most light whiskeys are brought down to 80 proof where the fire subsides and the fruit notes turn candy - sweet ( almost like a Jolly Rancher ) .
In the case of High West Silver Western Oat Whiskey , the spirit is so smoothed out it could easily be bottled as vodka .
In many ways , white dog is the caterpillar of whiskey : the barrel , the crysalys and the aged whiskey , the butterfly .
Unfortunately , the white dog movement has lead to a selection of spirits which are effectively ripping the caterpillar out of its crysalys well before it ’s been able to become a butterfly .
What you end up with is a half - formed creature , a work in progress , that often represents the worst that whiskey has to offer .
Poorly distilled and lightly aged , a spirit like Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey is probably the best example of the downside to the light whiskey movement .
Being in barrel for a few months dulls the fire of the raw distillate and infuses the wood sugars .
Pulling it out before the barrel can deliver more to the spirit robs it of all the complexity and flavor you get with a good whiskey .
Dead Guy
Whiskey is not the only spirit in this space which is less than half - baked .
Ransom Spirit ’s Whippersnapper
Whiskey is also a train wreck of a whiskey that openly celebrates its lack of aging .
It ’s sort of like a cheese advertising it ’s casein free – the caseins are the very thing which makes a good cheese gooey , sticky and yummy .
The buzz over the white dog category makes a lot of sense .
There ’s a huge boom in micro-distilling in the US and an increasing market demand for whiskey .
Light whiskey is easy to make , costs a fraction of aged whiskey , and does n’t have to sit in barrels for years before it can be sold .
White dog also has a terrific lore behind it – the badboy image of moonshine and its antidisestablishmentarianist roots give the spirit that edge of excitement that is very compelling .
And then there ’s vodka , king of the white spirit since the 60’s , it ’s long - time reign seems to finally be easing , making room for other white spirits to get their moment in the sun .
Combine this with a renaissance of the classic cocktail movement with mixologists who are seeking out more taste than vodka traditionally offers and you ’ve got the search for the next big white spirit – white dog .
While white dog might look good on paper , it simply does n’t deliver as a category .
Without the complexity of an aged whiskey , white dog does n’t hold up in many classic whiskey drinks .
While many mixologists have nobly tried to mix with white dog , the results pale in comparison to similar drinks with fully aged or alternative classic spirits .
White dog is also a fairly poor substitute for vodka in drinks as it ’s not very neutral and its fruit tones can easily turn candy - sweet when mixed .
There are also very few light whiskeys we ’d consider drinking straight and , when stacked next to solid and affordable aged whiskey and bourbon in our liquor cabinet , it ’s a hard sell to pull out the white dog to drink .
At Whiskeyfest we spoke with Kevin Smith from Maker ’s Mark who earlier this year strongly considered jumping on the white dog wagon with their own offering .
Ultimately they decided not to and Smith explained , “ Why would anyone want to drink white dog Maker ’s when you can drink the real full expression of Maker ’s Mark ? ”
The white dog / light whiskey trend is ultimately a crutch for American micro-distillers who really should be spending the time and money on producing fully aged whiskey .
It ’s difficult and expensive to sit and wait for your whiskey to age in barrels but the end result is far superior to the alternative .
We believe we are at the start of a true whiskey revolution in America , with small batch , artisan , hand - crafted whiskeys and bourbons that will raise the bar and create a ton of excitement for the entire category .
But the revolution is n’t ready yet , and when it comes to white dog , that dog just ca n’t hunt .
So as excited as we were about it , it ’s probably best to put that dog down and wait for the right one to come around .
In a small white room above the Berkeley ’s Patient ’s Group marijuana dispensary , three men in spotless white lab coats and masks toil over bins of marijuana .
One uses a high - powered video camera to scan the potent buds for hair , mold , bugs and any other detritus .
The men quietly scoop buds with names like Cali Gold and All - star Jack Frost into labeled bags for sale in the downstairs dispensary .
" We definitely have all the sanitary stuff going on , " said sorter Mark Silva .
" The gloves and the masks and the lab coats . "
This scene is far from the image of camouflaged growers with automatic rifles guarding illegal marijuana crops in Northern California forests .
If anything it ’s another reminder that marijuana has n’t just kicked down the door of mainstream acceptance , it ’s pulled up a seat at the table and kicked up its feet .
" Definitely , opinions are changing , " said Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates .
As a sign of that change , cities like Berkeley are now looking at taxing medicinal and recreational pot in the event Proposition 19 passes on California ’s November Ballot .
The measure would legalize recreational marijuana and tax it .
" If 19 passes in November it ’s going to be a whole different ball game , " said Bates .
" We ’ll have to go back and figure out how we ’re going to regulate it , how we ’re going to sell it , how we ’re going to allow it to be embraced . "
In the meantime , Berkeley ’s City Council met Tuesday night to consider levying its own marijuana tax .
The measure would add a 10 percent tax on gross receipts of recreational marijuana and up to 2.5 percent on medical marijuana .
They approved putting the proposal on the city ’s November ballot .
The measure would also expand the city ’s pot clubs from three to four , and allow up to ten new marijuana cultivation operations in the city .
While the city ’s marijuana clubs generally support the measure , they think the tax on medical cannabis is too high .
" No medication should be taxed , " said Brad Senesac , Communications Director of the Berkeley Patients Group .
" If you were to look at this , medicinal cannabis is supposed to be a true medicine .
It really should n’t be taxed . "
Mayor Tom Bates concedes the tax will only generate about $ 350 thousand dollars a year , a mere drop in the bucket for Berkeley .
But he said the city will at least be prepared if Prop 19 passes .
" This would mean that we move forward asking the voters of Berkeley to change what we currently have now , " said Bates .
And if the white - smocked lab techs bundling up potent bundles of All - star Jack Frost are any indication , what was once a sordid backroom affair , is about to become a full - blown civic love fest .
Good Golly !!

Image caption Cancer cells are notoriously resistant to attempts to kill them
Programmable proteins could soon be revealing how cancer cells survive attempts to kill them .
Built by UK researchers , the chemically engineered molecules are made to resemble key proteins that control the longevity of cancer cells .
The tiny proteins , known as biophotonic nanoswitches , adopt an active form when hit with a pulse of light .
The researchers hope the activated proteins will shut off the processes that keep tumour cells growing .
Protein soup
While all cells strive to stay alive , tumour cells seem particularly resilient towards attack by drugs and other attempts to kill them .
To find a way to interrupt this longevity a group of researchers are developing custom - built peptides ; pieces of proteins that can be manipulated to resemble critical parts of the ones found in cells .
" Proteins only have a function when they adopt a well - defined 3D structure , " said project leader Professor Rudolf Allemann from the School of Chemistry at Cardiff University , who designed the peptides .
Built using a synthesis machine , the normally inactive peptides sport a section that deforms when hit with a flash of light of the right wavelength .
Deforming the peptide turns it from an inert form into one that is active with a shape complementary to its cellular targets .
The active form is exactly the right shape to bind to a location on a larger protein molecule in a cell .
How nanoswitches work Chemically - created biophotonic nanoswitches are attached to short pieces of protein , or peptides .
The nanoswitch " backbone " is activated when it is hit by a certain wavelength of light .
The light causes the nanoswitch to deform , in turn changing the peptide into an active shape .
The peptide can now bind with a target protein in the cell , triggering or shutting down a chemical process .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
" The cell is a thick soup of proteins , with rather uniform and shallow surfaces that are difficult to target with conventional small molecule based drugs , " said Professor Allemann .
The active form acts like a car ignition key turning the " engine " keeping a cell going on or off .
" We try to target these protein surfaces using peptides taken from natural proteins that should allow us to control protein - protein interactions , " he said .
" This is chemistry at work ; based on a fundamental physical understanding of biological chemistry , we use simple chemical building blocks to control the complex biochemical machinery inside a cell . "
Path following
The researchers are not trying to control all the processes going on in a cell .
Instead , said research partner Professor Paul Smith from the Cardiff Medical School , they are focussing on those processes , known as pathways , which help keep a cell healthy .
" There are pathways that signal damage in a cell and decide whether it should die or go on living , " said Professor Smith .
Dr Rachel Errington added : " Those are the pathways that respond to environmental stress .
We 've chosen to target two major pathways knowing that people will be interested in switching them on or off at discrete points . "
Image caption
The nanoswitches could help to grow replacement organs
These pathways , regulated by critical proteins called Bcl - 2 and p53 , control processes such as cell division and cell survival .
Aberrations in the regulation of these pathways account for a large number of tumors .
With the right peptides , it might become possible to effectively switch off a tumour cell simply by applying a pulse of light .
" Biophotonic nanoswitches are now put inside cells and then hit with a pulse of light to see if the biological properties of these cells can be controlled , " said Dr Arwyn Jones of Cardiff University 's School of Pharmacy .
The researchers are refining their techniques by trying to find out how much of their custom - built peptide has to be added to a cell to get an effect , mapping where the nanoswitches travel to and working out the best way to manipulate these critical pathways .
" From an engineering viewpoint we 're particularly interested in the control systems that cells employ to regulate their internal processes and hence maintain their function , " said Professor Huw Summers from the School of Engineering at the University of Swansea .
" Peptide molecules are key components in these regulation systems . "
He added that the team did not simply wish to gain an ability to switch these systems on and off but also wanted to find out whether they could manipulate the rate at which the feedback systems operate .
" We 're also looking at how much light is required to activate the biophotonic nanoswitches and how long they remain in the on - state at body temperature , " he said .
The custom - built peptides fluoresce so the researchers can map where they go once they have been placed inside a cell .
" The early success with tumour cells suggests that the approach may be more widely applicable , " said Dr Errington .
" There 's tissue engineering and all sorts of application areas where we would want to switch a molecular process or change the fate and direction of the pathway , " she said .
If proteins that cause cells to change their type could be controlled in this way , then a pattern of light pulses could transform a uniform sheet of stem cells into tissues containing an ordered array of different cell types - a stepping stone to growing replacement organs .
Oh , sure -- this has certainly been tried before , but given that things like this need a critical mass of followers to be effective , we 're particularly jazzed about Google 's own initiative .
Dubbed ' Open Spot , ' this bloody brilliant Android ( 2.0 and up ) application enables motorists to search for unclaimed spaces that have been reported by other Open Spot users , and once they head elsewhere , it allows them to mark their spot as open and available .
Once a spot is marked , the color gradually fades from red to yellow the longer it remains unclaimed .
We 've given it a quick test here on our end , and while it seems snappy enough ( and yes , we definitely received a Karma Point for every space we dropped ) , the obvious omission is the ability to add notes to each marked place .
There really should be a way to denote whether a spot is metered , covered by some wacky city permit law or submerged in a foot of water -- here 's hoping the next update will enable comments .

Some of the chaos and bloodshed of everyday life on the streets of Mogadishu was visited on the Ugandan capital on Sunday night .
As the bodies of innocents ripped apart while they watched the World Cup final are buried and the burnt remains are sifted there is a keener sense of the cost of ignoring the world ’s most failed state .
This was the Independent ‘s lesson from last weekend ’s deadly Uganda bombings , which killed some 74 people .
It was also decidedly the wrong one , and based on faulty assumptions .
The world has , far from “ ignoring ” Somalia , been trying to install a series of illegitimate governments there for years , and Uganda has been at the forefront of this recently , contributing the most troops to the African Union ’s military adventure into Somalia .
The current government got its start at an outdoor stadium in neighboring Kenya , dubbing themselves the “ Transitional National Government ” ( TNG ) of Somalia and behaving to all appearances as a government in exile , albeit a government only in its members ’ minds .
The history of Somalia for the past several years is a history of several nations trying to shoehorn the TNG into the position of legitimate nation - state , something no one serious believes they can do .
And this attack did not happen in a vacuum but rather came after repeated threats from the Somali militant faction to “ retaliate ” against Uganda for its many , many attacks on residential neighborhoods under al - Shabaab ’s control .
Though one can not but condemn al - Shabaab for taking out its retaliation on innocent civilians , it is also impossible to notice that the Ugandan troops in Somalia have been doing virtually the same thing , responding to ambushes against them by shelling residential neighborhoods , on a regular basis since the troops got there .
In fact since we ’re so keen on the soccer aspect of the killings , let us not forget an incident in mid-January , when AU troops responded to an attack on the presidential palace by al - Shabaab by launching artillery shells at a playground in al - Shabaab - held territory a day later , killing seven children who were playing soccer at the time .
It was shortly after this that al - Shabaab started talking about banning soccer , and while the official line on this is that it proves the group ’s extremism the reality is that it largely is n’t safe to play soccer in Somalia not because of al - Shabaab but because Ugandan and Burundian troops have declared the right to attack any region under “ insurgent ” control , which considering the self - proclaimed government owns little more than a few city blocks in Mogadishu , puts virtually the entire civilian population of Somalia directly in the line of fire .
The notion that al - Shabaab launched this attack out of some religious dislike of watching soccer on television is nonsense , and in reality this is as classic an example of blowback for interventionism as there ever has been .
In fact it seems like Somalia could stand a little more ignoring from the outside world , as one ca n’t help but note that there were n’t any attacks originating from the nation before the “ government ” got kicked out of their hotel rooms in Kenya and convinced the African Union et al to try to prop them up .
Groups like al - Shabaab simply did not exist in Somalia before then , and to the extent that they enjoy any support domestically , it is because they are one of the few groups able to oppose international troops with force of arms .
It may look like a melted British Rail sign but it 's hoped that a new symbol for the Indian rupee will signal India 's growing economic strength ‑ and it will be coming soon to a keyboard near you .
The winning design was selected by the Indian cabinet yesterday from a shortlist of five following a national competition .
Measures are already afoot to have the rupee sign declared a computer standard , meaning it could join currencies such as the pound , dollar , euro and yen on keyboards within two years .
" The distinct symbol denotes the robustness of the Indian economy , " India 's information minister , Ambika Soni , said .
References to sums in rupees currently involve spelling out the word ( as is the case in the Guardian 's style guide ) or giving it the abbreviation Rs or INRs to distinguish it from other Asian countries that use rupees or variations thereof .
" Once accepted , it will stand clear from the clutter of currencies that call themselves rupee or the rupiah , " India 's Telegraph reported .
The winning symbol was the work of Udaya Kumar , a lecture in design at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai .
Speaking to the Indian news website Rediff.com he said : " My design is based on the tricolour , with two lines at the top and white space in between .
I wanted the symbol for the rupee to represent the Indian flag .
It is a perfect blend of Indian and Roman letters : a capital ' R ' and Devanagari ' ra ' which represents rupiya , to appeal to international audiences and Indian audiences . "
Michael Johnson , a director at the award - winning London - based design consultancy johnson banks , said the new symbol fitted with other currency signs but lacked imagination .
" I think it 's a B or B plus .
Most currency symbols follow an established route now ‑ E for euro , Y for yen , now R for rupee .
You could argue that a dynamic emerging economy could have gone for something more unusual and got away with it ‑ I think in the end conservative voices prevailed . "
There was an odd moment during my ( already odd ) cameo on Vernon Kay 's show last week .
They went over to an entertainingly distracted , seemingly drunk George Lamb for an update on Big Brother .
Throughout his bit , there was a girl with her back to the camera , wearing headphones , obviously part of the show , working .
For a lark , Vernon got George Lamb to tap her on the shoulder and make her turn round .
She turned round , slightly self - consciously , and waved .
She had small sweat patches .
Vernon said : " She 's a bit sweaty ! " Brian Dowling , my co-guest , said spitefully : " She 's not wearing make - up ! "
And that was that ; she 'd had her five minutes of fame .
I felt really uncomfortable .
There are many reasons to disapprove of the above events , not least the idea of taking the piss out of someone who is just doing their job and does n't expect to be judged on their appearance , when you yourself are no more than a professional chancer who could just as easily be on the crew ( I 'm talking about Dowling here , not Kay ) .
But I think what troubles me is the notion that if someone 's a woman , it 's fine to expect them to be made up and to bitch about them if they 're not .
Make - up has its uses all right , and it's made people look stunning before now , but overall I would say it is one of the vilest things ever devised -- and not just because I hate having it on my face on TV .
The very fact that it exists means that some women feel they have to wear it every day .
If all the women who spend half an hour " making up " every morning did something else with that half - hour , the results would be startling .
I 'm not blaming the women themselves .
I just think it 's a pity .
And it 's a pity , too , that if you 're a woman but choose not to pretty yourself up , you are categorised as a " quirky " or " alternative " woman , in the same way that a woman with big tits can't just be beautiful , she has to be " the attractive larger woman " in a feature in Heat magazine , who " love X's new curvy look " but two months later will be accusing X of being in " BINGE HELL " .
I realise the subject is rather more complicated than this ; plenty of women find make - up and cosmetics generally empowering , not constricting , and so on .
But I still find it a pity that after everything that 's happened , women are still subject to the sort of easy instant judgement that the fashion world imposes , and some women even actively conspire in it .
That 's all .
I think I 'm a feminist .
Bye .

The Israeli propaganda machine has reached new highs its hopeless frenzy .
It has distributed menus from Gaza restaurants , along with false information .
It embarrassed itself by entering a futile public relations battle , which it might have been better off never starting .
They want to maintain the ineffective , illegal and unethical siege on Gaza and not let the " peace flotilla " dock off the Gaza coast ?
There is nothing to explain , certainly not to a world that will never buy the web of explanations , lies and tactics .
Only in Israel do people still accept these tainted goods .
Reminiscent of a pre-battle ritual from ancient times , the chorus cheered without asking questions .
White uniformed soldiers got ready in our name .
Spokesmen delivered their deceptive explanations in our name .
The grotesque scene is at our expense .
And virtually none of us have disturbed the performance .
The chorus has been singing songs of falsehood and lies .
We are all in the chorus saying there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
We are all part of the chorus claiming the occupation of Gaza has ended , and that the flotilla is a violent attack on Israeli sovereignty - the cement is for building bunkers and the convoy is being funded by the Turkish Muslim Brotherhood .
The Israeli siege of Gaza will topple Hamas and free Gilad Shalit .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yossi Levy , one of the most ridiculous of the propagandists , outdid himself when he unblinkingly proclaimed that the aid convoy headed toward Gaza was a violation of international law .
Right .
Exactly .
It 's not the siege that is illegal , but rather the flotilla .
It was n't enough to distribute menus from Gaza restaurants through the Prime Minister 's Office , ( including the highly recommended beef Stroganoff and cream of spinach soup ) and flaunt the quantities of fuel that the Israeli army spokesman says Israel is shipping in .
The propaganda operation has tried to sell us and the world the idea that the occupation of Gaza is over , but in any case , Israel has legal authority to bar humanitarian aid .
All one pack of lies .
Only one voice spoiled the illusory celebration a little : an Amnesty International report on the situation in Gaza .
Four out of five Gaza residents need humanitarian assistance .
Hundreds are waiting to the point of embarrassment to be allowed out for medical treatment , and 28 already have died .
This is despite all the Israeli army spokesman 's briefings on the absence of a siege and the presence of assistance , but who cares ?
And the preparations for the operation are also reminiscent of a particularly amusing farce : the feverish debate among the septet of ministers ; the deployment of the Masada unit , the prison service 's commando unit that specializes in penetrating prison cells ; naval commando fighters with backup from the special police anti-terror unit and the army 's Oketz canine unit ; a special detention facility set up at the Ashdod port ; and the electronic shield that was supposed to block broadcast of the ship 's capture and the detention of those on board .
And all of this in the face of what ?
A few hundred international activists , mostly people of conscience whose reputation Israeli propaganda has sought to besmirch .
They are really mostly people who care , which is their right and obligation , even if the siege does n't concern us at all .
Yes , this flotilla is indeed a political provocation , and what is protest action if not political provocation ?
And facing them on the seas has been the Israeli ship of fools , floating but not knowing where or why .
Why detain people ?
That 's how it is .
Why a siege ?
That 's how it is .
It 's like the Noam Chomsky affair all over again , but big time this time .
Of course the peace flotilla will not bring peace , and it wo n't even manage to reach the Gaza shore .
The action plan has included dragging the ships to Ashdod port , but it has again dragged us to the shores of stupidity and wrongdoing .
Again we will be portrayed not only as the ones that have blocked assistance , but also as fools who do everything to even further undermine our own standing .
If that was one of the goals of the peace flotilla 's organizers , they won big yesterday .
Five years ago , the noted Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa , who is a Jerusalem Prize laureate , after concluding his visit to Israel , said the Israeli occupation was approaching its grotesque phase .
Over the weekend Vargas Llosa , who considers himself a friend of Israel , was present to see that that phase has since reached new heights of absurdity .

[ compiz ] Compiz 0.9.0 is Released !
Compiz 0.9.0 is released !
This is the first unstable release of the Compiz 0.9 series .
This release represents a complete rewrite of the 0.8 series from C to C++ , brings a whole new developer API , splits rendering into plugins , switches the buildsystem from automake to cmake and brings minor functionality improvements .
This release represents the first developer and tester preview of what will eventually make the 0.10.x stable series .
Please note that as such , it is not yet ready for general use as there are a number of known issues , regressions and incomplete functionality .
The Compiz 0.9.0 tarballs are available at http://releases.compiz.org/0.9.0/ .
You can verify these tarballs using the sha1sums in http://releases.compiz.org/0.9.0/compiz-0.9.0.sha1 , which are signed by Compiz Release Team GPG key ( C2B8F46E ) at http://releases.compiz.org/0.9.0/compiz-0.9.0.sha1.asc .
Please note that each component is also available in its own directory in http://releases.compiz.org/components/ .
Quick changelog : compiz - core : ------------ *
Completely rewritten developer API in C++ , using boost and stl to simplify a number of tasks originally handled in core .
* Reworked plugin function hooking system , where the WRAP / UNWRAP macros have been replaced with ' smart ' function call chains using real function lists that can have any component turned off at any time to save unneeded CPU cycles * Rendering framework split into the composite and opengl plugins , the former making compiz a compositing window manager and the latter performing that compositing using OpenGL .
Such a split will allow new rendering plugins such as XRender and Clutter to be developed as well as for compiz to run as a non-compositing window manager *
Added copytex plugin , which re-implements part of the ' copy mode ' texture binding from Beryl .
While this is slower , it allows for textures that are larger than the maximum texture size allowed by the host 's OpenGL implementation *
Added decoration reparenting to the decoration plugin .
This will allow compiz to run with decorations as a non-compositing window manager .
Reparenting support added to both gtk - window - decorator and kde4 - window - decorator * Added KDE
Plugin to integrate with the QT main loop and create a KApplication , for further integration into KDE .
* Added compiztoolbox library plugin , allows developers to do tedious but repeated actions in many plugins such as set up the application switcher window and draw thumbnails of window * Plugins rewritten in C++ using the new API * DBus plugin now uses the screen number to identify compiz instance .
This means that scripts which use / allscreens will no longer work .
In general this means that paths have now changed to be /org / freedesktop / compiz/screen{screen_number} / ...
In a single instance of compiz , {screen_number} would generally be 0 ( i.e screen0 ) * Shape drawing implemented in annotate .
Also fixed long standing damage bug that caused skips in line drawing .
*
Added serialization interface to core , which allows plugins to save activity states on plugin load / unload and through compiz relaunches .
The data is stored in X11 window properties and automatically dropped when relevant X11 resources are destroyed plugins - main : ------------- *
Rewritten animations interface ; supports object oriented animation construction , which should further simplify creating new animations * Switchers support viewing only icons *
Added support to drag windows to edges and have them fill the adjacent side of the screen * Plugins rewritten in C++ using the new API plugins - extra : -------------- *
Added support for automatic wallpaper rotation *
Added edge support to grid plugin so windows can easily be resized by dragging to an edge or corner * Plugins rewritten in C++ using the new API plugins - unsupported : -------------- *
Rewritten elements interface - allows definition of elements in an object oriented fashion , easily create new plugins that hook into the existing functionality of the plugin * Plugins rewritten in C++ using the new API ccsm : ----- * Number of buttons increased to 20 * Fixed bug newer gtk exposed where values were not read before destroying the dialog window resulting in blank entries compizconfig - backend - gconf : --------------------------- *
CMake buildsystem compizconfig - python
------------------- *
Distutils buildsystem libcompizconfig : ---------------- *
CMake buildsystem * Plugins rewritten in C++ using the new API
Please note that there are new build dependencies for this release , including boost - devel , cmake and cython .
Additionally , libboost is a required runtime dependency .
This is a development release and as such there will likely be bugs .
Feel free to report bugs at our bug tracker at http://bugs.opencompositing.org/.
Currently known issues are : * Miscompilation with GCC 4.5 resulting in the occasional crash on window closes or plugin unloads .
Please compile with GCC 4.4 , or see bug 1308 [ 1 ] : for a workaround to compile with GCC 4.5 * Some SDL applications like frozen - bubble and qemu will not display correctly .
Please launch these applications in a window manager like metacity or kwin first and then switch back to compiz .
Compiz is entirely developed as a volunteer project , and we'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this release .
Translators , testers , the support team and developers : thank you , your continuous contributions made it all possible .
We hope you will enjoy using Compiz as much as we enjoyed writing it ! - The Compiz Team [ 1 ]

Advantages
Compared with conventional drying methods , which are heating from the outside to the inside by heat conduction , microwave show so - called volume heating with the following advantages :
1 , temperature gradient directed towards the surface , i.e. temperatures inside are higher than outside , giving rise to a higher partial pressure that drives the evaporating liquid to the surface consequently , the superficial layer does not dry up completely and the surfaces remain permeable .
2 , the liquid evaporating inside the product is emitted through the porous structure of the solid material ’s macro- capillary system , resulting in a high drying velocity .
3 , the heating of water and most organic solvents occurs selectively - due to the LDer dielectric losses of water as compared to the product to be dried .
4 , swift and thorough drying of moist products with low thermal conductivity static drying of thick layers without frictional losses .
5 , high total efficiency of enerLD application and high - speed control of the enerLD transport .
6 , short processing times , i.e. suitable for automated manufacturing .

Back in February 2009 , we named the Honorable Joseph Wall a Judge of the Day .
Joe Wall , at the time a Wisconsin trial court judge , used the term “ baby mama ” at the sentencing of an African - American defendant .
He also made additional amusing quips — e.g. , suggesting that “ baby mamas ” congregate at “ a club ” to find their unemployed , wastrel boyfriends .
An appeals court , finding Judge Wall ’s comments to be inappropriate , held that the defendant was entitled to a new trial .
But now the Wisconsin Supreme Court has reversed the appeals court , in a unanimous decision — a rarity on that utterly dysfunctional famously fractured court .
So , what did the Wisconsin court conclude ?
Reports Bruce Vielmetti , for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ( via Bad Lawyer ) :
In a rare 7 - 0 ruling , the court rejected the appeals court notion that if a reasonable observer might think racial or gender stereotypes influenced the trial judge , Landray Harris deserved a new hearing .
Rather , the high court found , Harris needed to show by clear and convincing evidence that then - Circuit Judge Joe Wall did base his sentence on such inappropriate factors , and the justices found he did not .
Wall , who left the bench in 2007 to rejoin the U.S. attorney ’s office , managed a chuckle Wednesday when observing that he somehow managed to bring unanimity to Wisconsin ’s often - fractured high court .
“ Race was never a factor in this case , and Harris ’ sentencing attorney told your newspaper as much , ” he said , referring to the original coverage of the appeals court ruling in January 2009 .
Now that he ’s back in federal court , safely ensconced in the U.S. Attorney ’s Office , Wall was able to get slightly snarky about those state appellate judges who got him in trouble before :
“ The Supreme Court , using simple common sense and following established law , found that two judges from the court of appeals lifted out of context four of my words from two separate sections of a 32 - page transcript and twisted the plain meaning of those words into something offensive , ” Wall said .
“ Then they devised their own legal standard to justify the result they sought .
As ( U.S. Supreme Court nominee ) Elena Kagan said in her confirmation hearing , ‘ Results oriented judging is the worst sort of judging . ' ”
Ouch .
Appeals court judges , you just got housed .
( Yes , my knowledge of street lingo is a bit dated . )
Amusingly enough , although the Wisconsin Supreme Court ’s decision was unanimous in terms of result , some justices used the case as an opportunity for airing the court ’s own dirty laundry .
They got in some digs at the author of the court ’s opinion , Justice Michael Gabelman , who was accused of violating the code of judicial conduct by using a race - baiting campaign ad back in 2008 :
[ T] hree justices who had sided against Gableman in his ethics case wrote a concurring opinion that made the point that the appearance of justice is indeed something important to consider .
“ We accepted Harris ’s petition for review to resolve how courts should address questions related to an appearance of bias .
Yet , that issue does not appear in the majority opinion , ” except in two footnotes dismissing the concurrence , wrote Justice Ann Walsh Bradley .
In a bit of measured understatement , Bradley refers to two other cases involving Gableman and the appearance of bias , regarding recusals and a change in the ethics code , and notes , “ Both of these questions have been difficult for the court . ”
Meow .
So much for the stereotype of “ nice ” Midwesterners !

The big news yesterday was that Mark Hamill , Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars franchise , will be appearing at the Star Wars Celebration V convention in Orlando .
This got everyone super excited … temporarily .
You see , Mark Hamill has one of the most outlandish autograph fees in all of fandom .
If you want to get it at Star Wars Celebration V , you ’ll have to pony up $ 125.00 .
That ’s more than double the price that Sir Patrick Stewart ( Star Trek , X - Men ) charges , by the way , and he has two major franchises and he ’s a knight !
But yes , you read that right .
The man wants $ 125.00 to sign his name to a glossy 8×10 photo for fans who ensure he continues to get royalty checks from now until the day he dies .
Fans that made him what he is today .
Fans who clearly are willing to pay that much or he would n’t get away with charging it .
Sadly , this is n’t really breaking news .
Fans have been complaining about Hamill ’s prices for a while now , but apparently not loudly enough .
Seriously people , it ’s time to follow this guy ’s example and just say “ NO ” to Mark Hamill .
This has gotten out of control .
It was bad enough when he was charging $ 100 , but to up it to $ 125 just a year later ?
I know the economy is bad and everyone could use some extra cash , but for cryin ’ out loud , it ’s bad for fans too .
And I ’d like to point out that Carrie Fisher ( Princess Leia ) and Anthony Daniels ( C3PO ) are charging $ 50 , which is peanuts by comparison ( but still pricey really , in the grand scheme of things ) .
If you ’d like to go to Star Wars Celebration V and take out a mortgage on your house to pay Mark Hamill , you can still get a full weekend pass for $ 128 .
You ’ll then need to buy the separate $ 125 autograph ticket from Official Pix , who is handling that for the convention .
Star Wars Celebration V is happening August 12 – 15 , 2010 , at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando , Florida .

Dark within light ( Image : KPA / Zuma / Rex Features )
IS DARK matter lurking at the centre of our bright sun ?
Yes , say two research groups who believe the elusive stuff is cooling the solar core .
The insight does n’t significantly affect the sun ’s overall temperature .
Rather , a core chilled by dark matter would help explain the way heat is distributed and transported within the sun , a process that is poorly understood .
Dark matter does n’t interact with light and so is invisible .
The only evidence for its existence is its gravitational effects on other objects , including galaxies .
These effects suggest dark matter makes up about 80 per cent of the total …
This is a follow - up post to VMware / CentOS build where I showed how I built my CentOS / VMWare server step by step .
You ’ll find that you will want to copy virtual machines to duplicate them .
However , the VMware Server Console does not have a way for you to copy them .
You have to do it with the CLI and root access to the server .
In order to do this quickly , without having to remember what to do , I wrote a script .
This script will copy the VM and change the names in the config file and the harddisk images .
I think there are probably more things that this could do and maybe more efficiently .
However , I find this script to work for me .
Maybe it will for you too .

A Swedish computer security consultant named Dan Egerstad has found a vulnerability that allowed him to obtain the user names and passwords of at least 1,000 e-mail accounts belonging to embassy employees around the world as well as legislators and civil rights workers in Hong Kong and China , and workers in the office of the Dalai Lama .
At least one of the accounts belongs to an ambassador – the Indian ambassador to China .
He also says he found some vulnerable accounts at large companies in the U.S. and the U.K. , though he would n't identify them .
Egerstad posted a list of 100 of those user names and passwords on his web site yesterday to get the attention of the account holders and IT administrators – most of whom he says have so far ignored his warnings about their vulnerability .
He also posted the IP address of the e-mail servers .
He wo n't say exactly what the vulnerability is , but see farther down in this post for details about the program that might be affected .
If anyone can figure out what it might be , send me an e-mail .
Egerstad says he 's read about a thousand e-mails in the vulnerable accounts and has found some pretty sensitive information .
This includes requests for visas ; information about lost , stolen or expired passports ; and an Excel spreadsheet containing the sensitive data of numerous passport holders – including passport number , name , address , and date of birth .
He also found documentation about meetings among government officials .
A reporter for the Indian Express newspaper accessed the account for the Indian ambassador in China and found details of a visit by a member of India 's parliament to Beijing and the transcript of a meeting between a senior Indian official and the Chinese foreign minister .
Egerstad says he did n't find any U.S. embassy or government agency accounts that were vulnerable so far .
But those he did find – and posted on the internet – were accounts for embassies of Iran , India , Japan , Russia , and Kazakhstan .
Forty of the accounts belong to workers at Uzbekistan embassies in various countries .
He also posted addresses for the foreign ministry of Iran , the U.K. visa office in Nepal , the Hong Kong Democratic Party , Hong Kong Liberal Party , the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor , the India National Defence Academy , and the Defence Research & Development Organisation at India 's Ministry of Defence .
The information , to no one 's surprise , reveals some pretty bad password hygiene .
The password for the exposed Iranian embassy accounts , for example , is the name of the country in which the embassy resides or the name of a city .
The user name of those accounts is a variation of the same city or country name used for the password .
Passwords for accounts used by the Hong Kong Liberal Party include " 123456 " and " 12345678 " .
Some of the workers in Indian embassies use " 1234 , " and the password for the India Ministry of Defence account is " password+1 " .
Workers in the Mongolian embassy in the U.S. were just as lazy ; their password is " temp . "
Egerstad says he has at least 900 more e-mail addresses and passwords he could expose ( and no doubt even more than this if he spent the time looking for them ) .
He says he obtained the data not by hacking any computers or servers but through a man - in - the - middle attack involving sniffing unencrypted data that 's broadcasting the password and log - in information for e-mail accounts .
He 's remaining tight - lipped about most of the details , though I did manage to wring some information out of him .
He says no one has figured out the problem program , so if any readers can determine what the issue is , please let me know .
From what he tells me , the vulnerability seems to involve a free encryption program that the users have installed on their desktops .
He says the vulnerability lies in the way the users are implementing the software .
He would n't say conclusively whether or not it 's PGP .
" ( The victims ) are using a technique ( to access their e-mail ) that they do n't understand how it works , " he says .
" They did n't understand how or why to use it . "
He says he found the information a while ago when he decided to test a theory and thinks he 's probably not the first one to discover the problem .
" I 'm pretty sure someone else has found it but they 're just not telling anyone about it , " he says , " and are just using it ( to read vulnerable e-mail accounts ) . "
He sat on the information for a while trying to figure out what to do with it .
He says he contacted some one of the victims , but got no response , which is what led him to finally post the data .
He also says that some Swedish journalists have since contacted all of the embassies whose accounts he exposed online , and that they 've been unresponsive for the most part .
He knows of only one account in which the password has been changed since he exposed it – that of the Russian embassy in Sweden .
I contacted the owners of several exposed accounts in Hong Kong , but none of them responded to my queries .
I did , however , get an answer to an e-mail I sent to Ken Chan at the One Country Two Systems Research Institute of Hong Kong , whose account information and password had been posted on Egerstad 's web site .
In response to my e-mail warning Chan that his account had been compromised and that intruders might already be reading his e-mail , I got a warm response from someone who clearly had compromised Chan 's account and read my e-mail in his inbox .
The intruder sent his greeting from a Gmail account :
From : kenloveskim@gmail.com
Dear Kimsey .
I really appreciate your concern for my email account .
You are cute , and i love you . :-)
I look forward to be seeing you soon .
Take care .
Sincerely , Ken .

I was recently writing my PhD thesis ( which is about CHP ) , and writing the conclusions got me thinking about weaknesses of CHP .
( For newcomers : CHP is an imperative message - passing concurrency library for Haskell . )
When you ’ve been working on some software for several years , you want to believe it ’s fantastic , wonderful , flawless stuff and that everyone should use it .
But why might CHP not be the best thing ever ?
( Other suggestions are welcome , honest ! )
Some aspects of the API design might fit into this category , and in this post I ’ll discuss one of the API choices behind CHP , namely : having a special CHP monad instead of using the IO monad that sits underneath .
This may have wider relevance to other libraries that similarly build on top of IO .
I ’m going to invert the flow of this post : later on I ’ll explain why I created a CHP monad , but first I ’ll discuss what problems it causes .
IO vs CHP
The CHP monad is a layer on top of the IO monad ( think of it as a few monad transformers on top of IO ) .
What difference does it make to the user to have the CHP monad instead of the IO monad that underlies it ?
Lifting IO
CHP being a layer on top of IO means that you can “ lift ” IO actions into the CHP monad to use IO actions in your CHP processes .
In Haskell , all actions in a monadic block must be of the same type .
But this can not be done automatically .
So if you have an IO action like touchFile :: String -> IO ( ) and the standard CHP function readChannel :: Chanin a -> CHP a , you cannot write :
do fileName <- readChannel fileNameChan touchFile fileName
The first action is CHP and the second is IO — Haskell ca n’t reconcile the two .
There are two fixes for this .
One is to use a package like monadIO , which defines several standard IO actions to have types like : touchFile :: MonadIO m => String -> m ( ) , i.e. to be able to fit into any monad built on top of IO ( some argue all IO - based functions should have a type like this ) .
Then you can write the code above .
But the monadIO package only supports a few core IO actions , and any time you use another IO - based library ( like , say , network ) you are stuck .
The other fix is to use the liftIO_CHP :: IO a -> CHP a function that exists exactly for this purpose .
That works , but it gets rather verbose :
do fileName <- readChannel fileNameChan liftIO_CHP $ touchFile fileName
If you have lots of IO and CHP actions interspersed , it clutters up the code and makes it less readable .
What ’s galling is that liftIO_CHP has no particular semantic effect ; it ’s only really needed ( to my mind ) to placate the type - checker .
This lifting problem is not specific to CHP , incidentally : it is a problem for all monad transformer libraries .
Adding any monad transformer on top of IO requires lifting functions such as liftIO_CHP .
Just a little CHP
Imagine that you have written a program that does n’t use CHP .
For all the imperative I/O parts it probably uses the ubiquitous IO monad .
Now you want to add some concurrency .
If you use MVars , you just need to create them and use them — writing and reading with MVars is done in the IO monad .
The STM library has its own monad , but this is a monad in which you write a small transaction and then execute it in the IO monad , so the rest of your program can happily remain in the IO monad .
But if you want to add a little CHP , suddenly you need to be in the CHP monad !
You ca n’t just use runCHP :: CHP a -> IO ( Maybe a ) at the points where you want to use CHP .
Firstly , the library is not built to be used like that ( and the API does n’t support being used like that ) .
Secondly , if you have to tag all the CHP actions in the IO monad with runCHP , you ’re not much better off than you were when you had to tag all the IO actions in the CHP monad with liftIO_CHP .
The “ correct ” way to add some CHP to your program is to adjust the whole program to be inside the CHP monad .
You need to either change the types of your functions that used to be in the IO monad to be in the CHP monad ( with varying amounts of liftIO_CHP ) or you need to wrap them in CHP wrappers .
That ’s quite an overhead , especially if you would prefer to gradually introduce some CHP into your program .
I do n’t like to be forcing people to put their entire program inside CHP to get anywhere .
( This reminds me a bit of emacs , where questions involving loading and quitting emacs to do other tasks often elicit the response : do n’t quit emacs , just do everything from inside emacs . )
So what is the CHP monad for ?
So far we ’ve explored all the problems of the CHP monad , which may have convinced you that it was a bad design decision .
Now I want to explain what the CHP monad does ( over and above IO ) and where it might be difficult to replace CHP with plain IO .
Poison
CHP has the notion of poison .
Channels can be set into a poisoned state , and any attempt to use them thereafter results in a poison exception being thrown .
The CHP monad incorporates this using a very standard error - monad ( - transformer ) mechanism .
This could easily be implemented using the standard Haskell exception mechanisms that exist in the IO monad .
I guess in general , an error monad transformer on top of IO is somewhat redundant .
Traces
A nice feature of CHP is that tracing support is built in , and can be turned on or off at run-time .
This used to be done using a state - monad ( - transformer ) , but the problem with implementing it that way is that if a process deadlocks , the state is lost .
Since the main time you want the trace is when a process deadlocks , this was quite a limitation !
So now it works by having a mutable ( IORef / TVar ) variable for recording the trace , with a reader - monad ( - transformer ) containing the address of that mutable variable along with an identifier for the current process .
At first , I thought to replicate this functionality I would need some sort of thread - local storage , which is discussed a little on an old Haskell wiki page .
Now thinking about it , I could hold information on whether tracing is turned on in some sort of singleton variable ( that is initialised once near the beginning of the program and read - only thereafter ) , and use Thread Id in lieu of a process identifier .
Process identifiers in CHP at the moment have information on their ancestry , but I could easily record ( during the runParallel function ) a map from Thread Id to ancestry information in the trace .
Choice actions
The other functionality that the CHP monad supports is choosing between the leading action of two code blocks .
That is , this code :
( readChannel c >>= writeChannel x ) < |> ( readChannel d >>= writeChannel y)
chooses between reading from channels “ c ” and “ d ” .
Once a value arrives on one of those channels , the choice is made for definite .
After that , the value is sent on either the channel x or the channel y respectively .
This is slightly unusual for Haskell , but I ’ve found it helps to make writing CHP programs a lot easier .
( I discussed this in more detail in the appendix of a recent draft paper . )
There is no way to replicate the same functionality in the IO monad .
One alternative to this style of API is to use a style more like CML .
In fact I ’ve previously released a “ sync ” library that is a cut - down version of CHP with a CML - style API in the IO monad .
So something similar to that may be acceptable ; one possibility might be :
choose :: [ forall a .
( Event a , a -> IO b ) ] ->
IO b
( Hoping I have my forall in the right place there !
Is that technically an ImpredicativeType ? )
Which would mean I could write the above as :
choose [ ( readChannel c , writeChannel x ) , ( readChannel d , writeChannel y ) ]
This could be done without the nasty types if I use a special bind - like operator ( the CML library calls this exact same function wrap ) :
( |>= ) :: Event a -> ( a -> IO b ) ->
Event b
That , along with sync :: Event a ->
IO a would allow me to write something like :
sync $ ( readChannel c |>= writeChannel x ) < |> ( readChannel c |>= writeChannel y)
That might not be too terrible , although maybe a better combination of symbols for my bind - like operator might be better .
Summary
The more I think about ( and write about ) this issue , the more I begin to think that I would be better off removing the CHP monad .
Slipping back to the IO monad would allow easier integration with existing Haskell code , and hence easier uptake of the library .
But that ’s quite a shift in the API — almost every single function in the CHP library would have to change its type .
Is that a jump that can be made by shifting from CHP 2.x to 3.x , or is it perhaps better to start again with a new library and build from there ?
( This brings to mind several recent discussions on haskell - cafe and the resulting wiki page on whether to rename / re-version — although CHP does n’t have as many users as FGL , so far as I know ! )
There may actually be a relatively easy way to transition with such a major change ; defining :
type CHP a = IO a liftIO_CHP = id run_CHP p = ( Just < $> p ) `onPoisonTrap` return Nothing
Should probably allow most existing code to keep working without modification , except for choice .
All opinions are welcome on whether to dump the CHP monad for IO , especially if you use the library .

Government would have “ absolute power ” to seize control of the world wide web under Lieberman legislation
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , June 16 , 2010
The federal government would have “ absolute power ” to shut down the Internet under the terms of a new US Senate bill being pushed by Joe Lieberman , legislation which would hand President Obama a figurative “ kill switch ” to seize control of the world wide web in response to a Homeland Security directive .
Lieberman has been pushing for government regulation of the Internet for years under the guise of cybersecurity , but this new bill goes even further in handing emergency powers over to the feds which could be used to silence free speech under the pretext of a national emergency .
“ The legislation says that companies such as broadband providers , search engines or software firms that the US Government selects “ shall immediately comply with any emergency measure or action developed ” by the Department of Homeland Security .
Anyone failing to comply would be fined , ” reports ZDNet ’s Declan McCullagh .
The 197 - page bill ( PDF ) is entitled Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act , or PCNAA .
Technology lobbying group TechAmerica warned that the legislation created “ the potential for absolute power , ” while the Center for Democracy and Technology worried that the bill ’s emergency powers “ include authority to shut down or limit internet traffic on private systems . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The bill has the vehement support of Senator Jay Rockefeller , who last year asked during a congressional hearing , “ Would it had been better if we ’d have never invented the Internet ? ” while fearmongering about cyber - terrorists preparing attacks .
The largest Internet - based corporations are seemingly happy with the bill , primarily because it contains language that will give them immunity from civil lawsuits and also reimburse them for any costs incurred if the Internet is shut down for a period of time .
“ If there ’s an “ incident related to a cyber vulnerability ” after the President has declared an emergency and the affected company has followed federal standards , plaintiffs ’ lawyers cannot collect damages for economic harm .
And if the harm is caused by an emergency order from the Feds , not only does the possibility of damages virtually disappear , but the US Treasury will even pick up the private company ’s tab , ” writes McCullagh .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Tom Gann , McAfee ’s vice president for government relations , described the bill as a “ very important piece of legislation ” .
As we have repeatedly warned for years , the federal government is desperate to seize control of the Internet because the establishment is petrified at the fact that alternative and independent media outlets are now eclipsing corporate media outlets in terms of audience share , trust , and influence .
We witnessed another example of this on Monday when establishment Congressman Bob Etheridge was publicly shamed after he was shown on video assaulting two college students who asked him a question .
Two kids with a flip cam and a You Tube account could very well have changed the course of a state election , another startling reminder of the power of the Internet and independent media , and why the establishment is desperate to take that power away .
The government has been searching for any avenue possible through which to regulate free speech on the Internet and strangle alternative media outlets , with the FTC recently proposing a “ Drudge Tax ” that would force independent media organizations to pay fees that would be used to fund mainstream newspapers .
Similar legislation aimed at imposing Chinese - style censorship of the Internet and giving the state the power to shut down networks has already been passed globally , including in the UK , New Zealand and Australia .
We have extensively covered efforts to scrap the internet as we know it and move toward a greatly restricted “ internet 2 ” system .
Handing government the power to control the Internet would only be the first step towards this system , whereby individual ID ’s and government permission would be required simply to operate a website .
The Lieberman bill needs to be met with fierce opposition at every level and from across the political spectrum .
Regulation of the Internet would not only represent a massive assault on free speech , it would also create new roadblocks for e-commerce and as a consequence further devastate the economy .

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2010 July 4
Companion of a Young , Sun-like Star Confirmed
Credit : Gemini Observatory , D. Lafreniere , R. Jayawardhana , M. van Kerkwijk ( Univ. Toronto )
Explanation :
The first direct image of an extrasolar planet orbiting a star similar to our Sun has been confirmed .
Located just 500 light - years away toward the constellation Scorpius , the parent star , cataloged as 1RXS J160929.1-210524 , is only slightly less massive and a little cooler than the Sun .
The star is , however , much younger , a few million years old compared to the middle - aged Sun 's 5 billion years .
This sharp infrared image shows the young star 's planetary companion positioned above and left of center .
The planet is estimated to have a mass about 8 times the mass of Jupiter , and orbit a whopping 330 times the Earth - Sun distance from its parent star .
The young planetary companion is still hot and relatively bright in infrared light , likely due to the heat generated during its formation by gravitational contraction .
In fact , such newborn planets are easier to detect before they age and cool and become much more faint .
The discovery image , shown above , was taken in 2008 but confirmed only recently by noting that the planet stayed with its parent star as background stars slightly shifted over time .
The previous essay sparked a lively discussion about the potential of methanol as a fuel , so I decided to write an essay particularly devoted to methanol .
I was especially motivated to write this because of hypocrites who profess to be all about renewable energy and weaning the U.S. off of foreign oil – which explains their rabid support for corn ethanol – and then when the conversation turns to methanol they start to bad mouth it .
When talking about methanol , hypocrites will tell you that “ it is toxic . ”
But these people have never raised that issue over highly toxic denatured ethanol .
They speculate that capital costs will be low for cellulosic ethanol but high for methanol .
They complain about the lower energy density of methanol , but bring up ethanol and they will tell you all about the possibilities of designing engines to compensate for ethanol ’s lower energy density relative to gasoline .
Yet they do n’t mention any possibility of optimizing engines for methanol .
It simply has less energy .
End of story .
They will talk about ethanol being pragmatic and practical , ignoring the fact that 1 ) .
The energy return on the process is very low , hence practicality is enabled by low fossil fuel prices ; 2 ) .
The “ practicality ” is only there because of heavy lobbying which led to very generous federal subsidies and mandates ; 3 ) .
The vision of next generation practicality is because people sometimes make very wild extrapolations on costs for cellulosic ethanol ( which we are n’t allowed to do with methanol , because after all , it is n’t practical ) .
Ethanol ’s “ pragmatism ” is far more due to the fact that it has lobbying organizations like Growth Energy , The American Coalition for Ethanol , and the Renewable Fuels Association spending millions of dollars per year to constantly tell the public and the politicians how pragmatic ethanol is – which by the way we need to keep subsidizing and protecting with tariffs .
Methanol does n’t have that advantage , thus it is “ impractical . ”
Let ’s address some of the silliness right now .
As has been pointed out , you can buy methanol today for around $ 1.00 per gallon .
This is a big , well - established business that does not receive heavy subsidies and government support as ethanol does .
On a per BTU basis , unsubsidized methanol costs $ 17.61 per million BTUs .
You can buy ethanol today – ethanol that has received billions in taxpayer subsidies – for $ 1.60 per gallon .
On a per BTU basis , heavily subsidized and mandated ethanol sells for $ 21.03 per million BTUs .
( See the energy tables here ) .
Yes , you read that correctly .
We are paying 20 % more for ethanol enabled via highly paid lobbyists , heavy government intervention , taxpayer funds , and protectionist tariffs than we are for methanol that has long been produced subsidy - free .
Yet ethanol is “ practical . ”
( If we make that gallon per gallon comparison that ethanol proponents like to make when comparing gasoline to less energy dense ethanol , then ethanol costs 60 % more than methanol ) .
Of course ethanol proponents will tell you that commercial cellulosic ethanol is just around the corner , as it has been for 100 years .
Ethanol fans will point to projections of companies like Fiberight who suggest that someday they will produce cellulosic ethanol for $ 1.65 per gallon .
“ Ha !
Top that ! ” – say the ethanol proponents .
The problem is that they do not understand the context of such projections .
If I plug methanol into that same model – produce it from biomass and assume generous tipping fees – my methanol projections can come in at under $ 0.50 per gallon .
But methanol does n’t have a big lobby and 42 senators from farm states it can count on for perpetual support .
Ethanol opponents and / or gasoline proponents will point out the issue with ethanol ’s 76,000 BTU / gal energy content versus gasoline ’s 115,000 BTU / gal energy content .
The ethanol proponents will say “ but , but ethanol has a higher octane .
Therefore you could design an engine with a higher compression ratio to even out that energy deficit . ”
Then when the talk turns to methanol , those same people will say “ But methanol has a lower energy content than ethanol . ”
These people are no longer interested in optimized engines ; they only wish to point out that methanol has lower energy content .
The fact is , methanol simply has not had the same sort of political favoritism , but is in my opinion a far superior option to ethanol as a viable , long - term energy option for the world .
Here is why I believe that .
As already pointed out , we had a thriving methanol industry long before the government created ( and continues to support ) via our taxpayer funds a thriving ethanol industry .
So in my opinion methanol wins the first generation battle on the technical and economic merits , and loses the very important political battle .
But the next generation is what is going to be important .
Biomass only contains 30 - 50 % cellulose , and a very large fraction of the biomass will be inaccessible for a cellulosic ethanol process .
After a series of complex steps , a very dilute solution of ethanol can be produced , which then must undergo an energy intensive distillation process .
Of course you can use the remaining lignin fraction for process heat , after it undergoes an energy - intensive drying process .
So I may project that I can produce it cheaply if I pretend someone is going to pay me a lot to relieve them of their biomass – but I will never , EVER , make it efficiently .
That is simply the nature of the beast .
But in my opinion a high utilization of the available BTUs will be a very high priority in an energy - constrained future .
For methanol , we can produce it from biomass via a similar process to how it is produced for $ 1.00 per gallon today .
There are numerous biomass gasifiers out there .
Some are even portable .
They do not require high fossil fuel inputs and they utilize a much larger fraction of the biomass .
They are n’t limited to cellulose .
They gasify everything – cellulose , hemicellulose , lignin , sugars , proteins – all organic components .
And if there is also a heating application , the combined heat and fuel / power efficiency of a biomass to methanol via gasification route is going to put cellulosic ethanol to shame .
In any case , the efficiency of biomass gasification to methanol is going to put cellulosic ethanol to shame , because it does n’t have to deal with all of that water present in the ethanol process .
( RR : Edited to remove a YouTube video on a modular methanol unit ) .
Finally , ethanol is inappropriate as a replacement for distillate fuels .
Methanol , on the other hand , is easily converted to di-methyl - ether ( DME ) , which is a very nice distillate replacement .
China already has a big head start on the rest of the world , as they saw the potential for DME while the U.S. was spending billions to build an ethanol industry .
( See my story : Keep Your Eye on DME ) .
So the next time an ethanol hypocrite tells you how good ethanol is relative to gasoline , but then turns around and tells you how bad methanol is relative to ethanol , you may want to explain that they have confused political favoritism for technical merits .
( Or you can conclude that they have a vested ethanol interest ) .
When they explain how first generation corn ethanol is paving the way for cellulosic ethanol , point out that both first generation and second generation methanol will beat the cost of ethanol on a per gallon – and more importantly on an energy equivalent basis .
When they argue about methanol ’s toxicity , ask them about the last time they drank denatured ethanol or gasoline ( or how many people are impacted each year by alcoholism ) .
When they point out that subsidized ethanol is becoming more competitive with gasoline , ask them if they have priced unsubsidized methanol lately .
Such is the nature of hypocrisy .
Their solution is good , and yours is bad even if it shares the same qualities as theirs .
The fact is , it is n’t a bias against ethanol that causes me to favor methanol .
I favor methanol because my view is long - term , and not based on political favoritism or a half - cycle of the very cyclical energy industry .
Ethanol has yet to even see one full cycle of the energy roller - coaster , which oil refiners can tell you is brutal .
Ethanol producers are further tied to the cyclical nature of commodity foods .
For these reasons , I simply do not believe ethanol will be a viable long - term answer to oil depletion , and the only reason it appears to have promise now is we have the luxury of subsidizing and mandating the industry which remains heavily reliant on cheap corn and cheap energy .
Now if someone can figure out how to efficiently gasify biomass and convert it to ethanol ( which was the Range Fuels model ) , I will certainly change my tune .

Do you think you have slow Internet access with DSL , cable , broadband , or satellite ?
Do you have internet speeds of 3 , 6 , 1 Artwork : Chip Taylor 2 , or even 20 Mbps ?
If you still think your Internet access is slow , then quantum Internet may be right for you .
And that is exactly what physicists at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics are trying to create .
The physicists have invented what they are calling a " quantum transistor . "
A traditional transistor is a semiconductor device which amplifies a signal , or opens or closes a circuit .
Transistors are in about every known electronic out there and form a vital portion of your pc when it comes to computing speed .
What makes the quantum transistor so special is that it uses the properties of quantum physics in which particles can communicate across open space without ever touching .
In this case the quantum transistor uses one beam of light to control the properties of another , meaning that " information " can travel ( or be transferred ) from point A to point B without ever making the trek .
A similar quantum mechanical transistor , the Double Electron Layer Tunneling Transistor ( DELTT ) , has been developed by the Sandia development team , a laboratory of the Department of Energy ( DOE ) .
According to Sandia , the device is capable of running at a trillion operations per second , or roughly ten times the speed of the fastest transistor circuits currently in use .
You can see where this spooky physics could drastically improve the speed of Internet communication and computing .
With groups like Sandia and the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics , the quantum internet and computing age may be just around the corner .

The Greencoat Boy pub in Westminster has refused to serve LGBT Labour members this evening at their post - AGM social .
The manager told members he would have refused their booking if he ’d known it was for an LGBT group .
The size of the group – shown here standing at the bar after they were refused service – shows just how much custom this pub was prepared to turn away :
This is illegal and the LGBT Labour comrades have reported it to the police as a hate crime :
In PR terms there are probably few more stupid things you can do than piss off LGBT Labour .
‘ Greencoat Boy ’ is currently the top Twitter trending topic in the UK .
You can show your support on Facebook here .
You can also take the following action , and I ’d encourage you to do so :
– leave comments on online pub review sites such as Fancy A Pint and Beer in the Evening
– email the chain that runs The Greencoat Boy , Punch Taverns
– email Cllr Audrey Lewis , Chair of Licensing , Westminster Council
– if you ’re a Labour supporter , join the fightback against homophobia and support your LGBT comrades by joining LGBT Labour .
“ The Chaocipher ” is a devious cipher system invented in 1918 by John F. Byrne : allegedly , it was so complex that nobody could crack his challenge ciphertexts ( even with the plaintext to refer to ! ) , yet was so simple that its mechanism was claimed to comprise only two rotating disks small enough to fit in a cigar box , and could be operated by a ten - year - old ( admittedly a diligent , determined and well - practised one ) to encipher and decipher texts .
Hence , the Chaocipher ’s long - standing mystery revolved around three questions :
Was the Chaocipher for real ?
( i.e. could something so simple really produce such tricksy ciphertext ) ?
Was it more secure than , say , the Enigma machine ?
More to the point , is the Chaocipher actually an unbreakable cipher ?
As of a few years ago , only three people knew the Chaocipher ’s secrets – John Byrne Jr ( the inventor ’s son ) , and two Cryptologia editors ( who saw it in 1990 but were sworn to silence ) .
Yet as Chaucer noted , time and tide wait for no man ( not even Cryptologia editors ) – so there was a very real ( and growing ) possibility that the secrets of the Chaocipher might somehow get lost forever .
Hence last August , Moshe Rubin – who CM readers may well recall as the zesty Israeli software / crypto guy who not long before had set up the Chaocipher Clearing House website – decided to try to contact John Jr before it was too late , and so cold - called his way through the list of Byrnes living in Vermont .
Before long , Moshe found himself in contact with Patricia Byrne ( John Jr ’s wife ) from whom he discovered the sad news that her husband had passed away a year or two previously .
However , because Pat Byrne was already looking for a buyer for her husband ’s cryptological material , Moshe put her in contact ( via David Kahn ) with David D’Auria , the chairman of the National Cryptological Museum ’s Acquisitions Commitee .
Somewhat surprisingly , after a couple of months Pat Byrne very generously decided to donate the whole set to the NCM , a terrific gesture which I ( for one ) highly appreciate ( and I hope that you do too ! )
And so it came to be that Moshe Rubin found himself allowed what he describes as “ preview access to some of the material “ .
Although he found that the precise setup John Byrne
Sr had employed was not immediately obvious from the material to hand , Moshe burnt a load of midnight oil ( is elbow grease more or less inflammable ? ) before finally managing to reconstruct the original algorithm in all its subtly obfuscatory glory .
Just as Byrne had described , his Chaocipher used two rotors ( with the plaintext alphabet on the right rotor and the ciphertext alphabet on the left rotor ) BUT with both alphabets altered slightly ( let ’s call this process ‘ twizzling ’ , for want of a better word ) after processing each letter .
I ’ve hacked together a 30 - second Chaocipher animation on YouTube to try to demonstrate Byrne ’s twizzlification …
Rather than go through the fine details here , I ’m happy to refer you to Moshe ’s detailed ( and very readable ) description of the process here : the only significant difference between my video and his text is that because the rotors mesh ( and hence physically rotate in opposite directions to each other ) , the numbering sequence on each rotor is reversed relative to the other – i.e. even though # 1 is at the top of each rotor , # 2 and # 3 proceed clockwise on the right ( plaintext ) rotor but anticlockwise on the left ( ciphertext ) rotor .
Whereas in his text , both numbering systems run in parallel to each other ( which might confuse you , it certainly confused me a little ) .
Of course , the obvious practical weakness of the Chaocipher is that any errors in enciphering , transmission , and deciphering get near - irreversibly propagated through the rest of the message : which probably makes the whole system too fragile to use in wartime , however cryptographically secure it may be ( and , answering the second question above , I suspect that it may well prove to be more complex than Enigma , for it really is quite a fiendish system ) .
But is it ( practically ) unbreakable ?
Well , the obvious answer would be that if it has now been released into the wild , you ’d have thought someone in a three - letter - agency ( or GCHQ , naturally ) would have worked out a clever way in .
However , I ’m not 100 % sure that has happened yet … so , interesting times .
All credit to Moshe Rubin , then , for his persistence and hard work bringing this cipher mystery into the light : he has a Cryptologia paper coming up , and plenty more work to do over coming months ( or years ? ) fleshing out the behind - the - scenes story from the stack of Byrne ’s papers now in the NCM .
It ’s a fascinating slice of cipher history , and I wish him the very best of luck with the inevitable book and selling the movie rights ! 😉

Update : I ’ve added a follow - on Chaocipher post here , discussing the intriguing parallels between the Chaocipher and chaos theory …
Washington ( CNN ) --
More U.S. soldiers killed themselves last month than in recent Army history , according to Army statistics released Thursday , confounding officials trying to reverse the grim trend .
The statistics show that 32 soldiers killed themselves in June , the highest number in a single month since the Vietnam era .
Twenty - one of them were on active duty , while 11 were in the National Guard or Army Reserve in an inactive status .
Seven of those soldiers killed themselves while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan , according to the Army numbers .
The spike comes after the monthly suicide numbers had dropped following a January high of 28 , and Army officials admit they still have n't answered the question of why troops are committing suicide at a record rate .
" There were no trends to any one unit , camp , post or station , " said Col.
Chris Philbrick , head of the Army 's suicide prevention task force .
" I have no silver bullet to answer the question why . "
He said he could offer only what he has said before : " Continued stress on the force and the opportunities we have been facing in terms of the challenges in the Army continue to cause these events to take place . "
Including the June numbers , 145 soldiers have killed themselves this year , more than half of the total number for all of 2009 , according to Army statistics .
In 2009 , a record - breaking year for suicides in the service , 245 soldiers killed themselves .
In another attempt to put a halt to the trend , the Army released a suicide prevention video , a follow - up to one released last year .
The updated video is designed to " hit home " with soldiers and instill the importance of getting help , Philbrick said .
The video , titled " Shoulder to Shoulder : I Will Never Quit , " begins with the compelling story of a soldier whose wife said she was divorcing him .
The soldier , Spc. Joseph Sanders , says his wife was his whole world .
" I grabbed my rifle , put it under my chin and pulled the trigger , " Sanders says .
The gun did not fire , he says , and when he took the rifle apart he discovered that a key part was missing .
His Army buddy then tells viewers he removed the part because Sanders was showing signs that he could kill himself .
Asked why the Army thinks this video will be more effective than the first one , Philbrick said the soldiers will relate to it better .
Watch the video on the Army 's Suicide Prevention website
The first video , made up of a mix of actors and real soldiers , " sucked , " he said .
It was rushed out , and troops did not believe in it .
He said some even openly laughed at it .
" This video has all real soldiers with real stories , " Philbrick said .
The video is part of a series of efforts to cut the suicide rate .
Last year , the Army required all soldiers around the world to stop working and spend a day watching the first video and receiving suicide prevention training .
Philbrick said the alarming June numbers will not bring another Army - wide training day , called a stand - down .
He said the new video will be incorporated immediately into the standard suicide prevention training for new troops and the yearly training all soldiers go through .

Wrong for the Democratic Party , Wrong for America , Fox " Democrats , " Artur & Lori
Last night it was n't only conservative corporate hacks like former - Blue Dog- turned - Republican Parker Griffith ( who was slaughtered in the GOP primary , not even making it to a runoff against some nutcase teabagger ) and Palin - backed Angela McGlowan ( who came in a distant third in the GOP primary in Mississippi ) who had terrible nights .
Artur Davis has always been thought of as a Democrat with a bright future , until last night .
He spent the last year and a half moving profoundly right :
He went from a moderate 70.82 ProgressivePunch lifetime voting score to a dismal and reactionary 31.58 since Obama became President and , more importantly , since he started campaigning to be governor of Alabama .
His vote against the health care reform bill was probably the last straw for his congressional constituents , who gave Ron Sparks majorities in 10 of the 12 counties that make up AL - 07 , Davis ' own congressional district !
Statewide , Sparks took 199,190 votes ( 62.4 % ) to Davis ' 119,908 votes ( 37.6 % ) .
Davis ' strategy -- one long encouraged by Rahm Emanuel and the DCCC ( see Ken 's perceptive stinky cheese story from yesterday ) -- to move to the political right backfired ... very badly .
It 's a losing strategy ; when conservatives vote , they tend to prefer to vote for real conservatives , not Democrats playing the role .
Will the Democrats learn anything from Davis ' disaster last night ?
Not. A. Chance .
And especially not know - it - all powermongers like Emanuel and his female doppelganger Debbie Wasserman Schultz .
They will continue hunting out reactionary candidates who apologize for being Democrats and , when they can slip into office , vote with the GOP .
A perfect example -- among so many -- is reactionary Blue Dog Lori Edwards , being fiercely pushed on Democrats by Wasserman Schultz .
Although they 're attempting to gussie her up as a moderate , Edwards is thenon - incumbent so far this year to be endorsed by and financed by the conservative Blue Dog caucus .
Wasserman Schultz and her anti-Social Security ally Allen Boyd are hammering lobbyists and fellow Democrats -- including politically naive progressives -- to donate to Edwards .
And why ?
So there will be another anti-government , anti-healthcare , anti-working family Democrat to cross the aisle and vote with Boehner at every opportunity ?
The irony here is that the far more electable Democrat , 2008 Democratic candidate Doug Tudor , is also in the race .
He is n't a self - funder -- a cardinal sin among party insiders -- and he was n't an ass - kisser when he had the temerity to ask Wasserman Schultz for help back then .
Last night , as Artur Davis ' strategy of abandoning the same kinds of values and principles that faux Democrats ( and DCCC faves ) like Ed Case and Tim Mahoney have abandoned was blowing up in his face , we reached Doug Tudor and asked him about why party insiders always seem to be pushing anti-working family Democrats like Edwards and Davis in primaries .
“ Lori , " he told us , " may call herself ‘ centrist ’ or whatever other deceptive term she wants , but the truth is she is a conservative .
Having never before run in a Democratic primary -- with the exception of the 2000 Congressional race in which she quit -- Lori showed her true colors early in this race when she actively sought the Blue Dog endorsement .
Every Democratic and Independent voter who worked for and voted for change and hope in 2008 will do well to remember it is Blue Dog conservative Democrats who are blocking the President ’s attempts to reform healthcare , to reform the financial sector , and blocking his attempts to extend programs which directly benefit working people and middle class families .
Lori can join her conservative friends in decrying government , but she certainly should n’t be so callous to the many benefits government brings to the countless FL - 12 residents who were hurt by the conservative economic policies to which she ascribes .
" As for me , I ’ll stand with the many progressives throughout America ’s history who have fought the battles that needed to be fought .
It was n’t popular to stand with unions , to end the Hoover - era giveaways to Wall Street and industrial robber barons , to provide a security net for our seniors , to integrate the Armed Forces , to integrate our schools and public places , to ensure the voting rights of all Americans , to provide health care to our elderly , and to expand that coverage to nearly all Americans .
It was n’t popular , but progressives like Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt , Harry Truman , Jack Kennedy and Barack Obama , as well as Dr. King , Robert Kennedy and countless American freedom fighters the country owes such a debt of gratitude to , fought the good fight and won .
These are the names and the spirits I want to be associated with … not the names of John Barrow , Jane Harman , and Gene Taylor .
" As freshman Alabama Blue Dog Parker Griffith proved when he switched parties after being in office less than one year , .
There is a party for people with Lori Edwards ’ political leanings , and it is the Republican Party .
"
If you can , please help Doug and other real Democrats like Claudia , Marcy and Regina defeat Blue Dog reactionaries in their primary races , all of which are coming up quickly .

Thousands of cops were brought in from around the country , a new law was secretly enacted to give police more power , millions spent for security and even Mother Nature cooperated by raining on the parade , but still a committed group of protesters managed to make Toronto burn .
So what happened ?
Toronto police Chief Bill Blair asked Saturday night for the public ’s “ patience and support . ”
“ It is very regrettable that such vandalism and violence could not be prevented , ” Blair told reporters at a news conference .
“ But I want to assure you that the persons responsible will be held accountable . ”
Mayor David Miller warned people to stay out of the downtown core until it is deemed safe .
He would n’t say whether he thought police lost control of the protesters , saying it was unfair to “ second guess what they ’re doing in the heat of the moment . ”
The heat began just before 4 p.m. Saturday when an abandoned police cruiser was set on fire at King and Bay Sts. , in the heart of Toronto ’s financial district .
As the cruiser burned and sent sparks and huge black clouds into the air , further west , near Queen St. and Spadina Ave. , police abandoned two more police cars as protesters enveloped them .
North on College St. near University Ave. police closed in on demonstraters , forcing many to flee .
Those who refused , and sat on the grassy median , were pepper sprayed and struck with batons .
“ Why are you doing this ? ” shouted a weeping Alison Blais .
The journalism student said she was trying to leave when the cops came at her .
“ They just attacked .
They came on like crazy , ” the bleary - eyed 24 - year - old said .
It was this picture of chaos , fire and the lines of beefy riot cops beamed around the world and had fingers pointing at police to explain what happened to Toronto the Good – especially after taxpayers had forfeited millions for security .
But Michele Paradis of the Integrated Security Unit responsible for G20 Summit safety cautioned that the violence had to be put into perspective .
“ Yes there are broken windows , yes there is graffiti and yes there are burned cars , ” she said Saturday .
She said police showed a remarkable amount of restraint and professionalism .
“ Our officers did not engage .
There were times when they were hit and they stood their ground .
We have always said we will take a balanced and measured approach and I think you saw that today . ”
For much of the day that seemed true .
Police effectively moved protesters from one street to another as the group of thousands marched south from Queen ’s Park .
The first line of police defence was often the bicycle cops or uniformed officers standing shoulder to shoulder .
Behind them one street south was an impenetrable line of riot cops and others on horseback .
If an intersection got rowdy , busloads of riot cops were brought to the site and marched two - by - two behind the lines as they banged their batons against shields .
Tucked away in back alleys were Toronto ’s elite Emergency Task Force .
Police did manage to keep protesters well north of the security zone known as “ the cage ” where international leaders met .
And this was the main goal , Chief Blair told reporters at the news conference .
Perhaps it was one that police had learned from past protests .
During the 2001 Summit of the Americas in Quebec City , the security fence became the flashpoint for protesters and led to violent clashes with police .
Tear gas was also fired far into the crowds , reaching not just the groups bent on anarchy but igniting panic as peaceful protesters were left gasping .
Although tear gas was used Saturday it was done sparingly during “ muzzle blasts ” rather than the overpowering canisters of tear gas , Toronto police spokesperson Const .
Wendy Drummond said .
Chief Blair disputed claims that rubber bullets had been used and said somewhat testily that he was aware that had been “ twittered ” by a number of people .
“ That , like much of the information put out by these anarchists , was misinformation in order to mislead the public and the media . ”
However , Const .
Tim Garland confirmed early Sunday that plastic bullets , pepper spray guns and ARWEN launchers , which shoot a special kind of bean bag or plastic projectiles , have been deployed against protesters .
In many ways Saturday was a battle of strategy between the violent protesters and police .
Some felt police tactics were too harsh , and questioned how police appeared to lose control .
Others believe after a week of expecting the worst , the violence was not as bad as expected .
As clashes continued Saturday night , the second battle for public opinion will continue Sunday between those who are asking police what went wrong , and those pointing out what went right .

Maicon produced a moment of pure Brazilian magic to set the five - time champions on their way to victory in their opening game against North Korea in Johannesburg .
The Brazilians , ranked number one in the Fifa rankings , were expected to cruise past the team in 105th place in their Group G encounter .
But on a difficult evening they had to wait until the 55th minute to break the deadlock as the North Koreans proved more than capable opponents .
It fell to right - back Maicon to settle Brazil 's nerves with a goal of typical beauty .
Latching on to a pass down the right from Elano but at a seemingly impossible angle trapped against the byeline , he produced a swerving screamer that bent in with goalkeeper Ri Myong - guk standing a fraction too far off his post .
The goal composed Dunga 's previously erratic side and they doubled the lead with 18 minutes left when Robinho slid a fabulous pass in for Elano to slot home from inside the area .
But North Korea gave them a much harder game than they were expecting and Kim Jong - Hun 's side got a goal their endeavour deserved when Ji Yun -nam fired in superbly in the closing stages .
Brazil deserved the victory for their dominance in possession , especially in the second half , but North Korea 's previously unknown players can hold their heads high after a display full of passion and no little skill either .
In fact , playing their in their first World Cup since 1966 , the Chollima - before they tired after the break - threatened to cause an almighty upset .
With star striker Jong Tae-se - who cried during their national anthem - leading the line magnificently , they were giving Brazil as good as they got in a first half that swung from end to end in hugely entertaining fashion .
Indeed as Elano , Robinho and Michel Bastos all sprayed long - range shots wide from outside the box , it was the little - fancied North Koreans who began to test the Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar as they proved that had not come to the World Cup simply to defend .
Jong was causing the usually unflappable Lucio all kinds of problems with his movement and pace and he turned sharply before firing straight at the Brazilian keeper , before Ri Kwang - chon dragged wide from a good position on the edge of the Brazil box after they had failed to clear a corner .
The Brazilians were lethargic , with their best moments coming down the flanks as Maicon on the right and Michel Bastos - who had a 20 - yard sizzler deflected over - got forward time and time again to support their struggling team - mates .
As the game wore on there was a sense that a major upset could be in the offing , but Maicon 's devilish drifter put paid to that and soon Brazil were controlling the game in the manner with which their World Cup opponents have become accustomed .
Striker Luis Fabiano , without a goal in his last six internationals , was desperate to get on the scoresheet , but he could only turn and blaze over , before Robinho wonderfully found Elano to make the game safe .
Brazil still had a scare when Ji Yun - nam 's brilliant first touch controlled a high ball and took him into space in the Brazil box and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past Julio Cesar .
There was no time for them to conjure the most unlikely of all equalisers , but their heroic display finally brought the World Cup to life and warmed the hearts of the crowd on a freezing night at Ellis Park .

The uncommon wombat
The underground lifestyle and nocturnal habits of wombats mean they can be hard to catch sight of , but this time of year provides a great opportunity to spot the world 's largest burrowing herbivore .
Wombats have a reputation for being muddle - headed , plodding and dozy .
But this doziness actually masks a consummate skill for energy conservation — they have exceptionally slow metabolisms and very low water needs .
Their metabolism has been described as almost reptilian , allowing them to convert ' grass to wombat ' three times more efficiently than kangaroos .
The stable temperature in their underground burrows is particularly important , helping them to manage their energy usage efficiently throughout the year .
This means that the cooler months , from May to October , are the best time to spot wombats in the daytime .
" During the winter , they 'll often come up in the afternoons or mornings and have a feed , then head back down and stay in their burrows through the night , because it 's just too cold and they can conserve energy , " explains Barbara Triggs , a wombat expert since 1972 .
" In summer they often wo n't emerge until midnight . "
By letting body temperature drop while they are snoozing , wombats do n't need to consume as much food as other mammals .
Their diet is almost exclusively grass , with a nibble of moss , mushrooms or fungus as an occasional treat .
They tend to only dig up roots and tubers in dry times .
And their efficiency extends to water usage .
Wombats are amongst the lowest water consumers of any mammal on earth , needing only 20 per cent of what a sheep requires .
They conserve water in all aspects of their lives , including excreting droppings four times drier than a camel's .
Like their closest relatives , koalas , they can get almost all the water they need from vegetation .
Their dozy reputation hides another surprising wombat characteristic — wombats can turn on the power if they need to .
The average wombat could win a gold medal in a 100 metre race with a human , as they can maintain 40 kilometres an hour for 150 metres .
They 've also been seen to leap over metre - high fences and squeeze through gaps only 10 centimetres high .
There are three species of wombats , all found exclusively in Australia .
The common wombat ( Vombatus ursinus ) lives in the coastal and highland areas of south - east Australia .
The southern hairy - nosed wombat ( Lasiorhinus latrifrons ) can be found in the arid areas of southern Australia , and the endangered northern hairy - nosed wombat ( Lasiorhinus krefftii ) is found in central Queensland , although you 'll be very lucky to see it , at this or any other time of year .
Fact file :
Other info : Wombats are nocturnal animals who spend a lot of time in burrows .
But it 's not all hiding and snoozing underground !
The work in digging a 10 m burrow is equivalent to walking 120 km , and they can maintain a speed of 40 km / hr for 150 m .
There are three wombat species in Australia - the common wombat , the southern hairy - nosed wombat and the northern hairy - nosed wombat ( which is very rare ) .
The common wombat is solitary and sometimes aggressive , with coarse , dense bristle - like hair .
The northern and southern hairy - nosed wombats are more social and more docile .
They have angular , blocky heads with softer , silky fur .

The uncommon wombat
The northern hairy - nosed wombat is only found within three square kilometres of Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland .
Dr Alan Horsup , Senior Conservation
Officer in the park , calls them the ' uncommon wombat ' .
" Northern hairy - noses are amongst the top ten most endangered mammals in the world , " he says .
" To put it into perspective , take the giant panda , the most famous endangered animal in the world .
There are 1800 giant pandas left .
There are only about 100 of these creatures . "
" It 's the only tropical wombat .
We nearly lost it .
They were down to perhaps thirty individuals in the 1980's .
If they become extinct , it will be the first large animal extinction since the thylacine .
We do n't want that to happen . "
Weighing in at up to 40 kg and 1.3 m long , the ' northerns ' are the largest species of wombat .
Their fine , silky fur , squared - off heads , pig - like noses and large ears are just part of what differentiates them from common wombats .
Geneticists calculate the commons and the hairy - nosed wombats are less closely related to each other than chimps and humans .
Dr Horsup is developing techniques to establish new populations within the park , and is looking for suitable land to establish a colony outside Epping Forest National Park .
" It 's really risky having all the animals in just one spot , " he says , " A disease outbreak or a bushfire could be a disaster . "
The Northern Hairy - nosed Wombat Recovery Program is using innovative techniques such as DNA hair analysis and remote ' burrow - cams ' to monitor these shy , scarce creatures with minimal disturbance .
Limited funding means that the remote park is staffed by volunteers , but the list of those wanting the chance to see one of these exceptional beasts is long .
" We 've started to see lots of young wombats ' signs around tracks and diggings and in videos now , " he says .
" There 's quite few new burrows .
It 's pretty encouraging . "

Joey spotting
Over the next few months , if you 're in South Australia , you might see a joey ( a baby wombat ) poke its head out of a burrow , or a pouch , for the first time .
Unlike the common wombat and the northern hairy - nosed wombat , the southern hairy - nosed wombat has a seasonal , and therefore predictable , breeding cycle .
Most southern hairy - noses are born from late August to October .
In a never - witnessed journey , the one gram neonate makes its way to the pouch and attaches to a teat .
There may still be an elongated teat in the pouch which is accessed by the previous year 's joey , now living outside the pouch .
" Like some other marsupials they can produce the appropriate milk for each offspring from different teats , " says Peter Temple - Smith , from Monash University .
" Often they 'll wean the older one off pretty quickly . "
The maternal bond remains however , and the older juvenile wombat will stay around for many months to come .
" Sometimes , if they 're still in the pouch , you might even catch sight of a two - headed wombat , " says Temple - Smith .
" While mum 's grazing , there 'll be a head poking out the other end chewing on a bit of grass as well .
They learn from the pouch what 's food and what 's not . "
With time , the females leave the joey in the burrow while they go out foraging .
And after a while they just come out with her .

Wombats do n't make good pets !
Many people might remember the lovable Fatso , who lived with the local policeman in the old TV series A Country Practice .
However , anyone thinking about ' adopting ' one needs to think twice .
First of all , it 's against the law to keep them without a licence .
" They 're a protected animal , " says Gaylene Parker , an animal carer .
" They have to be released and it has to be done the right way . "
Parker has looked after over 500 orphaned wombats and now trains carers .
" We 've had older confiscated wombats brought to us and 95 per cent of them die because they 've been kept with a person , and they 've run around the house with them during the day .
When it comes to the age where it feels that it should be doing certain things , it does n't have the confidence and skills to go out into the wild and fend for itself . "
If someone finds a baby with a mother killed by the side of the road , they should contact WIRES , the RSPCA , National Parks or a vet , she says .
In any case , wombats are not the most domestic of animals .
" We once had a wombat come through a sliding door at full pace , just leaving a wombat - sized hole in it , " says Triggs .
" They 're not destructive really .
It 's just that to get somewhere , it does n't matter what 's in the way , they 'll just push it aside rather than go around . "
And if you 're still having second thoughts about having a lovable wombat for a pet , try tapping your knuckles on a common wombat 's rump .
The shiny patch over their rump marks an area of tank - like toughness formed by matted hair , centimetre - thick skin , cartilage and bone .
It 's used as a shield to block a tunnel against predators or even to crush the skull of an attacking dingo or fox against the burrow roof .
It 's like knocking on a door - mat !

Trappist ( TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetIsmals Small Telescope -- kind of a stretch for an acronym ) is joining in the search for exoplanets , Earth - like rocky bodies orbiting distant stars that are quite en vogue in the astronomical community right now .
Such planets are clearly the best place to start looking for extraterrestrial life , and in recent years astronomers and governments have been devoting increased resources to identifying them .
Trappist will also employ special filters to study molecules ejected by comets orbiting the Sun in hopes of gaining a better understanding of how comets may have contributed to the advent of life on Earth .
Fingers crossed , I 'm hoping to have fresh bhut jolokia chiles arrive in my garden by the end of the summer .
( Seeds were purchased from the Chile Pepper Institute ) .
If you 're not familiar , this bad boy is the world 's hottest chile pepper with a Guinness World Record to prove it .
Also known as the ghost chile , this pepper from India rates one million units on the Scoville scale , compared to 400,000 for the hottest type of habanero .
( Read more information about the jolokia in this previous Serious Heat ) .
I 've only worked with the chile either in powder form or dried whole , and I 've worn gloves and a mask while doing so .
According to Jeff R. Blaine , there are certain things to consider before plunging into working with fresh jolokias .
And he 's a man to know .
Dabbling with powdered and fresh jolokia chiles for the past two and a half years , Blaine recently had his own jolokia chiles grown straight in Assam for his Bhut Sauce Liquid Atomic Fire Hot Sauce .
Here 's some of his advice on how to handle them .
Difference Between Fresh and Dried
According to Blaine , the capsaicin intensity changes significantly from fresh to dried .
The fresh packs the highest pungency with 1 million Scoville units , whereas the powdered can fall to roughly around 750,000 to 900,000 Scoville units .
So if you 've been working with the powdered version , be prepared that the fresh will be much more lethal .
Armour Up
When Blaine processes large quantities of jolokia chiles for his hot sauce — upwards of 200 chiles at a time — he is certain to wear eye goggles , double - vinyl gloves and a long - sleeved shirt .
Also , the room needs to be well - ventilated .
But once , he tried a little shortcut .
" The last time we made 200 bottles , the kitchen was warm , and I skipped the long sleeve shirt by design .
This was a bad idea because the sauce splashed on my left arm and caused a blister in about a day , " he said .
" The burn lasted for a few days . "
Take note from his lesson learned and cover up while working with the chiles .
Best in Small Doses
Keep in mind that this chile is the hottest of the hot .
Use sparingly .
Blaine became overzealous with the jolokia and paid the price : " In about 15 seconds , I was sweating profusely and literally thought I was going to die from palpitations and the heat intensity .
It took about 1 1/ 2 hours to pass , and I learned my lesson .
So , anyone planning on using bhut jolokia chilies , please be very careful . "
Cooking with the Bhut Jolokia
From one chilehead to another , I recommend puréeing the jolokia into a hot sauce to use all year long .
Use a few jolokia chiles to experiment with in your food , but preserve the bulk of them to use all year .

( CNN ) -- German football fans ' agony over Wednesday 's loss to Spain in the World Cup semifinal was perhaps worsened by the knowledge that the result was predicted by an octopus .
Paul the octopus , a psychic cephalopod at Sea Life in Oberhausen , western Germany , has become a World Cup phenomenon after correctly predicting the victors in all six of Germany 's matches .
Tuesday 's ceremony was carried live on German television .
Sea Life staff help
Paul make his prediction by lowering two boxes of food into his tank , one with a German flag and the other bearing that of their opponents .
The case he opens first is adjudged to be his predicted winner .
The octopus correctly picked that coach Joachim Low 's side would beat Ghana and Australia in the group stages -- but also outwitted most professional pundits by predicting Germany 's shock 1 - 0 defeat by Serbia .
Australia in the group stages -- but also outwitted most professional pundits by predicting Germany 's shock 1 - 0 defeat by Serbia .
In the knockout stages , Paul tipped Germany to beat both England and Argentina .
But the eight - legged oracle drew cries of despair from assembled watchers prior to the semi-final round , when he lingered over the box for the German flag before opting for the Spanish flag instead .
Spain won the match 1 - 0 .
But the octopus only managed an 80 percent success rate in predicting Germany 's results at the 2008 European Championships .
He also failed to foresee Spain 's 1 - 0 win over Germany in the final .
Spain will face the Netherlands Sunday in the World Cup Final .
Politicians on the right love to scare us .
George Osborne , in his Mansion House speech cited " fears " over government solvency and sovereign debt crises .
David Cameron has declared the fiscal deficit a " threat " to " our whole way of life , " and " a clear and present danger to the British economy " .
This is nonsense .
The threat we face is ideologically driven cuts that risk causing a double - dip recession .
The fiscal deficit seems scary because it is debt .
Cameron argues that within five years the national debt will rise to " some £ 22,000 for every man , woman and child in the country " .
This may be true , but what he does n't tell us is that it is money the government owes to us – not money that we owe to anyone else .
That 's right : 80 % of our government debt is owed to the British people .
What is called " national debt " is our own savings , looked at from the other side of the balance sheet .
Given that most of us do not knowingly buy government debt , how do our savings end up as the fiscal deficit ?
We put our savings in banks and pensions funds .
But they are just intermediaries : they invest our savings by buying bonds and other securities that pay interest .
Some of these bonds will be from private sector companies that want to borrow for investment .
But when private companies do not want to invest as much as we , the people , want to save in a given year , then the only alternative is to invest the money in government bonds , ie public debt .
The fiscal deficit is just the lending that we make to the government .
The fiscal deficit is so high because we are demanding more bonds – that is , we want to save more – than the private sector is willing to invest .
Incidentally , this is not Keynesianism : it 's just accounting , familiar to any macroeconomist .
The fiscal deficit adds to the stock of government debt owed to us , and it is true that we do not want that debt to grow as a proportion of GDP forever .
But relative to GDP , the stock of national debt in the UK remains below that of the US , France and Germany .
And when the economy starts to recover , the deficit will decline in any case , as investment and tax receipts rise .
Household saving will also decline with time from its current high rate : saving rose because we became so indebted during the boom years , running down our savings and buying goods on credit .
Having built up so much debt we now want to pay some of it off .
But once we have paid off enough of that debt , our saving rate can decline and private spending pick up , further helping reduce the deficit .
What if the government insisted on cutting the fiscal deficit while we tried to save , before recovery is secured ?
That would imply that the country – households , the private sector and the government together – would be trying to buy less than we produce .
But this means that aggregate demand would be lower than aggregate supply : some companies and workers would be producing things that no one wants to buy .
What do they do ?
They stop producing : companies go bankrupt and workers get fired .
With unemployment already at 8 % and GDP well below capacity , this would spell double - dip recession .
Ironically , this would lower tax receipts and could make the deficit even worse .
What of the argument that the fiscal deficit crowds out private investment ?
This can only happen if the fiscal deficit pushes up interest rates , making investment more expensive .
When the economy is doing well , this can certainly happen .
But we have a fiscal deficit precisely because the private sector does n't want to invest as much as we want to save , whatever the interest rate – which remains extremely low .
The government still faces nominal interest rates of only 3.5 % on 10 - year bonds because we the people are demanding these bonds – ie , we are demanding the fiscal deficit so that we can save .
What , then , of Osborne 's complaint in his Mansion House speech about " annual debt interest payments that will soon exceed what we spend on schools " ?
Is this a " terrible , terrible waste of money " , as Cameron has called it , taking money from our schools and hospitals ?
No .
The vast majority of those interest payments are going back to us , the people , who lent the money to the government in the first place – since only 20 % of UK public debt is held by foreigners ( one of our major differences with Greece ) .
Cameron 's claim that " for every single pound you pay in tax , 10 p would be spent on interest " is frankly dishonest : 8 p of the 10 p is cashback for us !
If we , as a democracy , decide that we are not spending enough on schools and hospitals , we can simply have the government tax the equivalent of that interest back again .
This reveals the underlying reason why politicians on the right really want to reduce the deficit : expenditure cuts today imply tax cuts and smaller government in the long run .
And once we see that the fiscal deficit is our saving with the government , it becomes obvious that Cameron and Osborne 's claim that the deficit has us " living beyond our means " is nonsense .
Any politician who cares more about public services than tax cuts should be relaxed about a few years of fiscal deficits .
Neowiz and Capcom officially announced Rockman Online , an online Mega Man game for PCs .
A 3D side - scrolling action RPG for PCs .
Being an online RPG , Rockman Online will have a perpetual growth system and varied stages to play .
Capcom wants to make this game appeal to Mega Man series fans as well as general audience .
X and Zero are confirmed to be in the game along with a bunch of original characters as NPCs .
Here ’s art for both of them .
Rockman Online has not been announced for any other region .
However , Capcom trademarked Mega Man Universe in North America and Europe .
Could that be this game ’s international name ?
With Jaroslav Halak being traded from the Montreal Canadiens to the St. Louis Blues , it 's become apparent that the off - season has arrived .
Over the next several days I 'll take a look at each team in the Northwest Division to get a sense of what they might need to do in order to improve .
Today 's focus is the team that won the division and carried the Northwest Divison flag further than any other in the playoffs , the Vancouver Canucks .
Over the last two years , Mike Gillis has done a very good job of retaining his top talent at a reasonable price ( new contracts for the Sedins , Luongo , Kesler ) but his new acquisitions have been much less inspiring ( Samuelsson has been the best but there 's also Wellwood , Bernier , Demitra , Alberts ) .
This off - season requires Gillis to do some shopping for new talent and how he performs will likely cement whether he's an adequate general manager or a really good one .
After the jump , we 'll take a look at what the Canucks have done since the trade deadline and then move on to look forward to their cap situation for next season and what they might add to their team .
Signed F Jordan Schroeder to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 1.025 M per year -
It 's hard to believe that Schroeder fell to 22nd in last year 's entry draft , but fall he did .
His second NCAA season was n't as good statistically as his first but after signing with the Canucks he had a solid AHL debut scoring nine points in eleven games and another six points in his six playoff games .
There 's some chance that Schroeder will make the Canucks out of training camp but if not , he should still provide excellent offensive depth for the Canucks when they need to deal with injuries .
Signed F Ryan Kesler to a one - way contract for six years at 5.00 M per year - I 've already talked about this contract at length .
In brief , it 's a very good deal for the Canucks .
Signed F Aaron Volpatti to a two - way contract for two years at 0.61 M per year - Although Volpatti just finished his career in the NCAA he was old enough to avoid the entry - level system which helped him to earn more money from his AHL salary ( $ 200,000 per season ) than would have otherwise been possible .
Volpatti is already 25 years old so he's not really a prospect but in his last season with Brown he scored 32 points and had 115 penalty minutes in 37 games .
He 's most likely penciled in as a " goon who can play " with the AHL's Manitoba Moose but , depending on how much he can play , he may see some time with the Canucks in the Rick Rypien role .
Signed F Prab Rai to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.57 M per year - The Canucks drafted Rai 131st overall in 2008 .
He 's under six feet tall and his last three WHL seasons all saw him score between 0.9 and 1.1 points per game ; he 's essentially an inferior version of the Oilers ' Philippe Cornet .
There 's only a very minimal chance that he gets even a cup of coffee at the NHL level .
Signed F Stefan Schneider to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.90 M per year -
He 's not likely to make it to the NHL .
Schneider scored 23 points in 72 games for the WHL's Portland Winterhawks in 2009 - 10 and signed with the Canucks as a free agent .
As you may have guessed , he 's also really big .
At least they did n't waste a draft pick on him .
Signed G Eddie
Lack to a two - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.90 M per year - Mike Gillis decided to use free agency to add a goaltending prospect , a tactic I think NHL teams should use more often .
Lack spent last season in the Swedish Elite League where he posted a .911 save percentage in 14 games with Brynas .
Lack will likely be in the mix for the starting job next year with the Moose as Cory Schneider will move up to the Canucks .
This is a solid low - risk move from Gillis .
Signed D Kevin Connauton to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.90 M per year - Connauton was taken 83rd overall in 2009 and is one of six defenders to sign an NHL contract with the Canucks since the trade deadline .
Connauton spent last season with the Giants and put up big offensive numbers ( 24 - 28 - 72 and +4 in 69 games ) .
It seems likely that Connauton will not make the Canucks this season and , as such , will spend another year in the CHL .
Signed D Yann
Sauve to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.67 M per year - Sauve was drafted 41st overall in 2008 and , although the numbers in his last year of junior point to a good player ( 7 - 29 - 36 and +42 in 61 games ) , the contract is a bit of a red flag .
Of the thirteen defenders drafted in the second round in 2008 , nine of them have agreed to contracts .
Of those nine , only Sauve and 31st overall selection , Vyacheslav Voynov ( $ 845,833 ) received less than the rookie maximum at the NHL level .
It 's possible that Gillis promised him an improved chance at a roster spot if he took less money but if that 's not the case , it seems both the club and the agent agree that Sauve is worth less than the other defenders taken in the second round of '08 .
I 'll be very interested to see how the Canucks treat Sauve over the next couple of years .
Signed D Chris
Tanev to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.90 M per year - Tanev was signed as an undrafted free agent after just one NCAA season .
Tanev scored 28 points in 41 games as a freshman with R.I.T. and is a big player who will likely spend a year learning the pro game in the AHL .
This is a really nice signing by Gillis as it adds a real prospect to the organization for nothing but money .
Signed D Lee Sweatt to a two - way contract for one year at 0.65 M per year - Sweatt was a free agent signing who has spent the last several years in Europe .
The contract includes a $ 150,000 signing bonus and an AHL salary of $ 150,000 which is a very nice payday for Sweatt .
He 's about 5 ' 8 '' and scored less than a point per game in the KHL , the SM - Liiga , his senior year at Colorado College and in the Austrian league .
I 'd be surprised to see him play a game in the NHL .
Signed F Anton Rodin to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.69 M per year - Rodin was taken 53rd overall in 2009 and played last year in the Swedish Elite League where he scored five points in thirty - six games .
Not too inspiring .
He will not make the Canucks this year and will spend the 2010 - 11 season either in the AHL - where he would earn the rookie maximum of $ 67,500 - or back in Sweden .
Signed D Peter Andersson to a three - year entry - level contract with an NHL cap hit of 0.68 M per year - Another Swede from the 2009 draft , this time 143rd overall .
Andersson spent 2009 - 10 with Frolunda of the Swedish Elite League and had 5 points in 21 games and like Rodin , he will receive the rookie max of $ 67,500 if he plays in the AHL but could also play another year in Sweden .
Signed G Cory Schneider to a one - way contract for two years at 0.90 M per year - Schneider was drafted 26th overall in 2004 and has been a very good AHL goalie for the last several seasons .
Although his save percentage declined from .928 in 2008 - 09 to .919 in 2009 - 10 , this past season was the first time he posted a better save percentage than his back - up in the AHL .
In that there are a lot of people who believe Schneider will be a very good goaltender , this seems like a pretty poor contract from Schneider 's perspective .
At the end of this season , Schneider would have become a Group 6 unrestricted free agent if he had played fewer than 21 games ( for at least 30 minutes per game ) .
Thus , a one year contract with the Canucks basically guarantees him 21 games in 2010 - 11 .
The two year deal only guarantees him 21 games over two years .
Further , there may well have been teams out there willing to give him an offer sheet that would have earned him more money .
As it stands , Schneider has signed on for two years as the back - up to Roberto Luongo .
This is a very good deal for the Canucks and a poor one for Schneider .
Signed D Aaron
Rome to a one - way contract for two years at 0.75 M per year - I was surprised to see Rome get a pay increase since he had n't established himself as an NHL player ( until signing this contract ) .
Last season , Rome 's goal differential per sixty minutes was the worst among Canuck defenders at even strength ( - 0.73/60 ) which is right where you 'd expect a player at the bottom of the roster .
At any rate , he 's a capable enough seventh or eighth defender and while the dollar figure is a bit high for that kind of player , it 's not as though Gillis is breaking the bank either .
Looking Foward to 2010 - 11
Those who 've read here before know that I like to use the chart below as a cap space guideline .
Because it 's based on percentages , we need to set a cap figure for 2010 - 11 and I 'll use 57 M , which is a slight increase from last season .
Here 's the chart :
Top 3 Forwards - 27.5 % or 15.675M
Middle 6 Forwards - 20.0 % or 11.4M
Top 4 Defenders - 27.5 % or 15.675M
Goaltending - 10.0 % or 5.7M
Bottom 8 Players - 15.0 % or 8.55 M
And here it is again with the players the Canucks have signed :
Top 3 Forwards - Sedin , Sedin , Kesler - 30.2 % or $ 17,200,000
Middle 6 Forwards - Samuelsson , Burrows , Bernier , ??? , ??? , ??? - 11.4 % or $ 6,500,000
Top 4 Defenders - Salo , Edler , Ehrhoff , Bieksa - 23.9 % or $ 13,600,000
Goaltending - Luongo , Schneider - 10.9 % or $ 6,233,333
Bottom 8 Players - Rome , Alberts , Baumgartner , Grabner , Hordichuk , Rypien , ??? , ??? - 7.9 % or $ 4,518,333
The bottom line here is that the Canucks have about $ 8.5 M to spend and five players to sign including three top nine forwards .
One of those players is sure to be Mason Raymond who needs a new contract this season .
Raymond is certainly a good forward and is likely to cost somewhere between $ 2 M and $ 3.5 M which leaves the Canucks between $ 5 M and $ 6.5 M to spend .
Let 's go with a $ 3 M salary which leaves the Canucks about $ 5.5 M .
At this point , I 'd be tempted to plan on one of Cody Hodgson or Jordan Schroeder making the team .
Hodgson 's cap hit is $ 1.7 M but a lot of that is in bonus money which does n't count against the cap unless Hodgson meets his bonuses .
The upshot is that they can add Hodgson to the lineup for a cap cost of $ 839,833 .
Schroeder also has some bonuses in his contract but his base salary is slightly higher which means adding him to the lineup would come at a cap cost of $ 900,000 .
Let 's plan on one of the two making the team , which leaves the club with $ 4.6 M and three more players to sign .
I think we can easily knock off one of those bottom six forward slots by bringing back Ryan Johnson ( or another player who the coach will trust for defensive zone draws ) for about $ 0.8 M , bringing our running total down to $ 3.8 M for two players .
I think one of those players needs to be a talented even strength forward and the oft - mentioned Colby Armstrong seems like a good fit if it can be done somewhere around $ 2.5 M .
The rest of the money would then go to a defender to play in the bottom pairing but who is capable of moving up the lineup when injuries hit .
In my opinion , that player should not be Shane O'Brien who has taken penalties at a higher rate than any other Canuck defender for the last two seasons despite facing some of the easiest competition .
For a sub - $ 1M player this might be acceptable but O'Brien 's qualifying offer is $ 1.6 M , already far too much for what he brings to the team .
He 's a guy that I expect Gillis to shop at the draft .
The Canucks also have several unrestricted free agents but I do n't expect any of them to sign .
I 'm sure that they would love to keep Willie Mitchell but the probable price and concerns over his health will likely prevent that from happening .
The other players available with expiring contracts do n't fit into the team 's needs going forward .
All in all , I expect Mike Gillis and the Canucks to be bit players in unrestricted free agency , looking for two solid players - one forward and one defender - from outside of the organization .
In that three of the Canucks ' top four defenders will be off to unrestricted free agency after this season , I would think that the Canucks will try to sign the defender to a mid- to - long term contract .
Mike Gillis can earn himself some extra spending money if he can get Raymond 's contract done for less than $ 3 M or if he can move Andrew Alberts and Steve Bernier , two players who are likely paid a bit too much for what they bring to the team .
Even if those things happen , it 's unlikely the Canucks will be in the market for any of the top free agents .
Looking forward to next season , I figure the Canucks to be a slightly better team this year than they were last season but most - if not all and then some - of that increase will be eaten away by a likely decrease in the team 's percentages at even strength ( in 2009 - 10 they had a .924 Sv % and a 9.2 Sh % for a PDO of 101.6 ) .
As a result , barring any really big surprise improvements , the Canucks will probably once again be a step down from the very best teams in the Western Conference .
My next detailed look at the Canucks will likely be around July 10th after the dust settles from the unrestricted free agency signing period .
I 'd also like to acknowledge capgeek.com for providing all of the contract information .
Democrats are considering a plan to delay tax hikes on the wealthy for two years because the economic recovery is slow and they fear getting crushed in November ’s election .
It could mean a big reprieve for families earning $ 250,000 and above annually .
ADVERTISEMENT
President George W. Bush ’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year unless Congress acts to delay their sunset .
Some Democrats are now arguing forcefully that a delay is a win - win plan that would help the federal budget without hurting the economy .
Wealthy families would not have an incentive to cut back on spending and budget writers could assume an inflow of tax funds in future years , making five - and 10 - year budget projections look less scary .
Rep. John Yarmuth John Allen YarmuthPelosi , Democrats unveil bills to rein in alleged White House abuses of power GOP , White House struggle to unite behind COVID - 19 relief House seeks ways to honor John Lewis MORE ( D - Ky. ) , a member of the Ways and Means Committee , which has jurisdiction over taxes , said some of his Democratic colleagues have discussed the idea out of fear of impeding the nation ’s economic recovery .
“ I ’ve heard some sentiment about raising the rate but not making it effective until 2012 , ” he said .
During the 2008 presidential campaign , President Obama said he would not extend the Bush - era tax cuts for families earning more than $ 250,000 .
Obama promised that families earning less than $ 250,000 would not see their taxes increase .
But vulnerable Democrats in Congress are worried about talk of raising taxes , even on the wealthiest families , when the national economic recovery has slowed .
“ I think the recovery is sufficiently fragile that we ought to leave tax rates where they are , ” said Rep. Gerry Connolly Gerald ( Gerry ) Edward Connolly Judge issues nationwide injunction against Postal Service changes

MORE , a freshman Democrat from Virginia .
Connolly said Democrats should not allow the 2001 Bush tax cuts to expire for anybody .
“ People in the upper tax brackets have a huge impact , a disproportionate impact on consumer spending , ” he said .
Sen. Kent Conrad ( N.D. ) , a senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee , said he could support a short - term extension of the Bush tax cuts for the highest income earners .
He noted that experts predict continued economic weakness over the next 18 to 24 months .
“ My reaction would be do n’t cut spending , do n’t raise taxes and that would mean on anyone , ” he said .
Rep. Bobby Bright , a Democrat facing a tough reelection race in Alabama , said tax increases , even if limited to the wealthiest families , could imperil the recovery .
“ I do n’t care if it ’s the wealthiest of the wealthy , you do n’t raise their taxes , ” he said .
“ In a recession , you do n’t tax , burden and restrict .
The economy is like a ship , and if you sink the ship , all the good you might do goes down with it . ”
Families who make up the 5 percent of highest earners account for about 30 percent of consumer spending .
Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody ’s Analytics , recently declared that a drop in spending by the rich has slowed the economic recovery .
“ One of the reasons that the recovery has lost momentum is that high - end consumers have become more jittery and more cautious , ” he told The New York Times .
Liberals who favor the tax hikes note that these families also take in almost 30 percent of the nation ’s income , according to Congressional Budget Office data from 2007 .
The top 1 percent of earners collect 17 percent of the nation ’s income , according to CBO .
Yarmuth said Connolly and Bright , who do n’t want to touch the tax rate on the wealthiest , represent a minority opinion in the Democratic Caucus .
But he added concern over the economic impact of raising any taxes has spurred the idea of postponing when higher taxes go into effect .
Discussions are in the earliest stages and it ’s not yet clear whether the tax impact would be postponed until after November of 2012 , when Obama faces reelection .
Even liberal lawmakers from the Northeast have begun pushing to shield some of the nation ’s highest income - earning families from tax increases .
Rep. Jerrold Nadler , a Democrat from Manhattan , has proposed legislation that would provide adjustments in income tax rates to reflect regional costs of living .
The legislation is sponsored by five Democrats representing New York City , its suburbs and Long Island where living standards and incomes are high .
They are Reps . Tim Bishop Timothy ( Tim ) Howard BishopDem candidate ' struck by the parallels ' between Trump 's rise and Hitler 's Dems separated by 29 votes in NY House primary Flint residents hire first K Street firm MORE , Steve Israel , Nita Lowey , Carolyn Maloney and Carolyn McCarthy Carolyn McCarthyWhy Congress needs an openly atheist member , now Lobbying World Lobbying world MORE .
Rep. Jared Polis , a freshman Democrat from Colorado , said lawmakers are torn between concerns over the economic effect of raising taxes and the budget impact of keeping rates low for earners in the top brackets .
Allowing income tax rates to reset to pre-Bush levels for individuals earning more than $ 200,000 and families earning more than $ 250,000 could generate close to $ 700 billion over the next 10 years .
Families earning more than $ 374,000 a year in taxable income would see their rate jump from 35 percent to 39.6 .
Families earning above $ 250,000 in gross income would see their rate jump from 33 percent to 36 .
The debate promises to get more contentious as Democrats near the end of the year .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) has reiterated her support for raising taxes on individuals and families who earn the most .
“ My position is also that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America did nothing to grow the economy during the Bush administration , did not create jobs , did not reduce the deficit , ” she said at a recent press conference .
In the Senate , some liberal Democrats such as Sen. Tom Harkin Thomas ( Tom ) Richard HarkinThe Memo : Trump attacks on Harris risk backfiring Ernst challenges Greenfield to six debates in Iowa Senate race Biden unveils disability rights plan : ' Your voices must be heard ' MORE ( Iowa ) would like to see the Bush tax cuts expire for families earning $ 200,000 a year , or even less .
Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) disputed the argument that raising taxes on the wealthy could hurt the economy .
“ One of the most robust periods of economic growth was prior to the Bush tax cuts , ” he said .
He said large federal deficits , which would be addressed by tax increases , have caused people to lose confidence in the economy .
Chuck Marr , director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a left - leaning think tank , said the economic impact of raising taxes on the wealthy is overstated .
He said the spending of high - income people is less affected by moderate shifts in income than is that of middle - income people , who often live “ paycheck to paycheck . ”
“ If lawmakers are concerned about the impact on the economy , they would be better off taking money raised from taxing the wealthy and channeling it in policies that deliver more bang for the buck , ” he said .
Some Democratic policy experts cite unemployment aid and infrastructure spending as policies with greater economic impact than keeping taxes low for the wealthy .
So I ’ve been here at MSR Cambridge for almost two weeks now (! ) , working in the Programming Principles and Tools Group with Simon Peyton - Jones and Dimitrios Vytiniotis — and also collaborating with Stephanie Weirich and Steve Zdancewic , who are also in Cambridge .
So , what have I been doing ?
This week , Simon , Dimitris , and I have been having a major GHC hacking session , implementing the new constraint - solving type inference engine described in their new OutsideIn ( X ) paper .
It ’s been a lot of fun — I ’ve never hacked on GHC before , and it ’s quite a new experience hacking on such a large ( and amazing ) piece of software .
I ’ve been working on the constraint canonicaliser , which puts constraints into canonical forms appropriate for the constraint simplifier to work with .
As a simple example , the equality constraint ( Int , a ) ~ ( b , Char ) gets decomposed into the primitive constraints Int ~ b and a ~ Char .
It ’s also responsible for flipping and flattening equality constraints so that type function applications only happen on the left - hand side : for example , the constraint F a b ~ G Int ( where both F and G are type families ) , gets rewritten to a pair of constraints F a b ~ c , G Int ~ c , where c is a fresh variable .
If we did n’t do this it would lead to problems with termination : for example , the constraint a ~ [ F a ] could lead to infinite rewriting of a to [ F a ] to [ F [ F a ] ] to …
( And before you protest that we ought to just throw out a ~ [ F a ] on the grounds that it is recursive , note that F a may not mention a at all ; for example , perhaps F is defined by F [ x ] = Int . )
Constraints also include type class constraints and implicit parameter constraints , although there ’s much less work to do with those as far as canonicalisation is concerned .
Next week , I ’ll likely get back to our other , more ambitious research project , but I ’ll write more about that next time .
In the meantime , if you ’re in or near Cambridge and want to meet up , just drop me a note !
Many of us with sympathies — and therefore blinders — on the side of the Free Gaza Movement ’s work have been reluctant to accept the possibility that , indeed , people aboard the Mavi Marmara and other vessels attempting to break Israel ’s blockade of the Gaza Strip earlier this week were anything but nonviolent as Israeli soldiers descended from helicopters above .
The facts of the incident remain very much in question , to be sure , and they will continue to be until a truly international , plausibly objective investigation takes place .
While it cannot be taken yet as conclusive , there is some evidence provided by the Israelis that their soldiers met violent resistance before , during , or after their shooting spree that finally killed at least nine activists .
This video of the events aboard the Mavi Marmara has been widely circulated :
Meanwhile , reports have begun to emerge from among the blockade - runners , including an Arab - Israeli Knesset member , a German activist , and a Turkish mother who brought her 1 - year - old baby aboard .
They insist that the Israelis fired on the Mavi Marmara before boarding , that those on board had no weapons short of wooden batons , and that the Israelis seemed intent on sending a bloody message .
But supposing the activists did try to defend themselves violently — how does that affect the ways we think about this incident in terms of nonviolence ?
As in any situation so tragic , and amidst a wider conflict so volatile , we ’re faced with an array of perplexing questions .
Encountering such questions is natural and , as much as one can muster , to be welcomed .
For it is through them that we begin to grope after a way forward , a better way , one that has learned from the past and hopes for the future .
It is disappointing to think that a brutal assault on the Gaza blockade - breakers was necessary to gain the world ’s attention when they have been risking their lives , peacefully , to bring aid to Gazans since August of 2008 .
Worse , what if the thing that finally put Free Gaza on the front pages was some activists ’ attempt to meet the Israeli soldiers ’ violence with violence of their own ?
Before , the Free Gaza Movement ’s resolutely nonviolent approach earned them mainly obscurity , but an act of self - defense — resulting in much more violence in reply — may have changed the equation .
Suddenly , world leaders are paying notice , and institutions from the United Nations Security Council to The New York Times are issuing statements of support .
Egypt is even lifting its side of the Gaza blockade .
Has violence , in this case , worked ?
In its way , yes , violence works ; it destroys people and things , and it certainly draws attention .
The crucial challenge of nonviolent resistance , however , is to develop creative tactics that will point eyes and minds not to the bloodshed but to the conditions of injustice .
( That ’s what Waging Nonviolence is for : to highlight struggles for justice against a mainstream media that would prefer to present a version of the news in which little happens or matters except when violence is involved . )
In the days to come , though , the judgment of the world will depend very much upon the extent to which the activists really did fight back and , in doing , partly justified the soldiers ’ onslaught .
( Nothing , however , can truly justify the use of such disproportionate force . )
To the extent that the activists and their mission were nonviolent , they will earn the moral high ground .
Their nonviolence thereby invites Israel to respond not with the violence it is so effective in dispensing , but to join in a common cause of bringing about justice .
The fundamentally nonviolent purpose of the Freedom Flotilla — to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza and to break what much of the international community considers an illegal blockade — is already what has aroused the world ’s sympathy and put Israel in a very uncomfortable situation , perhaps even more so than during the full - scale invasions of Lebanon and Gaza in the recent years .
The fact that many aboard the flotilla were noted peacemakers and people committed to and trained in nonviolence makes their statement all the more powerful .
The more insistent the activists are on eschewing violence and putting themselves in harm ’s way to do right , the more any injustice at play in the situation will come to light for all to see — and the less any military power can justify aggressive action .
Such power becomes undermined without a shot fired .
What is probably most at stake in the questions of violence and nonviolence surrounding this incident is the future character of the pro-Palestinian movement — among the international community of course , but foremost in the Palestinian territories themselves .
A BBC report last month suggests that , despite growing interest in nonviolent methods among Palestinians , there is still a lack of willingness to make a comprehensive commitment .
( In the days following the attack on the flotilla , there have already been skirmishes with Israeli troops resulting in Palestinian deaths . )
Many leaders remain hopeful that acts of violence will help them make progress in securing independence and the kind of society they long for .
These voices appear rather representative , speaking after attending a talk in Ramallah by Rajmohan Gandhi , the Mahatma ’s grandson :
“ I came to promote non-violent resistance , ” said Mahmoud Ramahi , secretary general of the Palestinian Legislative Council , and a member of the Islamist movement Hamas .
“ We support all types of resistance — non- violent , economic , political and armed resistance , ” he said — apparently missing the point of strictly peaceful campaigns .
Hind Awad , 22 , a campaigner for an international boycott of Israel , said non-violent methods had historically been a “ major tool ” of the Palestinians .
“ I also think that under international law , armed struggle is just , for people that are living under occupation , ” she added .
Yet the Palestine - Israel situation is a case in point of the endlessly cyclical and self - perpetuating nature of violence .
From the 1940s onward , the more Palestinians and their Arab neighbors have tried to fight , the more Western - backed Israeli forces have been able to justify sweeping and decisive retaliation , as well as outright preemption .
The international community can help break the cycle by exemplifying a kind of resistance that is at once effective and nonviolent .
The BBC report tells of Najmadeen al - Husseini , a 62 year - old man who lives under occupation in the West Bank :
In his view , two decades of negotiations have yielded little , yet “ military resistance will get us nowhere … what are Kalashnikovs against tanks ? ”
“ If the world supports us , peaceful resistance will get us something back , ” he says .
Providing that support will require nonviolent discipline and self - sacrifice , of a kind that demolishes any moral standing held by those who would support injustice with force .
If that discipline broke on Monday , all the more reason to restore it for the future .
Also needed , meanwhile , are the kinds of creative , courageous , and nonviolent tactics such as the Free Gaza Movement has been using since 2008 , as well as ones that can make even more undeniable and unignorable the fact that more fighting is not the answer , justice is .

Sunset is around 10:30 pm in France right now and with the summer heat , we had plenty of time and motivation to roam around Paris at night .
I have my favorite spots , they are not so original but they are lovely : le Louvre , along the Seine , the Trocadéro , the Eiffel Tower …
We walked across the Pont des Arts and were surprised to noticed a bunch of locks attached to the fence , like in Montevideo — I guess it ’s good luck for lovers .
Funny thing , I do n’t remember seeing that many locks just a few years ago , I wonder how and why the tradition suddenly started .
The bridge was packed at night and people drank and ate there after sunset .
I had a lot of fun taking long exposure pictures of the Seine and capturing the motion of the tourist boats passing under the bridge .
Most of the area around the Eiffel Tower was blocked because of both July 14th ( France ’s National Day ) and the FIFA World Cup village .
Yet , the view from Trocadéro remains one of the best in Paris .
As for the Louvre , it ’s a quiet spot at night , not so many people come take pictures of the pyramids for some reason .
The main courtyard ( Cour Napoleon ) offers the best views on Pei ’s controversial work .

Apple fixes one iPhone bug as another appears Published duration 16 July 2010
image caption
Before the fix every iPhone misreported signal strength
Apple has issued a fix for one problem with the iPhone as reports start to emerge of another bug .
An iPhone software update has corrected the way that different versions of the handset display signal strength .
But some users are reporting that an earlier update means their 3GS phones now drop far more calls than before .
The news comes as Apple prepares for a news conference in which it is expected to address the ongoing iPhone 4 antenna problem .
Rebooting phones
The update for the iPhone iOS software fixes a problem that Apple discovered when investigating reports about reception falling away on the newest version of the handset .
In an open letter , Apple said it was " stunned " to discover that the formula it had been using to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display was " totally wrong " .
The formula regularly displayed two more bars of strength than it should , the company said .
To correct the flaw , Apple issued a fix that owners can get hold of by connecting their phone to a Mac or PC and updating the device .
Analysis of the update shows that it does not alter the underlying formula for calculating strength but changes how many bars a phone displays .
At the same time some owners of the iPhone 3GS are reporting that an earlier update to the handset 's operating system made their phone far more likely to drop calls .
The dropped calls occur when the phone suddenly reboots during a conversation .
The Apple support forum dealing with the problem now has more than 36 pages of comments attached to it .
Apple has yet to give specific advice about this problem but many users report that restoring the phone 's firmware fixes the trouble .
At 1800 BST , Apple is holding a press conference at which it is expected to talk about an ongoing problem with the iPhone 4 antenna .
Could 84 % of Facebook soon fall into the hands of a web designer ( later wood pellet distributor ) called Paul Ceglia ?
It 's unlikely , but to prevent it , Facebook will have to disprove Ceglia 's claims in court .
According to the lawsuit ( embedded below ) , filed in the Supreme Court in New York 's Allegany County last month , Paul Ceglia signed a contract with Facebook in April 2003 to design and develop thefacebook.com ( Facebook 's original name ) .
Ceglia claims that , according to the contract , he was to be given a $ 1,000 fee and a 50 % stake in Facebook for services rendered , with a further 1 % stake for each day until the site was finished , which was on February 4 , 2004 .
Add it all up , and Ceglia claims he should be the owner of 84 % of Facebook .
The terms of the contract are weird , and the timing ( more than six years after the contract was signed ) of the lawsuit is suspicious at best , but the story gets even weirder from there , as Ceglia was sued last year for failing to deliver wood pellets to customers , with damages to the tune of $ 200,000 .
We do n't see Ceglia winning this , but it already caused some problems for Facebook ; the court has issued a temporary restraining order , barring founder Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook from transferring any assets .
Facebook asked for the case to be transferred to a federal court , and is trying to have it annulled .

Irish homeowners can now legally use guns to defend themselves if their homes are attacked under new legislation .
The new home defense bill has moved the balance of rights back to the house owner if his home is broken into " where it should always have been " , say top Irish police .
The police association of superintendents and inspectors , the AGSI , stated that “ the current situation , which legally demands a house owner retreat from an intruder , was intolerable " .
The new bill was published by Justice Minister Dermot Ahern yesterday .
Under the bill homeowners will be allowed to use " reasonable " force against intruders to defend themselves , others or their property .
This includes lethal force , depending on the circumstances .
Justice Minister Dermot
Ahern stated that house owners could use guns in self - defense , especially if the intruders were armed but said it would ultimately be a matter for the courts to resolve .
The bill also clarifies that a house owner will not be required to retreat from an intruder .
and that intruders injured as a result of reasonable force wo n’t be able to sue the house owner .
" The bill is welcomed because it aims to clarify the entitlements of a homeowner when faced with the situation where an uninvited intruder has entered the home , " AGSI vice - president Dan Hanley told the Irish Examiner .
" The bill aims to shift the balance of rights back to the homeowner where it should always have been .
It is intolerable a homeowner should be compelled to retreat in front of an intruder who has entered the home and who may have malign intentions towards the homeowner , the family or the home owner ’s property . "
Hanley added : " It is ridiculous to suggest the bill , which attempts to redress a serious legal imbalance , would provide a license to kill or a ‘ have - a - go ’ charter for homeowners , the vast majority of whom will continue to act with good sense and in a peaceful way . "
Minister
Ahern also dismissed the suggestion the bill was a " license to kill " .
He stated it merely allowed for lethal force provided it was justifiable .
Rural Link , the national network of community groups in rural Ireland welcomed the bill , saying it was " sensible legislation giving much needed clarity to homeowners on their rights when confronted by intruders " .
The Irish Council for Civil Liberties however , stated it would inspect the bill to establish that it was " human - rights compliant " .
The need for new legislation became evident after an intruder , John Ward , was shot dead while on the land and dwelling area of Mayo farmer , Pádraig Nally .
Nally was convicted of manslaughter , but his conviction was later overturned after a public outcry .
Burglaries in Ireland increased from 23,600 in 2007 to 26,800 in 2009 .
Violent burglaries rose from 255 to 363 in the same period .
Paris .
If anyone can sum up that city in just a few succinct paragraphs , I would be highly suspicious of how much they actually went out and experienced there .
Overwhelmed by all of the words that could be said , the myriad of stories that could be told , after a mere 5 1/2 days of total immersion in the capital of France , I found it impossible to pick and choose the right ones at all .
( However , if you want to know more about the photos I posted , you can now see a few brief descriptions and explanations on Flickr . )
Speechless , stunned , and yet brimming with inspiration , I was back at work in the kitchen again as soon as we walked through the door .
Suitcases still stuffed , with both dirty laundry and happy memories , the familiar scent of buttery pastries began floating through the air , as if we had never left Paris at all .
This time , however , I could actually enjoy those flaky delicacies , instead of solely photographing them .
I ’ll be the first to admit that these are no where near as grand as those massive breakfast confections , but for a first try , I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome .
Cut into miniature sizes , each croissant was but two bites each , but unarguably rich enough to quell any further hunger .
Despite how intimidating the hundreds of paper - thin layers may seem , croissants are actually quite simple to make ; it ’s the waiting and repetition that might become a bit trying .
Luckily , I found a recipe for “ quick ” croissants , which can produce fresh , homemade pastries from start to finish in about 3 hours .
Adapting it to better suit my American cups and teaspoons , while also easily veganizing it , this is definitely a good starting place for anyone who wants to give croissants a try for themselves .
Basic Vegan Croissants
Dough :
2 1/4 Cups Bread Flour
1 Teaspoon Active Dry Yeast
1/2 Cup + 2 Teaspoons Water
1 Teaspoon Salt
2 Tablespoons + 2 Teaspoons Granulated Sugar
1 1/2 Tablespoons Melted Margarine
“ Butter ” Block :
9 Tablespoons Margarine , Frozen
To make the dough , start by combining all of the dry ingredients together in a large bowl until well distributed .
Mix everything together and knead until a smooth dough is formed .
Let rest in the fridge for 20 - 30 minutes .
Add in the water and melted margarine , and stir thoroughly to incorporate .
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and kneed by hand for about 10 – 15 minutes , until smooth and elastic .
Place in a lightly greased bowl , cover with plastic wrap , and let rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes .
While the dough chills , you can go ahead and prepare the “ butter ” block .
It helps to start by cutting the margarine into sizable chunks and arranging them right next to each other in as even of a rectangle as possible on top of a silpat or piece of parchment paper .
Sandwich the margarine in between another silpat or sheet of parchment paper , and using your rolling pin , whack it into submission .
You want to flatten the block out to about 1 cm or so high , and try to keep the sides even and rectangular .
Allow it to chill in the fridge for 20 - 30 minutes .
Once properly chilled , roll the dough out into a rectangle about twice as large as your “ butter ” block .
Place the “ butter ” block in the center , diagonal to the sides ( not parallel . )
Enclose the block like an envelope , bringing the corners of the dough in to meet at the center .
Roll the whole thing out gently to a thickness of about 1 cm again , and fold the short sides in by thirds .
Return it to the fridge so that it can chill for another 20 minutes before proceeding .
Do n’t be tempted to hasten this time , as the heat from your hands and the rolling pin will make all of the margarine melt and run out .
It ’s essential to keep this dough as cool as possible before it hits the oven !
The folding and shaping process is rather difficult to describe in words , so do n’t worry if you ’re a bit confused .
Just check out the very helpful photos over at WikiHow and Joe Pastry if you need a visual aid .
Roll out the dough into a rectangle yet again , and fold in thirds as before .
Chill for the same amount of time , and then repeat this process once more .
Chill the dough for 20 more minutes before shaping it .
To shape your croissants , roll the dough out into a rectangle as before , but cut it with a very sharp knife into equal triangles .
If you want mini croissants , cut the dough in half lengthwise first , and then cut your triangles .
Roll each triangle up , starting at the widest side , and the place each one on a fresh silpat or piece of parchment paper .
Once all the croissants are cut and rolled , let them rise in a warm place for about 75 minutes , until nearly doubled in size .
After rising , move the croissants into a preheated 415 degree oven .
As soon as they ’re safely inside , reduce the heat to 350 degrees , and do not open the door again until 15 minutes has elapsed .
They should be golden brown , but if not , bake for an additional 5 – 10 minutes as necessary .
Let cool before enjoying the fruits of your labor !

With the gulf oil spill creating political opportunity , Senate Democrats will begin crafting a sweeping energy bill this week that could include a first - ever , though more modest , cap on global - warming pollution , believing they must act now despite differences within their ranks and political jitters in an election year .
Instead of regulating all sources of greenhouse gas emissions as originally proposed , lawmakers are considering placing a carbon cap initially only on utility companies .
That idea was once dismissed by environmentalists as too incremental , but now is seen by some as better than no cap at all .
President Obama will meet Tuesday with a bipartisan group of senators to push for a new energy policy .
“ We are prepared and ready to move forward on a new energy strategy that the American people desperately want but for which there ’s been insufficient political will , ” Obama said recently .
“ It is time for us to move to a clean - energy future . ”
With political will running short before the midterm election , the Senate has shown little appetite for a broader , economy - wide climate change bill as passed by the House almost exactly one year ago .
Even a more modest carbon cap remains difficult for senators wary of another ambitious government program at a time of voter unrest over Washington ’s reach .
A broad carbon - pricing system would essentially require power plants , manufacturers and transportation industries to limit the pollution that scientists say is causing climate change and would tax entities that exceed their caps .
Republicans dismiss such a cap - and - trade system as a new tax on households and business — “ cap- and - tax , ” they call it .
With the Democrats ’ 59 - member caucus intensely divided on energy issues , crossover support from Republicans would be needed .
Still , a majority of Democrats appear willing to risk legislative failure , believing a robust summer discussion on energy would establish a stark contrast between the parties before the fall election .
Tackling energy legislation gives Democrats a strategy they believe resonates with voters — though one that would expose them to GOP taunts over higher taxes , a fight Republicans would relish .
“ If we spend our time always worrying about that 60th vote , we never get to do anything in a strong position , ” said Sen. Mark Begich ( D- Alaska ) .
A group of senators is expected to meet this week to begin crafting legislation that could come to the floor in mid-July .
Legislative realists know the complications of passing an energy bill .
It often takes years of tortuous negotiations as lawmakers split along regional rather than partisan lines .
Any cap on carbon emissions draws fierce opposition from coal - state lawmakers and those from states with manufacturing industries that could be taxed for emissions .
“ We have to get to the 60 votes , but it ’s not going to happen , I think , without the public really weighing in a major way — and we need Republican votes , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif . ) .
The bill is likely to be a broad collection of provisions , including some in response to the gulf spill that would increase the liability caps on oil companies and impose tougher environmental and safety rules on offshore drilling .
The legislation is also expected to include new requirements that utilities generate more electricity from wind , solar or other renewable sources , as well as stricter efficiency standards for appliances and buildings .
Key will be whether the bill includes a cap on carbon emissions — a long - sought Democratic goal .
Corporate executives who are usually regulation - averse have pushed Congress to act , preferring legislation to what they see as inevitable regulation coming from the administration , as the Environmental Protection Agency begins to regulate carbon next year .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , an architect of broader climate change legislation , believes a cap on the utility industry alone “ would be a significant step forward . ”
Key Republicans have given the proposal currency by indicating they could be open to such an approach .
“ I ’m willing to look at it , ” said Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , who plans to attend Tuesday ’s White House meeting .
Several Democratic senators have urged their colleagues to steer away from any carbon - pricing mechanism and focus on a narrower — but still weighty — bill that reduces foreign oil dependence by developing cleaner energy sources and increasing efficiency standards .
“ That ’s the basis for legislation that can pass , ” said Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated the need for Obama to engage fully on the issue that is one of the top remaining items on his domestic agenda .
“ I think it ’s pretty clear we have to do something , ” Reid said last week .
“ The question is what do we do , and a lot of that depends on what the White House is going to do to help us get something done . ”

I was watching engineers argue , someone was bitching about a code reviewer asking him to put more parentheses in a conditional : “ As if I do n’t know the precedence rules ! ” I do n’t know them , as a matter of principle .
Seriously .
I ’ve learned a lot of programming languages over the years , and I ’ve taken care never to learn the operator precedence rules in any of them .
It ’s easy to get them wrong and get bitten and why should I require that people reading my code learn those stupid rules .
Today I wrote this :
while ( calls.moveToNext ( ) && ( count < howMany ) ) {
I sorta kinda think that the parentheses after the && are superfluous , but being sure would mean memorizing something that adds no value and furthermore require that subsequent programmers do the same .
So for the last couple of decades I ’ve just put all the parens in , regardless .
A related case : I have never bothered to learn , nor will I , what the default modifiers for Java ’s variables and methods are .
Thus , every one of those things gets one of private or public or protected in front of it .
There are way better things to load up the finite cupboard - space in my mind with .
No , I do n’t think it ’s a big deal ; just saying .
Image caption Uruguay has already distributed laptops to 380,000 primary - aged children
The so - called $ 100 laptop has undergone a facelift in order to be used by secondary school children .
The machines , designed by One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) , are based on the original XO laptop , which was built for primary school children .
The new computers feature a larger keyboard and upgraded software .
Uruguay , which has already distributed nearly 400,000 XO laptops to primary schools , has ordered 90,000 of the new laptops , known as the XO - HS .
It has also ordered 10,000 machines designed by rival Intel , which makes the Classmate PC , also developed for children .
" We want to see how students react and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each , " said Miguel Brechner , director of the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay , who is in charge of the country 's Plan Ceibal ( Education Connect ) project .
' Full saturation '
The government scheme has given many people in the country their first taste of computers and the internet .
Image caption Intel 's Classmate PC was recently updated and now runs Windows 7
It has delivered 380,000 XO laptops to primary school students and nearly 20,000 to teachers .
" Uruguay is the only deployment that is complete , " Kalil Nicolas of the OLPC Association , told BBC News .
" They have full saturation of their primary schools . "
The 90,000 XO - HS machines will be rolled out to some of Uruguay 's 230,000 high school students .
" We are expanding our reach , " said Mr Nicolas .
" We still want to focus on 6 - 12 year olds - and motivate them - but they need a laptop to grow into . "
Deliveries of the new laptops will begin in September 2010 .
Mr Nicolas said that they would also be offered to other countries interested in connecting high - school students .
Tablet future
The original XO laptop was designed specifically for children in the developing world and featured a rugged design aimed at keeping out water and dust , a sunlight - readable display and open source software .
It was designed by OLPC , a spin out from US university MIT .
The organisation originally aimed to sell the green and white machines in lots of one million to governments in developing countries for $ 100 each .
However , it had difficulty getting governments to commit to bulk orders .
Mr Nicolas said that 1.2 million machines had been deployed so far and OLPC was contracted to supply a further 500,000 .
Each laptop ordered by Uruguay cost $ 209 .

The new XO - HS laptops will be based on the same design as the original , but will be tweaked to appeal to be used by older children .
In particular , it will feature a larger keyboard better suited to older students and will be offered in different colours to the original machines .
Although it will have the ability to run two operating systems - including Microsoft Windows - the project has chosen to use Linux .
It is one of the most significant changes to the machine 's outward appearance since it was first launched .
However , a more radical transformation could be on the horizon .
Earlier this year , OLPC founder Nichols Negroponte recently announced a partnership with chip - maker Marvell to design a touchscreen tablet computer .
The firm had previously announced a prototype of a similar device , which Mr Negroponte said could cost as little as $ 75 .
The machine - known as the XO - 3 - promises wi-fi , high - quality video and stills cameras , 3D graphics and low power consumption .
It could be launched as early as 2011 .

An intro to modern OpenGL .
Chapter 4 : Rendering a Dynamic 3D Scene with Phong Shading
At this point , we 've seen the most important core parts of the OpenGL API and gotten a decent taste of the GLSL language .
Now 's a good time to start exercising OpenGL and implementing some graphic effects , introducing new nuances and specialized features of OpenGL and GLSL as we go .
For the next few chapters , I 've prepared a new demo program you can get from my Github ch4 - flag repository .
The flag demo renders a waving flag on a flagpole against a simple background :
With the flat , wallpaper - looking grass and brick textures and the unnatural lack of shadow cast by the flag , it looks like something a Nintendo 64 would have rendered , but it 's a start .
We 'll improve the graphical fidelity of the demo over the next few chapters .
For this chapter , we 'll render the above image by implementing the Phong shading model , which will serve as the basis for more advanced effects we 'll look at later on .
Overview of the flag program
I 've organized flag into four C files and four headers .
You 've already seen a good amount of it in hello - gl : the file - util.c and file - util.h files contain the read_tga and file_contents functions , and gl- util.c and gl- util.h contain the make_texture , make_shader , and make_program functions we wrote in chapter 2 .
The vec-util.h header contains some basic vector math functions .
flag .c looks a lot like hello - gl .c did : in main , we initialize GLUT and GLEW , set up callbacks for GLUT events , call a make_resources function to allocate a bunch of GL resources , and call out to glutMainLoop to start running the demo .
However , the setup and rendering are a bit more involved than last time .
Let 's look at what 's new and changed :
Mesh construction
The meshes .c file contains code that generates the vertex and element arrays , collectively called a mesh , for the flag , flagpole , ground , and wall objects that we 'll be rendering .
Most objects in the real world , including real flagpoles and flags , have smooth curving surfaces , but graphics cards deal with triangles .
To render these objects , we have to approximate their surfaces as a collection of triangles .
We do this by filling a vertex array with vertices placed along its surface , storing attributes of the surface with each vertex , and connecting the samples into triangles using the element array to give an approximation of the original surface .
The fundamental properties a mesh stores for each vertex are its position in world space and its normal , a vector perpendicular to the original surface .
The normal is fundamental to shading calculations , as we 'll see shortly .
Normals should be unit vectors , that is , vectors whose length is one .
Each vertex also has material parameters that indicate how the surface is shaded .
The material can consist of a set of per-vertex values , texture coordinates that sample material information from a texture , or some combination of both .
For the flag demo , the material consists of a texture coordinate for sampling the diffuse color from the mesh texture , a specular color , and shininess factor .
We 'll see how these parameters are used shortly .
Our vertex buffer thus contains an array of flag_vertex structs looking like this :
struct flag_vertex { GLfloat position [ 4 ] ; GLfloat normal [ 4 ] ; GLfloat texcoord [ 2 ] ; GLfloat shininess ; GLubyte specular [ 4 ] ; } ;
Although the position and normal are three - dimensional vectors , we pad them out to four elements because most GPUs prefer to load vector data from 128 - bit - aligned buffers , like SIMD instruction sets such as SSE .
For each mesh , we collect the vertex buffer , element buffer , texture object , and element count into a flag_mesh struct .
When we render , we set up glVertexAttribPointer s to pass all of the flag_vertex attributes to the vertex shader :
struct flag_mesh { GLuint vertex_buffer , element_buffer ; GLsizei element_count ; GLuint texture ; } ;
static void render_mesh ( struct flag_mesh const * mesh ) { glBindTexture ( GL_TEXTURE_2D , mesh -> texture ) ; glBindBuffer ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , mesh->vertex_buffer ) ; glVertexAttribPointer ( g_resources.flag_program.attributes.position , 3 , GL_FLOAT , GL_FALSE , sizeof ( struct flag_vertex ) , ( void * ) offsetof ( struct flag_vertex , position ) ) ; glVertexAttribPointer ( g_resources.flag_program.attributes.normal , 3 , GL_FLOAT , GL_FALSE , sizeof ( struct flag_vertex ) , ( void * ) offsetof ( struct flag_vertex , normal ) ) ; glVertexAttribPointer ( g_resources.flag_program.attributes.texcoord , 2 , GL_FLOAT , GL_FALSE , sizeof ( struct flag_vertex ) , ( void * ) offsetof ( struct flag_vertex , texcoord ) ) ; glVertexAttribPointer ( g_resources.flag_program.attributes.shininess , 1 , GL_FLOAT , GL_FALSE , sizeof ( struct flag_vertex ) , ( void * ) offsetof ( struct flag_vertex , shininess ) ) ; glVertexAttribPointer ( g_resources.flag_program.attributes.specular , 4 , GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE , GL_TRUE , sizeof ( struct flag_vertex ) , ( void * ) offsetof ( struct flag_vertex , specular ) ) ; glBindBuffer ( GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER , mesh->element_buffer ) ; glDrawElements ( GL_TRIANGLES , mesh->element_count , GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT , ( void * ) 0 ) ; }
Note that the glVertexAttribPointer call for the specular color attribute passes GL_TRUE for the normalized argument .
The specular colors are stored as four - component arrays of bytes between 0 and 255 , much as they would be in a bitmap image , but with the normalized flag set , they 'll be presented to the shaders as normalized floating - point values between 0.0 and 1.0 .
The actual code to generate the meshes is fairly tedious , so I 'll just describe it at a high level .
We construct two distinct meshes : the background mesh , created by init_background_mesh , which consists of the static flagpole , ground , and wall objects ; and the flag , set up by init_flag_mesh .
The background mesh consists of two large rectangles for the ground and wall , and a thin cylinder with a pointed truck making the flagpole .
The wall , ground , and flagpole are assigned texture coordinates to sample out of a single texture atlas image containing the grass , brick , and metal textures , stored in background .
tga .
This allows the entire background to be rendered in a single pass with the same active texture .
The flagpole is additionally given a yellow specular color , which will give it a metallic sheen when we shade it .
The flag is generated by evaluating the function calculate_flag_vertex at regular intervals between zero and one on the s and t parametric axes , generating something that looks sort of like a flag flapping in the breeze .
The flag being a separate mesh makes it easy to update the mesh data as the flag animates , and lets us render it with its own texture , loaded from flag .tga .
Streaming dynamic mesh data
void update_flag_mesh ( struct flag_mesh const * mesh , struct flag_vertex * vertex_data , GLfloat time ) { GLsizei s , t , i ; for ( t = 0 , i = 0 ; t < FLAG_Y_RES ; ++t ) for ( s = 0 ; s < FLAG_X_RES ; ++s , ++i ) { GLfloat ss = FLAG_S_STEP * s , tt = FLAG_T_STEP * t ; calculate_flag_vertex( &vertex_data[i ] , ss , tt , time ) ; } glBindBuffer ( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , mesh->vertex_buffer ) ; glBufferData( GL_ARRAY_BUFFER , FLAG_VERTEX_COUNT
* sizeof ( struct flag_vertex ) , vertex_data , GL_STREAM_DRAW ) ; }
To animate the flag , we use our glutIdleFunc callback to recalculate the flag 's vertices and update the contents of the vertex buffer .
We update the buffer with the same glBufferData function we used to initialize it .
However , both on initialization and on each update , we give the flag vertex data the GL_STREAM_DRAW hint instead of the GL_STATIC_DRAW hint we 've been using until now .
This tells the OpenGL driver to optimize for the fact that we 'll be continuously replacing the buffer with new data .
Since only the positions and normals of the vertices themselves changes , the element buffer for the flag can remain static .
The connectivity of the vertices does n't change .
Using a depth buffer to order 3D objects
Since we 're drawing multiple objects in 3d space , we need to ensure that objects closer to the viewer render on top of the objects behind them .
An easy way to do this would be to just render the objects back - to - front — in our case , render the background mesh first , then the flag on top of it — but this is inefficient because of the overdraw this approach leads to : fragments get generated and processed by the fragment shader for background objects , only to be immediately overwritten by the foreground objects in front of it .
Back - to - front rendering also cannot render mutually overlapping objects , such as two interlocked rings , on its own , for rendering either object first will cause it to entirely overlap the other .
Graphics cards use depth buffers to provide efficient and reliable ordering of 3d objects .
A depth buffer is a part of the framebuffer that sits alongside the color buffer , and like the color buffer , is a two - dimensional array of pixel values .
Instead of color values , the depth buffer stores a depth value , associating a projection - space z coordinate to each pixel .
When a triangle is rasterized with depth testing enabled , each fragment 's projected z value is compared to the z value currently stored in the depth buffer .
If the fragment would be further away from the viewer than the current depth buffer value , the fragment is discarded .
Otherwise , the fragment gets rendered to the color and depth buffers , the new z value replacing the old depth buffer value .
In addition to providing correct ordering of objects , depth buffering also minimizes the cost of overdraw if you render objects front - to - back .
Although the rasterizer will still generate fragments for parts of objects obscured by already - rendered objects , modern GPUs can discard these obscured fragments before they get run through the fragment shader , reducing the number of overall fragment shader invocations the processor needs to execute .
Since our flag mesh appears in front of the background mesh , we thus render the flag before the background so that the obscured parts of the background do n't need to be shaded .
To use depth testing in our program , we need to ask for a depth buffer in our framebuffer and then enable depth testing in the OpenGL state .
With GLUT , we can ask for a depth buffer for a window by passing the GLUT_DEPTH flag to glutInitDisplayMode :
int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { glutInit ( &argc , argv ) ; glutInitDisplayMode ( GLUT_RGB
| GLUT_DEPTH | GLUT_DOUBLE ) ; /* ... */ }
We enable and disable depth testing by calling glEnable or glDisable with GL_DEPTH_TEST :
static void init_gl_state ( void ) { /* ... */ glEnable ( GL_DEPTH_TEST ) ; /* ... */ }
When we start rendering our scene , we need to clear the depth buffer along with the color buffer to ensure that stale depth values do n't affect rendering .
We can clear both buffers with a single glClear call by passing it both GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT and GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT :
static void render ( void ) { glClear ( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT ) ; /* ... */ }
Back - face culling
Another potential source of overdraw comes from within an object .
If you look at the cylindrical flagpole from any direction , you 're going to see at most half of its surface .
The front - facing triangles appear in front of the back - facing triangles , but they rasterize into the same pixels on screen .
Depending on the ordering of triangles in the mesh , the front - facing triangles will either overdraw the back - facing triangles or the fragments of the back - facing triangles will fail the depth test , requiring some extra work from the GPU in either case .
However , we can get the GPU to cheaply and quickly discard back - facing triangles even before they get rasterized or depth - tested .
If we enable back - face culling , the graphics card will classify every triangle as front - or back - facing after running the vertex shader and immediately prior to rasterization , completely discarding back - facing triangles .
It does this by looking at the winding of each triangle in projection space .
By default , triangles winding counterclockwise are considered front - facing .
This works because transforming a triangle to face the opposite direction from the viewer reverses its winding .
By constructing our meshes so that all of the triangles wind counterclockwise when viewed from the front , we can use back - face culling to eliminate most of the work of rasterizing those triangles when they face away from the viewer .
Only the vertex shader will need to run for their vertices .
Back - face culling is enabled and disabled by passing GL_CULL_FACE to glEnable / glDisable :
static void init_gl_state ( void ) { /* ... */ glEnable ( GL_CULL_FACE ) ; /* ... */ }
Updating the projection matrix and viewport
If you go back a chapter and try resizing the hello - gl window , you 'll notice that the image stretches to fit the new size of the window , ruining the aspect ratio we worked so hard to preserve .
In order to maintain an accurate aspect ratio , we have to recalculate our projection matrix when the window size changes , taking the new aspect ratio into account .
We also have to inform OpenGL of the new viewport size by calling glViewport .
GLUT allows us to provide a callback that gets invoked when the window is resized using glutReshapeFunc :
static void reshape ( int w , int h ) { g_resources.window_size[0 ] = w ; g_resources.window_size [ 1 ] = h ; update_p_matrix ( g_resources.p_matrix , w , h ) ; glViewport ( 0 , 0 , w , h ) ; }
int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { /* ... */ glutReshapeFunc( &reshape ) ; /* ... */ }
The update_p_matrix function implements the perspective matrix formula from last chapter and stores the new projection matrix in the g_resources .
p_matrix array , from which we 'll feed our shaders ' p_matrix uniform variable .
Handling mouse and keyboard input with GLUT
GLUT provides extremely primitive support for mouse and keyboard input .
In flag , I 've made it so that dragging the mouse moves the view around , and the view snaps back to its original position when the mouse button is released .
GLUT offers a glutMotionFunc callback that gets called when the mouse moves while a button is held down and a glutMouseFunc that gets called when a mouse button is pressed or released .
( There 's also glutPassiveMotion Func to handle mouse motion when a button is n't pressed , which we do n't use . )
Our glutMotionFunc adjusts the model - view matrix relative to the distance from the center of the window , and our glutMouseFunc resets it when the mouse button is let go :
static void drag ( int x , int y ) { float w = ( float ) g_resources.window_size[0 ] ; float h = ( float ) g_resources.window_size [ 1 ] ; g_resources.eye_offset[ 0 ] = ( float ) x /w - 0.5f ; g_resources.eye_offset [ 1 ] = -( float ) y/h + 0.5f ; update_mv_matrix( g_resources.mv_matrix , g_resources.eye_offset ) ; } static void mouse ( int button , int state , int x , int y ) { if ( button == GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON && state == GLUT_UP ) { g_resources.eye_offset[ 0 ] = 0.0f ; g_resources.eye_offset [ 1 ] = 0.0f ; update_mv_matrix( g_resources.mv_matrix , g_resources.eye_offset ) ; } }
int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { /* ... */ glutMotionFunc( &drag ) ; glutMouseFunc( &mouse ) ; /* ... */ }
The update_mv_matrix function is similar to update_p_matrix .
It generates a translation matrix , following the formula from last chapter , and stores it to g_resources .
mv_matrix , from which we feed the shaders ' mv_matrix uniform variable .
I also rigged flag so you can reload the GLSL program from disk while the demo is running by pressing the R key .
The glutKeyboard Func callback gets called when a key is pressed .
Our callback checks if the pressed key was R , and if so , calls update_flag_program :
static void keyboard ( unsigned char key , int x , int y ) { if ( key == 'r ' || key == ' R ' ) { update_flag_program ( ) ; } }
int main ( int argc , char* argv[ ] ) { /* ... */ glutKeyboardFunc( &keyboard ) ; /* ... */ }
update_flag_program attempts to load , compile , and link the flag .v.glsl and flag .
f.glsl files from disk , and if successful , replaces the old shader and program objects .
That covers the C code for the flag demo .
The actual shading happens inside the GLSL code , which we 'll look at next .
Phong shading
Physically accurate light simulation requires expensive algorithms that have only recently become possible for even high - end computer clusters to calculate in real time .
Fortunately , human eyes do n't require perfect physical accuracy , especially not for fast - moving animated graphics , and real - time computer graphics has come a long way rendering impressive graphics on typical consumer hardware using cheap tricks that approximate the behavior of light without simulating it perfectly .
The most fundamental of these tricks is the Phong shading model , an inexpensive approximation of how light interacts with simple materials developed by computer graphics pioneer Bui Tuong Phong in the early 1970s .
Phong shading is a local illumination simulation — it only considers the direct interaction between a light source and a single point .
Because of this , Phong shading alone cannot calculate effects that involve the influence of other objects in a scene , such as shadows and mirror reflections .
This is why the flag casts no shadow on the ground or wall behind it .
The Phong model involves three different lighting terms :
ambient reflection , a constant term that simulates the background level of light ;
reflection , a constant term that simulates the background level of light ; diffuse reflection , which gives the material what we usually think of as its color ;
reflection , which gives the material what we usually think of as its color ; and specular reflection , the shine of polished or metallic surfaces .
Diffuse and ambient reflection
If you hold a flat sheet of paper up to a lamp in a dark room , it will appear brightest when it faces the lamp head - on , and appear dimmer as you rotate it away from the light , reaching its darkest when it 's perpendicular to the light .
Curved surfaces behave the same way ; if you roll up or crumple the paper , its surface will be brightest where it faces the light the most directly .
The wider the angle between the surface normal and the light direction , the darker the paper appears .
If the paper and light remain stationary but you move your head , the paper 's apparent color and brightness wo n't change .
Likewise , in the flag demo , if you drag the view with the mouse , you can see the flag 's shading remains the same .
The surface reflects light evenly in every direction , or " diffusely . "
This basic lighting effect is thus called diffuse reflection .
There 's an inexpensive operation called the dot product that produces a scalar value from two vectors related to the angle between them .
Given two unit vectors u and v , if their dot product u · v ( pronounced " u dot v " ) is one , then the vectors face the exact same direction ; if zero , they 're perpendicular ; and if negative one , they face exact opposite directions .
Positive dot products indicate acute angles while negative dot products indicate obtuse angles .
GLSL provides a function dot ( u , v ) to calculate the dot product of two same - sized vec values .
The dot product 's behavior follows that of diffuse reflection : surfaces reflect more light the more parallel to a light source they become , or in other words , the closer the dot product of their normal and the light 's direction gets to one .
Perpendicular or back - facing surfaces reflect no light , and their dot product will be zero or negative .
This relationship between the dot product and diffuse brightness was first observed by 18th - century physicist Johann Lambert and is referred to as Lambertian reflectance , and surfaces that exhibit the behavior are called Lambertian surfaces .
Phong shading uses Lambertian reflectance to model diffuse reflection , taking the dot product of the surface normal and the direction from the surface to the light source .
If the dot product is greater than zero , it is multiplied by the diffuse color of the light , and the result is multiplied with the surface diffuse color to get the shaded result .
( Multiplying two color values involves multiplying their corresponding red , green , blue , and alpha components together , which is what GLSL's * operator does when given two vec4 s. )
If the dot product is zero or negative , the diffuse color will be zero .
However , in the real world , even when a surface is n't directly lit , it still wo n't appear pitch black .
In any enclosed area , there will be a certain amount of ambient reflection bouncing around , dimly illuminating areas that the light sources do n't directly hit .
The Phong model simulates the ambient effect by assigning light sources a constant ambient color .
This ambient color gets added to the light 's diffuse color after it 's been multiplied by the dot product .
The sum of ambient and diffuse effect colors is then multiplied by the surface 's diffuse color to give the shaded result .
Specular reflection
Not all surfaces reflect light uniformly ; many materials , including metals , glass , hair , and skin , have a reflective sheen .
Unlike with diffuse reflection , if the viewer moves while a light source and shiny object remain stationary , the shine will move along the surface with the viewer .
You can see this simulated in the flag demo by looking at the flagpole : as you drag the view up and down , the gold sheen moves along the pole with you .
Physically , an object appears shiny when its surface is covered in highly reflective microfacets .
These facets face every direction , creating a bright shiny spot where the light source reflects directly toward the viewer .
This effect is called specular reflection .
The specular effect is caused by reflection from the light source to the viewer , so Phong shading simulates the specular effect by reflecting the light direction around the surface normal to give a reflection direction .
We can then take the dot product of the reflection direction and the direction from the surface to the viewer .
Microfacets on a specular surface follow a normal distribution : a plurality of facets lie parallel to the surface , and there is an exponential dropoff in the number of facets at steeper angles from the surface .
The dropoff is sharper for more polished surfaces , giving a smaller , tighter specular highlight .
Phong shading approximates this distribution by raising the dot product to an exponent called the shininess factor , with higher shininess giving a more polished shine and lower factors giving a more diffuse sheen .
This final specular factor is then multiplied by the specular colors of the light source and surface , and the result added to the diffuse and ambient colors to give the final color .
Non-specular surfaces have a transparent specular color with red , green , blue , and alpha components set to zero , which eliminates the specular term from the shading equation .
Implementing Phong shading in GLSL
Shading calculations are usually performed in the vertex and fragment shaders , where they can leverage the GPU 's parallel processing power .
( This is where the term " shader " for GPU programs comes from . )
Let 's bring back the graphics pipeline diagram to get an overview of the Phong shading dataflow :
For the best accuracy , we perform shading at a per-fragment level .
( For better performance , shading can also be done in the vertex shader and the results interpolated between vertices , but this will lead to less accurate shading , especially for specular effects . )
The vertex shader , flag.v.glsl , thus only performs transformation and projection , using the p_matrix and mv_matrix we pass in as uniforms .
The shader forwards most of the material vertex attributes to varying variables for the fragment shader to use :
#version 110 uniform mat4 p_matrix , mv_matrix ; uniform sampler2D texture ; attribute vec3 position , normal ; attribute vec2 texcoord ; attribute float shininess ; attribute vec4 specular ; varying vec3 frag_position , frag_normal ; varying vec2 frag_texcoord ; varying float frag_shininess ; varying vec4 frag_specular ; void main ( ) { vec4 eye_position = mv_matrix * vec4 ( position , 1.0 ) ; gl_Position = p_matrix * eye_position ; frag_position = eye_position.xyz ; frag_normal = ( mv_matrix * vec4 ( normal , 0.0 ) ) .xyz ; frag_texcoord = texcoord ; frag_shininess = shininess ; frag_specular = specular ; }
In addition to the texture coordinate , shininess , and specular color , the vertex shader also outputs to the fragment shader the model - view - transformed vertex position .
The model - view matrix transforms the coordinate space so that the viewer is at the origin , so we can determine the surface - to - viewer direction needed by the specular calculation from ths transformed position .
We likewise transform the normal vector to keep it in the same frame of reference as the position .
Since the normal is a directional vector without a position , we apply the matrix to it with a w component of zero , which cancels out the translation of the modelview matrix and only applies its rotation .
With this set of varying values , the fragment shader , flag .
f.glsl , can perform the actual Phong calculation :
#version 110 uniform mat4 p_matrix , mv_matrix ; uniform sampler2D texture ; varying vec3 frag_position , frag_normal ; varying vec2 frag_texcoord ; varying float frag_shininess ; varying vec4 frag_specular ; const vec3 light_direction = vec3( 0.408248 , -0.816497 , 0.408248 ) ; const vec4 light_diffuse = vec4 ( 0.8 , 0.8 , 0.8 , 0.0 ) ; const vec4 light_ambient = vec4 ( 0.2 , 0.2 , 0.2 , 1.0 ) ; const vec4 light_specular = vec4 ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.0 ) ; void main ( ) { vec3 mv_light_direction = ( mv_matrix * vec4 ( light_direction , 0.0 ) ) .xyz , normal = normalize ( frag_normal ) , eye = normalize ( frag_position ) , reflection = reflect ( mv_light_direction , normal ) ; vec4 frag_diffuse = texture2D ( texture , frag_texcoord ) ; vec4 diffuse_factor = max ( - dot ( normal , mv_light_direction ) , 0.0 ) * light_diffuse ; vec4 ambient_diffuse_factor = diffuse_factor + light_ambient ; vec4 specular_factor = max ( pow ( - dot ( reflection , eye ) , frag_shininess ) , 0.0 ) * light_specular ; gl_FragColor = specular_factor * frag_specular + ambient_diffuse_factor * frag_diffuse ; }
To keep things simple , the shader defines a single light source using const values in the shader source .
A real renderer would likely feed these light parameters in as uniform values , so that lights can be moved or their material attributes changed from the host program .
With the light attributes embedded in the GLSL as constants , it 's easy to change the light attributes in the source , press R to reload the shader , and see the result .
Our light source acts as if it were infinitely far away , shining from the same light_direction on every surface in the scene .
The light is white , with a 20 % baseline ambient light level .
It can be made colored by replacing light_diffuse , light_ambient , light_specular with RGBA values .
The fragment shader uses several new GLSL functions we have n't seen before :
normalize ( v ) returns a unit vector with the same direction as v .
We use it here to convert the fragment position into a direction vector , and to ensure that the normal is a unit vector .
Even if our original vertex normals are all unit vectors , their linear interpolations wo n't be .
returns a unit vector with the same direction as .
We use it here to convert the fragment position into a direction vector , and to ensure that the normal is a unit vector .
Even if our original vertex normals are all unit vectors , their linear interpolations wo n't be.
pow( x , n) raises x to the n th power , which we use to apply the specular shininess factor .
raises to the th power , which we use to apply the specular shininess factor .
max ( n , m ) returns the larger of n or m .
We use it to clamp dot products less than zero so they shade the same as if they were zero .
returns the larger of or .
We use it to clamp dot products less than zero so they shade the same as if they were zero. reflect ( u , v) reflects the vector u around v , giving a vector that makes the same angle with v as u , but in the opposite direction .
With it we derive the reflected eye direction for the specular calculation .
We transform our constant light_direction to put it in the same coordinate space as the normal and eye vectors .
We then sample the surface 's diffuse color from the mesh texture
We assign the shaded value to gl_FragColor to generate the final shaded fragment .
Tweaking the Phong model for stylistic effects
Before we wrap things up , let 's take a quick look at how the Phong framework can be manipulated to give more stylized results .
The classic Phong model is a photorealistic model : it attempts to model real - world light behavior .
But photorealism is n't always desirable .
Many games set themselves apart visually by using more stylized shading effects .
These effects often use the basic
Phong model of diffuse , ambient , and specular lighting , but they warp the individual factors before summing them together .
As a trivial example , we can get a brighter , softer shading effect if , instead of clamping the diffuse dot product of back - facing surfaces to zero , we scale it so that perpendicular surfaces receive half illumination , and back - facing surfaces scale linearly toward zero .
Team Fortress 2 uses this " half Lambert " reflectance scale , so called because the standard Lambertian dropoff rate is halved , as a basis for its cartoonish but semi-photorealistic look ( albeit heavily modified ) .
Let 's modify flag .
f.glsl to warp the diffuse dot product :
float warp_diffuse ( float d ) { return d * 0.5 + 0.5 ; } void main ( ) { // ... vec4 diffuse_factor = max ( warp_diffuse ( - dot ( normal , mv_light_direction ) ) , 0.0 ) * light_diffuse ; // ... }
A popular effect that builds from this half - Lambert scale is cel shading , in which a stair - step function is applied to the half - Lambert factor so that surfaces are shaded flatly with higher contrast between light and dark areas , in the style of traditional hand - drawn animation cels .
Jet Set Radio pioneered this look , and it 's since been used in countless games .
Implementing it in GLSL is easy :
float cel ( float d ) { return smoothstep ( 0.35 , 0.37 , d ) * 0.4 + smoothstep ( 0.70 , 0.72 , d ) * 0.6 ; } float warp_diffuse ( float d ) { return cel(d * 0.5 + 0.5 ) ; }
GLSL 's smoothstep ( lo , hi , x ) function behaves like this : if x is less than lo , it returns 0.0 ; if greater than hi , it returns 1.0 ; if in between , it transitions linearly from zero to one .
Our cel function above uses smoothstep to create three flat shading levels with short linear transitions in between .
There are other effects that can be performed by messing with the warp_diffuse function .
For example , the function does n't need to be float - to - float but could also map to a color scale ; you could map greater dot products to warmer reddish colors while lesser products map to cooler bluish colors to give an artistic illustration effect .
I encourage you to experiment with the fragment shader code to see what other effects you can create .
Conclusion
With Phong shading implemented , we can start adding additional effects to further improve the look of the flag scene .
The most glaring problem is the lack of shadow cast by the flag , so next chapter we 'll look at shadow mapping , a technique for rendering accurate shadows into a scene , and learn about off - screen framebuffer objects in the process .
Meanwhile , if you 're interested in learning more about real - time shading techniques on your own without an OpenGL bias , I highly recommend the book Real - Time Rendering .

SYDNEY ( Reuters Life ! ) -
An Australian restaurateur fed up with the waste left by diners has ordered her customers to eat everything on their plates for their sake of the earth or pay a penalty and not return .
Chef Yukako Ichikawa has introduced a 30 percent discount for diners who eat all the food they have ordered at Wafu , her 30 - seat restaurant in the Sydney suburb of Surry Hills , that describes itself as “ guilty free Japanese cuisine . ”
“ To contribute toward creating a sustainable future we request a little more of our guests than most other restaurants , ” she says in a list of her restaurant ’s policies that is pinned on the door to the eatery .
This list includes finishing all dishes ordered which are organic and free of gluten , dairy , sugar and eggs and the chef and her staff tell people who do n’t clear their plates to choose another restaurant next time .
“ Finishing your meal requires that everything is eaten except lemon slices , gari ( sushi ginger ) and wasabi , ” says the menu .
“ Please also note that vegetables and salad on the side are NOT decorations ; they are part of the meal too . ”
Wafu ’s strict policy has been welcomed by some but criticized as overbearing by some reviewers .
Ichikawa is undeterred .
“ Wafu is not just a restaurant ; it is an extension of Yukako ’s personal ethos toward nourishment and sustenance , ” says a statement on the restaurant ’s website .
“ We are not only committed to serving meals that nurture and respect the body but are actively dedicated to the notion of waste prevention , and take seriously our responsibility toward the environment and sustainability for the future . ”
I love niche programs , especially in the area of multimedia .
If you 're like me , you probably have a folder full of MP3s and Oggs collected from the last ten years that 's reached the point where you 've forgotten half the files in there .
This month , I stumbled upon the charming little command - line program , audiopreview .
To quote the project 's Freshmeat entry :
" audiopreview is a command - line tool that plays previews of many audio file types ( Ogg , MP3 , etc. ) , video file types ( AVI , MPEG , Real , etc. ) , and Internet streams .
It also can be used as a regular command - line media file player ( that is , play the files entirely like yauap or mpc123 would ) . "
audiopreview is a simple and easy command - line program for previewing large numbers of music files .
Although the name may suggest otherwise , audiopreview also plays video files .
Installation
Packages for audiopreview are available in Debian / Ubuntu format or the usual source .
If you 're running with the source , according to the man page , you need the following libraries : gstreamer0.10 - plugins - base , gstreamer0.10 -plugins -good , gstreamer0.10 - plugins - bad and gstreamer0.10 - plugins -ugly .
I found I also had to install the intltool library to get past the configure script .
Once you have the library side of things sorted out , compile the program with the usual :
$ ./ configure $ make
If your distro uses sudo :
$ sudo make install
If your distro does n't :
$ su # make install
Usage
Using the actual command can be as simple as entering the folder where the files you want to hear are located and entering :
$ audiopreview *
( The * is used to indicate all the files in a folder . )
Once the program is running , you 'll be greeted with a simple track listing , along with other relevant information in purple .
As far as controls go , the spacebar pauses and unpauses the stream , N plays the next stream , and P plays the previous stream .
R restarts the current stream , and Q stops playing and exits the program .
That 's the basic usage out of the way , but let 's refine it with some command - line switches to hone your usage .
For new Linux users , these are added at the end of the command , like this :
$ audiopreview files - to - play -- switch
If you plan on using audiopreview to play a whole song instead of in segments , use the switch -- entirely or -e .
If you want audiopreview to start over again after the last song has been played , use -- loop or -l .
As mentioned previously , audiopreview also can play some video formats .
However , this being a command - line program , there 's a good chance you may not have X running .
If so , you 'll want to disable the video to avoid errors .
To do so , enter -- no - video .
The default starting position for each file seems to be random , which might become annoying for those looking for more specific sections of a song .
Thankfully , you can specify which section of a song you want to hear with a simple numerical switch .
Add : -- position =POSITION
or -p POSITION , and replace POSITION with the numbers 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 .
0 sets the position to the beginning , 1 to the middle , 2 to the end , and 3 makes the start position random .
Last but not least , engage the all - important shuffle function with -- shuffle or - S .
For example :
$ audiopreview *.mp3 -p 1 -- shuffle
The above command plays all the MP3 files in a directory , sets the starting position to the middle of a song and shuffles the order in which they 're played .
You can work out the rest from here , but honestly , do yourself a favor and check out the man page with :
$ man audiopreview
Ultimately , audiopreview fills a nice little niche that will appeal to anyone sorting through large collections of music ( and some video ) files .
DJs in particular will find this of real use , but I found it great for rediscovering songs I had n't listened to in years .
Love it .

As if Zelda II was n't hard enough , a fan has remade the game so that it 's played through the eyes of Link .
The NES 's Zelda II : The Adventure of Link , sequel to The Legend of Zelda , discarded the first title 's top - down view and dropped main character Link into a side - scroller .
A fan named Michael A. Johnston decided to change the view a second time by converting Zelda II into a first - person shooter .
Until you lose a little bit of health anyway , at which point it becomes a first - person poker .
Johnston only remade the game through to the first boss , and changed a few aspects of the game due to time constraints .
There are no towns , it does n't include every enemy , and players do n't level - up .
You do still run around and poke enemies with a very short sword , so if you play it you 'll notice that it definitely feels like Zelda II from a first - person view .
If I were Link , I would have invested in a crossbow .
Though the world map looks just like Zelda II 's NES version , Johnston 's 3D modeling work on the enemies ( and on Princess Zelda ) looks very nice and fits with the feel of the original game .
Johnston says this project is the result of his " learning programming for the first time and a labor of love making this game in 3D . "
He probably could have picked a more beloved NES game , but hey , he did a nice job nonetheless .
The game can be played through a browser here , and a full walkthrough is included .

Logitech 's boxed speaker sets have always gone over quite well with reviewers , and now it 's offering a 5.1 system that may just be priced at a point that 's too good to refuse .
You know , if you holdouts were considering sticking with that 2.0 setup for another score or so .
Launched today , the Surround Sound Speakers Z506 are designed to play nice with PCs , game consoles , PMPs and DVD / Blu-ray players .
Pretty much anything that sends out an audio signal can be hooked up to these , and Logi even threw in color coded connectors to prevent you from getting overly confused and eventually doing something awfully regrettable with the satellites .
There 's 75 watts of RMS power , which should be plenty to fill your moderately sized gaming cave -- head on past the break for a promo vid , if you 're into that type of thing .
RapidShare will no longer offer incentives to users who share popular content .
After having stopped cash payouts for their rewards program some time ago , RapidShare has now decided to discontinue the entire program .
The file - hosting service cites complaints by copyright holders that the rewards were facilitating piracy as the reason for this move .
RapidShare and other file - hosting services have been growing at a steady pace over the last years .
This growth has not gone unnoticed by the entertainment industry and several rights holders have started legal action against the company behind RapidShare .
Unlike most torrent sites , RapidShare has done well in court .
Last month a United States District Court of California ruled that RapidShare is not guilty of copyright infringement .
A few weeks earlier a German court ruled that the file - hoster is not liable for acts of copyright infringement committed by its users .
Outside of court RapidShare has sought contact with several major players in the entertainment industries , hoping to start a collaboration by converting copyright infringers into paying consumers .
In addition , the company has taken several steps to ensure that they can not be seen as piracy facilitators .
RapidShare has gone after sites that abuse their trademark to promote piracy , and they have now discontinued the rewards program for its users for the same reason .
“ This decision by the company is a reaction to claims that the reward programme rewards the uploading of contents that are protected by copyright .
We feel it is necessary to undertake this step as we do not wish RapidShare ’s users to be exposed to such an unjustified general suspicion , ” RapidShare explained .
The reward programs of RapidShare and other file - hosting services allowed users to earn cash or other gifts if they uploaded popular content .
The entertainment industry sees these programs as incentives to upload copyrighted music and movies and possibly urged RapidShare to shut it down .
Previously , a leaked email from former RapidShare boss Bobby Chang to several entertainment industry representatives already revealed that RapidShare was not planning to compete with file - hosting services that were trying to gain the favor of ‘ criminals ’ ( copyright infringers ) .
“ RapidShare has decided not to participate in this battle and not to fight for the favor of criminals .
Instead we would rather like to agitate against these activities and – if possible – to institute proceedings against those competitors of ours , who are intentionally supporting criminal activities , ” Chang wrote in an email a few months ago .
Whether RapidShare ’s most recent move to shut down the reward program will cause it to lose users is yet to be seen .
If anything , it may have avoided yet another expensive legal battle while ensuring the site can continue to operate its business .
Sonic was n't always the beaten - up shell of a hedgehog he is today .
When Sega launched the first Sonic the Hedgehog game on its 16 - bit Genesis console in 1991 , the action game was a huge hit .
Sega positioned Sonic as its answer to Nintendo's Mario series , backed with a massive marketing blitz .
Sonic was the new hotness :
He ran across the game screen with blazing speed and had a too - cool - for - school attitude that any mascot needed in the early '90s .
Kids and core gamers alike ate it up .
What they discovered beyond the marketing was that Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the best platform games on the market .
The levels were cleverly designed with lots of secrets , and players learned that they had to manage Sonic 's blazing speed with precision , lest he slam into an enemy and grind to a screeching halt .
The result was a risk - reward system that forced players to use momentum to their advantage .
Sega cranked out several well - received Sonic games for 16 - bit systems , but when the game made its belated leap to 3 - D in 1999 , Sonic lost his way .
The character remains a popular mascot and lucrative cash cow for Sega – Sonic Unleashed , the latest game in the series , sold nearly 2.5 million copies even with a Metacritic ranking in the low 60s – but the quality of the games has dropped like a rock over the last decade .
Sega has announced two new Sonic games this year .
The downloadable Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is a return to old - school 2 - D mechanics , and the Wii game Sonic Colors continues the 3 - D style .
Since fans have largely given up on the 3 - D games being worthwhile , they 've pinned their hopes on Sonic 4 .
As the first new 2 - D Sonic for home game machines since 1994 , it 's what fans have been asking for .
If Sega ca n't get it right this time , we might as well abandon all hope .
Early red flags indicate Sonic 4 is n't quite shaping up .
Sega said last month that it would delay the game to " allow for more careful focus on the design of each level and to provide additional polish . "
In its current state , Sonic 4 does n't look like it will buck the trend .
A series of – videos that showed off the whole game long before its release date revealed that it was on the short track to mediocrity .
The game 's developer , Dimps , seems to have at least gotten one thing right by keeping the design simple .
Sonic is the only playable character in the game , unlike many other titles that became bogged down with extraneous playable characters .
Unfortunately , it seems like all the other problems of the 3 - D Sonic games may remain .
Sonic Adventure : Beginning of the End — — — — — — — — — —— —-
Sonic
Adventure may have wowed the world over with its impressive chased - by - a - whale sequence back when it launched on the Dreamcast .
But today , the game is seen as the beginning of Sonic 's decline .
Sonic Adventure was the progenitor of all the problems that plague Sonic to this day .
While previous Sonic games on the Sega Genesis had added playable characters other than Sonic , the alternate choices were two characters that were actually quite similar to the hedgehog : Tails the fox and Knuckles the echidna .
Tails could fly and Knuckles could climb up walls , but their respective abilities did n't change the game design in any way other than allowing them to reach hidden areas where Sonic could n't go .
Sonic Adventure took the idea much further .
The game introduced unique levels , new game mechanics and many more characters , each with its own storyline .
Every one besides Sonic played terribly .
Lengthy story sequences proved boring , and the other characters ' controls ranged from unpolished to completely broken .
The most maligned : Big the Cat , whose levels consisted entirely of fishing – as if Sega were trying to find the thing that would fit in least with Sonic .
Unleashing the Beast — — — — ——
–
All Sonic games after Sonic Adventure have dialed down the amount of playable characters – and yet each has introduced at least one more protagonist besides Sonic .
It 's come to the point where more time is spent playing as Sonic 's friends than actually playing as the title character .
Even in games where the playable roster is comparatively small , Sega always insists on introducing some gimmick for each game that ends up bogging down the entire thing .
Although Sega said that 2008 's Sonic Unleashed would mark a return to Sonic 's roots , it later unveiled the Werehog , a creature Sonic transformed into during the game 's nighttime sequences .
These levels turned Unleashed into a beat 'em - up similar to God of War .
In theory , anyway .
In practice , Sonic Unleashed 's night levels are so mindless and so numbingly boring that any comparison to a game like God of War would be ludicrous .
The night levels are slow as molasses , which is ironic seeing as how it 's a Sonic game , and you can't go 20 feet without running into a forced enemy encounter .
Adding insult to injury , the levels are excruciatingly long , with infrequent checkpoints and some truly sloppy jumping segments .
Lost in the Speedy Shuffle — — — — — —
——
–
Even though Big the Cat and the Werehog are emblematic of Sonic 's decline , the series ' biggest problem is n't his crappy friends and alter egos .
No , Sonic 's biggest problem is that Sega may no longer understand what made the original games good to begin with .
The Sonic the Hedgehog marketing campaign might have emphasized his blazing speed , but that 's not what the gameplay was all about .
Speed was n't an easy thing to come by in the original games .
In fact , you were liable to die if you went too fast .
There were very few boost pads to make you go faster , and the games did n't offer you the ability to dash at the touch of a button like modern games do .
Speed was a rarity , a reward for the player 's skill at keeping the momentum going .
Managing momentum was important because of the curves in the level design .
Players could gain speed by rolling down inclines and could even roll up hills to reach hidden areas , provided they maintained their forward momentum .
The classic level designs were also much more intricate , featuring different paths to the goal .
Most levels had top , middle and bottom paths , which always led to the same place but had varying difficulty levels .
Classic levels were also filled with more platforming sequences and other obstacles , forcing players to occasionally go slow and steady .
Contrast this with the levels in the 3 - D Sonic games , which are designed in such a way as to facilitate as much high - speed running as possible .
Modern Sonic levels are typically flat and straightforward , with plenty of straight lines on which to build speed .
Loop - de- loops and boost pads are everywhere , and the result is that the levels are usually constructed to show off how fast Sonic can hoof it .
Rarely do you have to do any jumping or exploration that requires your full attention .
Instead of incorporating the design principles of older games , it would seem from the videos that Sonic 4 might use the same streamlined level design as contemporary 3 - D games .
The leaked videos are filled with straightforward levels filled with boost pads and places for Sonic to run fast with minimal risk .
Where are the branching pathways , the risk and reward ?
Both Sega and Sonic 's long - suffering fans surely want Sonic 4 to recapture the magic that made the 2 - D games so popular .
But that does n't mean just snapping the camera to a fixed position and calling it a day .
What 's crucial is that Sega create intricate levels that serve not merely to get Sonic moving as fast as possible , but provide players with engaging obstacles and hidden routes .
By giving this game – the umpteenth Sonic adventure – the name Sonic the Hedgehog 4 , Sega is putting its stake in the ground .
The meaning is clear :
This is the return to form , as if all that messy stuff never happened .
It had better feel that way , or else Sonic 's going to spin - dash into oblivion .

When the Concorde luxury jet was retired seven years ago , after 27 years of dutiful service to the world ’s elite , it seemed like the end of an era .
Now , however , efforts are underway to get the supersonic craft back in the air — in time for the 2012 Olympic Games .
Last weekend a former Concorde engineer performed a preliminary engine inspection on one of the Mach 2 airliners in hopes of green - lighting the resurrection of the Concorde as a flying piece of aviation history instead of a mothballed museum display .
Mirroring the two national airlines that operated the Concorde for years – British Airways and Air France – a $ 22 million collaboration between Britain ’s Save Concorde Group ( SCG ) and France ’s Olympus 593 has been hard at work to get the supersonic jetliner back in the air .
The groups next hope to get the engines running and follow up with taxi testing .
The end goal is to get a Concorde flying again in time for a fly over at the 2012 London Olympics .
Saturday ’s preliminary inspection of the Rolls Royce engines of a Concorde at the Air Museum in Le Bourget , Paris went as well as could be hoped .
An engineer used a borescope camera that is commonly used to peak deep inside of engines for inspections .
After a thorough seven hours , the engineer said the engines are in great shape .
Curiously enough , the proclamation of the plane ’s resurrection comes just days after a Paris court concluded the trial over the notorious Concorde crash that killed 113 people back in 2000 .
The court wo n’t issue its verdict until December , but , at this point , it does n’t appear that the decision ( or the blame it places on Concorde ) will have much influence over the Concorde ’s imminent return to skybound glory .
Outrageously overpaid California public union parasites have every intention of sucking the last drop of blood out every taxpayer .
Regardless of the cost to taxpayers , and even though their bloated benefit programs vastly exceed what the private sector gets , nothing will get in the union 's way of protecting the overgenerous benefits they have , while still demanding more money from taxpayers , no matter what fiscal shape any of the cities are in because of those contracts .
Assembly Bill 155 Places Hurdles On Bankruptcies
Sadly , California 's corrupt politicians , bought and paid for by the unions , are all too willing to go along with a Scheme to Bar City Bankruptcies .
A bill that clamps down on municipal bankruptcy filings is headed for Gov. Schwarzenegger 's desk , which is bad news for Los Angeles and other cash - strapped California cities .
It the governor signs Assembly Bill 155 , it would place a hurdle in the path of filing for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy .
The bill stipulates that a city may only file for bankruptcy with the approval of the California Debt Investment Advisory Commission , which provides information on debt to public agencies .
" California 's taxpayers who rely on public safety , senior , park and library services , as well as those who own and operate businesses in our communities , deserve every effort that state and local government can make to avoid the long - term devastation of bankruptcy , " the bill says .
In particular , the bill says it intends to protect retirement pensions and health benefits for public employees , which would be disrupted and renegotiated in the wake of bankruptcy .
This could have a direct impact on the state 's largest city , Los Angeles , which is facing a huge budget shortfall .
The city 's former mayor , Richard Riordan , is calling for bankruptcy as the current mayor , Antonio Villaraigosa , is proposing deep cuts to city payrolls , according to news reports .
Union Parasites and Corrupt Politicians Cause Devastation
Weeds are back , with Nietzschean resilience .
Several varieties of Roundup - resistant weeds ( no , not just Kudzu ) are surging across the South , an AP article notes , forcing farmers to resume environmentally harmful herbicide and tilling practices to control their spread .
“ We ’re talking a pesticide treadmill here , ” one food safety scientist said .
“ It ’s just coming back to kick us in the butt now with resistant weeds . ”
Just as the BP oil spill is alerting Americans to the cost of our oil addiction , perhaps this weed boom could awaken us to the cost of our own backyard “ farming . ”
Consider the resources that are wasted in the effort to keep our lawns looking like putting greens .
According to People Powered Machines :
Each weekend , about 54 million Americans mow their lawns , using 800 million gallons of gas per year and producing tons of air pollutants .
Garden equipment engines , which have had unregulated emissions until very recently , emit high levels of carbon monoxide , volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides , producing up to 5 % of the nation 's air pollution and a good deal more in metropolitan areas .
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , a traditional gas powered lawn mower produces as much air pollution as 43 new cars each being driven 12,000 miles .
And speaking of gas , the EPA states that 17 million gallons of fuel , mostly gasoline , are spilled each year while refueling lawn equipment .
That 's more than all the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez , in the Gulf of Alaska .
That ’s on top of the water , herbicides , fertilizers , and other chemicals we use to keep lawns looking green .
And then there ’s the incalculable opportunity cost of the human talent , time , and labor devoted to grass maintenance .
Last week , while on vacation in Cape Cod , I saw crew after crew of young men sweating in the salty air to give lush lawns a buzz cut .
These days , any job ’s a good job , but it 's hard not to wish that all that money and labor were channeled elsewhere – say to building better schools .
So what are the alternatives ?
Those with smaller lawns can trade in expensive , self - propelled gas guzzling mowers for cheaper electric or push - reel models .
The result is free cash , free exercise , and a better cut .
Those with bigger lawns have to think more creatively until hybrid riding mowers go mainstream .
Options include :
• Synthetic turf
• “ No mow ” grass , specially designed to grow just a few inches high
• Ground cover like clover , or other native grasses
• A really big vegetable garden
Like the weed killer Roundup , gas - powered mowers are convenient and effective – for a time .
Our instinct is to turn to technology to build a better mousetrap .
But maybe it ’s time we figured out how to turn the proverbial mouse into a pet .
Anarchic internet hangout 4 chan sent a little more hate Gawker 's way today , launching a denial of service attack against our website , spamming our email accounts and even trying to bother one staffer 's spouse .
All so we 'd stop talking about them .
Angry users of 4 chan 's notoriously freewheeling /b/ forum inundated Gawker Media 's servers with traffic around 1:30 pm Eastern , reprising a similar distributed attack the prior day .
The attack slowed down sites across the Gawker Media network , including Gawker.com , where the number of active users on the site fell sharply for approximately an hour before normal service was restored .
Then there were some attempts to harass Gawker editors and writers individually .
As the author of the post about yesterday 's attack , I got some nasty Facebook messages from angry 4 chan users calling me various names and showing me the personal information they 'd collected about me .
Someone else sent my wife a porn video in a message that repeated " WE ARE LEGION " over and over , a slogan of 4 chan offshoot Anonymous .
Then , later in the day , someone wrote from the Facebook account of a stranger — a woman living in England judging by her friends — to inform my wife we'd been carrying on a torrid three - month affair .
We 're guessing the account was either hacked or belongs to a friend of the aggrieved 4 chan users .
The attackers also spammed email accounts belonging to myself , two higher ups at Gawker Media and Adrian Chen , author of a series of posts on how denizens of /b/ helped coordinate a campaign of harassment against an 11 year old video star and her family .
The people who lurk on /b/ do n't want to be talked or written about , especially in the press , even though they make news regularly .
This posture is codified in the board 's " Rules 1 & 2 , " which both state " you do not talk about / b/. "
On Encyclopedia Dramatica , the satirical wiki associated with 4 chan , news reports mentioning /b/ from Fox News and the New York Times are both cited as " Violations of Rules 1 & 2 . "
Not everyone who uses 4 chan thinks these rules should be enforced on the media ; in fact , several spoke out on /b/ yesterday against the Gawker attacks .
Some have even written in to tell us the attackers are , as one 4 chaner put it , " little kids who hang around hoping to be noticed and praised by the older members , " a dynamic we mentioned in yesterday 's post .
Yet the attacks continued .
Which makes sense ; even individual people and groups associated with /b/ and 4 chan can have real impact , whether it's by getting into Sarah Palin 's email account , waging a surprisingly effective war against the Church of Scientology or finding iPad security breaches .
Individually , all of these activities might be distinct from 4 chan per se , but taken together they add up to a pretty compelling reason to mention the site , /b/ board and the culture around both from time to time in a news context .
Which is what everyone should continue to do , whenever appropriate , whether certain people hanging out on /b/ object to it or not .

With the largest population in the world , China also has a very old culture and some long - standing traditions .
There are around 56 identified ethnic groups here and hence a diverse culture .
So , there are no one - way fits all here when it comes to customs but we can dive into the mainstream which is led by Han Chinese culture .
Chinese constitute a collectivistic society and give much importance to others thoughts and opinions .
Before committing to anything , they will try to ensure that they are acting right and wo n’t make way for any abuse from elders .
Marriage is one of the three important aspects of life for Chinese people and often considered the most pleasant moment of life .
In the present age , the relationships between couples have witnessed a lot of change from the very conservative people to a very broad - minded people .
Dating in public is very common in urban cities and many romances have ended up in love marriages here .
Chinese have their particular days of celebration .
Even their version of Valentine ’s Day is celebrated on a different day ( They follow the lunar calendar , not the English calendar ) .
In ancient time , polygamy as well as having many concubines were allowed in China , but was later stopped by law .
These days arranged , as well as love marriages take place here .
Even for love marriages , couples get prior permission from their parents before they step into their wedding .
Traditional Chinese weddings witness six major procedures like matchmaking , girls name knowing , betrothal gift , engagement , wedding date and finally the wedding .
The weddings are usually decided by the couple ’s parents .
Matchmakers also play a vital role in Chinese weddings .
Fortune tellers will help the parents to find if the match is suitable with the help of the girls name and birthday .
In this present age also many of the couples get to see each other for the first time only on their wedding day .
But they never have any complaint on this since they consider it as the most precious gift they ever get from their parents .
The youth ’s family has to visit the girl ’s house for the girl with a betrothal gift which ends up in engagement .
In return , the girl ’s family will visit the youth ’s family where the in - laws would have prepared some delicacy for the girl .
Dowry in the form of clothes , utensils , other accessories is to be handed over to the groom before the wedding by the bride ’s family .
With the wedding day being considered as a highly important day it is held on a very auspicious day , this may be from the lunar calendar , from traditional dates or from modern social trends .
You will notice a lot of weddings taking place on dates that match auspicious numbers on , such as the eighth day of the eighth month .
If a wedding party is held , weddings are usually a grand ceremony with the groom dropping at the bride ’s house to pick her for the wedding ceremonies which will be held at a banquet location of choice .
Post wedding the couples either opts to stay with the grooms family or stay separate , depending on the financial strength .
Much of the current generation omits majority of the marriage rituals as they think it ’s a waste of money and step onto simple wedding procedures .
That includes simply going to the registry with the customary photos and making it official .
Knitting is a 2 handed skill .
FACT .
You use both hands to knit however one hand will definitely take the lead .
You can knit in either direction with either hand taking the lead – I know you can , I do .
There is no reason to teach mirror knitting to lefties .
FALLACY .
Everyone should learn mirror knitting it makes those tedious button bands , shawl borders and entrelac so much quicker .
Some LH just ca n’t get knitting in the same direction as RH and some RH teachers are more comfortable teaching the same technique in the opposite direction rather than a different technique in the same direction .
Teaching the same technique in the same direction leads to people giving up because it is all too hard , this is akin to making us all write with our right hand .
( I was taught the same technique in the same direction as RH but adapted very quickly to having my LH dominate ) Lefties should be taught RH continental .
FALLACY .
I found continental to be more one handed than English style knitting .
If you enforce RH continental you enforce making the stitch with your right hand .
This is a total no - no .
Ask anyone who was forced to write with their right hand .
What people may be referring to here is simply knitting holding the yarn in your left hand , but still wrapping the yarn around the needle english style , otherwise it is totally right handed .
Mirror knitters are doomed to always having to rewrite patterns .
FALLACY .
Most knitted items are symmetrical therefore does it matter which end you approach it from .
The shaping at the start of the row and end of the row is still the same .
There may be the odd occasion where simple modifications are necessary ( eg. cables will twist in the opposite direction otherwise ) .
Just remember the instruction for the right front will give you a left front and vice versa .
Thinking is good for the brain !
Mirror knitters need to reinterpret charts .
FACT .
If you are knitting in the other direction the key for the symbols needs to be reversed in some cases ( your start of the row is their end of the row ) .
Not difficult once you understand how to knit , most people do n’t refer to the key very often anyway they just know what the symbol means to them .
There are some things a mirror knitter cannot do .
FALLACY .
Huh ?
Where did this come from , if you can do it in one direction you can do it in the other .
If it ends up a mirror image who cares .
Mirror knitters can’t get friends / family to fix mistakes .
FALLACY .
Just pick an experienced person who understands knitting and can knit through the back of the loop .
Once off the needle you ca n’t tell which direction it was knitted in .
Mirror knitters will be stared at in public .
FACT , so will continental knitters , nordic knitters , english knitters , combination knitters ….. we are all different and doing something the public will want to look at .
Get used to it !
So it is up to you , do you want to work in the same direction as your RH friends ?
Knit from the left needle to the right but still use your left hand to make the stitches ?
No problem that is my ‘ normal ’ .
Do you want to knit in the opposite direction taking the work from the right needle to the left ?
That way you use the same technique as your RH friends but in reverse .
No problem here either .
If you learn to knit from the left needle to right but have real trouble with wrapping the wool you can swap the wool to your left hand ; this is also quite common .
The hardest part of learning is tensioning the yarn to get an even fabric .
This is difficult for everyone and no more difficult for any one group .
One thing I have noticed , if you crochet or plan on crocheting then you will tension the yarn with your non-dominant hand as the hook is in your dominant hand .
RH english and LH contintental both require tensioning with the right hand .
I crochet left , Knit english right and knit continental left ; I always tension the same way .
Just something to keep in mind .
Remember we all knit differently , there is no right and wrong other than what feels right to you .
Just do n’t let a teacher bully you into knitting Right handed .
Learn the basic stitch from them then go home and work out what you are really doing so your left hand can take over the control .
If they say you are doing it wrong later then tell them to learn left and not let their right hand take over ; I bet they ca n’t do it !
As newmatilda.com heads for the archive in the sky , we ’ve asked people who ’ve worked on publications which have shaken up the Australian media for their thoughts on independent media past and present .
We asked why so many independent media projects have such short lifespans — and what ’s needed to survive in a marketplace that is both packed and changing .
First up is Charles Firth with a dose of tough love .
Like so many other independent media projects , the major problem with newmatilda.com was that it was , essentially , a boring idea .
This is not to say that there were n’t interesting things wrapped up in the boring idea , but I would n’t really know because I did n’t check it out all that often , because , as I say , it was a boring idea from the start .
I know this , because I once had a boring idea .
It was called Manic Times .
The idea was that Manic Times would bring together all the disparate voices of good , linking the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and we ’d all talk among ourselves , in dumbed - down tabloid format , about how bad things were .
Why would anyone read that ?
I certainly would n’t if I had n’t had to .
It ’s not to say there were n’t great pieces in there —
Pinky Beecroft ’s undercover investigation of what it was like to pick up at Hillsong springs to mind as the highlight — but at the end of the day , it failed because it should have failed .
I look back now and think , " What was I thinking ? " .
The Chaser newspaper was another idea I had , and that was n’t a boring idea at all .
It might have had , from time to time , incredibly boring things in it , but the idea itself was quite interesting .
The idea was that it would be a Sunday paper — and would act as a chaser shot on your week ’s news .
The idea being that you read all the heavy Saturday papers , and then The Chaser would come along , light and cutting and cut through all the turgid prose and give you searing , hilarious analysis through barbed satire and great writing .
That was a very interesting idea .
It still is .
It never became a Sunday vision , but the DNA of that idea never really changed .
Because it was a great idea .
And the most notable thing about that idea , to me , is that it did n’t try and divide its audience according to a belief set .
It was for anyone who wanted to laugh at those in power .
Which is just about anyone .
Which leads me to my thesis : if someone wants to come along and set up a successful , thriving " independent " media organisation , the thing they should start out with is a bloody good idea .
Which means a mainstream idea .
Or at least , an idea that could conceivably appeal to the mainstream if they ever found out about it .
The Monthly qualifies as a great idea : great writing , original reportage , a focus on Australian content .
It ’s something that anyone would conceivably want to read if they found out about it .
The only place it is let down in its current iteration is that it seems to see its role as Australia ’s foremost provider of undergraduate - quality cultural studies essays and turgid opinion pieces by grumpy academics at the sunset of their careers .
But unless that tendency replaces the original idea completely — there ’ll always be room for it in the miniscule world of Australian independent media .
Crikey , love it or hate it , has a similarly great idea behind it : that people self - important enough to think they might be gossiped about are willing to shell out over a hundred bucks a year on the off chance that they might be the subject of some salacious rumour .
I do n’t quite know what Crikey is doing peddling respectable reportage and interesting writing — it does n’t seem core to its underlying idea — but it does n’t seem to have hurt it too much .
But if it ever lost its commitment to bitchy , biased swipes at people from unnamed sources , the idea behind Crikey would fundamentally change , and weaken the product .
Which brings us to the question of what newmatilda.com should have been .
I think part of the problem was that it was the brainchild of guilded lefties who enjoyed some level of success in the 1970s , and were wanting to bestow on the next generation a media platform that interested them .
This was confused thinking .
If Phillip Adams and co had really wanted to make it work , they should have rolled up their sleeves and done it themselves .
It was an old person ’s idea carried out by teenagers when it should have been an old person ’s idea carried out by old people .
Then we could have excused the Dad - style humour , and creaky , earnest prose , because it would have at least been authentic .
Instead we were left with something that was trying to be right , and ended up just right on .
I do n’t think quality writing was ever part of the idea — it was always meant to be a quick and dirty comment site : which is not a bad idea .
Just very hard to execute without another limiting idea .
A quick , dirty and funny comment site I can get behind .
A quick and dirty comment site about the sex lives of public figures I would definitely want to read .
But this was a quick and dirty comment site about everything .
It was kind of like trying to be what the whole of the internet is on just one site .
Except that nothing I ever read on newmatilda.com skewed the news in a way that had n’t been said better somewhere else .
The internet makes people think that analysis of news is easier than reportage , when the reverse is actually true .
The Big Media companies — News , Fairfax and ABC — have a tendency to hire anyone who can reliably churn out original analysis .
To do a newmatilda.com well , you need access to all the journalists in one of those news organisations to help underwrite your content , which is why The Punch , The National Times and The Drum will be sustainable , where newmatilda.com is not .
That ’s not to say that any of those three websites are in any way more interesting than newmatilda.com but they ’re inherently subsidised by their parent company ’s sheer scale , and , in particular , their access to good writers .
There are actually quite interesting things happening in the world of " independent " media .
Daniel Petre ’s firm , Allure Media , over in North Sydney is building a base of web magazines that over time will threaten to disrupt the business models of mainstream magazines .
He has a computer gadgets blog , a parenting blog , a Hollywood gossip blog .
Every single one of these has a focused , good idea that it relentlessly pursues .
Underwritten with a healthy dose of internet advertising AdWords arbitrage , the idea that underpins that business model is , if not amazingly interesting , then at least sustainable .
If Petre wanted to enter the quick and dirty political / social comment site world , I can imagine he ’d get the Australian rights to Gawker.com , and do it that way .
And with the revenue from all the other blogs , he’d be far more assured of long term viability than newmatilda.com or Manic Times , or even The Chaser ever was .
So there you have it .
The lesson of the failure of newmatilda.com , and the litany of independent media properties before it , is that in media , good intention alone is not a good idea .
In fact , it ’s rather boring .
What It ’s Like To Ride A Bike Down An 800 Meter Incline Through The Brazilian Slums
You ever wonder what it would be like to ride a bike down an 800 meter incline and through narrow stairways and back alleys of a Brazilian slum ?
Well , thanks to one ballsy bike rider who attached a camera to his helmet for this video , now you know .

One of the hardest things to do as an artist is to create a musical species out of your music , that is to say , music that s a brand of its own ; consequently , when you succeed in doing so , as the audio - abnormality Ratatat has done , it is also one of the most rewarding things .
The duo , comprised of guitarist Mike Stroud and producer / synth - master / bassist Evan Mast , exists as an industry anomaly , an offbeat coupling that manufactures intuitive guitar riffs paired with precise bass hits and subtle , delectable drumming ( and believe me , its weird to describe them as offbeat ,  as few and far between are the times that they are actually offbeat ) .
Stroud and Mast first started creating their oft - described Baroque - esque dance tunes by building Ratatat , their self - titled debut , on a MacBook in Strouds Brooklyn apartment in 2004 .
At that time , they probably didnt see their then - newest musical creation taking them on the journey it has : two world tours ( including opening slots for Daft Punk , BjÃ¶rk and Interpol ) , two remix LPs , two recent forays into hip hop with Kid Cudi , and even an inaugural one - off gig at the world famous Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan .
And it would appear that in six years , it didnt take long for either half to prosper in their success .
Between the tour supporting their previous electro - dance endeavor , LP3 , and going in to the studio to mix / master LP4 , Stroud spent time with his girlfriend on a yacht along the coast of Sicily , while his co-conspirator , Mast , vacationed in Paris .
That s what can happen when you fill a void in an industry that begs to be filled .
Youngsters all across the nation , or dare I say the world , were waiting for this vibrant , authentic , hallucinogenic material to align themselves with .
Hipsters nationwide treat Ratatat like your dad treated Pink Floyd : progressive , intrinsically thought - provoking music that serves more as a secretive movement to become a part of , more than a mere band to be enjoyed .
LP4 , conceived , written , and recorded at Old Soul Studios in Catskill , New York , is in some ways an extension of its predecessor ; this should not come as a surprise .
LP3 was recorded in the same studio and in the same sessions .
They recorded thirty songs , and decided to cut the cluster in half .
However , Stroud believes theres a difference in the two , telling Paste Magazine last summer ,
There ’s definitely a progression …
We felt like the rest of them [ for LP4 ] were better than LP3 .
So like , LP3 would be like a teaser to LP4 , we thought at the time .
LP4 , is no doubt , the duos most expansive , divergent piece of artwork .
Never before have we heard the illustrious sounds of an orchestra incorporated with the symphonic sound of Ratatat .
They even sampled Terrence Malicks 1978 film Days of Heaven .
Why ?
Who knows– who cares ?
With Ratatat , a reason is not often required .
Many of the songs seem intrinsic and natural , however abrasive .
 Drugs , a song that starts off with a lackluster piano riff , horns , and the aforementioned orchestra , ebbs and seemingly goes nowhere until it explodes into a head - spinning beat , complete with that good ol screaming guitar sound and accompanied by an innate synth - popping jam , making the song a track that will surely cause more than one consumer to question use of the songs namesake .
The albums single , dubbed  Party With Children , could be considered a reflection of the pairs  time spent in non-American worlds , with a harpsichord - based harmony that sound like something straight out of a [ talented ] busking accordion player in Europe , momentously flowing into more of Mike Strouds layered genius .
It does n’t stop there either ; a catchy , interesting use of a mandolin is employed on “ Bare Feast ” and “ Alps ” , the album ’s closer , soaring into a pleasant , thumping ballad that wraps up LP4 in pristine fashion .
Alas , LP4 has its downfalls .
 We Cant Be Stopped , for example , is a sad , orchestral overture with a repetitive piano that never expands into the colossal mind - fuck I know it could become , but I guess that s a little much to ask for in a mere two minutes and ten seconds .
This short - handed feeling could also be felt on “ Mandy ” , a funky , tribal charge , indeed , but from start to finish , I do n’t hear the tune going anywhere .
The truly great songs on LP4 are what we have come to expect from Ratatat : guitar - laced , synth - powered , electro - dance jams .
But there lacks a certain crunch to their latest experiments that was very omnipresent on their self - titled debut , as well as 2006s Classics .
There are no  Loud Pipes on LP4 , no clear - cut masterpieces .
The aficionados of this band , the ardent devotees , will argue against this blasphemous claim ; those same people would also argue that everything the dual composers come up with is a work of gold .
Thats why LP4 gets this rating theres good stuff here , and I cant wait for the tour in support of it , but when people think of Ratatat , they will still think of Classics , not of LP4 .
Unfortunately , this is an album review , and not a concert review , or otherwise the outcome , I can only assume , would have been much different .
Convicted felon Byron Williams loaded up his mother 's Toyota Tundra with guns , strapped on his body armor and headed to San Francisco late Saturday night with one thing in mind : to kill workers at the American Civil Liberties Union and an environmental foundation , prosecutors say .
Williams , an anti-government zealot on parole for bank robbery , had hoped to " start a revolution " with the bloodshed at the ACLU and the Tides Foundation in San Francisco , authorities said .
But before he made it to the city , Williams was stopped at early Sunday by California Highway Patrol officers for speeding and driving erratically on westbound Interstate 580 west of Grand Avenue in Oakland .
Police say he then initiated a chaotic , 12 - minute gunbattle with officers , firing a 9 mm handgun , a .308 - caliber rifle and a shotgun .
He reloaded his weapons when he ran out of ammunition and stopped only after officers shot him in areas of his body not covered by his bullet - resistant vest , authorities said .
On Tuesday , Williams , 45 , of Groveland ( Tuolumne County ) appeared in an Oakland courtroom on charges that he tried to murder four CHP officers .
Authorities described him as a heavily armed man determined not to return to prison .
Bullets from the suspect 's rifle could penetrate ballistic body armor and vehicles , police said .
' Start a revolution '
After he was wounded and taken to Highland Hospital in Oakland , Williams told investigators " his intention was to start a revolution by traveling to San Francisco and killing people of importance at the Tides Foundation and the ACLU , " Oakland police Sgt. Michael Weisenberg wrote in a court affidavit .
The foundation has funded environmental and social justice projects since 1976 and also provides philanthropic advice , according to its website .
The ACLU of Northern California is based in San Francisco .
" Obviously , we 're dismayed that this has happened , and we 're not really going to speculate about the investigation while it 's ongoing , " said Tod Hill , a Tides spokesman .
" We 're taking appropriate safety measures . "
ACLU officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday .
Sheriff 's deputies brought Williams into Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland in a wheelchair Tuesday .
His right hand was bandaged .
He showed no emotion and kept his head down as he read his copy of the criminal complaint .
Asked by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers if he wanted to be represented by the public defender , Williams said yes .
Litany of charges
The complaint accuses Williams of trying to kill CHP officers Vincent Herrick , Richard Coward , Ty Franklin and Todd Owen .
In addition to the four charges of attempted murder of a peace officer , Williams was also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and possessing ammunition .
He also faces enhancements for firing a gun and wearing body armor .
The unemployed carpenter has two strikes - one for a 2001 bank robbery in Madera County and the other for a 1995 bank robbery in Washington state .
That means he faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of a third strike in connection with the shootout .
He is being held without bail .
The FBI joined Oakland police in investigating the incident because a notebook , titled " California , " was found in Williams ' car and removed by a bomb squad robot , investigators said .
Authorities did not reveal its contents .
only rainwater and pure grain alcohol

Dear FSF .
I ’ve been using FLOSS ( free / libre / open source software ) on my computers pretty much exclusively for about 5 or 6 years now and I do n’t see me going back to the limited lands of Windows or OSX anytime soon , but I have started to feel some sort of disconnect to one of the leading institutions of FLOSS lately : The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) .
The FSF has achieved a lot , has funded and supported a lot of the GNU projects and software developers , has defended the GPL ( my preferred license for software ) in court and in general have had a huge part in bringing free software to where it is today .
I am not ungrateful , it ’s just … it ’s not you , it ’s me .
When I look at some of the recent FSF campaigns I feel ashamed for being seen as associated with it : Windows7
Sins is just the prime example for the kind of attitude I can no longer stand ( DefectiveByDesign is n’t much better ) .
What I can not longer stand is the vocabulary of hate and judgement , the negativity of it all .
Look at the campaign name : Windows7Sins .
Sins are a religious concept , one that does n’t apply to software but one that shows what kind of broken self perception the FSF has :
That of a missionary , of someone who can , from the moral high ground , cast judgement down onto everybody else with a holier - than - thou attitude .
Those campaigns are full of negativity , of nagging and most importantly talking about issues that do not even reach their target audience .
If you want to make people use your software or support your cause , it ’s not enough to just run around screaming how “ evil ” the others are , that makes you look like a raving lunatic .
And that is not my way .
While I do have ideals and while I do consider Freedom Zero to be important , I do n’t preach because in the end that is my decision .
It ’s not my place to tell people what they are not allowed to do because of my rules .
What I can do is to lead by example .
To be positive .
I am a very positive person , even if I might might look ranty or grumpy from time to time , and these campaigns that focus on whatever other people might have done wrong just bore me .
No .
That ’s not enough .
They suck the life out of me .
If you want people to adapt your ideals or products you gotta show them why they are better than what they have been using :
Tell them about the brilliant things they get when they use your stuff , tell them about new possibilities .
The FSF should focus on outlining what positive things a new users gets from FLOSS :
Tell people about VLC that allows them to play basically every type of media without hassle .
Do n’t talk about why IE is evil but show them what an awesome browser Firefox is .
Just drop the hate .
In my life my message has never been one of hate .
And I feel that lately our goals and approaches no longer line up the right way .
You probably did n’t change , you were always like that , maybe I changed or got tired of that attitude , I do n’t know .
It ’s not you , it ’s me , but I think we ca n’t really let you talk for me anymore .
Thanks for all you have done and good luck with your future projects and campaigns ,

Following Recent Raids , Medical Marijuana Advocacy Groups Call on President Obama to Withdraw Nomination of Michele Leonhart to be DEA Administrator
Obama ’s DEA Head Must Follow Stated Medical Marijuana Policy , End Obstruction of Marijuana Research , and Base Marijuana Rescheduling on Science Rather than Ideology
CONTACT : Allen St. Pierre , Executive Director , 202-483-5500 or director@norml.org
WASHINGTON , DC – Today , a coalition of organizations supportive of medical marijuana patients and providers ( see list of organizations below ) are calling on President Obama to withdraw his nomination of Michele Leonhart to serve as administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
Ms. Leonhart , who is currently the DEA ’s acting - administrator , has not demonstrated that she is capable of leading the agency in a thoughtful manner at a time when fourteen states have enacted medical marijuana laws and science is increasingly confirming the therapeutic benefits of the substance .
“ It is clearly time for President Obama to insist that his appointees adhere to current Justice Department guidelines regarding state laws regulating the medical use of marijuana , and that marijuana be fairly evaluated by all federal agencies , based on science , not ideology , ” said Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , the nation ’s oldest marijuana legalization lobby .
“ The Obama administration should be working with us to eliminate criminal penalties for the responsible use of marijuana by adults , regardless of whether it is medical use or otherwise . ”
Under Leonhart ’s leadership , the DEA has staged medical marijuana raids in apparent disregard of Attorney General Eric Holder ’s directive to respect state medical marijuana laws .
Most recently , DEA agents flouted a pioneering Mendocino County ( CA ) ordinance to regulate medical marijuana cultivation by raiding the very first grower to register with the sheriff .
Joy Greenfield , 69 , had paid more than $ 1,000 for a permit to cultivate 99 plants in a collective garden that had been inspected and approved by the local sheriff .
Informed that Ms. Greenfield had the support of the sheriff , the DEA agent in charge responded by saying , “ I do n’t care what the sheriff says . ”
The DEA ’s conduct is inconsistent with an October 2009 Department of Justice memo directing officials not to arrest individuals “ whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana . ”
Ms. Leonhart has also demonstrated that she is unable to be objective in carrying out the duties of the administrator as it relates to medical marijuana research .
In January 2009 , she refused to issue a license to the University of Massachusetts to cultivate marijuana for FDA - approved research , despite a DEA administrative law judge ’s ruling that it would be “ in the public interest ” to issue the license .
This single act has blocked privately - funded medical marijuana research in this country .
The next DEA administrator will likely influence the outcome of a marijuana rescheduling petition currently before the agency .
It is critical that an administrator with an open mind toward science and research is at the helm .
# # # # #
The following organizations are calling on President Obama to withdraw the nomination of Ms. Leonhart if she does not end the attacks on individuals acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws and commit to making decisions related to medical marijuana based on science , not a personal anti-marijuana bias :
California NORML
Drug Policy Alliance ( DPA )
Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP )
Marijuana Policy Project ( MPP )
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML )
Students for Sensible Drug Policy ( SSDP )

FORMULA 1 car - pointer Mark Webber will start the next Grand Prix in a
1998 Fiat Punto .
Red Bull ’s management have promised Webber that the ashtrays will be cleaned and the boot emptied in order to make the car as competitive as possible .
The Punto will also go through the Executive Valet at the local Esso station rather than the Standard Service .
Webber said : “ There is no question of favouritism in the Red Bull Team between myself and Sebastian Vettel , although his 14 - litre jet powered car does n’t need push starting in cold weather . ”
The controversy started before the Silverstone race when Webber ’s car was stripped of 90 % of its parts to make an amusing sculpture for Vettel ’s dressing room .
But the Australian won the race despite his car consisting of a chassis , three wheels and a wing mirror .
Miniature racing pundit Eddie Jordan said : “ It was an amazing victory for Webber , as he was basically having to propel his car around the track like Fred Flinstone .
“ I ’ve seen nothing like it since 1975 when Niki Lauda ’s Ferrari broke down at the NÃ¼rburgring and he sprinted the last 15 laps carrying his car over his head . ”
Margaret Hollis , the current owner of Webber ’s race Punto , said : “ I ’ve had it since new and it ’s a lovely little run-around so it ’ll be perfect for the tight corners at Hockenheim .
“ I only use it to go to Sommerfield , but I ’ve not changed the oil thingy since I bought it so he may want to have that looked at by a man . ”
Le ministre de la Culture , Frédéric Mitterrand , a annoncé aujourd ' hui à Arles qu'il allait créer prochainement un " portail de la photographie " destiné à la fois aux professionnels et au grand public .
Ce site internet sera adossé à l'agence photographique de la Réunion des musées nationaux ( Rmn ) , a -t - il précisé lors d'une conférence de presse organisée à l'occasion des Rencontre photographiques d'Arles .
" Il permettra aux professionnels de s'informer , et à tous de découvrir cet art absolu , magistral et populaire qu'est la photographie " , a - t - il déclaré .
Le ministre a indiqué également qu'il était à la recherche d'une salle pour accueillir les collections photographiques historiques qui ont dû quitter l'Hôtel Sully , siège du Centre des monuments nationaux .
" Cette salle est indispensable , j'ai une piste très sérieuse " , a déclaré le ministre .
" Un apport du mécenat serait le bienvenu " , a - t - il ajouté .
M. Mitterrand a rappelé qu'il avait choisi de faire de la photographie " un chantier essentiel " de son action à la tête du ministère .
Il a indiqué qu'" au moins dix millions d'euros sont affectés annuellement a la photographie " par l'Etat .
" Cela reste peu mais ce n'est nullement négligeable dans un contexte de crise et de nécessaire sobriété budgétaire " , a - t - il dit .
" Je suis profondément convaincu qu'en mobilisant encore plus efficacement les ressources dont nous disposons , nous pouvons faire plus " , a - t - il estimé .
There are no ultimate 100 Indie Maximum Exposure vehicles for one simple reason .
Indie artists must break from a niche .
That niche must be well delineated and can be very very small and still be effective .
The mistake most artists make is making a pop record that does not have a niche to break out of .
The adage , think globally act locally can be re-stated think mainstream , act niche .
The newer your niche , the greater your chance of becoming identified with it .
Almost every Tommy
Boy superstar broke out of a niche they dominated if they did not invent .
Examples : De La Soul : hip hop hippies , House of Pain – Irish hip hop , Queen Latifah : first proud and powerful African American woman in hip hop , Ru Paul , first drag queen with dance hit , and so on .
So whatever you genre , sub - genre or micro niche there will usually be media that dominates that view of reality .
If you are a militant political artist , you would launch in the niche militant political blogs and magazines to establish a beach head .
If you a rapper that rapped about uzis and AK ’s maybe your entry would be blogs and mags about guns and ammo .
David Hazan mentioned a band that was way into Anime and they get written up in the Anime blogs and make a living playing the Anime shows .
Will they be able to cross to mainstream ?
Maybe not but they can be the lords of their niche and make a good living doing that .
So rather than being specific , I would point to blogs and mags in your micro- niche that might not even be music - oriented .
You may be more news to a non-music site and reach a core audience that way than trying to get Pitchfork to discover you .
There are also opportunities to perform at industry shows in non music industry events and get paid much better than you would in the glutted music market .
In other words make your presentation and target audience as unique as possible so you can be the king of that niche , then target the non-music publications ( both on line and off ) and the events in that niche .
You will be building fans , gaining awareness and making money before you even attempt to cross into the “ music industry . ”
