Agility Starts With Sales
How many of us have had a sales rep sell us something we did n't need as a solution for a problem we needed solved and solved well .
Everybody ?
That 's what I thought .
Often times , we as consumers get sold things that unnecessarily do more than just meet our basic need .
Other times , we get told a product can do something when it can't .
We want marketing to be enthusiastic about our software , but there are limits to everything .
Better make sure marketing has actually used the system and knows what the software product can do versus what it can't .
If a product can't currently do something , do n't you dare say , " We can get that to you in six months . " without consulting development first .
Promising things on a timeline is just setting yourself up to have to make an apology for a broken promise .
What happens if your whole development team gets hit by a dump truck in the crosswalk on their way to lunch ?
In a lot of cases marketing did n't relay the information wrong , they just forgot ( or did n't know ) that how they sold it to the consumer is just as important as what they sold .
If marketing says , " You could use this product to do X , Y , and Z . "
The consumer is going to interpret that as " This product was designed to do X , Y , and Z . "
You might think , " Where is the failure in that ? "
The failure is that the product being able to do X , Y , and Z was probably a side effect of implementation rather than a requirement .
This is only a failure if the marketeer does n't go back to the Product Owner and say , " Hey , we really need the product to do X , Y , and Z because that is what some people are going to use it for . "
The Product Owner then should probably chastise marketing for selling the product outside its intended usage , but then reward marketing for extending their user base .
Let 's face it , products never get used exactly the way they were intended to .
That 's why we need to tighten the feedback loop between marketing and development .
So that development does n't fail to deliver on marketing 's promises , and so that marketing does n't bury development in overtime .
Marketing is the only component of the organization with the ability to sell everybody else out of a job .
In order to avoid that rather unwanted predicament , marketing needs to understand what development can deliver on .
Enter the estimates .
God has a sense of humor and he hates developers
You want irony ?
How 's this ?
Why are the most antisocial people on the planet in charge of improving and leveraging the most useful tool on the planet ?
Old school managers who used to be code jockies pride themselves on their ability to talk to things like memory and bandwith optimization and crash recovery .
Time to tell the boss man to get the heck out of the kitchen .
What ever happened to " No optimization before its time . "
Computer science types are also notorious for focusing too early on optimization .
If you want to be a good developer , be of this world .
Hang out in bars .
Go attend a concert on the lawn .
And for the sake of all that is holy , figure out what matters to real people and code to that .
Try to keep the people who are out of touch with humanity from developing products intended for use from humans .
If you are on a project that takes data from everyday people , does something fancy with it and returns a result , remember to let the user interface ( the code representation of the user 's conceptual model ) drive the engine , not the other way around .
Agile is about thinking about what we do every second we do it and how to improve .
Code with your brain on and its refinement engine engaged .
If at any time , you as a developer think , " Jeez , this interface sucks . "
You 'd better believe you wo n't be the only one .
You should try to smooth out rough spots in your application as you encouter them .
That includes sluggish performance , badly laid out interface , bad organization of control flow , etc .
Theoretically the customer team should perceive these things as you are iterating and propose suggestions .
I like to think " Never code alone " extends to embrace the customer team .
Better to let a feature slip than to let a design hernia prevade .
When all the passengers on mothership earth throw the computers overboard , do n't say I did n't warn you .
Bad efficiency can cost you execution time , bad usability can cost you your job .
Over optimizing at the cost of usability is about the worst case of penny - wise pound - foolish I 've ever heard of .
And engineers are usually the ones that do this .
This is not because they are bad people , but because they are used to thinking in terms of operational cost rather than business cost .
If no one uses your stuff , you do n't make any money , and it wo n't matter how little memory you consume , how little bandwidth your app eats up , or how secure your authentication process is .
The moral of the story is , let the product sell itself
If you keep up communications with your customer , do n't make false promises , maintain a tight feedback loop with your beta testers , and put the needs of the user first , your odds of success increase drastically .
Recently we praised the latest sci-fi blockbuster Iron Man for including so many real - world technologies .
It makes a change , since all too often Hollywood ’s use of science involves shocking blunders : including spaceships making whooshing noises in Star Wars to the journey to the centre of the Earth in The Core .
So , to give credit where it ’s due , we have picked out five more sci- fi films that go against the grain , and contain some accurate , plausible science .
They may not be completely realistic , but they get it right when it matters most .
Be warned : this article inevitably contains a number of spoilers .

2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 )
“ Open the pod-bay doors , HAL . ”
Despite being made before the first moon landing , Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke ‘s masterpiece is a strikingly realistic depiction of space travel .
It envisions interplanetary spaceships that use a variety of techniques to allow people to exist in zero gravity – some sections rotate to generate artificial gravity , others have walls covered in Velcro ( or something similar ) so that crewmembers wearing suitable shoes can walk across them .
Among the film ’s neater details :
All scenes in outer space are silent – sound does not travel in a vacuum
The stars do not move past the ship – for there to be a visible motion of the star field , the ship would have to be travelling at close to the speed of light
The crew eat paste - like food and only drink liquids through straws .
Additionally , crew members are shown coping with the boredom and routine of a long , straightforward trek across empty space .
Newtonian physics is strictly obeyed in the behaviour of the ship and little “ pods ” that the astronauts use to travel outside it .
Trouble only starts when a carefully - aligned radio transmitter , the crew ’s lifeline to Earth , begins to drift out of position .
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( 2004 )
“ I walked out the door .
There ’s no memory left . ”
The central character , Joel , discovers that his girlfriend Clementine has erased her memories of their relationship .
Heartbroken and embittered , he goes to the company that performed the procedure and asks them to erase his memories as well .
However , as the procedure gets underway , he realises that he wants to keep the memories after all , and begins to resist .
This sort of selective memory erasure is well beyond our current technology , but there are good reasons to think it may not be impossible .
Several forms of dementia affect particular types of memory – for instance semantic dementia , which targets only factual knowledge about the world , and not “ personal ” life memories .
Sensibly , the film depicts memory as essentially a network of links .
In its frenetic second half , Joel is asleep while the technicians “ operate ” on his mind .
We follow as he careens from recent memories of his relationship to those of his earliest childhood .
As he encounters each memory , it is identified by the technicians and erased , leading to spectacular sequences of him running through bookshops while books disappear from the shelves and escaping from a house that is disappearing one wall at a time .
Alien ( 1979 )
“ I ca n’t lie to you about your chances , but you have my sympathies . ”
This sci - fi horror has a number of realistic touches , such as the use of suspended animation to keep the spaceship ’s crew alive during decades - long interstellar travel ( no implausible faster - than - light travel for these astronauts ) .
It makes the list , though , for the vicious creature the crew encounters , in particular for the finer details of its life cycle .
The alien goes through three stages over the course of the film .
It begins as an egg , which produces a kind of head - sized spider , equipped with a strong tail and a vaguely reptilian appearance .
This attaches itself to the nearest living body and , while clamped over the face , implants an embryo into its victim ’s stomach .
It then falls off and dies .
The embryo survives by feeding on the victim ’s digested food .
Eventually it breaks out ( in the least pleasant way possible ) and runs amok on the ship .
Every element of the life cycle can be found in nature , variously in parasites , robber wasps and social insects .
Much of the film ’s suspense comes from the filmmakers ’ decision to let events unfold without too much explanation – the viewer has to piece the life cycle together for themselves .
Unfortunately , there are a couple of pretty dubious points .
First , the adult somehow manages to grow from about 30 centimetres to 2 metres in a matter of hours .
The alien is also equipped , throughout its life , with very strong acid for blood .
For that to work , the rest of it must be made of Teflon , as conventional organic tissue would obviously be destroyed .
Gattaca ( 1997 )
“ We now have discrimination down to a science . ”
Andrew Niccol ’s film is noteworthy for its grimly plausible vision of a society dominated by genetic prejudice .
The majority of babies are conceived using IVF , following a process of preimplantation genetic diagnosis that weeds out all genetic imperfections .
As a friendly geneticist explains to worried parents , “ This child is still you , simply the best of you . ”
Everyone ’s identities , and their genetic status , are also continuously monitored by biometric ID systems .
The central character , Vincent , is an “ in - Valid ” – he was conceived naturally , and consequently is short - sighted and has a heart defect .
Debarred from all but the most menial jobs , he pays a crippled “ Valid ” to lend him his genetic identity – in the form of urine samples and the like – so he can pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut .
The society depicted in Gattaca is intentionally dystopic , sometimes to the point of parody .
Most notably , Vincent ’s job interview at the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation consists entirely of a urine sample .
However , genetics can only give statistical predictions , and rarely delivers 100 % certainty .
So the company would be well - advised to put him through a real interview as well .
Nevertheless , it is one of the few films to tackle the issue of genetic determinism : how much are we really controlled by our genes ?
Vincent out - competes genetically - superior characters mostly through sheer strength of will .
Does that mean that genetic testing really cannot predict how people will perform – or does it just mean we have n’t found the genes for willpower yet ?
Solaris ( 1972 and 2002 )
“ I was haunted by the idea that I remembered her wrong , and somehow I was wrong about everything . ”
This Russian classic makes the list not so much for the specific science it portrays , as for its portrayal of the limits of science and of human understanding .
Psychologist Chris Kelvin is dispatched to a space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris , to find out why the crew has stopped responding to messages from Earth .
He discovers them in a state of emotional breakdown , and is soon in the same condition himself .
After falling asleep on the station for the first time , he wakes to find his wife Rheya , who committed suicide years before , next to him .
Somehow , and for no reason ever made clear , Solaris has brought Rheya back , constructing her using her husband ’s memories .
But is she really Rheya , or is she just Chris ’s flawed recollection of her , seen through his own preconceived ideas and limited understanding ?
Solaris itself is equally inexplicable , creating bizarre geometric shapes across its surface that may or may not be alive .
Stanislaw Lem , who wrote the original novel , was convinced that extraterrestrial life would be so strange that humans would be unable to understand it .
Solaris gets right to the heart of this idea .
Despite being a trained psychologist and an educated man , Chris cannot even understand his wife .
How then , the film asks , could he possibly understand something as alien as Solaris ?
Devotees of quantum mechanics and the consciousness problem will no doubt sympathise .

Conversations about race are fraught with emotion , confusion and controversy .
But that does n’t mean we should avoid or sidestep the issue .
As a Latino raised in East Los Angeles , and as the elected sheriff of Los Angeles County for the last decade , I have seen many sides of the race issue .
I have lived it , in fact .
So let me be very clear about one thing :
We have a serious interracial violence problem in this county involving blacks and Latinos .
Some people deny it .
They say that race is not a factor in L.A. 's gang crisis ; the problem , they say , is not one of blacks versus Latinos and Latinos versus blacks but merely one of gang members killing other gang members ( and yes , they acknowledge , sometimes the gangs are race - based ) .
Advertisement
But they ’re wrong .
The truth is that , in many cases , race is at the heart of the problem .
Latino gang members shoot blacks not because they ’re members of a rival gang but because of their skin color .
Likewise , black gang members shoot Latinos because they are brown .
Just look at the facts .
In February 2006 , our jail system erupted into a full - scale riot involving about 2,000 black and Latino inmates at the North County Correctional Facility at Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic .
One black inmate died and numerous others were injured .
Through extensive interviews with participants , our investigation revealed that race -- not gang affiliation -- was the motivating factor .
Furthermore , we have evidence linking inmates who are known as “ shot callers ” directly to street shootings based entirely on race .
These shot callers at Pitchess and elsewhere are affiliated with gangs , to be sure , and in many cases they may give the order to kill a particular person or a member of a particular gang .
But if that person or gang cannot be found , the shot caller will often order the gunman to find someone -- anyone -- who is black or brown and shoot them instead .
Gang affiliation does not matter .
Only the color of the victim ’s skin matters .
I would even take this a step further and suggest that some of L.A. 's so - called gangs are really no more than loose - knit bands of blacks or Latinos roaming the streets looking for people of the other color to shoot .
Our gang investigators have learned this through interviews in Compton and elsewhere throughout the county .
L.A.'s gang wars have long been complicated by drugs , territory issues or money .
Now , it can also be over color .
Advertisement
Race - based violence has even found its way into our school system , although no deaths have been reported .
Some say it ’s always been there , but it certainly is rearing its ugly head now more than ever .
Most recently , fighting broke out in May between more than 600 black and brown students at Locke High School in South L.A .
The racial divide is being driven by the ongoing population growth and demographic changes that have buffeted L.A. for decades .
The perception that one group has more opportunities and advantages than another can lead to resentment , competition and , ultimately , spontaneous eruptions of violence .
So where does this leave us ?
How does this information help ?
I have begun a process in my headquarters in which analysts are poring over data collected from various sources throughout the county to help us understand exactly what gang crimes are underway -- and where -- in real time .
I call it a Gang Emergency Operations Center .
Advertisement
It ’s about more than just identifying problem areas and moving more police there .
In fact , it is not a suppression model at all , but an intervention and prevention model aimed at ensuring that those who need social services get them .
Most important , it will serve as a fusion center for sharing information .
Such centers -- like the federal Joint Regional Intelligence Center , which combats terrorism -- have more than proved their worth .
But as we gather this data , the race issue must be part of the equation -- because if it is n’t , we are not analyzing the data correctly .
Crimes with a racial component must be categorized and studied to help us better understand the problem .
Racial issues must then be addressed through education and awareness .
The problem of interracial violence is not intractable ; we ’ve made progress in other settings .
I have seen it on a small scale in the Sheriff ’s Department ’s Domestic Violence Prevention Program in our jails .
It happened like this .
Inmates with a history of domestic violence -- sometimes known members of opposing gangs -- were forced to attend this program or be remanded to custody for a significant amount of state prison time .
Those who agreed to participate would sit together and discuss various topics of interest .
They would eat meals together and live together in housing set aside for them .
Advertisement
The program was designed to address issues of domestic violence .
But over a period of weeks , the participants overcame barriers by being exposed to those they were supposed to hate .
They began to form friendships -- friendships that , in some cases , have lasted outside the jail walls .
This may seem like an insignificant occurrence to those who are uninformed about gang life and racial tension .
But it is not .
People who would shoot each other as easily as kick a can were taking meals together , talking together and living together without violence .
The better we understand the crisis , the better chance we have of solving it .
It is difficult to believe that something as simple as gathering information , analyzing it and then putting it into action -- whether through suppression , intervention or prevention -- will have any effect .
But it will .
It is a proven formula .
The unification of information , dispassionately collected and analyzed , will lead us toward a disarming of the gang culture .
And through disarmament , we will make the streets safer .
And that ’s the whole point .
America ’s for sale .
Just ask Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
With the U.S. economy in shambles , Paulson just spent four days touring the Middle East , hat in hand , looking for investors to bail us out .
Specifically , on Monday , Paulson met with heads of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority , the world ’s largest “ sovereign wealth fund ” with roughly $ 875 billion in assets , and encouraged them to buy American businesses .
Of course , it ’s nothing new for U.S. officials to reach out to the deepest pockets in the world in times of crisis .
Just a century ago , J.P. Morgan became an American icon by single - handedly rescuing the financial markets during the stock market panic of 1907 .
What is new , however , is that our economic problems have become so big that they no longer can be remedied by a few affluent individuals or investment firms .
Only extremely wealthy countries have the resources to clean up this mess .
So Paulson is forced to visit flush , oil - slicked Arabian emirates from Qatar to Abu Dhabi and beg for help .

This is economic globalization in its most raw form -- and a dramatic change in the way the worldwide economy operates .
Today , the real power in international finance is held by rich countries , not wealthy institutions , corporations or private investors .
And these countries are flexing their increasingly bulging muscles through investment vehicles known as sovereign wealth funds .
Sovereign wealth funds , or SWFs , basically are mutual funds that invest the excess capital generated by a region or country .
The first one was established by Kuwait when it still was a British territory .
After World War II , as Kuwait was negotiating independence , its leader , Sheik Abdullah al Salem al Sabah , asked the British to help him create a fund that would invest the nation ’s oil profits .
The Kuwait Investment Board , which eventually became the Kuwait Investment Authority , today has about $ 250 billion in assets and is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world .
As the British Empire crumbled , the government created similar funds for many of its territories and colonies ( including the islands of Kiribati , which profitably exported guano for fertilizer ) .
Meanwhile , other countries with growing wealth started setting up similar funds , such as the oil - rich nations of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Norway and Russia , as well as China , Singapore and South Korea , which had highly productive economies that also generated lots of excess capital .
Still , it ’s only recently that SWFs have become major players on the financial stage .
Advertisement
In 1990 , the funds held just $ 500 billion in assets combined .
Today , that figure is about $ 3.5 trillion .
For comparison purposes , that ’s more than all of the assets controlled by all of the hedge funds in the world .
And by 2012 , the figure will be at least $ 10 trillion , according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund .
The primary reason for this explosion is , in a word , oil .
As its price has soared from less than $ 25 a barrel in 2002 to more than $ 125 a barrel today , the value of sovereign wealth funds held by oil - rich nations has skyrocketed .
And this trend is n’t expected to change any time soon .
The new power of SWFs has been on graphic display during our recent mortgage crisis .
They ’ve essentially rescued the international financial system by injecting tens of billions of dollars into troubled banks .
Citigroup , for instance , raised about $ 20 billion from a consortium of SWFs from Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Singapore .
UBS secured nearly $ 10 billion from a Singapore fund that now controls 9 % of the bank .
Merrill Lynch took in about $ 11 billion from SWFs from Kuwait , Singapore and South Korea .
And even august Morgan Stanley got $ 5 billion from China ’s SWF .
These investments are steadying global financial markets by ensuring that none of these key banks goes under .
But there are important questions to ask about the increasing influence that sovereign wealth funds have over our economy .
As SWFs grow in size , they will be in a position to control large swaths of the global business world .
That means foreign governments , which control the funds , will increasingly own sizable stakes in companies in such important industries as computer technology , aerospace and biotechnology .
Advertisement
These kinds of investments raise “ profound questions ” of geopolitical power , as former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers pointed out a few months ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
Summers ’ essential complaint is that there is no way of knowing if there is a political agenda behind a country ’s investment in these essential industries .
To that end , the International Monetary Fund is trying to draft a code of “ best practices ” that SWFs can adopt voluntarily .
The funds generally have been resistant to the idea , although Abu Dhabi and Singapore have signed an agreement with the Treasury Department that lays out principles for the countries ’ funds to be more transparent and not politicize their investments .
But on a practical level , the growing influence of SWFs really brings up much more basic concerns .
What does it mean for Americans to have decisions about our jobs , our home loans , our school loans and so on to ultimately rest with foreign governments ?
What does it mean to surrender this level of control over our own economy ?
The trouble is , we do n’t know .
And that raises perhaps the most important question of all :
What if the cure to our mortgage crisis is more deadly than the disease itself ?

Barter Works Great When Economy Is n't
The Craziest Way To Buy A Lobster
To : Editors and Writers – Alternative Media
Les Blough ,
Google can’t really be hurt by any imaginable economic protest to their new censorship tactics , but they ( the Zionists ) really hate it when they are made to look bad .
Whenever Zionists manipulate events and people around them , they seem to be as worried about appearances as they are about results .
The inner businessman ’s concern for image is always at war with the fascist bastard ’s desire to kill the opposition .
We have the following statement on censorship from the director of Google Israel , Meir Brand :
“ At Google , we have a bias in favor of people ’s right to free expression , ” he said .
“ Google is not and should not become the central arbiter of what does and does and does not appear on the Web .
That ’s for elected governments and courts to decide , ” Brand said .
He said Google removes results from its search index only when required to by law , for example , when copyright infringement is an issue . ”
12/11/2007 http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/923191.html
Very soon after Google made this claim , the censorship began .
Someone should check to see when this wave of hacks and administrative denials began .
When did the Israel 60 begin its cyber attack center ?
Someone in Israel should get the actual addresses of the Google centers in Tel Aviv and Haifa , as well as the Israel 60 site , to determine if the attacks could be traced back to them .
This is a partial list of the attacked and banned sites .
Someone who knows should complete it .

As a writer and contributor to most of these sites , I have experienced some of these cyber attacks myself , though most of them were before the current period of sabotage .
The attacked sites should start to mirror each other ’s sites , to complicate the task for them .
The writers should begin to really focus on the hostile interference with Americans ’
Constitutional rights to freedom of the press and freedom of expression by our supposedly “ democratic ” ally .
Publicly proving Israeli censorship of Americans might prove to be as important to our fight as the work of Mearsheimer and Walt .
The BBC report , “ Google censoring web content , ” http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2360351.stm could provide the opening for that breakthrough .
We have to find an effective way to stand together on this , because we are all going to find out on a personal level the penalty for having such contrary beliefs .

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and the Association of Corporate Travel Executives ( ACTE ) urged an appeals court today to review a flawed decision allowing random and invasive searches of travelers ' computers at the U.S. border .
The news media has reported extensively on these searches as well as the surprise and anger felt by American travelers when they are singled out for inspection .
In a typical search , U.S. border officials will turn on the computer and then open and review files .
If agents see something of interest , they may confiscate the computer , copy its contents , and sometimes provide a copy to the Department of Justice -- even when the traveler is not suspected of criminal activity .
In some cases , travelers have never gotten their computers back from the government .
In an amicus brief filed today , EFF and ACTE asked the full 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear and reverse an appeals panel decision in United States v. Arnold , which upheld this blanket search and seizure power .
While the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that customs and border agents can perform " routine " searches at the border without a warrant or even reasonable suspicion , these ongoing baseless searches of electronic devices at America 's borders are unconstitutionally invasive .
" Searching a laptop is very different from searching a briefcase .
Your computer contains a vast amount of information about your private life , including details about your family , your finances , and your health , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien .
" All that information can be easily copied , transferred , and stored in government databases , just because you were chosen for a random inspection . "
These suspicionless laptop searches and data seizures violate the Fourth Amendment 's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure .
The unique nature of electronic information stored on computers and other portable devices requires the courts to recognize a standard that protects the privacy of Americans in the Information Age .
" The implications of unfettered data collection are staggering , " said ACTE Executive Director Susan Gurley .
" Border authorities may now systematically collect all information on every laptop computer , BlackBerry , or other device carried across our border .
The government can then store and search all that data without any justification or oversight by any court .
This simply does not square with the Fourth Amendment . "
The EFF - ACTE amicus brief was prepared by Arent Fox LLP .

Here ’s What You Can Do When Your PS4 Controller Does n’t Charge
The PS4 is one of the best consoles out there .
Features like being to adjust its speaker volume and screen brightness make for an enhanced gaming experience .
However , it is n’t immune to having tech issues .
One of the most common ones being talked about on forums is when the PS4 controller does n’t charge .
If you are having the same troubles with your console , here are some fixes you can try out to address the issue .
Check the cable
The first thing you can do is check the hardware components .
The wire connecting your charger can be frayed or having issues , thus causing the problem .
Try charging your controller with a different charger .
If it charges , then it ’s a simple matter of replacing the charger itself .
Battery Replacement
If the wire looks fine , it could be the batteries .
If you have n’t been using your console for that long , consider swapping the batteries you have for rechargeable ones .
Reset Mode
Another fix you can try is resetting the controller .
Locate the small hole in the back of the device and press down on it for a few seconds .
Try charging it again .
Hot Surfaces
Check where your controller is placed .
If it ’s on top of a hot surface , this could affect the temperature sensor .
It ’s a separate component attached by a wire known as the Bluetooth receiver that ’s located directly underneath the cover .
Turn it upside down
Some gamers have reported that charging the PS4 controller upside down was able to solve the problem .
It might be unusual but still worth a try .
To do this , plug your PS4 remote , position it upside down and let it sit .
If none of these fixes don ’ do the trick , then it might be time to bring it in for repairs .
On the other hand , it may be more expensive to buy a new PS4 controller altogether .
Confirming what many of us have already noted from the anecdotal evidence coming in of a much cooler than normal May , such as late spring snows as far south as Arizona , extended skiing in Colorado , and delays in snow cover melting , ( here and here ) , the University of Alabama , Huntsville ( UAH ) published their satellite derived Advanced Microwave Sounder Unit data set of the Lower Troposphere for May 2008 .
It is significantly colder globally , colder even than the significant drop to - 0.046 °C seen in January 2008 .
The global ∆T from April to May 2008 was -. 195°C
UAH
2008 1 - 0.046
2008 2 0.020
2008 3 0.094
2008 4 0.015
2008 5 - 0.180
Compared to the May 2007 value of 0.199 °C we find a 12 month ∆ T is -.379°C .
But even more impressive is the change since the last big peak in global temperature in January 2007 at 0.594°C , giving a 16 month ∆T of - 0.774 °C which is equal in magnitude to the generally agreed upon “ global warming signal ” of the last 100 years .

Reference : UAH lower troposphere data
I ’m betting that RSS ( expected soon ) will also be below the zero anomaly line , since it tends to agree well with UAH .
HadCRUT will likely show a significant drop , I ’m going to make a SWAG and say it will end up around 0.05 to - 0.15 °C .
GISS ; I ’m not going to try a SWAG , as it could be anything .
Of course anomalies can change to positive on the next El Nino , but this one seems to be deepening .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As the Iraq war continues with no clear end in sight , the cost to taxpayers may balloon to $ 2.7 trillion by the time the conflict comes to an end , according to Congressional testimony .
In a hearing held by the Joint Economic Committee Thursday , members of Congress heard testimony about the current costs of the war and the future economic fallout from returning soldiers .
At the beginning of the conflict in 2003 , the Bush administration gave Congress a cost estimate of $ 60 billion to $ 100 billion for the entirety of the war .
But the battle has been dragging on much longer than most in the government expected , and costs have ballooned to nearly ten times the original estimate .
William Beach , director of the Center for Data Analysis , told members of Congress that the Iraq war has already cost taxpayers $ 646 billion .
That 's only accounting for five years , and , with the conflict expected to drag on for another five years , the figure is expected to more than quadruple .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , told members of Congress that the war costs taxpayers about $ 430 million per day , and called out the Bush Administration .
" It is long past time for the administration to come clean and account for the real costs of the war in Iraq , " said Schumer .
" If they want to disagree with our estimates or with other experts ... fine - they should come and explain why . "
The Bush Administration , which was invited to give testimony , declined to participate .
The Pentagon has previously said that the war costs approximately $ 9.5 billion a month , but some economists say the figure is closer to $ 25 billion a month when long - term health care for veterans and interest are factored in .
Health care :
In testimony before the committee , Dr. Christine Eibner , an Associate Economist with research firm RAND , said advances in armor technology have kept alive many soldiers who would have been killed in prior wars .
But that has added to post - war health care costs for veterans , especially for " unseen " wounds like post traumatic stress disorder , major depression and traumatic brain injury .
Two - year post - deployment health care costs for the 1.6 million service members currently in Iraq and Afghanistan could range from $ 4 billion to $ 6.2 billion , according to Eibner .
For one year of treatment , the costs are substantially lower , ranging from $ 591 million to $ 910 million .
Eibner admitted that the study did not take into account long term care , and her estimates probably underestimate the total costs .
However , Eibner noted that an increasing number of soldiers are not seeking the care that they need , which affects their ability to get and maintain jobs .
And , that , she said , must change .
" Many service members are currently reluctant to seek mental health treatment due to fear of negative career repercussions , " said Eibner .
" Policies must be changed so that there are no perceived or real adverse career consequences for individuals who seek treatment . "
Unemployment : Furthermore , many veterans who recently completed their service are coming back to a difficult job and housing market .
Among veterans who completed their service within the last 1 to 3 years , 18 % were unemployed , and 25 % earned less than $ 21,840 a year , according to a recent report commissioned by the Department of Veterans Affairs .
" Trying to convince [ job interviewers ] that my service will translate into skills ... at a bottling factory or a distributing company is almost like you 're speaking French to someone who does n't speak French , " said Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America policy associate Tom Tarantino .
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer agreed , saying the government does a poor job at readying veterans for post - Army life .
" We have n't figured out how to convert a warrior to a citizen yet , " Schweitzer told the committee .
Foreclosure : Many soldiers who come home from active duty are also finding difficulty keeping their homes .
" Military families are already shouldering heavy burdens to care for and support families while their loved ones are serving abroad or recovering at home , " said Schumer .
" Knowing that so many more are losing their homes to foreclosure is heartbreaking -- and its just plain wrong . "
The senator said that Army personnel returning from duty are at a 37 % higher risk of foreclosure , because the areas populated by military families have substantially larger foreclosure rates .
" Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan deserve better , " testified Tarantino .
Tarantino recommended Congress quickly sign into law an update to the World War II GI Bill , which would help ease the economic hardships returning solders are feeling .
" More than any other single piece of legislation , the GI Bill will make a difference in the economic futures of the troops returning every day from Iraq and Afghanistan , " he said .
The views in this article are my own , particularly the peak oil views .
Many of the comments about technical issues are based on discussions with the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) .
I recently participated in an API bloggers conference phone call on the subject of " Exploration and Production . "
We talked about offshore drilling and ANWR .
A listing of the people involved can be found here , and a transcript of the call can be found here .
Locations of concern include coastal waters such as those near Florida ; the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) ( beyond state coastal areas ) ; and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) .
If legislation is passed to permit drilling in areas which have previously been off limits , it will be at least 7 to 10 years before we can expect new production ( Transcript 15:43 ) .
If new production is far from existing pipelines , as is often the case , new production is likely to be at least 10 years away .
This long time period is required because of the many steps involved .
In this post , I will first tell you the reasons why I think we should start this long process now .
After that , I will answer some of the objections I am aware of .
Necessary resources available
I think one major reason we should start now is that we have the drilling rigs , trained geologists , pipelines , financing capability and all the other requirements for going ahead with drilling now .
( Transcript 26:30 )
These may not be in as good supply as companies might like , but if companies are willing to wait until an appropriate rig becomes available , and until staff can be brought on board , there is a reasonable chance of projects going forward .
In future years , as we pass peak oil , the world will become a more a more difficult place to do major integrated projects of any type .
There are likely to be financial disruptions that make financing more difficult .
More and more pipelines will exceed their planned lifetimes .
Air travel will become more and more difficult .
A reasonable estimate of the timeframe for oil production in these new locations might be 2018 to 2040 if we start the process now .
If we delay for say , another 20 years , the production window might be 2038 to 2060 .
Who is to say what the world will look like then ?
If we do n't start now , there is a good chance we may never be able to access oil in difficult locations .
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .
How much do we really have ?
According to API ( Transcript 23:17 ) , we really do n't know how much recoverable oil is available .
There are some published estimates for various pieces -- coastal oil , OCS - 48 states oil , Alaska - offshore , Alaska - ANWR -- but none of these is very big .
At this point , we have n't done any on - site research to see what is really there , using today 's equipment .
We do n't know if there are some fairly good sized fields that we have overlooked .
It is possible that the estimates are too high , but without looking , we really do n't know .
Better use of existing pipeline systems
We have pipeline systems both for transporting oil to refineries and for transporting refined oil to consumers .
The pipelines exist within the 48 states and Alaska .
As production from existing wells diminishes , the amount of oil flowing through these pipelines will drop below their planned operating levels .
Additional production from new sources will keep the pipelines operating longer , and give at least of chance of business close to normal , if not business as usual .
The issue of minimum operating levels is raised in a recent EIA analysis of ANWR .
One thing we should consider is that our existing distribution system is built with the expectation that we will have our current 20 million barrels a day of supply .
What will happen if our imports get cut back dramatically , perhaps because of financial issues ?
The more we have of our own resources to prop up the system , the better .
Better energy return on investment ( EROI )
All of the proposed new drilling areas seem to have relatively small potential .
Oil companies will start running into problems with overly high fixed costs if the majority of oil that is available is from these small locations .
If companies need to start laying large amounts of pipeline because the old pipeline has corroded , costs will be even higher .
If companies can arrange their drilling so that they can piggyback on infrastructure that is still available , this will increase the likelihood that it will be financially feasible to drill in these areas .
Help cushion the downslope
The estimated amounts from drilling these areas do n't appear to be very great , based on information available at these time .
No one who has studied the question thinks that the additional production will actually postpone the peak .
In fact , all of these areas together are not likely to provide very much production .
Whether or not they provide very much , they may help make the situation less bleak for people who are around during the window when their oil is available .

Protect ( very partially ) against the loss of imports
At this point , it seems to me that we are living on borrowed time with respect to the amount of imported oil we are buying , given our lack of exports to pay for the oil .
If we start pumping our own oil , it might partially offset the loss , when it comes .
Objections
These are my responses to some of the reasons I have seen for not drilling .
Spoil the view
In areas where there is a tourist trade , or even fancy homes along the beach , there is often concern that drilling equipment will spoil the view , and thus negatively affect the local economy .
This is primarily an issue where drilling would be close to the beach .
The current Republican legislation relates to OCS areas that are at least 50 miles from shore .
At this distance , there is little chance that oil platforms would be visible from shore .
According to API ( see transcript , 11:45 ) , even with coastal drilling , technology has changed so that it is not necessary to put oil derricks or platforms in the middle of the view .
Newer technology allows companies to place the physical structures out further , beyond the horizon .
The physical structures are then tied by umbilical lines to small subsea systems closer to the coast which are out of sight .
Figure 2 . Typical Basic Subsea Oil or Gas Development - Wikipedia
Oil spills
According to API ( see transcript , 32:50 ) , most oil spills happen when an oil tanker ( a special type of ship ) collides with some object .
Very often these tankers are international ships that are not required to comply with US laws regarding oil transport .
When oil companies produce oil offshore or on US soil , they transport the oil in pipelines , rather than in tankers .
There are many fewer spills with pipelines than with tankers .
For US produced off - shore oil , there have been no major spills in 25 years , even in hurricanes .
If there are fewer spills when we produce oil ourselves and transport it by pipeline , and more spills when we import oil by tanker , the oil spill argument against offshore production makes little sense .
Save it for our grandchildren
The idea of saving oil for our grandchildren is popular among people who are peak oil aware .
The problem is that we are saving fields that are difficult to extract , in remote locations .
If they are difficult for us to extract now , they are likely to be even more difficult for future generations to extract , when fewer resources are available .
The oil infrastructure we currently have is likely to corrode over time .
We may also have problems with available oil falling below pipeline minimum operating levels , even before we run out of oil .
With these difficulties , and the general lack of availability of resources after peak oil , I question whether future generations will actually be capable of producing and distributing the oil that is left .
If we want to save oil for future generations , it seems to me that we should extract it now , and save it in easy to access storage facilities .
Nothing in it for the local economy
This argument may not be explicitly stated , but I expect that it is one of the reasons there is not much support for offshore drilling .
Oil companies operating offshore often use contractors from distant locations ( the largest offshore drilling contractor is Transocean , headquartered in the Cayman Islands ) and contract workers from around the world .
In addition , workers who work on oil platforms sometimes commute ( by air ) to homes many states away .
If this model is followed , the benefit to the local economy may not be very great .
One benefit states can expect to get ( see transcript , 30:18 ) is a portion of payments made by oil companies under leases .
Under proposed Republican legislation , amounts from offshore leases are shared with the states , with states getting 37.5 % of the funds .
This means that states get up - front money , while oil companies are in the process of looking for the oil .
As oil gets more expensive , long distance commuting by off - shore workers will become less and less feasible .
In many ways this will be good for local economies , because workers will be more likely to spend their money near where the drilling takes place .
In inhospitable areas like ANWR , it may mean that it will be harder to find workers because it will no longer be feasible for workers to live in Hawaii and work in Alaska , commuting back and forth every two weeks .
False promises
The Republican legislation that has been introduced has the misleading name of " The Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008 " .
It includes a provision to allow drilling on the OCS more than 50 miles out , and the option for states to choose to drill closer .
The rest of the package is of rather questionable value .
It would repeal the moratorium on oil shale development ; give funding and loans with respect to plug in autos ; and make some changes in futures markets .
I can live with these , but they certainly wo n't provide as much benefit as the title of the legislation suggests .
If one looks at the description of benefits , one can find more misleading information .
Drilling in the OCS is said to provide 14 billion barrels of oil , and this is said to be " More Than All US Imports From Persian Gulf Countries Over The Last 15 Years . "
Most people do n't know that in the past , most US imports have been from places like Mexico , Canada , and Venezuela , since they are closer than the Middle East .
It would have been clearer to say , " Almost three years of US oil imports , at current levels " or " Equal to six months of world oil usage . "
I would agree that the legislation is packaged with promises that do n't make sense .
Nevertheless , I think the question of drilling should be judged on its own merits , regardless of the silliness of the packaging .
We need to increase auto mileage standards first
I do n't know that waiting until we have auto higher mileage standards necessarily makes sense .
Offshore drilling and higher milage standards are really two separate questions .
In some sense , it is questionable whether we even need to build more gasoline or diesel powered cars .
We already have about as many cars as we need ; we could just fix up ones we have .
Instead of building more gasoline powered cars , we could be using our resources to build buses , trains , bicycles , and scooters .
Passing legislation raising milage standards just makes it look like we will be able to keep motoring along in more efficient cars .
We need to start planning for a lot of other things that are not nearly as popular as higher auto mileage cars :
• We need to encourage young people to have smaller families .
• We need to plan to grow food locally , and teach people the skills they need to do this .
• We need to plan for soil fertility .
Can this be accomplished by crop rotation , or will fertilizer be needed ?
If we can not import it , can we make it ourselves ?
• We need to make plans to improve the electrical grid , if we have any plans of adding more renewable energy or if we plan to use it to recharge battery powered cars .
Otherwise , we are just kidding ourselves thinking that these things are feasible .
( See my article here . )
• We need to figure out how we are going to maintain our roads , using much fewer resources .
We may need to change some roads to gravel or dirt .
• Now that we have hit resource limits , the US needs to figure out how to live within its means -- that is , not continue to increase our debt , and not continue to import more goods and services than we export .
( See my talk The Expected Economic Impact of an Energy Downturn ) .
To do this , our oil imports will need to drop significantly , as will our imports of all kinds of things from China and around the world .
Our taxes will either have to be much higher , or we will have to cut back on spending .
How can we do this ?
Will it be necessary to ration gasoline ?
Will we have enough resources available to build factories in the United States to replace imports we can no longer afford ?
While living within our means may sound like an unreasonable goal , this result is likely to be imposed on us by the financial markets , whether we plan for it or not .
We need to learn to live without oil
Having less oil is likely to mean a much lower standard of living .
We can plan for less oil with some of the steps I have suggested , but it wo n't make it very easy .
Not enough oil to make a difference
The oil that is off limits may not be all that much , but it is all that we have .
If we are no longer able to import oil without having goods to export in return , we are going to have to use our own oil , or no oil at all .
Even a relatively small amount of oil can go a long way toward making medicines and textiles and the many other goods that can be manufactured from oil .
We may no longer have enough oil to burn .
Wo n't help prices
I think there are plenty of reasons to drill for oil , apart from helping prices .
The issue of whether it helps prices only matters if one is concerned about the message Republicans are using to " sell " their legislation .
The US Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) has made forecasts that indicate that the additional oil will make little difference in prices , even in the future .
EIA 's price forecasts have been so inaccurate in the past that I think they are more or less irrelevant .
If drilling for oil makes the difference between having medicines and textiles , and not having those goods , it could be very important , regardless of the price anyone assigns to these goods .
We tend to believe so much in fungible oil supplies and very open international trade that it is difficult for us to understand that the situation could change very dramatically , very quickly .
Drilling would damage the wilderness
If I had to choose a place to damage , I would choose a place that is as far away from large population areas as possible .
ANWR seems to satisfy that profile .
Drilling would only involve one small part of the ANWR .
It seems to me that it should be up to the Alaskan people as to whether or not they want drill in ANWR .
I understand that the opposition to drilling in ANWR has generally been from outside of the state in the past .
( Transcript 22:48 )
Prevent global warming
It is my understanding that even James Hansen feels that drilling offshore and in ANWR is irrelevant to global warming .
There is just too little oil , and he feels that it will be drilled at some point anyhow .

IN 2004 , ARJUN N. MURTI , A TOP ENERGY ANALYST AT GOLDMAN SACHS , published a report predicting " a potentially large upward spike in crude oil , natural gas and refining margins at some point this decade . "
It was a controversial call , with crude around $ 40 a barrel at the time .
But it was right on the money .
Four years later , crude is trading around 139 .
Murti sees energy in the later stages of a " super spike , " in which prices rise to a point where demand drops off .
In a note last month , he wrote that " the possibility of $ 150 - to - $ 200 - per - barrel oil seems increasingly likely over the next six to 24 months . "
With supply growth constrained and global demand staying strong , prices must rise further , in Murti 's view .
Barron 's caught up with him last week in his New York office .
The 39 - year - old analyst does n't give many interviews and keeps a low profile , preferring not to be photographed .
But his strong views on energy have resonated across the financial markets .
" We do n't think the world has run out of oil .
We do think [ many producers ] are n't on track to grow their supply aggressively . "
-- Arjun Murti Scott Pollack
Barron's :
What do you make of Friday 's big surge in oil prices ?
Murti :
There have been a number of bullish fundamental data points recently that contributed to the rally .
These include further declines in U.S oil inventories announced June 4 , the announcement of a decline in Russian oil production in May , and recent comments that Mexico expects further meaningful declines in oil production over the rest of this year .
Longer - term , what 's driving crude to such high levels ?
Spare capacity throughout the energy complex seems very limited , whether for OPEC crude oil , natural gas or refining .
In all of those areas , capacity is limited .
And it 's getting very difficult for companies and countries to boost supply -- something that became increasingly apparent to us over the first half of this decade .
Our view started shifting , from one of " It is easy to grow supply , " which was the perceived view of the 1990s , to " It is going to be more difficult to grow supply . "
That 's partly because some oil - producing regions , like Mexico and the North Sea , are declining .
The Lower 48 states in the U.S. are very mature .
There are growth areas , such as Brazil and Angola .
But when we add up all those pluses and minuses , non-OPEC supply looks like it is not going to grow very much .
So , essentially , there is constrained supply , along with increasing demand ?
Demand has been consistently growing .
On the supply side , we do n't subscribe to the peak - oil view .
We do n't think the world has run out of oil .
We do think that the places that have large quantities of recoverable oil , notably Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Iran , Venezuela and Russia , are n't on track to grow their supply aggressively .
It is growing at a very moderate rate , and so the remaining oil resources are concentrated .
And , to some degree , high prices are disincentivizing some of these countries to either open up their industry or spend the money themselves .
What actually is keeping them from producing more ?
These countries do n't need the incremental revenue .
They 're getting the revenue through price ; they do n't need it through volume .
It means they have sufficient capital to try and develop their oil industry on their own .
With high prices , they do n't need Western capital .
Venezuela , where Western companies ' assets have been expropriated , is a good example .
You 've made the distinction in your research that while the world 's oil supply is barely growing , if at all , there is a lot of oil that 's not being taken out of the ground .
Take Russia , for example .
Why are n't they producing more oil ?
In a lot of the key oil - exporting countries , the government is the key driver of whether their oil fields get developed .
Relative to 10 years ago , Russia is in a very healthy position .
So , logically , there is less incentive for Russia to massively grow their supply and bring down oil prices .
Frankly , that 's true for a lot of these countries .
In terms of your super - spike scenario , what phase are we in ?
We are getting closer to the end game here , where despite eight years of rising energy prices , supply looks like it is going to barely grow this year .
We have been bullish , but we did n't expect such a slow growth rate of supply .
And demand outside the U.S. , Europe and Japan has been more resilient than we expected .
What markets are you referring to ?
That would include China .
The Middle East is a big demand driver , though it is often underappreciated .
In aggregate , Middle East demand is about the same size as China 's and it 's growing at about the same rate .
Demand from Latin America is also increasing .
Let 's talk about the possibility of crude hitting $ 200 a barrel .
If we get there , how does it play out ?
Our view has been that the price will keep going up to the level where it meaningfully reduces demand .
This is Economics 101 ; we need more supply or less demand .
And because there are various political and geologic constraints on growing supply , we 're left with looking for the price at which demand is reduced .
We 've never thought we knew what that exact number is .
But we 've tried to look at the 1970s , notably the economic impact of gasoline prices that ultimately led to a reduction in demand .
How does the current situation compare with the 1970s ?
In the 1970s , you had a traditional supply shock .
You took a bunch of oil off the market , and the price rose very quickly in a short period of time .
That led to lower demand that proved sustainable , because the market worried that the supply would n't come back .
It has been , up until the last three or four months , a much more gradual increase -- and therefore , people have generally been able to get used to the price .
And it 's allowed demand to be more resilient than even we thought it would be .
But if crude does hit $ 200 a barrel , what kind of prices will we see at the pump ?
Oil at $ 150 to $ 200 a barrel would imply between $ 4 and $ 5.75 a gallon .
At which point you probably see a falloff in demand , right ?
We are already starting to see a drop in demand in the U.S. , but they are still having demand growth in the non-OECD countries , including China , the Middle East and Asia .
The OECD [ Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ] countries are mainly the U.S. , Europe and Japan .
The real question :
At what point do the non-OECD economies slow down ?
The other thing about U.S. demand is , at what point do you have sustainable change in consumer behavior ?
So if the price temporarily goes to $ 4 [ a gallon ] , but immediately falls back to $ 3 , it 's likely that people will keep driving cars with poor gasoline mileage .
But if people believe the increase in oil prices is more sustainable , they might shift to taking mass transportation , if available , driving hybrids or taking the other kind of actions that are necessary to reduce demand on a sustained basis .
Do you see a sustained drop in demand at $ 200 a barrel ?
That is the big question .
We have always assumed that , at some point , you get a sustained drop in demand .
Our long - term oil forecast looking out 20 years is [ for crude ] to fall back to $ 75 a barrel , or some lower number .
The questions are : How long do prices stay high ?
How sharply do they rise ?
And do people truly change their behavior or are they just temporarily driving less ?
It 's an unknown at this point .
There 's been a lot of discussion about speculators driving up commodity prices .
Oil markets are driven by fundamentals .
Our response to the notion that it is merely a bubble is that you are still seeing no supply growth .
If the price is n't real , where is the supply ?
Where are natural - gas prices going ?
Our thesis has been that LNG [ liquefied natural gas ] would n't arrive in the U.S. in anywhere near the quantities people expected , because LNG prices are so much higher in the rest of the world .
In a country like Japan or Korea , they are now paying $ 18 to $ 20 per million BTUs [ British thermal units ] .
Our natural - gas prices have risen to around to $ 12 million per BTU .
Europe is $ 13 to $ 14 [ million ] , so we have amongst the lowest natural - gas prices in the world .
Therefore , it makes less sense for companies to ship liquefied natural gas to the U.S. For LNG to come into the U.S. , we would have to have much higher natural - gas prices than the rest of the world .
So either prices would have to fall in the rest of the world or they would have to rise here .
Also , natural - gas inventories in the U.S. are tightening , putting upward pressure on prices .
You are pretty bullish on energy .
But you 're Neutral on the refiners .
The challenge for the refiners right now is that we are starting to see the U.S. experience negative gasoline - demand growth and the U.S. refiners are very tied to gasoline margins , which are likely to be lackluster if gasoline demand growth is negative .
There is also higher ethanol production .
The bottom line is that U.S. refiners get squeezed .
One group you and your colleagues do like is the integrated oil companies .
Why ?
Right now , the market seems to be very pessimistic on the integrated oils .
I think the market is worried that there may be windfall - profit taxes .
The market has also taken the view that if you 're bullish on oil , you 're better off owning E&P [ exploration and production ] companies or oil - services companies .
And , again , the market has generally factored in lower oil prices than we think are likely .
All this makes the major oils look very inexpensive .
As of last week , the major oils , including ExxonMobil [ ticker : XOM ] , ConocoPhillips [ COP ] and Chevron [ CVX ] were trading at about eight times earnings , based on oil prices of $ 110 a barrel .
They were trading at four times enterprise value [ stock - market value plus net debt ] to Ebitda [ earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ] .
That 's fairly inexpensive by historical measures .
Do any of these companies stand out ?
ConocoPhillips is our overall top pick among the major oils , partly because they have more oil in OECD countries .
The tax rates tend to be a little bit lower in those countries than they are in some of the non-OECD countries .
They 've also got a large natural - gas position , which they got when they acquired Burlington Resources several years ago .
In the two years after they bought it , natural - gas prices fell .
So the market has taken a pessimistic view of the Burlington Resources acquisition .
But now , with natural - gas prices rebounding to around $ 12 per million BTUs , those assets should be performing a lot better .
Another sector you favor is exploration and production .
The E&P companies tend to be more leveraged to natural gas , where we also have a fairly bullish outlook .
Gas prices have been very inexpensive over the past couple of years , and they are just starting to recover in the U.S.
So some of these natural - gas E&P companies are big beneficiaries of that .
Also , many of these E&Ps are now in some of the newer natural - gas shale plays , like the Barnett Shale in Texas , the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas and the Horn River Basin in British Columbia .
Our top pick is Cabot Oil & Gas [ COG ] , one of the smaller companies , with a market capitalization of about $ 6 billion .
We like their exposures to some of these specific shale plays , including the Marcellus Shale in Appalachia .
Because they are a smaller company , some of these new areas can have a disproportionate impact on the size of their reserves and production .
Another company in this group that we like is Apache [ APA ] , which is larger , with a market capitalization of about $ 45 billion .
They have a nice balance between crude and natural gas and domestic and international exposure .
We think international natural - gas prices are likely to start rallying , and Apache has got a good position in Egypt and Australia .
And they have a number of key assets domestically .
All of these companies look very inexpensive because the market has n't factored in anything near the current oil and natural - gas prices .
Based on our numbers , Apache 's enterprise value was recently at four times Ebitda and Cabot 's was a little bit more expensive at 6.5 times Ebitda .
What other sectors look attractive ?
Pipelines .
The pipeline companies do n't directly benefit from higher commodity prices , as would integrated oil or E&P companies , but there is a great need to expand our pipeline infrastructure in this country , and a lot of the companies we favor are positioned to do just that .
Oneok [ OKE ] and El Paso [ EP ] are two we like .
El Paso has a very large natural - gas pipeline network , and it looks undervalued to us .
As for Oneok , they are well - positioned to benefit from a lot of natural gas in the Rockies and some of these mid-continent shale plays .
Are there any calls you wish you could have back ?
We stayed too bullish on the U.S. refiners for too long , and that has been a mistake .
What most concerns you about energy stocks , going forward ?
The biggest risk is that emerging - market growth abruptly changes for some reason .
It is hard to predict that reason , but if it changes , it will probably change suddenly .
That 's what we worry about .
As for the possibility of $ 200 oil , that 's not sustainable in your view , right ?
No , we call it a spike , which implies an upside and a downside .
So we do n't talk about a sustainable price of $ 200 .
We call it a peak price , but we do n't know what that is .
We 've got a range of $ 150 to $ 200 .
Thanks very much , Arjun .

DollhouseForums ' trailblazing leader Nathan posted the following as a call to arms : " After seeing some of my favorite television shows get canceled in the past – as well as the ' save this show ' campaigns that followed – I had the idea that a fan campaign BEFORE the show begins may be the best thing to do . "
A Facebook fan page dedicated to the online campaign already has nearly 1,500 members .
Some worry the efforts are overkill and will become a sort of self - fulfilling prophecy .
At fan site Whedonesque , several commenters suggest that such pre-emptive campaigning will negatively affect the show .
" There is a fine line to walk so that this wo n't be another obnoxious Whedon fan campaign that will piss people off and make them talk negatively about the show in advance .
Please be careful , " writes TamaraC .
ShanshuBugaboo adds : " I agree that too much ' in your face ' promotion could backfire . "
Our contacts at Fox told us early on that the show was greenlit even before the pilot was shot , and several sites are reporting that the seven - show season was recently upped to 13 – all evidence that seems to point toward the network 's confidence in the show .
Then again , fanatic fandom support does n't always equal show continuation – take vampire drama * Moonlight * or the nuclear - devastated show Jericho .
What do you think ?
Is the early Dollhouse campaign overboard or a just cause to rally as much support as possible for Whedon 's series ?

Who could tell Clinton to quit ?
By Max Deveson
BBC News , Washington
In Britain they are called the Men in Grey Suits .
Mrs Clinton will listen to the advice of her most trusted colleagues
They are the people a politician least wants to hear from .
The people who visit you to whisper gently in your ear that the party 's over - you have to resign , quit the race .
They are usually senior members of your party , loyal friends and colleagues , who you trust enough to tell you truth - even if the truth is that your political dreams are over .
With observers now almost unanimously predicting the death of Hillary Clinton 's campaign to be the Democratic Party 's 2008 presidential nominee , there is much discussion about how her exit from the race will be managed .
And who will tell her that she needs to call it a day .
Political arithmetic Mrs Clinton is now faced with a situation in which the political arithmetic is against her .
Her rival , Barack Obama , has won more elected delegates than she has , more states than she has , and leads her in the popular vote .
And there is little prospect of Mrs Clinton being able to make up her deficit in the dwindling number of states that are still to hold primaries .
There is one moment of grace left for her and it is the inevitable moment she chooses to end her rock fight against Barack Obama and step aside
Mike Lupica , New York Daily News
And with every endorsement Mr Obama receives from one of the senior party officials and lawmakers who automatically get a vote at the party 's nominating convention - the super - delegates - her chances of persuading enough of them to overturn the will of the electorate and choose her as the party 's nominee grow increasingly slim .
Some in the party are concerned that the longer the internal battle goes on , the longer Republican presumptive nominee John McCain is allowed to push his message unchallenged .
The only way Mrs Clinton could realistically win the nomination now is by going for Mr Obama 's jugular and trying to make him so unelectable that the super - delegates are forced to turn against him .
But many people in the party are unwilling to let that happen .
They fear that an all - out Clinton attack on Mr Obama would damage the party , damage the party 's most likely nominee , and damage Mrs Clinton herself - a person for whom the party still retains a great deal of affection , and who is likely to be a senior figure in Democratic circles for many years to come .
Heavy hitter Consequently , a number of Democratic bigwigs are coming round to the idea that Mrs Clinton should end her campaign sooner rather than later - and end it gracefully .
" There is one moment of grace left for her and it is the inevitable moment she chooses to end her rock fight against Barack Obama and step aside , " writes Mike Lupica in the New York Daily News .
" Sometimes that kind of grace comes from the one who knows when to throw in the towel . "
But who will carry out this intervention - and when ?
Senator Dianne Feinstein has been a strong public supporter of Mrs Clinton
It is unlikely to happen before the primary in Kentucky on 20 May , where Mrs Clinton is highly favoured to win .
But the Kentucky primary will take place on the same day as the Oregon primary , where Mr Obama is likely to do well .
His campaign believes that he will do well enough on 20 May to make it clear to all observers that he is the only person able to win the nomination .
At this point , it will probably be necessary for someone in Mrs Clinton 's camp to tell her that the race is over .
There are only a few people in the party , or in Mrs Clinton 's inner circle who would carry enough weight to fulfil the role .
Bad tidings
Many of the most senior party figures - people like Ted Kennedy , John Kerry and most recently John Edwards - have publicly endorsed Barack Obama .
Some party elders have remained studiously neutral , however , and might be called upon to give Mrs Clinton the bad news .
Al Gore is probably the most obvious choice .
He served as vice president under Mrs Clinton 's husband Bill , and has refused to endorse any candidate in the race so far .
The Senate Majority Leader , Harry Reid , might also be in a position to call on Mrs Clinton to quit .
Does Speaker Pelosi privately favour Barack Obama ?
But both of these potential bearers of bad tidings have one major drawback - their gender .
Although they might be able to trigger a mass movement of super - delegates - as John Edwards 's endorsement also may - they are highly unlikely to be the ones to come to Mrs Clinton and advise her to quit .
" White women have been Mrs Clinton 's most reliable base of support and readiest crutch , " US columnist Peggy Noonan quotes a super - delegate as saying .
" Maybe they 're the only ones who can break through , both to Mrs Clinton and to the country , and tell her to stop , " the super - delegate adds .
That would also rule out a senior African - American Democrat , like House Majority Whip James Clyburn , who has also stayed neutral during the campaign .
' Negative dividends '
Which women might Mrs Clinton listen to ?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the most high - powered woman in Democratic politics , is deemed by the Clinton camp to be too pro-Obama in private , although she has made no public endorsements in the race .
" The Clintons think the speaker is for Obama ...
Her San Francisco district went for him 70 % to 30 % - they 'll dismiss her , " says Peggy Noonan 's anonymous super - delegate .
So that leaves only a few women whom Mrs Clinton would trust and respect enough to listen to their advice .
Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has been a loyal Clinton backer since the beginning of the race .
There is one person on Mrs Clinton 's team , of course , who is not a woman , but to whom she might well listen above all others
Her statement last week to the effect that the drawn - out campaign was producing " negative dividends ... in terms of strife within the party , " was seen by some as a coded attempt to tell Mrs Clinton that her time was up .
But she later reaffirmed her commitment to Mrs Clinton 's continued presence in the race , saying " she should take this for as long as she feels she has a chance to win it " .
Other names being suggested include Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski , Robert Kennedy 's daughter Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , and Ellen Malcolm of Emily 's List , the high - profile pro-choice campaigning organisation .
Political analyst John Zogby told the BBC that California Senator Barbara Boxer , Washington Senator Patty Murray and Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln would also be of sufficient stature to make the suggestion to Mrs Clinton .
Behind the scenes , Mrs Clinton might also be prepared to listen to her campaign manager Maggie Williams , with whom she has worked on and off since arriving in the White House in 1992 .
So these are the Men - but mainly Women - in Grey Suits , whom we might expect to be scheduling an appointment with Mrs Clinton before too long , if they feel that enough is enough and Mrs Clinton must bow out of the race .
There is one more person on Mrs Clinton 's team , of course , who is not a woman , but to whom she might well listen above all others .
He has considerable experience of presidential campaigns , and has known Mrs Clinton longer than most .
So if and when her husband Bill decides to have a quiet word in his wife 's ear , that might be the moment when Mrs Clinton is finally made to realise that her presidential ambitions are over - for the time being at least .

“ The states that have ratified this treaty are trying to strengthen the rule of law .
The Bush administration is trying to punish them for that . ”
Richard Dicker
Director
International Justice Program
Human Rights Watch
( New York , August 3 , 2002 ) A new law supposedly protecting U.S. servicemembers from the International Criminal Court shows that the Bush administration will stop at nothing in its campaign against the court , Human Rights Watch warned today .
U.S. President George Bush today signed into law the American Servicemembers Protection Act of 2002 , which is intended to intimidate countries that ratify the treaty for the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
The new law authorizes the use of military force to liberate any American or citizen of a U.S. - allied country being held by the court , which is located in The Hague .
This provision , dubbed the “ Hague invasion clause , ” has caused a strong reaction from U.S. allies around the world , particularly in the Netherlands .
In addition , the law provides for the withdrawal of U.S. military assistance from countries ratifying the ICC treaty , and restricts U.S. participation in United Nations peacekeeping unless the United States obtains immunity from prosecution .
At the same time , these provisions can be waived by the president on “ national interest ” grounds .
“ The states that have ratified this treaty are trying to strengthen the rule of law , ” said Richard Dicker , director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch .
“ The Bush administration is trying to punish them for that . ”
Dicker pointed out that many of the ICC ’s biggest supporters are fragile democracies and countries emerging from human rights crises , such as Sierra Leone , Argentina and Fiji .
The law is part of a multi-pronged U.S. effort against the International Criminal Court .
On May 6 , in an unprecedented move , the Bush administration announced it was “ renouncing ” U.S. signature on the treaty .
In June , the administration vetoed continuation of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia in an effort to obtain permanent immunity for U.N. peacekeepers .
In July , U.S. officials launched a campaign around the world to obtain bilateral agreements that would grant immunity for Americans from the court ’s authority .
Yesterday , Washington announced that it obtained such an agreement from Romania .
Between them , Barack Obama and John McCain participated in more than 40 televised debates with their respective Democratic and Republican competitors over the course of 2007 and 2008 .
They were asked questions about topics from the serious ( Iraq ) to the frivolous ( flag lapel pins ) .
But to my knowledge , and I watched as many of these confabs as a normal human could be expected to endure , the men and woman bidding to be the next US president were n't asked a single direct question about the current administration 's use , and misuse , of executive power .
This says something depressing about America 's agenda - setting media corporations and their stars .
For when the historical assessments of the Bush administration are delivered , there 's little doubt that , while the list of its crimes against democratic practice will be long and the competition for worst transgression stiff , its abuse of executive authority will occupy a special place .
The men who founded the United States feared nothing more than an all - powerful executive that could , at its whim , define crimes against the state and detain those so accused without their even knowing of what exactly they were accused .
The constitutional system of checks and balances and the bill of rights were written expressly to protect citizens from such an executive .
Several wartime presidents have tested the limits of those instruments , and some more blatantly than George Bush .
Franklin Roosevelt put Japanese - Americans in camps on mere suspicion that their nationality would render them loyal to the enemy combatant .
But democracy is about trying over time to perfect the union , and so , after Richard Nixon 's various crimes against the state , we thought we 'd reached the consensus that executive power had to be carefully checked , and we took some steps to do so .
But everyone did n't agree with that consensus .
There were young men , some then working in the administration of Nixon 's successor , Gerald Ford , who saw the post - Nixon reforms as usurpations of executive power .
Two of these young swashbucklers were Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld .
They had to bide their time , but , three decades and a major terrorist attack later , they saw their opportunity .
They put into place precisely the policies that the founders had feared .
They gave themselves the power to declare people , including citizens , " enemy combatants " and to hold them indefinitely without specific charges .
Nearly 800 people so designated were sent to Guantánamo Bay .
No one seemed to have the power to stop it .
But someone did .
Last week , the supreme court told the Bush administration , for the fourth time in as many years , that its practices were unconstitutional .
The current decision , in a case captioned Boumediene v Bush , is a response to a response .
After the third anti-Bush ruling , in 2006 , the administration pushed a law through Congress that grudgingly respected Geneva convention rights for foreign " Gitmo " detainees , but denied them the right of habeas corpus .
The law was challenged , and the supreme court , yet again , said to Bush : you are acting outside the constitution and you must stop .
When we talk about the presidential election , we talk about race and age and Iraq and the economy and healthcare .
When we speak of the supreme court at all , we refer chiefly to abortion rights .
The president , of course , appoints the court 's justices .
There are nine .
They leave the bench either voluntarily ( retirement ) or involuntarily ( death ) .
One is 88 .
Another is 75 and has been living with a colon cancer diagnosis for about a decade .
A third is 72 in July , and a fourth is 70 in August .
All the above , incidentally , are part of the wobbly majority that , by a 5 - 4 margin , ruled against Bush and for the constitution .
The rightwing anti-constitutional minority is much younger ( Chief Justice John Roberts , appointed by Bush , is just 53 ) .
You do n't need to be an insurance actuary to see what I 'm getting at .
The next president , if he serves eight years , will almost certainly appoint one , two or maybe even three justices , who will play a large role in shaping an anti-terrorism policy that is both effective and legal .
So what might our two candidates do ?
McCain used to be a constitutionalist .
He used to say we should close Gitmo .
Last week he said the court had just issued " one of the worst decisions in the history of this country " .
Considering that the supreme court spent most of the 19th century upholding slavery and segregation , that 's saying something .
He complains we 'll see a flood of lawsuits , which is true , but that 's the administration 's fault for writing bad law .
Barack Obama , who to put it mildly does n't stand to gain politically from defending the rights of terrorism suspects , drew a sharp distinction with McCain : " That principle of habeas corpus , that a state can't just hold you for any reason without charging you and without giving you any kind of due process - that 's the essence of who we are . "
Obama 's apparent seriousness on these questions is supported by a statement he made in May on what he hoped to accomplish in his first 100 days .
Without prompting , he included a pledge to " review every single executive order issued by George Bush and overturn those laws or executive decisions that I feel violate the constitution " .
I do n't know how many votes this will net him .
But I do know that , if he becomes president , the nation and the world will be grateful .

Legal challenges to Gov. David A. Paterson ’s plan to recognize same - sex marriages from other jurisdictions are likely to come thick and fast .
But they face an uphill fight , legal experts said on Thursday , given New York ’s unusual legal terrain .
The plan , issued by the governor ’s office in a memorandum on May 14 , was , for starters , in one sense , unremarkable .
The usual idea , after all , is that married couples who move from one state to another remain married , and New York is not among the many states with constitutional provisions or statutes that expressly forbid the recognition of same - sex marriages from other jurisdictions .
“ This is the normal rule , ” Suzanne Goldberg , a law professor at Columbia , said of New York ’s approach , “ and what is unusual is what has happened in most of the rest of the country . ”
For more than a year , the state ’s Department of Civil Service has provided health benefits to same - sex couples who were married in other jurisdictions , and some localities have similar policies .
State courts have rejected challenges to the policies .
Judging from the futures markets , shock at the gas pump is bound to get worse .
Maybe much worse .
Since the beginning of the year , benchmark oil and gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange both have increased by more than a third , but the average retail price of gasoline in the U.S. has risen by 22 % .
That bodes ill for consumers .
So ...
For many it conjures up little more than beer and Lego , but Copenhagen has been crowned the best city in the world in a survey of global urban treasures .
The Danish capital was awarded top spot for its quality of life and status as a cutting - edge design centre , said the authors of the report , which looked at factors from the ease of buying a good glass of wine at 1 am to the quality of architecture and the number of cinema screens .
Researchers at the London - based lifestyle magazine Monocle praised the city 's compact planning , its " frictionless " transport system and infrastructure , as well as its contemporary buildings , top - notch restaurants and renewed focus on environmental issues .
The last characteristic was crucial in Copenhagen 's promotion from second place in last year 's standings to first place in 2008 , they said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" As the planet becomes an increasingly urban place , delivering these life - improving essentials to cities big and small is proving more than a challenge .
Radical environmental initiatives that pull cars off streets can do wonders , but can also kill off passing trade , " said Tyler Brule , Monocle 's editor - in - chief .
" New developments , designed to attract investment , can not only boost local fortunes but also drive out all those people that made the city interesting in the first place . "
In a further accolade , Copenhagen was proclaimed the design capital of the world , with researchers hailing the return of a buzzing scene which had not seen such creativity since its heyday in the 1950s and 60s .
Cities usually considered big - hitters were notable in their absence .
Neither New York nor London – which was lambasted by philosopher and writer Alain de Botton for its " bland " developments – made it into the 20 featured locations .
To be thus neglected by Monocle magazine , which since it was set up 18 months ago by the Wallpaper * founder Mr Brûlé , has established itself as the observer of things cool and contemporary , will come as a shock to both cities .
Other locations that fared better in the survey included Munich and Tokyo , which came second and third respectively .
Paris won the award for best global city , crediting its maverick mayor , Bertrand Delanoe , with having ushered in a new era of free - thinking in the form of innovative initiatives such as the bike - sharing Vélib scheme .
President Nicolas Sarkozy was also praised for having revived the city 's reputation as an international political centre .
For fledgling entrepreneurs , Madrid was named best business city after shaking off its reputation for bureaucracy .
The survey said the Spanish capital was now free from the red tape which once plagued it , and its relaxed working hours make it a fun place to work .
Researchers advised the more artistic traveller , meanwhile , to head to Berlin , which they labelled the world 's best for culture .
The German capital 's art galleries have made it an " unparalleled " cultural hub , the magazine said , adding that cheap studio space and a 24 - hour scene were attracting artists and designers from around the globe .

' Stroll ' through history – without the fumes
By Simon Calder , Senior Travel Editor
Scale : that is the secret of Copenhagen .
The Danish capital has sufficient critical mass to power a thriving cultural scene from sculpture to jazz .
It is big enough to embrace all the benefits of diversity .
Yet , as the principal city of a scattered archipelago that ( often ) shivers in the Baltic breeze , Copenhagen maintains a human scale .
This becomes most evident as you walk along Stroget , the main civic drag ( whose name is agreeably pronounced " stroll " ) .
While the Champs - Elysées , Oxford Street and Fifth Avenue are choked with traffic , Copenhagen 's principal artery has been pedestrianised for decades – boasting the longest car - free thoroughfare of any European city .
Liberated from traffic , the pedestrian is free to appreciate the cultural variety of the city through the centuries .
The architecture is sometimes shocking in the best sense , but much of the civic history is preserved – such as the 17th - century Round Tower ( still a functioning observatory ) , and a waterfront that has grown from mercantile hub to a locale for civilised indulgence .
The water lends the city a certain serenity , but do n't be fooled – it remains at the cutting edge of art , music and design .
Copenhagen is also the home of , probably , the most philanthropic lager in the world .
The profits from Carlsberg beer are expended on a wide range of good causes , including the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek : a beautiful sculpture gallery that also holds a fine Gauguin collection , and a glass - domed winter garden .
Here , you can buy a Carlsberg and toast your good fortune at finding a city so acutely in tune with humanity .
Executions are being carried out responsibly , Mr Hatoyama says
Three death row prisoners have been executed in Japan , the authorities there have announced .
All three had been convicted of murder , a Justice Ministry statement said .
One was a man found guilty of killing four young girls in the late 1980s .
The executions bring to 10 the number of people hanged this year in Japan .
It is one of the few industrialised countries to retain the death penalty and it appears to be stepping up the pace of executions .
A unofficial moratorium was in place for 15 months until 2006 , because then Justice Minister Seiken Sugiura said the death penalty ran contrary to his Buddhist beliefs .
But the current post - holder , Kunio Hatoyama , backs the death penalty - and says the public support it too .
" We are carrying out executions by selecting the people whom we can execute with a feeling of confidence and responsibility , " he told a news conference .
One of the three men executed was Tsutomu Miyazaki , 45 , who was convicted of killing and mutilating four young girls two decades ago .
The case made headlines in Japan and sparked calls for tighter controls on violent pornographic material when a large collection was found in Miyazaki 's home .
The other two men were Shinji Matsuda , 45 , and Yoshio Yamasaki , 73 , who were both found guilty of murder .
Nine prisoners were executed in Japan in 2007 , and more than 100 remain on death row .
Human rights groups are critical of the secrecy surrounding executions in Japan .
Relatives are told only after the hangings have taken place and , until December 2007 , the names of those executed were not publicly announced .
On Wednesday 28th May 2008 , I will attempt a citizen ’s arrest of John Robert Bolton , former Under - Secretary of State , US State Department , for the crime of aggression , as established by customary international law and described by Nuremberg Principles VI and VII .
These state the following :
“ Principle VI
The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law :
( a) Crimes against peace :
( i) Planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties , agreements or assurances ;
( ii ) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under ( i ) .
. . .
“ Principle VII
Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law . ”
The evidence against him is as follows :
1. John Bolton orchestrated the sacking of the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) , Jose Bustani .
Bustani had offered to resolve the dispute over Iraq ’s alleged weapons of mass destruction , and therefore to avert armed conflict .
He had offered to seek to persuade Saddam Hussein to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention , which would mean that Iraq was then subject to weapons inspections by the OPCW .
As the OPCW was not tainted by the CIA ’s infiltration of UNSCOM , Bustani ’s initiative had the potential to defuse the crisis over Saddam Hussein ’s obstruction of UNMOVIC inspections .
Apparently in order to prevent the negotiated settlement that Bustani proposed , and as part of a common plan with other administration officials to prepare and initiate a war of aggression , in violation of international treaties , Mr. Bolton acted as follows :
In March 2002 his office produced a ‘ White Paper ’ claiming that the OPCW was seeking an “ inappropriate role ” in Iraq .
On 20th March 2002 he met Bustani at the Hague to seek his resignation .
Bustani refused to resign .
On 21st March 2002 he orchestrated a No- Confidence Motion calling for Bustani to resign as Director General , which was introduced by the United States delegation .
The motion failed .
On 22nd April 2002 the US called a special session of the conference of the States Parties and the Conference adopted the decision to terminate the appointment of the Director General effective immediately .
Bolton had suggested that the US would withhold its dues from OPCW .
The motion to sack Bustani was carried .
Bustani asserts that this ‘ special session ’ was illegal , in breach of his contract and gave illegitimate grounds for his dismissal , stating a ‘ lack of confidence ’ in his leadership , without specific examples , and ignoring the failed No-Confidence vote .
In his book Surrender is Not an Option , Mr. Bolton describes his role in Bustani ’s sacking ( pages 95 - 98 ) and states the following :
“ I directed that we begin explaining to others that the US contribution to the OPCW might well be cut if Bustani remained ” .
“ I met with Bustani to tell him he should resign …
If he left now , we would do our best to give him ‘ a gracious and dignified exit ’ .
Otherwise we intended to have him fired ” .
“ I stepped in to tank the protocol , and then to tank Bustani ” .
Bolton appears , in other words , to accept primary responsibility for Bustani ’s dismissal .
Bustani appealed against the decision through the International Labor Organization Tribunal .
He was vindicated in his appeal and awarded his full salary and moral damages .
2. Mr. Bolton helped to promote the false claim , through a State Department Fact Sheet , that Saddam Hussein had been seeking to procure uranium from Niger , as part of a common plan to prepare and initiate a war of aggression , in violation of international treaties .
The State Department Fact Sheet was released on the 19th December 2002 and was entitled ‘ Illustrative Examples of Omissions From the Iraqi Declaration to the United States Security Council . ’
Under the heading ‘ Nuclear Weapons ’ the fact sheet stated –
“ The Declaration ignores efforts to procure uranium from Niger .
Why is the Iraqi regime hiding their uranium procurement ? ”
In a US Department of State press briefing on July 14th 2003 the spokesman Richard Boucher said “ The accusation that turned out to be based on fraudulent evidence is that Niger sold uranium to Iraq . ”
Bolton ’s involvement in the use of fraudulent evidence is documented in Rep. Henry Waxman ’s letter to Christopher Shays on the 1st March 2005 .
Waxman says “ In April 2004 , the State Department used the designation ‘ sensitive but unclassified ’ to conceal unclassified information about the role of John Bolton , Under Secretary of State for Arms Control , in the creation of a fact sheet distributed to the United Nations that falsely claimed that Iraq sought uranium from Niger . ”
“ Both State Department intelligence officials and CIA officials reported that they had rejected the claims as unreliable .
As a result , it was unclear who within the State Department was involved in preparing the fact sheet . ”
Waxman requested a chronology of how the Fact Sheet was developed .
His letter states :
“ This chronology described a meeting on December 18,2002 , between Secretary Powell , Mr. Bolton , and Richard Boucher , the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Public Affairs .
According to this chronology , Mr. Boucher specifically asked Mr. Bolton ‘ for help developing a response to Iraq ’s Dec 7 Declaration to the United Nations Security Council that could be used with the press . ’
According to the chronology , which is phrased in the present tense , Mr. Bolton ‘ agrees and tasks the Bureau of Nonproliferation , ’ a subordinate office that reports directly to Mr. Bolton , to conduct the work .
“ This unclassified chronology also stated that on the next day , December 19 , 2003 , the Bureau of Nonproliferation “ sends email with the fact sheet , ‘ Fact Sheet Iraq Declaration.doc , ’ ” to Mr. Bolton ’s office ( emphasis in original ) .
A second e-mail was sent a few minutes later , and a third e-mail was sent about an hour after that .
According to the chronology , each version ‘ still includes Niger reference . ’
Although Mr. Bolton may not have personally drafted the document , the chronology appears to indicate that he ordered its creation and received updates on its development . ”
Both these actions were designed to assist in the planning of a war of aggression .
The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg ruled that “ to initiate a war of aggression … is not only an international crime ; it is the supreme international crime . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A top Democratic lawmaker on Tuesday called for urgent improvement of the U.S. military ’s readiness , saying the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and cost overruns in weapons programs had sapped its ability to respond quickly to a crisis elsewhere .
Rep .
Ike Skelton , a Missouri Democrat who heads the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee , said military officials had finally begun to acknowledge these problems after years of questioning by Congress .
“ Should a major unexpected contingency occur today , it could not be answered in a timely fashion and this worries me to death , ” Skelton told a group of defense writers .
“ We are in dire need of upgrading our readiness , ” he said , citing concerns about military training , the strain of repeated deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan , and difficulties ensuring troops had the equipment they needed .
Noting it has been five years since the Iraq war began , Skelton said the average time between major conflicts over the past decades had been about five years .
Skelton said he hoped to include language in the fiscal 2009 defense spending bill to improve military readiness , increase the focus on Afghanistan , and underscore the need for more help from the State Department and other federal agencies .
The legislation will be drafted by his committee next month .
Cost growth in nearly every U.S. weapons program was compounding the issue , he said .
Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , on Tuesday held a hearing on Pentagon weapons programs , calling them “ one of the biggest sources of wasteful spending in the federal budget . ”
Waxman noted a recent Government Accountability
Office study put cost overruns in weapons programs at nearly $ 300 billion and cited average delays of nearly two years .
Waxman took aim at one program , a $ 1.2 billion Marine Corps amphibious tank that was being developed by General Dynamics Corp .
He said the company received more than $ 60 million in bonuses for the program even though its tanks flunked their tests .
Now the Pentagon planned to spend nearly $ 1 billion more to redo the development efforts .
“ There seems to be absolutely no accountability , ” he said .
“ The contractors keep getting rich , senior Pentagon officials keep receiving lucrative job offers , and the taxpayer keeps getting stuck with the check . ”
Skelton said the Pentagon needed to focus more on winning the current wars , especially in Afghanistan , than spending billions on weapons for possible future conflicts .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently said the Air Force needed to produce more unmanned airplanes for use in Iraq and Afghanistan , rather than focusing on its stealth F - 22 fighter jet that is geared for combat against another military force .
The Air Force wants to buy 381 Lockheed Martin Corp F - 22 fighters , but says it can only afford 183 .
Skelton also said the Navy ’s goal of expanding to a 313 - ship fleet was becoming “ pretty illusory , ” given cost growth in the ships under construction .
He said he supported the addition of more ships to the Navy ’s 2009 budget , but it was not clear exactly how many it could afford to buy .
Skelton defended moves by lawmakers to add spending for certain weapons projects not included in the Pentagon ’s budget request , including billions of dollars in recent years for additional C - 17 transport plane built by Boeing Co .
He said Congress sometimes had a longer - range vision than the Pentagon , but occasionally lawmakers also needed to take a “ hard look and not fund some of the pet projects of the services .
It ’s our job sometimes to pick and choose . ”

Shhh ... super secret special for blog readers .
Sony ’s announced their PS3 PlayTV accessory will be available this September for 99 Euros ( ~$ 150 USD ) .
PlayTV consists of dual DVB- T tuners , enabling both PS3 DVR functionality and placeshifting to the PSP .
Last100 raises some pertinent questions : Can television be recorded during gameplay ?
Can PS3 hard drive capacity be increased ?
( 40 - 80 GB wo n’t hold much HD content … )
Sony has n’t revealed plans for an ATSC ( or other ) model in the US market …
Unlike the UK Freeview phenomenon , I ’m not sure how much demand we have here for a purely OTA - based DVR .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - British researchers say they have created embryos using human cells and the egg cells of cows , but said such experiments would not lead to hybrid human - animal babies , or even to direct medical therapies .

British researchers say they have created embryos and stem cells using human cells and the egg cells of cows , but said such experiments would not lead to hybrid human - animal babies , or even to direct medical therapies .
REUTERS / Shaun Best
Dr. Lyle Armstrong of Newcastle University presented preliminary data on his work to Israel ’s parliament last week , Newcastle University said in a statement released on Tuesday .
They said they had hollowed out the egg cells of cattle and inserted human DNA to create a growing embryo .
The hope would be to take it apart to get embryonic stem cells .
Details of the work were not available because the researchers have not yet published their study in a scientific journal -- the usual route for reporting such experiments .
Other experts agreed such work would only be an interim step aimed at understanding the biology of embryonic stem cells -- the body ’s ultimate master cells , which can give rise to all of the other cells and tissues .
“ They put human DNA into a cow egg and got the usual early - stage embryos you ’d expect , ” said Dr. Robert Lanza of Massachusetts - based Advanced Cell Technology , whose company tried , but failed , to create stem cells in a similar way in the late 1990s .
“ It ’s too early to say whether this is different or new , ” agreed Susannah Baruch of the The Genetics and Public Policy Center in Washington .
John Burn , head of the Institute of Human Genetics at Newcastle University , said the idea is to save “ precious human eggs ” in making stem cells using cloning technology .
“ Cells grown using animal eggs cannot be used to treat patients on safety grounds but they will help bring nearer the day when new stem cell therapies are available , ” he said in a statement .
REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
Scientists hope to use stem cells to create a new field of so - called regenerative medicine .
Doctors hope for treatments for spinal cord injuries and diseases such as diabetes and cancer .
Opponents of human embryonic stem cell research object to the destruction or manipulation of human embryos .
“ This is one of the most controversial ethical issues in all of cloning and stem cell research , ” Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania , said by e-mail on Wednesday .
Caplan noted many people may be disgusted or frightened by such work .
“ In my view there is no risk of making monsters this way .
The biology will not work .
Nor is that the intent of any of these experiments anyway , so I do n’t think that fear is justified , ” he said .
“ This is the kind of technology that will raise concerns , ” Baruch agreed .
“ But you should n’t underestimate people ’s interest and willingness to think hard about these new technologies . ”
Newcastle said Armstrong was granted a license by Britain ’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to use animal eggs in such research .
President George W. Bush has vetoed bills that would regulate the field because they would also all permit destruction of human embryos .
In 2004 , Chinese researchers said they had created embryos by putting human DNA into a rabbit cell .
Experts are pursuing various ways to create stem cells .
Several teams said last year they had re-programmed ordinary skin cells to act like human embryonic stem cells , but stressed that many different approaches need to continue before anyone fully understands how to regenerate human tissue and organs .
On the night of April 28th , the Roots took the stage on The Late Show with David Letterman dressed almost entirely in black .
They wore t- shirts and pins denouncing the recent verdict in the Sean Bell case .
It was an act of protest that eerily pointed out how few things have really changed in the “ post - civil rights ” era .
The next day , the Roots ’ tenth album Rising Down was released on the sixteenth anniversary of the Rodney King verdict .
Rising Down does indeed fit the chaotic and frustrating times we live in .
It is sonically dense , often dark and atmospheric , emotionally fraught and confrontational .
And the lyrics ?
Well , the subject matter is n’t exactly light .
On the contrary , it is hard - hitting , unflinching , and serious as a heart attack .
The group waste no time setting the album ’s tone on the opening title - track , employing steady - flowing drums and a simmering guitar - line as MC Black Thought , along with guests Mos Def and Styles P , take on the wealth gap , urban racism and global warming :
Between the greenhouse gases and earth spinning off its axis
Got Mother Nature doing back flips , the natural disasters
Its like 80 degrees in Alaska , you in trouble if you not an Onassis
It ain’t hard to tell that the conditions is drastic
Just turn on the telly check for the news flashin ’
The Roots have long represented the leading edge of “ conscious ” hip - hop .
In fact , Rising Down seems to be almost a gathering of some of hip - hop ’s most political artists , from Common and Saigon to Mos Def and Talib Kweli .
According to drummer Ahmir “ ? uestlove ” Thompson Rising Down is “ probably our most political album to date dealing with addiction , nihilism , hypocritical double standards in the prison system and overall life in Philadelphia . ”
While the group ’s hometown of Philly plays a central role on many tracks , the sheer scope of issues taken on means these stories could be about almost anywhere in America and even the world at - large .
The track “ Criminal ” puts the very term on its head , telling a story of being forced into a world of violence by powers bigger than yourself .
In a recent interview , Black Thought described the song ’s message : ” It ’s about being persecuted and having no other alternative . ”
” You could also see it from the angle of the Rockefeller [ anti - drug ] laws , ” adds ? uestlove , ” certain groups of people get persecuted and others get away with it . ”
The same repression and violence surrounds this album ’s much more unsettling stories .
The subjects of “ The Singer ” are , in order , an American school shooter , African child soldier and suicide bomber in Iraq .
The track is at some points disturbing , but its utter frankness and willingness to get inside the heads of the alienated and oppressed make it hard to disagree with .
Moments like these have lead some in the music press to label Rising Down a downer .
Most reviews understandably have focused on the album ’s harsh soundscapes and brutal honesty .
Rolling Stone criticized Black
Thought ’s lyrics as being “ so terminally stern that even his jokes sound like harangues . ”
Then again , the Roots have never really given much credence to what outside forces have to say about them , including the music industry .
In rap , a genre constantly painted into a corner , this is not easy .
“ [ T ] he new minstrel image of black people is in vogue now , ” says Black Thought , “ that ’s the image that ’s being sold to you .
It ’s really hard to hold on to your dignity and not resort to shucking and jiving to sell records . ”
This is taken up on “ I Will Not Apologize , ” a proudly defiant track that refuses to back down from one ’s artistic principles .
The track is also one of the album ’s most eclectic and catchy songs , relying heavily on contributions from Talib Kweli and samples from Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti .
What most reviews miss is that by unabashedly portraying life as it is , Rising Down raises the possibility of something better .
Positioned close to the end of the album , with its buzzy synthesizers and snare - rolls , “ The Show ” ( featuring Common and Dice Raw ) is positively militant in its sense that another world is n’t just possible but necessary :
They got hopes and plans of gettin ’ rid of me
I ’ll hit ’em like Ethiopia hit up Italy
Swift as the bullet that killed King and Kennedy
You know the battle is on for infinity
For the Roots to maintain this kind of uncompromising outlook , even strengthen it , in this kind of political climate had undoubtedly been a challenge .
In an interview with Vanity Fair , ? uestlove recently ruminated on the demoralization that many politically conscious artists ( especially of color ) have taken through the hard - knocks of the Bush administration : “ It ’s just a numbing period for artists left - of - center .
Why did it take Erykah [ Badu ] eight years to do a follow - up record ?
Why have n’t you heard from [ Rage Against the Machine ’s ]
Zack de la Rocha ?
D’Angelo ? Lauryn Hill ?
Bilal ?
All the left - of - center , politically charged minority artists –Dave Chappelle included–like , what happened ? ”
The Roots , like many others in the hip - hop community , have thrown their lot in with the Obama camp recently .
How much faith the group has in the Illinois senator is unclear , but listening to the lyrics one gets the feeling they would like to see something a lot more fundamental than Obama is capable of .
Despite all the talk of this album being a po-faced lecture to a world that does n’t get it , Rising Down delivers a lot more truth and hope than you possibly could from anything on the campaign trail .
I make this dish all the time , and I ’m continually amazed that such a simple combination of ingredients can result in a dish that tastes so special .
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil and place the dry linguine noodles into it .
Cook them until al dente ( tender firm ) .
Begin by cutting up the chicken thighs into small pieces .
Heat a large skillet until very hot and then generously drizzle in some olive oil .
Swirl to coat the pan , then add half of the cut up chicken to the pan , spreading them out as you put them in .
NOTE : Do not begin stirring the chicken immediately as you want to get them nice and brown .
After a minute or two , flip over the chicken with a spatula .
Then let it brown on the other side .
After it ’s brown , remove it to a plate and set aside .
Repeat with the second half of the chicken pieces , remove from the pan and set all of the chicken aside .
Add a tablespoon or so of olive oil into the hot pan and throw in the chopped onions and the garlic and give them a stir .
Now add the wine ( or chicken broth ) , whisking to deglaze the bottom of the skillet .
Cook until the liquid reduces by half .
Add the two cans of crushed tomatoes and stir to combine .
Add salt and pepper to taste and a pinch of sugar .
Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes .
Add the chicken ( and do n't forget all of those yummy chicken juices ) , to the tomato / onion mixture and continue simmering for another 15 minutes .
Toward the end of the cooking process , chop up your fresh parsley and basil and add it to the sauce , stirring to combine .
Place pasta on a platter or in a large bowl and smother with the sauce .
Top with grated Parmesan cheese .

Stand back , because I have to get something off my chest : I LOVE BONELESS , SKINLESS CHICKEN THIGHS !
Okay , I ’m back and I feel much , much better .
No , really .
I ’m fine .
Thank you .
Have you discovered boneless , skinless chicken thighs yet ?
I absolutely love them and they ’ve revolutionized my cooking .
They combine all the versatility of boneless , skinless chicken breasts , but they have an added component : FLAVOR !
Flavor , flavor , flavor , and a delightful texture that ’ll pretty much steer you away from breasts for good .
And if I were mischievous , I ’d crack some sophomoric joke right now … but I ’m not .
So I wo n’t .
This dish is one of my favorite ways to use boneless , skinless thighs , and it ’s so , so simple .
Small pieces of chicken thighs are cooked quickly in olive oil over a high heat , then removed from the pan .
Then a simple marinara sauce is prepared in the same pan , later reunited with the chicken , and eventually poured over steaming hot linguine .
I make this dish all the time , and I ’m continually amazed that such a simple combination of ingredients can result in a dish that tastes so special .
And the best thing about it ?
Marlboro Man loves this dish .
My four punks love this dish .
And I love this dish .
The harmony is almost too much to take .
Let ’s make it and we ’ll see if the same thing happens to your house !
The Cast of Characters : Boneless , Skinless Chicken
Thighs , Linguine ( or any pasta ! ) , Crushed Tomatoes , Onion , Garlic , Wine ( or chicken broth ) , Olive Oil , Salt , Pepper , Fresh Parsley , Fresh Basil , and Parmesan Cheese .
Begin by cutting up the chicken thighs into small pieces .
Now , chicken thighs are a little tricky to cut up , so it ’s VERY important to begin with a very sharp knife .
And take it slow .
Slice all the way across the thigh …
Then turn them the other way and finish dicing .
Now you ’ve got a great big pile of fabulous chicken flavor !
Well , at least you will after we cook them .
C’mon .
Let ’s keep moving .
Get a skillet really hot , and generously drizzle in some olive oil .
See those black spots in my pan ?
They ’re the result of my turning on the heat , then walking out of the kitchen and getting distracted for about fifteen minutes .
When I came back , the pan was hot .
Very hot .
And it was mad .
I gave it freckles .
Swirl to coat the pan , then add half of the cut up chicken to the pan , spreading them out as you put them in .
NOTE : Do not begin stirring the chicken immediately .
We want to get the chicken nice and brown , and the best way to do that is not to move it after it touches the pan .
After a minute or two , flip over the chicken with a spatula .
Then let it brown on the other side .
After it ’s brown , remove it to a plate .
Now it ’s time to do the second half of the chicken .
Do n’t worry about the chicken cooking all the way through ; it ’ll finish cooking in the sauce later .
Drizzle in some more olive oil …
And brown the chicken .
Then remove this batch to the plate and set aside .
NOTE : Do NOT wash the pan at this point , because we ’re gonna want all those brown , flavorful bits in the bottom of the pan .
Now it ’s time to chop an small - medium onion .
Here ’s how I chop onions :
Cut the onion in half from end to end …
Then lay each half on the side and cut off the tops .
Peel off the outer skin , then make several vertical slices .
Next , rotate the onion 90 degrees and continue slicing to create a dice .
Thus endeth the onion chopping lesson .
Amen .
Hello , pan .
I ’ve missed you and your brown bits very much .
And now , I ’m going to heat you up again .
Once the pan starts to get hot , drizzle in some more olive oil .
Throw in the onions …
Chop up 3 or 4 cloves of garlic and throw it in .
Then stir lightly just to combine .
NOW !
Grab that glass of wine sitting on the counter .
Take a big swig .
Thank God for grapes .
Then …
Pour the wine into the pan .
I used about 1 /2 cup .
It ’ll steam and smell divine .
NOTE : If you ’re not a wine - o like me , you can use about 1 / 2 cup of chicken broth and it ’ll taste just perfect .
Take a whisk ( mine is flat and I love the dang thing ) and begin scraping the bottom of the pan , which will loosen all those beautiful brown bits so they ’ll wind up in the sauce .
Once you ’ve loosened all the bits , let it bubble up and cook for a couple of minutes …
Until the liquid has reduced by half .
Now open up your two cans of whoop ass .
Oh my !
I mean , open up your two cans of crushed tomatoes .
Then pour them right into the pan .
Stir to combine .
Add in a healthy pinch of salt and …you heard me …a healthy pinch of sugar .
The sugar will cut down the acidic bite of the tomatoes .
Now reduce the heat to a simmer and let it cook for a while .
About fifteen minutes into the simmering process , dump in all the chicken , making sure to get all the juices from the plate in there .
Stir to combine , then keep simmering for at least another fifteen minutes .
That way , if any of the chicken was n’t totally cooked , it ’ll finish cooking all the way through .
Also , the sauce will become richer and absorb some of the wonderful chicken flavor .
Meanwhile , throw a package of dry linguine into a pot of boiling , lightly salted water .
Now , toward the end of the sauce ’s cooking process , chop up some fresh herbs .
I like to send my punks out to the herb garden , tell them the herbs I need , and see what they come back with .
Sometimes , when I say “ Parsley ” , they ’ll come back with a big honkin’ Hosta — roots , dirt , and all .
I need to work on them .
Well , whadda ya know ?
They actually brought back parsley this time !
Will wonders never cease ?
Go ahead and chop it pretty finely .
Now , stack up about 7 or 8 basil leaves …
And roll them into a nice , horizontal … well …roll .
Then cut the roll into small slices , which will result in a Chiffonade .
Everyone say that with me : Chiffonade .
Shiff - oh - nod .
Throw all the herbs into the sauce …
And stir to combine .
And oh , baby .
Let me tell you — it may just look like a boring old chicken / marinara sauce , but those chicken thighs really , really take it over the top .
To serve , just throw the cooked ( al dente , please ) noodles onto a platter .
I bought this particular platter at Sam ’s Club in the summer of ’ 04 in a fit of impulsiveness .
I was eight months pregnant and I also bought the then - new Ashlee Simpson CD , which I listened to the whole way back to the ranch .
A week later , I dyed my hair black .
I still ca n’t explain my peculiar actions that summer .
But at least I have a bitchin’ platter to show for it .
Okay , now you can pour the sauce right over the top .
And grate some fresh Parmesan over the top .
Feel free to go overboard .
I like to slice storebought herb / garlic bread , drown the slices in olive oil , and brown them under the broiler .
Then I like to stack them abundantly around the perimeter of the platter .
Do n’t ask me why .
It probably has something to do with Ashlee Simpson .
Now serve up individual portions , heaping plenty of fresh Parmesan over the top .
And yes , you can use the stuff in the green can if you want .
I give you permission .
Now hurry up and eat !
That ’s what I just did .
* Burp * Excuse me .
Love ,
Pioneer Woman

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Buoyed by the blockbuster success of “ Iron Man ” over the weekend , Marvel Studios on Monday announced plans for a string of superhero properties , including an “ Iron Man ” sequel set for April 2010 .
“ Iron Man 2 ” will be followed in June 2010 by the big - screen adaptation of another of Marvel ’s popular comic book characters , “ Thor , ” the mighty , hammer - wielding hero based on the Nordic god of the same name , the company said .
“ Captain America ” and “ The Avengers ” are next in line for the summer of 2011 .
The nearly $ 99 million opening weekend of “ Iron Man , ” Marvel ’s first fully self - financed production , gave Hollywood ’s summer movie season a solid start and set the stage for a robust earnings report from the studio ’s corporate parent , Marvel Entertainment Inc .
Drawing largely favorable reviews , “ Iron Man ” stars Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire industrialist and playboy Tony Stark , who wrestles with a mid-life crisis as he invents a high - tech suit of armor that transforms him into a superhero .
Kevin Feige , head of production for Marvel Studios , said Downey would return in the sequel as part of his three - picture deal for the franchise .
Feige said the gifted actor deserved much of the credit for the film ’s broad appeal .
“ It ’s great to see a sold - out audience that you know is made up of comic book fans and people who had never read an ‘ Iron Man ’ comic in their life , ” he said .
Marvel shares soared nearly 10 percent on Monday as the company reported first - quarter profits above market estimates and raised its 2008 financial outlook .
Costing about $ 150 million to make , “ Iron Man ” was distributed by Viacom Inc. ’s Paramount Pictures studio , which footed the $ 75 million marketing bill for the movie and received a flat fee for its efforts .

The same arrangement will apply for “ Iron Man 2 ” and an upcoming film based on “ Captain America , ” the iconic crime - fighter created in 1941 .
That film , now titled “ The First Avenger : Captain America , ” is slated for release in May 2011 , to be followed by “ The Avengers , ” based on a team of Marvel heroes that has included Iron Man , Thor and Captain America , in July of that year .
‘ IRON MAN ’ PROVES BOX OFFICE METTLE
An adaptation of Marvel ’s “ Ant - Man ” character also is in development .
But with the coveted summer movie release dates for 2009 already well booked by other studios , Marvel has no self - produced films scheduled to open next year .
Instead , the company said it would “ focus its attention on maximizing the success of an ‘ Iron Man ’ sequel and the launch of ‘ Thor ’ in the summer of 2010 . ”
The final Friday - through - Sunday tally for “ Iron Man ” came to $ 98.6 million , down slightly from the $ 100 million - plus studio estimate reported on Sunday .
But even without an additional $ 3.5 million grossed from Thursday “ previews , ” the film easily exceeded the debut weekends of sequels to two other hit Marvel franchises -- “ Spider - Man 2 ” and “ X2 : X - Men United ” ( $ 88.2 million and $ 85.6 million , respectively ) .
“ Iron Man ” also ranks as the second - biggest domestic debut ever for a non-sequel movie , a record set by the first “ Spider - Man ” with $ 114.8 million in May 2002 .
“ Spider - Man 3 ” stands as the top movie opening of all time -- $ 151 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales its first weekend in May 2007 .
“ Iron Man ” also proved its international mettle , grossing nearly $ 97 million from overseas openings in 57 foreign markets and claiming the No. 1 box office spot in most of those .
Although the studio has no movies in the works for release next year , three animated TV series are set to debut in 2008 based on Marvel ’s Iron Man , Hulk and X - Men titles .
The very next Marvel film slated for release is “ The Incredible Hulk , ” headed to theaters next month as a remake based on the oversized , green brute originally brought to the big screen in a 2003 commercial dud directed by Ang Lee .
Universal Pictures , an NBC Universal unit controlled by General Electric
Co , will distribute the new film , as it did the first “ Hulk . ”

Mr Green has been a police officer for 30 years
One of the UK 's most senior police officers has attacked supermarkets for selling alcohol too cheaply .
Steve Green , the Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire , accused the drinks industry of " making as much money out of people 's miseries as they can " .
He called for alcohol to be sold from behind a counter , like cigarettes .
But industry body the Portman Group , which promotes responsible drinking , said there are more effective ways to tackle underage and excessive drinking .
The government says it is reviewing the relationship between the price of alcohol , the way it is promoted and advertised , and the harm it causes .
While praising the latest efforts to clamp down on underage drinking , Mr Green believes ministers need to do battle with manufacturers and supermarkets , where alcohol is " stacked high and sold as cheap as water " .
He wants alcohol to be moved from easily accessible aisles to behind the counter , and believes alcopops are the " passport " from soft drinks to alcohol and should be banned .
Protecting profits
He told the BBC : " The industry is still determined to make as much money out of people 's miseries as they possibly can and they do n't care who suffers as a result .
" The industry is not feeling the pinch at the moment .
They have to challenge how they are selling stuff , where they are selling it and how much they are selling it for .
We need to change the drinking culture by making drunkenness socially unacceptable
Michael Thompson , of the Portman Group " I think there needs to be some control on prices and I would n't have it as self - service .
I would have it sold under the counter like cigarettes because alcohol is just as dangerous as tobacco . "
Mr Green , who is retiring in less than a fortnight after seven years in the post , said the industry was trying to protect its profits but was working against the interests of young people and the health service .
The chief constable added that in Nottingham , the police and council were doing all they could to combat binge drinking and alcohol - related public disorder , but the drinks industry remained the " problem child " .
Drinking culture Michael Thompson , head of communications at the Portman Group , which is supported by the UK 's leading drinks producers , said there were greater priorities than lowering the price of alcohol .
" We need to change the drinking culture by making drunkenness socially unacceptable , proper enforcement of alcohol laws by police , better education and a crackdown on the minority of rogue traders who serve alcohol to children should be our priorities , " he said .
" There are strict controls on the marketing of alcopops and if Mr Green believes any drinks are marketed at children , he should alert us . "
Earlier this month , the government outlined its new youth alcohol action plan .
Proposals included giving parents guidelines on how much alcohol their children can safely consume , and giving police the powers to disperse under - 18s who are drinking and behaving anti-socially from any location .
In addition , those who fail to get their children to " change their ways " and stop abusing alcohol could be required to attend parenting courses or end up facing prosecution .
The government also plans to work with the alcohol industry to reduce the sale of alcohol to under - 18 s but also in marketing and promoting alcohol in a more responsible way .

LOS ANGELES 
Its reservoir levels receding and its grounds parched , California has fallen officially into drought , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Wednesday , warning that the state might be forced to ration water to cities and regions if conservation efforts did not improve .
The drought declaration  the first for the state since 1991  includes orders to transfer water from less dry areas to those that are dangerously dry .
Mr. Schwarzenegger also said he would ask the federal government for aid to farmers and press water districts , cities and local water agencies to accelerate conservation .
Drought conditions have hampered farming , increased water rates throughout California and created potentially dangerous conditions in areas prone to wildfires .
The declaration comes after the driest California spring in 88 years , with runoff in river basins that feed most reservoirs at 41 percent of average levels .
It stops short of a water emergency , which would probably include mandatory rationing .
Efforts to capture water have also been hampered by evaporation of some mountain snowpacks that provide water , an effect , state officials say , of global climate change .
This article , which first appeared in Modern Age for Fall 1973 , is collected in Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays .
For well over a century , the Left has generally been conceded to have morality , justice , and “ idealism ” on its side ; the Conservative opposition to the Left has largely been confined to the “ impracticality ” of its ideals .
A common view , for example , is that socialism is splendid “ in theory , ” but that it cannot “ work ” in practical life .
What the Conservatives failed to see is that while short - run gains can indeed be made by appealing to the impracticality of radical departures from the status quo , that by conceding the ethical and the “ ideal ” to the Left they were doomed to long - run defeat .
For if one side is granted ethics and the “ ideal ” from the start , then that side will be able to effect gradual but sure changes in its own direction ; and as these changes accumulate , the stigma of “ impracticality ” becomes less and less directly relevant .
The Conservative opposition , having staked its all on the seemingly firm ground of the “ practical ” ( that is , the status quo ) is doomed to lose as the status quo moves further in the left direction .
The fact that the unreconstructed Stalinists are universally considered to be the “ Conservatives ” in the Soviet Union is a happy logical joke upon conservatism ; for in Russia the unrepentant statists are indeed the repositories of at least a superficial “ practicality ” and of a clinging to the existing status quo .
Never has the virus of “ practicality ” been more widespread than in the United States , for Americans consider themselves a “ practical ” people , and hence , the opposition to the Left , while originally stronger than elsewhere , has been perhaps the least firm at its foundation .
It is now the advocates of the free market and the free society who have to meet the common charge of “ impracticality . ”
In no area has the Left been granted justice and morality as extensively and almost universally as in its espousal of massive equality .
It is rare indeed in the United States to find anyone , especially any intellectual , challenging the beauty and goodness of the egalitarian ideal .
So committed is everyone to this ideal that “ impracticality ”  that is , the weakening of economic incentives  has been virtually the only criticism against even the most bizarre egalitarian programs .
The inexorable march of egalitarianism is indication enough of the impossibility of avoiding ethical commitments ; the fiercely “ practical ” Americans , in attempting to avoid ethical doctrines , cannot help setting forth such doctrines , but they can now only do so in unconscious , ad hoc , and unsystematic fashion .
Keynes ’s famous insight that “ practical men , who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences , are usually the slaves of some defunct economist ”  is true all the more of ethical judgments and ethical theory .

Egalitarianism as a Re ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 3.44 Buy New $ 8.95 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
The unquestioned ethical status of “ equality ” may be seen in the common practice of economists .
Economists are often caught in a value - judgment bind  eager to make political pronouncements .
How can they do so while remaining “ scientific ” and value - free ?
In the area of egalitarianism , they have been able to make a flat value judgment on behalf of equality with remarkable impunity .
Sometimes this judgment has been frankly personal ; at other times , the economist has pretended to be the surrogate of “ society ” in the course of making its value judgment .
The result , however , is the same .
Consider , for example , the late Henry C. Simons .
After properly criticizing various “ scientific ” arguments for progressive taxation , he came out flatly for progression as follows :
The case for drastic progression in taxation must be rested on the case against inequality  on the ethical or aesthetic judgment that the prevailing distribution of wealth and income reveals a degree ( and / or kind ) of inequality which is distinctly evil or unlovely .
2
Another typical tactic may be culled from a standard text on public finance .
According to Professor John F. Due , " [t ] he strongest argument for progression is the fact that the consensus of opinion in society today regards progression as necessary for equity .
This is , in turn , based on the principle that the pattern of income distribution , before taxes , involves excessive inequality . "
The latter “ can be condemned on the basis of inherent unfairness in terms of the standards accepted by society . ”
3
Whether the economist boldly advances his own value judgments or whether he presumes to reflect the values of “ society , ” his immunity from criticism has been remarkable nonetheless .
While candor in proclaiming one ’s values may be admirable , it is surely not enough ; in the quest for truth it is scarcely sufficient to proclaim one ’s value judgments as if they must be accepted as tablets from above that are not themselves subject to intellectual criticism and evaluation .
Is there no requirement that these value judgments be in some sense valid , meaningful , cogent , true ?
To raise such considerations , of course , is to flout the modern canons of pure wertfreiheit in social science from Max Weber onward , as well as the still older philosophic tradition of the stern separation of “ fact and value , ” but perhaps it is high time to raise such fundamental questions .
Suppose , for example , that Professor Simons ’s ethical or aesthetic judgment was not on behalf of equality but of a very different social ideal .
Suppose , for example , he had been in favor of the murder of all short people , of all adults under five feet , six inches in height .
And suppose he had then written : “ The case for the liquidation of all short people must be rested on the case against the existence of short people  on the ethical or aesthetic judgment that the prevailing number of short adults is distinctly evil or unlovely . ”
One wonders if the reception accorded to Professor Simons ’s remarks by his fellow economists or social scientists would have been quite the same .
Or , we can ponder Professor Due writing similarly on behalf of the “ opinion of society today ” in the Germany of the 1930s with regard to the social treatment of Jews .
The point is that in all these cases the logical status of Simons ’s or Due ’s remarks would have been precisely the same , even though their reception by the American intellectual community would have been strikingly different .

My point so far has been twofold : ( 1 ) that it is not enough for an intellectual or social scientist to proclaim his value judgments  that these judgments must be rationally defensible and must be demonstrable to be valid , cogent , and correct : in short , that they must no longer be treated as above intellectual criticism ; and ( 2 ) that the goal of equality has for too long been treated uncritically and axiomatically as the ethical ideal .
Thus , economists in favor of egalitarian programs have typically counterbalanced their uncriticized “ ideal ” against possible disincentive effects on economic productivity ; but rarely has the ideal itself been questioned .
4
Let us proceed , then , to a critique of the egalitarian ideal itself  should equality be granted its current status as an unquestioned ethical ideal ?
In the first place , we must challenge the very idea of a radical separation between something that is “ true in theory ” but “ not valid in practice . ”
If a theory is correct , then it does work in practice ; if it does not work in practice , then it is a bad theory .
The common separation between theory and practice is an artificial and fallacious one .
But this is true in ethics as well as anything else .
If an ethical ideal is inherently “ impractical , ” that is , if it cannot work in practice , then it is a poor ideal and should be discarded forthwith .
To put it more precisely , if an ethical goal violates the nature of man and / or the universe and , therefore , cannot work in practice , then it is a bad ideal and should be dismissed as a goal .
If the goal itself violates the nature of man , then it is also a poor idea to work in the direction of that goal .
Suppose , for example , that it has come to be adopted as a universal ethical goal that all men be able to fly by flapping their arms .
Let us assume that “ pro-flappers ” have been generally conceded the beauty and goodness of their goal , but have been criticized as “ impractical . ”
But the result is unending social misery as society tries continually to move in the direction of arm - flying , and the preachers of arm - flapping make everyone ’s lives miserable for being either lax or sinful enough not to live up to the common ideal .
The proper critique here is to challenge the “ ideal ” goal itself ; to point out that the goal itself is impossible in view of the physical nature of man and the universe ; and , therefore , to free mankind from its enslavement to an inherently impossible and , hence , evil goal .
But this liberation could never occur so long as the anti-armfliers continued to be solely in the realm of the “ practical ” and to concede ethics and “ idealism ” to the high priests of arm - flying .
The challenge must take place at the core  at the presumed ethical superiority of a nonsensical goal .
The same , I hold , is true of the egalitarian ideal , except that its social consequences are far more pernicious than an endless quest for man ’s flying unaided .
For the condition of equality would wreak far more damage upon mankind .
What , in fact , is “ equality ” ?
The term has been much invoked but little analyzed .
A and B are “ equal ” if they are identical to each other with respect to a given attribute .
Thus , if Smith and Jones are both exactly six feet in height , then they may be said to be “ equal ” in height .
If two sticks are identical in length , then their lengths are “ equal , ” etc .
There is one and only one way , then , in which any two people can really be “ equal ” in the fullest sense : they must be identical in all of their attributes .
This means , of course , that equality of all men  the egalitarian ideal  can only be achieved if all men are precisely uniform , precisely identical with respect to all of their attributes .
The egalitarian world would necessarily be a world of horror fiction  a world of faceless and identical creatures , devoid of all individuality , variety , or special creativity .
Man , Economy , and Stat ... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 22.75 Buy New $ 25.00 ( as of 07:50 EST - Details )
Indeed , it is precisely in horror fiction where the logical implications of an egalitarian world have been fully drawn .
Professor Schoeck has resurrected for us the depiction of such a world in the British anti-Utopian novel Facial Justice , by L.P. Hartley , in which envy is institutionalized by the State ’s making sure that all girls ’ faces are equally pretty , with medical operations being performed on both beautiful and ugly girls to bring all of their faces up or down to the general common denominator .
5 A short story by Kurt Vonnegut provides an even more comprehensive description of a fully egalitarian society .
Thus , Vonnegut begins his story , “ Harrison Bergeron ” :
The year was 2081 , and everybody was finally equal .
They were n’t only equal before God and the law .
They were equal every which way .
Nobody was smarter than anybody else .
Nobody was better looking than anybody else .
Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else .
All this equality was due to the 211th , 212th , and 213th Amendments to the Constitution , and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General .
The “ handicapping ” worked partly as follows : Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence , which meant she could n’t think about anything except in short bursts .
And George , while his intelligence was way above normal , had a little mental handicap radio in his ear .
He was required by law to wear it at all times .
It was tuned to a government transmitter .
Every twenty seconds or so , the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains .
6
The horror we all instinctively feel at these stories is the intuitive recognition that men are not uniform , that the species , mankind , is uniquely characterized by a high degree of variety , diversity , differentiation ; in short , inequality .
An egalitarian society can only hope to achieve its goals by totalitarian methods of coercion ; and , even here , we all believe and hope the human spirit of individual man will rise up and thwart any such attempts to achieve an ant - heap world .
In short , the portrayal of an egalitarian society is horror fiction because , when the implications of such a world are fully spelled out , we recognize that such a world and such attempts are profoundly antihuman ; being antihuman in the deepest sense , the egalitarian goal is , therefore , evil and any attempts in the direction of such a goal must be considered evil as well .
The great fact of individual difference and variability ( that is , inequality ) is evident from the long record of human experience ; hence , the general recognition of the antihuman nature of a world of coerced uniformity .
Socially and economically , this variability manifests itself in the universal division of labor , and in the “ Iron Law of Oligarchy ”  the insight that , in every organization or activity , a few ( generally the most able and / or the most interested ) will end up as leaders , with the mass of the membership filling the ranks of the followers .
In both cases , the same phenomenon is at work  outstanding success or leadership in any given activity is attained by what Jefferson called a “ natural aristocracy ”  those who are best attuned to that activity .
The age - old record of inequality seems to indicate that this variability and diversity is rooted in the biological nature of man .
But it is precisely such a conclusion about biology and human nature that is the most galling of all possible irritants to our egalitarians .
Even egalitarians would be hard put to deny the historical record , but their answer is that “ culture ” has been to blame ; and since they obviously hold that culture is a pure act of the will , then the goal of changing the culture and inculcating society with equality seems to be attainable .
In this area , the egalitarians slough off any pretense to scientific caution ; they are scarcely content with acknowledging biology and culture as mutually interacting influences .
Biology must be read out of court quickly and totally .
Let us ponder an example that is deliberately semi-frivolous .
Suppose that we observe our culture and find a common dictum to be : “ Redheads are excitable . ”
Here is a judgment of inequality , a conclusion that redheads as a group tend to differ from the nonredhead population .
Suppose , then , that egalitarian sociologists investigate the problem , and they find that redheads do , indeed , tend to be more excitable than nonredheads by a statistically significant amount .
Instead of admitting the possibility of some sort of biological difference , the egalitarian will quickly add that the “ culture ” is responsible for the phenomenon : the generally accepted “ stereotype ” that redheads are excitable had been instilled into every redheaded child from an early age , and he or she has simply been internalizing these judgments and acting in the way society was expecting him to act .
Redheads , in brief , had been “ brainwashed ” by the predominant nonredhead culture .
Conceived in Liberty V... Murray N. Rothbard Best Price : $ 35.13 Buy New $ 29.95 ( as of 08:10 EST - Details )
While not denying the possibility of such a process occurring , this common complaint seems decidedly unlikely on rational analysis .
For the egalitarian culture - bugaboo implicitly assumes that the “ culture ” arrives and accumulates haphazardly , with no reference to social facts .
The idea that “ redheads are excitable ” did not originate out of the thin air or as a divine commandment ; how , then , did the idea come into being and gain general currency ?
One favorite egalitarian device is to attribute all such group - identifying statements to obscure psychological drives .
The public had a psychological need to accuse some social group of excitability , and redheads were fastened on as scapegoats .
But why were redheads singled out ?
Why not blondes or brunettes ?
The horrible suspicion begins to loom that perhaps redheads were singled out because they were and are indeed more excitable and that , therefore , society ’s “ stereotype ” is simply a general insight into the facts of reality .
Certainly this explanation accounts for more of the data and the processes at work and is a much simpler explanation besides .
Regarded objectively , it seems to be a far more sensible explanation than the idea of the culture as an arbitrary and ad hoc bogeyman .
If so , then we might conclude that redheads are biologically more excitable and that propaganda beamed at redheads by egalitarians urging them to be less excitable is an attempt to induce redheads to violate their nature ; therefore , it is this latter propaganda that may more accurately be called “ brainwashing . ”
This is not to say , of course , that society can never make a mistake and that its judgments of group - identity are always rooted in fact .
But it seems to me that the burden of proof is far more on the egalitarians than on their supposedly “ unenlightened ” opponents .
Since egalitarians begin with the a priori axiom that all people , and hence all groups of peoples , are uniform and equal , it then follows for them that any and all group differences in status , prestige , or authority in society must be the result of unjust “ oppression ” and irrational “ discrimination . ”
Statistical proof of the “ oppression ” of redheads would proceed in a manner all too familiar in American political life ; it might be shown , for example , that the median redhead income is lower than nonredheaded income , and further that the proportion of redheaded business executives , university professors , or congressmen is below their quotal representation in the population .
The most recent and conspicuous manifestation of this sort of quotal thinking was in the McGovern movement at the 1972 Democratic Convention .
A few groups are singled out as having been “ oppressed ” by virtue of delegates to previous conventions falling below their quotal proportion of the population as a whole .
In particular , women , youth , blacks , Chicanos ( or the so - called Third World ) were designated as having been oppressed ; as a result , the Democratic Party , under the guidance of egalitarian - quota thinking , overrode the choices of the voters in order to compel their due quotal representation of these particular groups .
Wall Street , Banks , an ...

In some cases , the badge of “ oppression ” was an almost ludicrous construction .
That youths of 18 to 25 years of age had been “ underrepresented ” could easily have been placed in proper perspective by a reductio ad absurdum , surely some impassioned McGovernite reformer could have risen to point out the grievous “ underrepresentation ” of five - year olds at the convention and to urge that the five - year - old bloc receive its immediate due .
It is only commonsense biological and social insight to realize that youths win their way into society through a process of apprenticeship ; youths know less and have less experience than mature adults , and so it should be clear why they tend to have less status and authority than their elders .
But to accept this would be to cast the egalitarian creed into some substantial doubt ; further , it would fly into the face of the youth - worship that has long been a grave problem of American culture .
And so young people have been duly designated as an “ oppressed class , ” and the coercing of their population quota is conceived as only just reparation for their previously exploited condition .
7
Women are another recently discovered “ oppressed class , ” and the fact that political delegates have habitually been far more than 50 percent male is now held to be an evident sign of their oppression .
Delegates to political conventions come from the ranks of party activists , and since women have not been nearly as politically active as men , their numbers have understandably been low .
But , faced with this argument , the widening forces of “ women ’s liberation ” in America again revert to the talismanic argument about “ brainwashing ” by our “ culture . ”
For the women ’s liberationists can hardly deny the fact that every culture and civilization in history , from the simplest to the most complex , has been dominated by males .
( In desperation , the liberationists have lately been countering with fantasies about the mighty Amazonian empire . )
Their reply , once again , is that from time immemorial a male - dominated culture has brainwashed oppressed females to confine themselves to nurture , home , and the domestic hearth .
The task of the liberationists is to effect a revolution in the female condition by sheer will , by the “ raising of consciousness . ”
If most women continue to cleave to domestic concerns , this only reveals the “ false consciousness ” that must be extirpated .
Of course , one neglected reply is that if , indeed , men have succeeded in dominating every culture , then this in itself is a demonstration of male “ superiority ” ; for if all genders are equal , how is it that male domination emerged in every case ?
But apart from this question , biology itself is being angrily denied and cast aside .
The cry is that there are no , can be no , must be no biological differences between the sexes ; all historical or current differences must be due to cultural brainwashing .
In his brilliant refutation of the women ’s liberationist Kate Millett , Irving Howe outlines several important biological differences between the sexes , differences important enough to have lasting social effects .
They are : ( 1 ) “ the distinctive female experience of maternity ” including what the anthropologist Malinowski calls an “ intimate and integral connection with the child . . . associated with physiological effects and strong emotions ” ; ( 2 ) “ the hormonic components of our bodies as these vary not only between the sexes but at different ages within the sexes ” ; ( 3 ) “ the varying possibilities for work created by varying amounts of musculature and physical controls ” ; and ( 4 ) “ the psychological consequences of different sexual postures and possibilities , ” in particular the “ fundamental distinction between the active and passive sexual roles ” as biologically determined in men and women respectively .

The Betrayal of the Am ... Murray N. Rothbard , Mu ... Best Price : $ 11.20 Buy New $ 18.50 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Howe goes on to cite the admission by Dr. Eleanor Maccoby in her study of female intelligence " that it is quite possible that there are genetic factors that differentiate the two sexes and bear upon their intellectual performance … .
For example , there is good reason to believe that boys are innately more aggressive than girls  and I mean aggressive in the broader sense , not just as it implies fighting , but as it implies dominance and initiative as well  and if this quality is one which underlies the later growth of analytic thinking , then boys have an advantage which girls … will find difficult to overcome . "
Dr. Maccoby adds that “ if you try to divide child training among males and females , we might find out that females need to do it and males do n’t . ”
9
The sociologist Arnold W. Green points to the repeated emergence of what the egalitarians denounce as “ stereotyped sex roles ” even in communities originally dedicated to absolute equality .
Thus , he cites the record of the Israeli kibbutzim :
The phenomenon is worldwide : women are concentrated in fields which require , singly or in combination , housewifely skills , patience and routine , manual dexterity , sex appeal , contact with children .
The generalization holds for the Israeli kibbutz , with its established ideal of sexual equality .
A “ regression ” to a separation of “ women ’s work ” from “ men ’s work ” occurred in the division of labor , to a state of affairs which parallels that elsewhere .
The kibbutz is dominated by males and traditional male attitudes , on balance to the content of both sexes .10
Irving
Howe unerringly perceives that at the root of the women ’s liberation movement is resentment against the very existence of women as a distinctive entity :
For what seems to trouble Miss Millett is n’t merely the injustices women have suffered or the discriminations to which they continue to be subject .
What troubles her most of all …is the sheer existence of women .
Miss Millett dislikes the psychobiological distinctiveness of women , and she will go no further than to recognize  what choice is there , alas ?
 the inescapable differences of anatomy .
She hates the perverse refusal of most women to recognize the magnitude of their humiliation , the shameful dependence they show in regard to ( not very independent ) men , the maddening pleasures they even take in cooking dinners for the “ master group ” and wiping the noses of their snotty brats .
Raging against the notion that such roles and attitudes are biologically determined , since the very thought of the biological seems to her a way of forever reducing women to subordinate status , she nevertheless attributes to “ culture ” so staggering a range of customs , outrages , and evils that this culture comes to seem a force more immovable and ominous than biology itself .
11
In a perceptive critique of the women ’s liberation movement , Joan Didion perceives its root to be a rebellion not only against biology but also against the “ very organization of nature ” itself :
If the necessity for conventional reproduction of the species seemed unfair to women , then let us transcend , via technology , “ the very organization of nature , ” the oppression , as Shulamith Firestone saw it , “ that goes back through recorded history to the animal kingdom itself . ”
I accept the Universe , Margaret Fuller had finally allowed : Shulamith Firestone did not .12

To which one is tempted to paraphrase Carlyle ’s admonition : “ Egad , madam , you ’d better . ”
Another widening rebellion against biological sex norms , as well as against natural diversity , has been the recently growing call for bisexuality by Left intellectuals .
The avoidance of “ rigid , stereotyped ” heterosexuality and the adoption of indiscriminate bisexuality is supposed to expand consciousness , to eliminate “ artificial ” distinctions between the sexes and to make all persons simply and unisexually “ human . ”
Once again , brainwashing by a dominant culture ( in this case , heterosexual ) has supposedly oppressed a homosexual minority and blocked off the uniformity and equality inherent in bisexuality .
For then every individual could reach his or her fullest “ humanity ” in the “ polymorphous perversity ” so dear to the hearts of such leading New Left social philosophers as Norman O. Brown and Herbert Marcuse .
That biology stands like a rock in the face of egalitarian fantasies has been made increasingly clear in recent years .
The researches of biochemist Roger J. Williams have repeatedly emphasized the great range of individual diversity throughout the entire human organism .
Thus :
Individuals differ from each other even in the minutest details of anatomy and body chemistry and physics ; finger and toe prints ; microscopic texture of hair ; hair pattern on the body , ridges and “ moons ” on the finger and toenails ; thickness of skin , its color , its tendency to blister ; distribution of nerve endings on the surface of the body ; size and shape of ears , of ear canals , or semi- circular canals ; length of fingers ; character of brain waves ( tiny electrical impulses given off by the brain ) ; exact number of muscles in the body ; heart action ; strength of blood vessels ; blood groups ; rate of clotting of blood  and so on almost ad infinitum .
We now know a great deal about how inheritance works and how it is not only possible but certain that every human being possesses by inheritance an exceedingly complex mosaic , composed of thousands of items , which is distinctive for him alone .
13
The genetic basis for inequality of intelligence has also become increasingly evident , despite the emotional abuse heaped upon such studies by fellow scientists as well as the lay public .
Studies of identical twins raised in contrasting environments have been among the ways that this conclusion has been reached ; and Professor Richard Herrnstein has recently estimated that 80 percent of the variability in human intelligence is genetic in origin .
Herrnstein concludes that any political attempts to provide environmental equality for all citizens will only intensify the degree of socioeconomic differences caused by genetic variability .
14
The egalitarian revolt against biological reality , as significant as it is , is only a subset of a deeper revolt : against the ontological structure of reality itself , against the “ very organization of nature ” ; against the universe as such .
At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality ; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will  in short , that reality can be instantly transformed by the mere wish or whim of human beings .
Surely this sort of infantile thinking is at the heart of Herbert Marcuse ’s passionate call for the comprehensive negation of the existing structure of reality and for its transformation into what he divines to be its true potential .

Nowhere is the Left Wing attack on ontological reality more apparent than in the Utopian dreams of what the future socialist society will look like .
In the socialist future of Charles Fourier , according to Ludwig von Mises :
all harmful beasts will have disappeared , and in their places will be animals which will assist man in his labors  or even do his work for him .
An antibeaver will see to the fishing ; an antiwhale will move sailing ships in a calm ; an antihippopotamus will tow the river boats .
Instead of the lion there will be an antilion , a steed of wonderful swiftness , upon whose back the rider will sit as comfortably as in a well - sprung carriage .
“ It will be a pleasure to live in a world with such servants .
” 15
Furthermore , according to Fourier , the very oceans would contain lemonade rather than salt water .
16
Similarly absurd fantasies are at the root of the Marxian utopia of communism .
Freed from the supposed confines of specialization and the division of labor ( the heart of any production above the most primitive level and hence of any civilized society ) , each person in the communist utopia would fully develop all of his powers in every direction .
17 As Engels wrote in his Anti-Dhring , communism would give “ each individual the opportunity to develop and exercise all his faculties , physical and mental , in all directions .
” 18 And Lenin looked forward in 1920 to the “ abolition of the division of labor among people … the education , schooling , and training of people with an all - around development and an all - around training , people able to do everything .
Communism is marching and must march toward this goal , and will reach it .
” 19
In his trenchant critique of the communist vision , Alexander Gray charges :
That each individual should have the opportunity of developing all his faculties , physical and mental , in all directions , is a dream which will cheer the vision only of the simple - minded , oblivious of the restrictions imposed by the narrow limits of human life .
For life is a series of acts of choice , and each choice is at the same time a renunciation .
Even the inhabitant of Engels ’s future fairyland will have to decide sooner or later whether he wishes to be Archbishop of Canterbury or First Sea Lord , whether he should seek to excel as a violinist or as a pugilist , whether he should elect to know all about Chinese literature or about the hidden pages in the life of a mackerel .20
Of course one way to try to resolve this dilemma is to fantasize that the New Communist Man of the future will be a superman , superhuman in his abilities to transcend nature .
William Godwin thought that , once private property was abolished , man would become immortal .
The Marxist theoretician Karl Kautsky asserted that in the future communist society , “ a new type of man will arise … a superman …an exalted man . ”
And Leon Trotsky prophesied that under communism :
man will become incomparably stronger , wiser , finer .
His body more harmonious , his movements more rhythmical , his voice more musical … .
The human average will rise to the level of an Aristotle , a Goethe , a Marx .
Above these other heights new peaks will arise .

We began by considering the common view that the egalitarians , despite a modicum of impracticality , have ethics and moral idealism on their side .
We end with the conclusion that egalitarians , however intelligent as individuals , deny the very basis of human intelligence and of human reason : the identification of the ontological structure of reality , of the laws of human nature , and the universe .
In so doing , the egalitarians are acting as terribly spoiled children , denying the structure of reality on behalf of the rapid materialization of their own absurd fantasies .
Not only spoiled but also highly dangerous ; for the power of ideas is such that the egalitarians have a fair chance of destroying the very universe that they wish to deny and transcend , and to bring that universe crashing around all of our ears .
Since their methodology and their goals deny the very structure of humanity and of the universe , the egalitarians are profoundly antihuman ; and , therefore , their ideology and their activities may be set down as profoundly evil as well .
Egalitarians do not have ethics on their side unless one can maintain that the destruction of civilization , and even of the human race itself , may be crowned with the laurel wreath of a high and laudable morality .

Are you looking for something to do this summer , spring , or even fall ?
Whether you are looking to do so something independently , with your family , or with your friends , have you ever thought about camping activities ?
The vast expanses of wilderness , mountains , forest , canyons and coastlines lend themselves to a wide range of outdoor pursuits .
From trekking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains , whitewater rafting through the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River , canoeing down the Mississippi River , fishing on the Great Lakes , sailing in Florida , diving in Hawaii to skiing in the Rocky Mountains , every camping activity can easily be arranged .
Here are the most fun and thrilling outdoor and camping activities .
Camping
Hiking / Trekking
Before there were Land Rovers and mountain bikes , there were hiking trips .
The inclination to pack it up and hoof it for long distances can be traced back to our days as nomadic hunter - gatherers , and the goal is little different now than it was back then :
Traveling to exciting and unseen places powered by will , stamina , and whatever provisions you can carry on your back .
Today , getting there is all the fun , what with newfangled backpacks to ease your burden , allowing you to drink up the unfolding scenery and let your mind wander .
Canoeing
When it comes to sex appeal , the canoe always seems to lose out to its sexier stepsister , the kayak .
Be it the boat ’s relative clunkiness next to the kayak ’s sleek lines , or just a quirky , passing trend , canoes have somehow come up less cool .
Yet the underdog status just seems to add to the canoe ’s appeal , especially among advanced paddlers , who argue that paddling a canoe takes more finesse .
Scuba Diving
Prepare to get hooked on scuba diving the moment you slip below the water ’s surface into the peaceful silence of the undersea world .
You ’ll finally understand what Jacques Cousteau was raving about all those years as you swim alongside graceful manta rays large enough to eclipse the sun ’s filtered rays , or when you come face to face with a hammerhead sizing you up .
Fortunately , 70 percent of the world is covered in water , so there ’s never a shortage of great dive sites to feed your submarine cravings .
Mountain Biking
It ’s easy to spot mountain bikers –they ’re the ones with scab - covered limbs talking animatedly about bonking while riding a wicked singletrack .
Indeed , they are a peculiar lot , but only because of their passion for the sport .
They do n’t seem to mind the murderous workouts –they actually celebrate sore muscles–as they attack intense rolling trails in pristine wilderness .
The exhilaration of nailing a technical ride in the world ’s most stunning places is more than enough fuel for mountain bikers .
White Water Rafting
For those who gaze at their washing machine ’s spin cycle and hear the call of roaring rapids , paddling is more than a pastime , it ’s a passion .
And who could blame them : Whitewater serves up heart - pounding thrills and adrenaline - pumping action in some of the world ’s most spectacularly beautiful spots .
Skiing
Planning a ski vacation , whether alone or with the whole family , starts the fun that you will get from the actual trip .
Skiing is basically using gravity to move downhill by gliding over snow conditions using two long and thin boards to keep balance and control .
Snowboarding is a similar snowsport which uses one wide board instead of the two thinner boards that skiers use .
Skiers use both boards to coordinate their movements and control their speed and direction .
Balance , weight , and edge control are the tricks of the trade in Skiing .
Snowboarding
Bird Watching
A camping activity that was once considered to be something of a ‘ nerdy ’ practice , Bird Watching has now become a pastime that encompasses both young and old and allows both experienced ‘ twitchers ’ and novices to come together in pursuit of some of most common and indeed rarest birds .
You can organize your own Bird Watching excursion to coincide with a camping trip .
Many people think that there is a lot of equipment necessary to go Bird Watching but really the most important elements are a decent pair of binoculars , a bird handbook , a notebook and pen , and a keen eye for detail .
Fly Fishing
Camping and fishing often go hand in hand .
Whether it ’s a young child simply trying to catch a few sticklebacks with a piece of string with a hook tied onto a tree branch to the full blown night sight and sound equipment needed by the serious overnight angler , fishing is certainly one of the most popular camping activities .
As fish often tend to bite earlier in the morning , you ’ll want to try to choose a site that ’s as close to the action as possible as you ’ll be getting up early enough as it is .
Caving
For all the natural wonders above ground , do n’t forget about the ones below .
Visiting the depths of a cave offers an experience you just can’t find anywhere else on earth .
Far below the surface , rocks that look like popcorn , butterflies , and bacon strips hang from the ceiling .
Explorers of the subterranean realm can wander through the cold shell of a lava tube , listen to musical stalactites , or take in the spectacle of a huge underground waterfall .
Biking
Under your own steam , at your own pace , and requiring fewer technical skills than mountain biking , cycling is the best way to experience a new place .
When you travel by bike , with panniers carrying your necessities , you become part of the neighborhood , village , province , or country .
As you leave behind the confines of the car , every hill and valley you conquer comes alive .
Sailing and Yachting
Sailing is one of the ultimate outdoor activities .
After all , it ’s how the explorers of old used to travel .
Today you might not discover uncharted waters , but you can certainly reach unknown lands–or at least lands that are unknown to you .
Whether you ’re cruising in the Caribbean , the Seychelles , or the Mediterranean , you decide the where and the winds decide the when .
True , you are at the mercy and whim of Mother Nature , but setting off into that great blue is the truest test of your mettle and where you ’ll find your greatest freedom .
Horseback Riding
There ’s nothing quite like seeing the world from the back of a horse .
We humans have been riding for 4,000 years , but ever since the introduction of the Model T , we seem to have completely lost touch with our equestrian past .
Thankfully , trekking across the countryside on horseback is a surefire way to reconnect with those bygone times .
Let your trusty steed take you across the steppes of Mongolia , explore the game reserves of Kenya , or practice your roping skills on a Wyoming cattle drive .
Wherever you go , you ’ll have fabulous fresh - air views , completely unencumbered by that steel - and - glass box–you know , the one that gets us there quicker , but without all the fun .
Wildlife Viewing
We are all attracted to outdoor activities for a variety of reasons .
However , one of the things most of us have in common is our love of the abundant wildlife that surrounds us on our adventures .
When the mountains give way again to the deserts and plateaus of the West , you probably thought you had veered off the road and into an alternate reality , where the earth is pink and rocks stand on end .
Pleasing as this scenery is to look at through the car window as you speed along the interstate , it ’s much , much more .
That ’s habitat you ’re looking at , full of living things .

Bhutia said his decision to withdraw was a personal one India 's football captain Baichung Bhutia has refused to carry the Olympic torch during its journey through the Indian capital Delhi later this month .
He told the authorities the move was in protest against China 's crackdown on Tibetan demonstrators , officials said .
India has not allowed large - scale Tibetan protests against China , which is hosting the Olympics this year .
Tibet 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has lived in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 .
India is also home to more than 150,000 Tibetan exiles .
Tibet 's government - in - exile , based in India , says up to 140 people were killed in a crackdown by Chinese security forces since anti-China riots began two weeks ago .
Beijing disputes this , saying rioters killed 18 civilians and two police officers during the protests .
Sympathy " I sympathise with the Tibetan cause .
This is my way of standing by the people of Tibet and their struggle .
I abhor violence in any form , " Bhutia told the Times of India newspaper .
Bhutia is a Buddhist who comes from the north - eastern Indian state of Sikkim which has long been claimed by China as its own territory .
The footballer told the newspaper he had not been requested by any group to pull out of the torch run .
" This is an absolutely personal decision .
I feel what is happening in Tibet is not right and in my small way I should show my solidarity , " he said .
The Indian Olympic Association , which is organising the flame 's journey through Delhi on 17 April , has invited several top athletes to participate .
India - China relations
On Sunday , China 's State Councillor Dai Bingguo called upon Indian National Security Adviser MK Narayanan to " understand and support " China 's policy towards Tibet .
Beijing said Mr Narayanan had reiterated that the government in Delhi viewed Tibet as part of China .
India has in the past been sympathetic to the Tibetan cause but in recent years Delhi 's relations with Beijing have improved .
India has not allowed large - scale public protests over the recent unrest in Tibet .
Earlier this month , more than 100 Tibetan refugees were detained in India while attempting to march to the Chinese border .

What are these ?
Overseen by Mr. Cioffi , a well - regarded executive with more than 22 years of experience at Bear Stearns , the funds were in essence a symbol of the frenzy and greed that characterized the booming subprime mortgage market from 2003 through 2006 .
The funds were highly leveraged , in some cases borrowing as much as $ 20 for every dollar invested and were sold to Bear ’s most exclusive clients .
Through 2006 , the High Grade fund did well , gaining as much as 40 percent in one year .
In August , to satisfy demand from clients , Bear started a second fund at what would prove to be the top of the market .
According to the indictment , Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin became aware of the funds ’ difficulties in March .
Mr. Cioffi gathered his team and led a vodka toast in celebration of their overcoming a rocky February .
But as the markets got worse , Mr. Tannin became increasingly worried about the funds ’ exposure to securities backed by subprime mortgages .
Mr. Cioffi calmed him : “ We are not 19 year olds in Iraq , ” he said in an e-mail message that was part of the indictment .
But his own worries were growing .
After a bad March , he told a colleague , “ I ’m sick to my stomach over our performance in March . ”
The indictment claims that the two men hid their concerns from investors , lenders and even Bear ’s own brokers .
“ We have an awesome opportunity , ” Mr. Cioffi said to a Bear Stearns broker .
Mr. Tannin congratulated himself : “ Believe it or not I ’ve been able to convince people to add more money , ” he said to a colleague .
In late March , the indictment claims that the funds ’ decline prompted Mr. Cioffi to transfer $ 2 million out of the $ 6 million he had in the Enhanced Fund and put it in a less risky fund that was showing better performance .
Prosecutors claim that the move  which he never disclosed to outside investors who themselves were desperate to exit  was proof that he was putting his interests ahead of clients .

Federal law enforcement agencies co-opted sheriffs offices as well state and local police forces in three states last weekend for a vast round up operation that one sheriff ’s deputy has described as " martial law training " .
Law - enforcement agencies in Tennessee , Mississippi and Arkansas took part in what was described by local media as " an anti-crime and anti-terrorism initiative " involving officers from more than 50 federal , state and local agencies .
Given the military style name " Operation Sudden Impact " , the initiative saw officers from six counties rounding up fugitives , conducting traffic checkpoints , climbing on boats on the Mississippi River and doing other " crime - abatement " programs all under the label of " anti-terrorism " .
WREG Memphis news channel 3 reported that the Sheriff ’s Department arrested 332 people , 142 of whom were fugitives , or " terrorists " as they now seem to be known .
Hundreds of dollars were seized and drugs recovered , and 1,292 traffic violations were handed out to speeding terrorists and illegally parked terrorists .
Click here to watch a WREG Memphis news report
The authorities even raided businesses and store owners , confiscating computers and paperwork in an effort to " track down possible terrorists before something big happens " .
The Sheriff ’s Department is determining if and when they plan another round - up .
The operation , which involved police , deputies , the FBI , drug agents , gang units and even the coast guard , is just one example of how law enforcement at the state and local levels is being co-opted and centralized by the Department of Homeland Security via massive federal grants .
It also highlights how the distinction between crime and terrorism is becoming irrelevant .
An Infowars reader called in to the Alex Jones show yesterday to alert us to the story and explain that he had gleaned the information from a his friend , a sheriff ’s deputy in Memphis , who had described the operation as " training for martial law in America " .
Forget innocent until proven guilty , you are now a terrorist suspect until you are told otherwise .
It is now the norm to consider everybody equally likely to be guilty of something than innocent .
This is proactive policing , not preventative or reactive policing , and is widely indicative of a society that is NOT free .
This form of proactive policing is a phenomena indicative of a once free state rapidly declining into a authoritarian police state .
If there was a real terror threat in these states , it would surely make sense to for law enforcement agencies to target known trouble areas , and follow up on already existing leads .
Instead we are seeing local police and the coast guard being recruited to randomly target anyone in any area as possible terrorists .
Surely if there was a real terror threat , this activity would harm the effort to combat it .
Of course , such activity is clearly not related to a real and tangible terror threat , it is related to the ongoing effort to vastly increase the size and scope of the federal government and increase the power it has over American citizens .
The information and intelligence from the operation will be collated and routed through federally funded state - run fusion centers , which are working in conjunction with the military arm of the DHS , NORTHCOM .
Such information will soon include the DNA and other biometric information from every person arrested , which DHS head Michael Chertoff has declared is no longer your personal information .
We recently reported on the fact that after 9/11 the Justice Department advised the Bush administration that it was able to effectively suspend the Fourth Amendment where domestic counter terrorism operations are concerned .
In light of this , and given that the government has begun to class any crime as terrorism and set local and state police to work on " anti- terror " operations , it is clear that the protections provided by the Bill of Rights and the Constitution are under direct threat .
We have seen how new provisions will effectively nullify the U.S. constitution , and a recent spate of executive orders , in particular PDD 51 , outline preparations for the implementation of open martial law in the event of a declared national emergency .
Centralized and federally coordinated law enforcement programs complement nationwide FEMA programs to train Pastors and other religious representatives to become secret police enforcers who teach their congregations to " obey the government " in preparation for the implementation of martial law , property and firearm seizures , mass vaccination programs and forced relocation .
The effects of this particular program have already been witnessed .

Advertisement Robert Mugabe has been sworn in for a new five - year term as Zimbabwe 's president after election officials declared a landslide victory for him .
Results showed Mr Mugabe won 85 % of the vote , but many ballots were spoiled .
After the ceremony , Mr Mugabe called for talks with the opposition , whose leader withdrew from the run -off vote citing violence against his supporters .
But southern African election observers said the poll had " failed to reflect the will of the people " .
A statement from the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) said that pre-election violence and intimidation of voters had " impinged the credibility of the vote " .
' Absolute joke ' Morgan Tsvangirai , who refused to attend the inauguration , said Mr Mugabe now had no option but to negotiate .
OFFICIAL RESULTS Robert Mugabe : 2,150,269 Morgan Tsvangirai : 233,000 Spoiled ballots : 131,481 Voter turnout : 42.37 % Source : Zimbabwe Electoral Commission
In a BBC interview , Mr Tsvangirai - the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) - said that any negotiation should be based on the result of the first round vote held in March .
Mr Tsvangirai won with 47.9 % against 43.2 % for Mr Mugabe , falling just short of an outright majority .
He withdrew from the run -off contest last week but his name remained on ballot papers after Zimbabwe 's electoral authorities refused to accept his decision .
His party has described Mr Mugabe 's appointment as " an absolute joke " as he did not have the mandate of the people .
Spoiled ballots
The hastily organised ceremony confirmed Mr Mugabe 's sixth term as president - extending his 28 years in power .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If the UN does n't intervene this time we are truly damned Rejoice , Bulawayo
In a speech that followed , Mr Mugabe said he was committed to talks with the opposition to find a solution to the political crisis .
" It is my hope that sooner rather than later , we shall , as diverse political parties , hold consultation towards ... dialogue as we minimise our differences and enhance the area of unity and co-operation , " he said .
But Mr Tsvangirai told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme : " We believe the 29 March election reflected the will of the people .
" That should be the basis upon which any negotiation ... for a transition should be based . "

Electoral commission officials said voter turnout had been about 42 % , similar to that of the disputed first - round vote .
Independent observers said many of those who did go to the polls voted out of fear , and that thousands of people had spoiled their ballots by defacing them or marking them inaccurately .
President Mugabe is now expected to fly to Egypt to attend an African Union summit which opens on Monday .
The BBC's Peter Biles , in Johannesburg , the question now is whether Zimbabwe 's neighbours will recognise this election result .
An observer team from the Pan - African Parliament has called for fresh elections to be held , saying the vote was not free or fair .
It has urged Sadc and the African Union ( AU ) to facilitate talks between the government and opposition .
International outrage Earlier , the former Archbishop of Cape Town , Desmond Tutu , appealed to the AU not to recognise Robert Mugabe as president .
Archbishop
Tutu told the BBC that Mr Mugabe should have no role in a future government , and said that he would support the deployment of a UN force to restore peace in the country .
There has also been international outrage at events in Zimbabwe .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it was time for strong international action to end the violence in Zimbabwe .
Ms Rice , meeting her Chinese counterpart in Beijing , urged members of the UN Security Council to back proposals for an arms embargo and a travel ban on Mr Mugabe 's associates .
It follows President George W Bush 's instructions on Saturday to US officials to come up with new sanctions against Zimbabwe .
The MDC says some 86 of its supporters have been killed and 200,000 forced from their homes by militias loyal to the Zanu - PF .
The government blames the MDC for the violence .

Experiences of my life ...
Ms di Marineo ( L ) was hitch - hiking to the Middle East with a fellow artist
An Italian woman artist who was hitch - hiking to the Middle East dressed as a bride to promote world peace has been found murdered in Turkey .
The naked body of Giuseppina Pasqualino di Marineo , 33 , known as Pippa Bacca , was found in bushes near the northern city of Gebze on Friday .
She had said she wanted to show that she could put her trust in the kindness of local people .
Turkish police say they have detained a man in connection with the killing .
Reports say the man led the police to the body .
Autopsy
Ms di Marineo was hitch - hiking from Milan to Israel and the Palestinian Territories with a fellow artist on their " Brides on Tour " project .
They had separated in Istanbul , planning to reunite in Beirut .
Ms di Marineo was last seen on 31 March in Gebze .
An Italian embassy official told the Associated Press news agency police tracked the man when he put a new SIM card into Ms di Marineo 's mobile phone .
Local media identified the suspect only by the initials MK and said he had a previous conviction for theft .
Ms di Marineo 's sister , who had gone to Turkey to look for her , identified the body .
An autopsy is being conducted in Istanbul .
" Her travels were for an artistic performance and to give a message of peace and of trust , but not everyone deserves trust , " another sister , Maria , told the Italian news agency , Ansa .
Now that the 2014 winter Olympics have wound down , it is fun to look back at the decision the Russian Olympic committee had to make between two competing logo choices .
Which would you choose ?
My first reaction was certainly the top one – it looked fresh , Olympic - esque and contemporary .
The one at the bottom had so much Russian old - schoolness , it seemed like they were still stuck in the Soviet - Russia era , and have not caught on the graphic design evolution .
But following the argument on Sans Raison made me a convert ( it ’s too detailed to be quoted or reproduced her – please head over ! ) – as she carefully and patiently compared between the 2 final candidates , and espousing the merits of this logo that has much more long - term strength in its identity ; that Olympics logo frequently falls into a certain cliche ( like the one at the top ) .
Eventually I became a convert for the second one too .
Of course , seeing it being applied in context gives it a whole new render / perspective as well :
In context , it does hold a lot on its own ( although the shade of blue on the logo in context seem much friendlier too ) .
You can also check out the full identity in action at their official website .

ESO 's VLT has allowed astronomers to determine that WOH G64 , a red supergiant star almost 2,000 times as large as our Sun located 163,000 light - years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud , weighs almost half of what was previously thought , thereby solving the mystery of its existence .
The behemoth star is found to be surrounded by a massive and thick torus of gas and dust , and is most likely experiencing unstable , violent mass loss .
" Previous estimates gave an initial mass of 40 times the mass of the Sun to WOH G64 .
But this was a real problem as it was way too cold , compared to what theoretical models predict for such a massive star .
Its existence could n't be explained , " says Keiichi Ohnaka , who led the work on this object .
New observations , made with ESO 's Very Large Telescope Interferometer , conclude that the gas and dust around the star is arranged in a thick ring , rather than a spherical shell , and the star is thus less hidden than had been assumed .
This implies that the object is in fact half as luminous as previously thought , and thus , less massive .
The astronomers infer that the star started its life with a mass of 25 solar masses .
For such a star , the observed temperature is closer to what one would expect .
" Still , the characteristics of the star mean that it may be experiencing a very unstable phase accompanied by heavy mass loss , " says co-author Markus Wittkowski from ESO .
" We estimate that the belt of gas and dust that surrounds it contains between 3 and 9 solar masses , which means that the star has already lost between one tenth and a third of its initial mass . "
To reach this conclusion , the team of astronomers used the MIDI instrument to combine the light collected by three pairs of 8.2 - m Unit Telescopes of the VLT .
This is the first time that MIDI has been used to study an individual star outside our Galaxy .
The observations allowed the astronomers to clearly resolve the star .
Comparisons with models led them to conclude that the star is surrounded by a gigantic , thick torus , expanding from about 15 stellar radii ( or 120 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun - 120 AU ! ) to more than 250 stellar radii ( or 30 000 AU ! ) .
" Everything is huge about this system .
The star itself is so big that it would fill almost all the space between the Sun and the orbit of Saturn , " says Ohnaka .
" And the torus that surrounds it is perhaps a light - year across !
Still , because it is so far away , only the power of interferometry with the VLT could give us a glimpse on this object . "
NEW DELHI–
It was supposed to be a heartwarming tale of a man who brought an orphaned bear cub home from the forests of India to console his 6 - year - old daughter , who had just lost her mother .
But when wildlife officials saw the story on TV , it turned to tragedy .
Ram Singh Munda was jailed for violating wildlife laws , daughter Dulki was sent to a state - run boarding school and the bear was brought to a zoo where it refuses to eat .
Now , animal rights activists are trying to win the 35 - year - old labourer 's freedom and reunite him with his daughter and the bear .
Munda , a member of an indigenous tribe that lives in the forests of eastern India , said he found the sloth bear cub last year while gathering firewood near his village .
The bear – which he named Rani , or Queen – became a cherished companion for the family , which was still struggling to absorb the death of Munda 's wife last year .
Television footage was taken of the bear frolicking with Dulki and climbing up on of Munda 's bicycle .
Wildlife officials saw the story and arrested Munda last week for breaking the county 's wildlife act , which prohibits keeping wild animals .
If convicted , he faces up to three years in prison .
A local official said Dulki would stay in boarding school until her father is released .
" They have sent me to jail .
How will my daughter survive ? "
Munda asked as he was taken into custody .
Ajit Kumar Patnaik , director of Nandan Kanan Zoo , where the bear was taken , defended the decision .
" Munda was arrested according to the provision of the law meant for protection of wildlife , " he said , adding that sloth bears , native to India 's lowland forests , are a protected species .
Animal rights activists also condemn taking animals out of the forest , but they say the government is being too harsh on Mandu .
" He never tortured the animal .
Neither was he using the bear for any commercial purposes .
Therefore , we feel he should not have been arrested , " said Jiban Ballav Das , of People for Animals in India 's Orissa state .
Activists warned that Rani , being held in an isolated cage and refusing food , could die if the sudden separation from its adopted human family is not managed properly .

Muslim hater , Michael Ledeen , in the National Review Online :
Time to Attack Iranian Terror Camps ?
So says John Bolton , and he ’s right .
As you know , I have been proposing this for years .
I always thought it was only a matter of time before we were compelled to take this action , which is a legitimate form of self - defense .
And while we ’re at it , we should do the same thing to the Syrian camps as well .
It is n’t “ sending a message , ” it ’s acting to protect our guys by fighting back in the proxy war the mullahs have been waging since 1979 .
Faster , please ?
Of course , for Ledeen and his fellow neocon partners in crime , the entire Muslim and Arab world is a “ terror camp ” and they favor bombing it all back to the Stone Age .
It ’s almost funny , this mullah “ proxy war ” argument .
Mike likely knows the mullahs were brought to power by Ayatollah Khomeini and Khomeini was brought to power by Zbigniew Brzezinski , a Rockefeller factotum .
In November 1978 , Carter appointed George Ball to head a special White House Iran task force under Brzezinski .
Ball recommended the U.S. drop support for the Shah of Iran and support the radical Islamist opposition of Ayatollah Khomeini , an idea proposed by Ledeen ’s guru , the “ Orientalist ” Dr. Bernard Lewis , who has long advocated balkanizing the Muslim world .
Brzezinski wanted to buddy up with the Khomeini regime , but this came to naught , thanks to the hostage crisis .
In short , the mullahs Ledeen perpetually complains about are the creation of Rockefeller and the bankers .
Maybe Mike should call for bombing the Rockefeller mansion ?
Naw , David is not a Muslim .

How do we prevent " mission creep " ( Score : 5 , Insightful )
by Jeremiah Cornelius ( 137 )
It appears that the military is increasingly involved in areas who 's jurisdiction was once considered to be wholly in the civil domain .
Use of jargon like " cyberspace " seems only to obfuscate and distract from the core issue .
This appears an effort to recruit public opinion and defuse the deeper questions that strike at the heart of a free and civil society .
I think that if we had a statement that " The private mails are a warfighting domain " would generate a fair amount of debate on the role of the military as opposed to the police , the function of constitutional protection of liberties , and the question of what actually constitutes a state of war .
What are the limits on this jurisdiction ?
Who enforces these limits , and how is the public informed of that status ?
How are efforts to extend being safeguarded from creating mission creep that threatens all civil discourse in the United States and abroad form targeting , suppression , propaganda and extra-legal surveillance ?
ANSWER :
A very good question .
It 's a complex issue , but bottom line is that we wo n't need new laws to be able to fly and fight in cyberspace .
The DoD 's role in protecting cyberspace is governed by domestic and international law to the same extent as its activities in other domains .
Other U.S. agencies , such as the Department of Justice and the FBI , have important and , in many cases , leading roles to play .
Attacks on the US and its Allies by China ( Score : 5 , Interesting )

There have been several recent news reports that China has and is engaging in a nationally funded effort to hack into and attack US government computer systems .
The German government recently announced that they traced recent aggressive cyber-attacks back to the Chinese government .
What , if anything , is being done against this type of cyber - terrorism against us and our allies ?
Why do we still confer most - favored nation trading status onto a Nation who is actively engaged in efforts to spy on and attacak our government and corporate computer systems ?
ANSWER :
Yes , there are lots of news reports on that , but I 'm sure you can appreciate the fact that there are other branches of the U.S. government that must answer your foreign policy questions .
I can tell you that securing cyberspace is difficult and requires a coordinated and focused effort from our entire society - federal government , state and local governments , the private sector and the American people .
The Air Force is working to improve our ability to respond to cyber attacks , reduce the potential damage from such events , and to reduce our vulnerability to such attacks .

General ,
Some of the most talented people in computer security tend to have the sort of records that prevent them from getting clearance .
Maybe nothing heavily criminal , but enough of a colored background that traditional security clearance mechanisms would throw them out of the room before they get started .
Often the same types of minds that are really good at computer security are also the rebel types , who 'll have some history .
Will you work to get these people in , or are we looking at a bunch of off - the - shelf programmers / admins who 've taken a few simple courses in computer security ?
Also , how do you plan to attract / retain them ?
Again , rebel types are some of the best hackers , and they 're not likely to go in without incentives .
Not due to any lack of patriotism per se , but an unexplored understanding of it .
More importantly , they 're likely to be anti-establishment types who are n't comfortable in the strict traditional chain of command .
Finally , usually the outside industry pays quite well for the good ones .
Are you prepared to financially compete for the best ?
Finally , will there be any connections back to the research / academic community ?
You may find academics more happy to help than usual , as cyber warfare can often be nonviolent .
Also , will the existing ( and immense ) capability within the NSA be properly leveraged ?
ANSWER :
I believe even the most unlikely candidate , when working for a cause bigger than himself , turns out to be a most loyal ally .
Young men and women come into the military for any number of reasons - education , health care , etc. - but end up staying because they believe what they 're doing matters .
We know money does n't create loyalty - - a sense of purpose does .
We 'll take what they have to offer , and in turn they might be surprised by what they get back .
It 's not just our military members either , it 's all those who partner with us . . . academia and private industry , our civilians and contractors , too .
In the cyber command , there is a purpose and sense of urgency to be ready .
You can bet that we leverage all the expertise out there to help us do our job .
Older recruits ?
( Score : 5 , Interesting )
by rolfwind ( 528248 )
It seems that in the military traditionally it was always looking for people fresh out of highschool for EMs and if you wanted to get anywhere in the military you had to be either college educated or , to really have a high end military career , start really young in something like the Valley Forge Military Academy and work from there .
In a traditional branch of the army / navy / airforce that is probably as it should be .
But in this area people have to be trained for years , still not know as much as the older hands in the private industry , and before they really know enough their enlistment would be over .
Also , it would be unacceptable for an older IT person to join but take a pay cut to a Private 's level or perhaps even a Lieutenant 's -- so I imagine this branch would have to be somewhat different .
Is the military going to do to reach out toward the older folks who have extensive experience and knowledge outside the military ?
ANSWER :
As I work alongside today 's Airmen , many with very specialized skill sets in great demand outside the Air Force , I find them to be incredibly well trained and up - to - speed on current technologies .
We bring them in from a general practitioner level and take them to expert level in reasonable time ... and well before retirement age indeed !
We train them with specific technical skills as well as overarching abilities required to lead in today 's environment .
You 're right in that we could n't compete in the cyber world without the experts in the civilian industries who give us the technology in the first place , provide the architectures we use , and even the software we need .
People do n't have to enlist or take a pay cut to help us out .
Certain skill sets can also be brought on board as civilians or contractors , and in many cases we do offer compensation competitive with the commercial sector .
Which acts of war should be illegal in cyberspace ?
( Score : 5 , Interesting )
by cohomology ( 111648 )
War is never clean .
In conventional warfare , certain actions such as hiding among civilian populations are forbidden .
These actions are considered war crimes because of the collateral damage they are likely to cause .
What actions in cyberspace do you think should be outlawed ?
How about intentionally bringing down hospital IT systems , or destroying undersea cables without regard to the effects on civilian populations ?
ANSWER :
The U.S. military complies with all applicable domestic and international laws , and that will certainly apply equally within cyberspace .
The Law of Armed Conflict , for example , arose from a desire among civilized nations to prevent unnecessary suffering and minimize unintended destruction while still waging an effective war .
It would be possible , as you mentioned in your scenario , that some who ignore the laws of civilized nations could conduct operations in cyberspace that may have unlawful negative consequences on civilian populations .
For us , abiding by these laws , being good at we what do and maintaining a technological advantage over our adversaries provides us a first line of defense .
Those who commit unlawful acts would certainly face potential criminal liability for war crimes .

You were recently quoted in Wired as having said " So if they can't run three miles with a pack on their backs but they can shut down a SCADA system , we need to have a culture where they fit in . "
Is this an accurate quote ?
As a former member of the US Army I must say that passing a PT test is not very difficult and the suggestion that some soldiers should be exempt from basic minimum requirements is rather upsetting .
Are you actually advocating the relaxation of military physical fitness standards for ' cyber warriors ' ?
Would this not create a double standard and animosity between the cyber command and other sections of the military ?
Surely there must be other recruitment incentives that can be applied to attract the talent you need .
ANSWER :
I do n't disagree with you . . . and I am not advocating changing our PT test .
What I am saying is that we , as a military culture , need to look beyond what we 've traditionally recruited .
The very nature of our military requires that we be able to work in combat conditions and be able to establish and protect our cyber / communications structures and networks in remote , even austere conditions .
As anyone who has worked in these austere locations will tell you , being fit is critical to mission success , so I do n't foresee or advocate for a relaxation of standards just to bring in this specific type of talent .
But , as we know , some of what we do in cyber can be done at home station as well , so what will our force look like in the future ?
This is something we need to look at and evaluate as we progress in this area .

A wise man once said " It is good that war is so terrible , lest we grow too fond of it " .
If cyberwarfare ever becomes a reality , how do we respond to the fact that is is n't " terrible " ?
The direct damage from such warfare would be primarily economic or data security related ( rather than a cost in human lives ) how do you feel we can prevent it from becoming a monthly , yearly , or daily occurance ?
ANSWER :
The fact is we are dealing with this on a daily basis and it wo n't be going away anytime soon .
Not for any of us .
The way to shield ourselves from these attacks is to be at the forefront of technology , tactics and procedures relating to operating in cyberspace .
We have systems and software that are protected by multiple layers of security and functional redundancy .
We train our people to be on the cutting edge of this technology , and we find ways secure our information .
We have to take this very seriously because we rely on our networks to conduct military operations all around the world .

Criminal vs Warlike Actions ( Score : 5 , Interesting )
by florescent_beige ( 608235 )
General Lord ,
Does the AFCC have a mandate to pursue criminals that use information infrastructure to commit crimes , or is your group intended to defend against warlike attacks only ?
If the latter is true , how would you distinguish between criminal activity and warlike activity in cyberspace ?
ANSWER :
The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes it very hard to distinguish what actions would be those of terrorists , criminals , nation states or just some lone prankster .
Our command coordinates with government partners such as the DoD 's Cyber Crime Center staff , who work with law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute criminal acts if necessary .
A " war - like activity " can also include presenting misleading information to our battlefield commanders .
So , we 've got to be spot on about authenticating the trusted source of that information in the first place .
But , generally speaking , if something is a coordinated attack that would cause disruption or an attack that required a high level of technical sophistication to carry out , that would cause us to take a closer look and recommend a proper response .

I 'm curious to know if you have have any criteria that would enable you do decide when a cyber attack is an act of war .
Would it be possible for some kind of action inside a network to lead to a shooting war without some kind of overt physical threat occurring first ?
ANSWER :
Within the Department of Defense , we are careful not to speculate about what would be considered an act of war .
Our nation 's elected officials are the ones who will decide what threats to , or actions against our national security will constitute an act of war against the United States .
These same leaders will likewise determine what an appropriate response would be , and that could be diplomatic , economic or involve the military to demonstrate the nation 's resolve .
That 's why it's my responsibility to oversee the building of a command that will provide our leaders , through the appropriate chain of command , with many options with which to deter threats in the first place or respond when necessary .

Why should the US Air Force be tasked with this , instead of DISA or NSA , neither of which is tied to a specific branch of the military ?

Do n't confuse the fact that we are standing up the Air Force Cyber Command to mean we are the lead for the nation , or the primary command to respond to a particular incident .
We are just one part of a combined effort .
Our first priority is to work with DoD to defend AF military resources , but many of those resources rely on civilian entities , so we obviously have a keen interest in protecting those items as well .
We thought it was the right thing to do to consolidate our efforts and to align all the Air Force cyber - related resources so we can have better command and control .
This command will be able to respond better to the needs of our commanders and be the focal point within the Air Force for cyber security and defense missions , as well as respond to emergencies and natural disasters .

Question about Existing Contractors ( Score : 5 , Interesting )

General Lord , I currently work as the exact type of ' cyber warrior ' you intend to recruit .
But I already have a Top Secret clearance , already familiar with DoD systems , etc .
The dynamic with what we call ' Information Assurance ' is that of a constant struggle with our contractor management ( stay within the contract , the budget , etc ) and with our ' warfighter ' higher ups ( educating them on why they can't have full access from their home in the spirit of " operations are a priority , to hell with security " ) .
So assuming you can get the type of expertise that are eligible for clearances , and that are willing to relocate to Offutt / etc , how are you going to address the core issue of security in the DoD : Operations / budget / schedule will always trump security .
Or alternatively , security will always be back burner to ' hot ' issues .
Thank you for your time .
ANSWER :
Certainly the balance between having access to do our mission and having robust security is an issue where not everyone agrees on just how much to restrict or how much to allow .
The Air Force takes the security of its computer networks very seriously and has taken several measures to educate our users and to provide secure means for them to operate .
As with many other issues , the Air Force through its commanders , must assess the risks and make a decision .
I do n't agree or I maybe I just have n't seen where security is always a back burner item .

What types of things is the DoD looking for when they choose the final location for this new Command ?
ANSWER :
The government actually has a regulation that covers the whole process for choosing a location for a command and it's a very defined , thorough process .
The bases must meet certain criteria -- existing infrastructure would be just one aspect of many items along with communications or square footage requirements , but there are other considerations , such as the impact to the environment that the Pentagon will consider .
I would hope that no matter where it was located , we would still be able to attract the talent needed to work in this exciting command and that all communities see the need to protect this domain .
[ The online game market has a battle raging between subscription - based and alternative microtransaction - related business models - Gamasutra examines the matchup with SOE's John Smedley , Three Rings ' Daniel James and EA Mythic 's Mark Jacobs . ]
While the majority of MMOGs in the U.S. still earn their keep by collecting monthly fees , the classic subscription business model is no longer a knee - jerk reaction for most domestic publishers of new massive - multiplayer online games .
Indeed , publishers say they are thinking long and hard , weighing their options , and not announcing earlier than necessary how their forthcoming games will produce income .
Consider Sony Online Entertainment .
Every one of SOE 's six current MMOGs -- EverQuest , EverQuest II , Vanguard : Saga Of Heroes , The Matrix Online , Planetside , and EverQuest Online Adventures -- requires gamers to shell out a monthly subscription fee .
But come 2009 , when Sony launches The Agency , an online action shooter , it still is n't clear what will be its method of generating revenue .
" We 'll be launching another MMOG -- Free Realms -- prior to The Agency late this year .
And we 've already said that we 're absolutely going away from standard subscriptions there , using ' freemiums ' instead , " says John Smedley , SOE 's president .
" That means you can play for free but you can also sign up for a club within the game if you want extra features .
" As for The Agency , we 're taking a wait - and - see attitude , " he adds .
" Before we make any decisions , we want to see how the combination of free play , microtransactions , and advertising support works for Free Realms .
If I had to guess , I suspect we 'll be doing the same with The Agency , but we 're not quite ready to commit . "
" In the meantime , we 've designed the game to fit different models .
Regardless which we actually choose , I foresee us moving to various business models other than subscriptions over time for newer games . "
SOE's The Agency
Smedley would n't comment on DC Universe Online , another forthcoming SOE MMOG that has not yet been officially announced .
But he did hint there 's even the possibility of re-tooling older MMOGs to accept new revenue models .
" We might be able to get new life out of an older MMO by going away from the subscription model and adding microtransactions , " he says .
" It is possible to do that , but it 's probably unlikely .
We 'll more likely save the newer revenue models for our newer games . "

The Weekly Q
This week NOW on PBS visits Atlanta , Georgia to see how one American city is handling the tragic phenomenon of child prostitution .
It is one of 27 American cities where the problem seems to be spinning out of control .
" It 's one of those issues that does n't get discussed and therefore there 's an assumption that perhaps either it does n't exist at all or the young women and girls who are prostitutes are there by their own free will , " Atlanta 's Mayor Shirley Franklin tells NOW .
About two years ago Mayor Franklin launched an aggressive campaign in her city — where the adult entertainment industry is booming — to crackdown on pay - for - sex customers , or " Johns . "
She 's also launched an ad campaign to raise awareness of the problem of child prostitution and ordered her police department to develop better ways to protect children caught up in the trade .
" [ The child prostitutes are ] ten or 11 years old , and the age is getting lower .
We 're not talking about 17 and 18 and 19 year olds , although we could , " Franklin says .
One would think fighting child prostitution is a cause everyone could get behind .
But the battle against this epidemic in Atlanta has been difficult , and the more NOW on PBS dug into the story , the more challenges we discovered .
This show was originally broadcast on May 30 , 2008 .

Care For a Glass of Tiger Bone Wine ?
When you think of an animal park , you would normally think of animal protection .
What you would not expect is to have animal park employees offer you wine made using endangered tiger carcasses .
Travel to enough animal parks in China and that is exactly what you will find .
Tiger Bone Wine , made from the carcass of a Tiger soaked in rice wine , is claimed by many animal parks to be a health tonic used to treat arthritis and rheumatism .
It is illegal to make and sell Tiger Bone Wine , but that has n’t stopped many animal park workers from producing the drink and attempting to sell it to park visitors .
“ The trade in parts of endangered species has been subject to international ban since 1987 , and has been outlawed in China since 1989 ”
When challenged by undercover EPA , Environment Protection Agents , workers claimed and even provided documentation that they were approved by the Chinese government to produce the wine .
Whether the documents and the claim where legit is unknown but the EPA called in authorities on two parks suspected of making the wine .
There are a limited number of tigers left in the wild , roughly 3,500 to 7,500 , and only about half of those are breeding adults .
Ever since the 1980 ’s small tiger farms have been created that could actually house more tigers than there are free in the wild .
It has been suggested that a removal of the ban on using endangered species would allow the use of farmed tigers for traditional medical purposes without hurting the wild tiger population .
An EPA spokesperson indicated that the cost is much higher to raise tigers than to shoot them in the wild and “ Lifting the ban would increase demand and lead to a surge in poaching .
It would be far too easy to launder their skins , bones and parts among those from legalised tiger farms .
This would effectively declare an open season on wild tigers . ”

Wine has been reported selling for around $ 25 to $ 35 per bottle , but good luck clearing customs with it .

The era of cheap and easily available oil is over .
We need to move away from black gold and put our efforts in a low carbon economy .
The sooner we do that , the better .
So what is the solution ?
Well , we have to move away from oil .
This is what the European Energy Policy is all about .
We need to reduce demand with more efficient transport , industry and housing .
We need to promote alternative fuels , like biofuels , electricity or hydrogen ; we need to change to cleaner and more efficient transport modes like rail , short sea shipping , or public transport .
And in the meantime , we need to continue our dialog with oil producers to encourage them to produce more and to supply the markets better .
On 24th of June , I will meet ministers of the OPEC countries to discuss with them on this issue .
We all know the consequences .
The barrel is currently around 130 $ , 300 % more expensive than only 3 years ago .
Experts are talking about prices of 200 $ per barrel for next year only .
At this levels , even non-conventional oil sources , such as heavy crude or tar sands become attractive , despite its awful CO2 foot print and high energy consumption .
The easy sources of oil are already in use .
Oil companies are currently exploring in deep seas or in frozen and inaccessible regions .
Geopolitical uncertainties reign in oil producing areas , while there is a growing tendency among producing countries to nationalise their resources , or make foreign investments more difficult .
There is a growing shortage of highly skilled working force and exploration and production of oil is becoming a high tech activity , extremely expensive .
In year 2000 China had 4 million cars .
In 2005 - already 19 million cars .
It is expected that in 2010 the Chinese car fleet will be 55 million and 130 million in 2020 .
India is following a similar trend , and the economies of the United States and Europe continue to devour oil in large quantities .
More and more people compete for an increasingly scarce commodity .
We all know that oil will run out some day .
The exact date is certainly under discussion , but there is a fact that nobody can deny , getting oil out of the earth is now much more difficult and expensive that it used to be .
However , the real drivers of oil price escalade have a structural nature .
You all know the offer and demand law .
If offer decreases , price increases .
If there is a growth on demand , there is also a growth on price .
If , at the same time offer decreases and demand increases then , price skyrockets .
This is precisely what is happening in oil markets .
In the past , periods of relatively expensive crude , were followed by periods of cheap oil due to temporary factors like the first Gulf war .
Currently , as well , there are temporary factors that are influencing oil prices , like the boom in commodities markets , geopolitical situation in several key producing areas , the weakening of the dollar or the turmoil in global financial markets .
Last Tuesday I was a witness of a very sad episode .
Belgian riot police employed force against a group of French and Italian fishermen marching to the European quarter to protest violently against high price of fuel .
A car crash occurred as a consequence of the riots .
The frustration of the demonstration is easy to understand , but certainly demonstrations and street fights are not the answer to this problem .
Oil prices are high and will go higher .
No demonstration can change that .
My reply
Dear Andris ,
This entry is the most appalling muddled mess - which is a direct reflection of EU energy policy .
There are shafts of sunlight mixed in with utter rubbish .
Each time I have left an entry here I have told you that we are in the early stages of a full blown energy crisis .
It is a great pity that you have waited until oil hit $ 130 per barrel and for French fisherman to riot before realising that this is indeed the case .
Of course if you and your team were up to the job , you would be able to study the oil supply and demand data published by the IEA , the EIA and BP and conclude that an energy crisis is on the way in advance and put in place effective strategies to mitigate for this .
But no , your approach is reactive , well behind the curve , wrongly focussed and without a substantial re-writing of the EU Energy policy , it is destined to fail .
The riots in Belgium and Iberia are partly your fault .
You are the EU energy commissioner , pipe dreaming whilst EU energy security drains away .
It is encouraging to see that you finally understand that demand for oil , gas and coal are rising whilst supply for oil at least is static .
Rising demand against static supply is controlled by escalating price , encouraging conservation and pricing poor Europeans out of the energy market .
You should by now understand that when poor people get priced out of the energy market they riot .
The next thing you need to grasp with some urgency is that oil supply will not stay static for long .
IT IS GOING TO GO DOWN ONE DAY VERY SOON .
( 2012±3 years )
And then the problems we are experiencing now will get worse by a factor of 100 or more .
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS ?
The EU and the OECD in general has absolutely no control over raising global oil supplies .
You seem to think that OPEC does , BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT OPEC ARE PUMPING FLAT OUT .
The IEA data shows that their reserve capacity is near zero .
So the only control OPEC has would be to reduce supply in order to conserve their dwindling reserves for future generations .
Thus , the only part of the equation that the EU can control is demand .
The EU needs to introduce with some urgency measures to reduce demand for oil and natural gas .
And here I believe you make some good points .
We need solid , urgent plans to radically transform our transportation systems .
To be blunt , cheap air travel for all will not be part of this future .
Shipping , canals , and electrified mass transit and electric cars are the future .
We need someone with vision to stimulate pilot V2G projects across Europe .
Energy conservation and energy efficiency must be vital cornerstones of the EU energy policy .
I believe you understand that but you do n't seem to understand what energy efficiency means .
( hence you drive one of the least energy efficient cars ever produced ) .
Producing H uses more energy than can be recovered .
It is an energy sink , a waste of energy and a waste of time ( apart from in some isolated special cases ) .
Ethanol consumes almost as much energy as it produces and falls into the same category - a waste of time and precious energy .
You are converting Gold ( nat gas ) to Lead ( ethanol - anecdote borrowed from Matt Simmons ) .
As a guiding beacon if the eroei of an energy producing system is less than 7 then it must be ignored .
It does not produce sufficient net energy to run society - and so pursuing the twin follies of H and ethanol will drag Europe off the net energy cliff .
In essence what you have done in this blog entry is to re-package the wholly misguided EU energy policy that is predicated on climate change and trying now to sell this rubbish as a solution to the emerging energy crisis .
From here there are two ways forward .
You either have to admit that the current energy policy is a shambolic mess , tear it up and start over - but this needs to be done urgently , within a matter of months .
Or you need to resign and let someone else do this vital job .

Will Obama 's Vow to Fight Clean Hurt Him ?
Barack Obama has vowed to take the high road , but that might become a liability .
March 7 , 2008  --
Words could come back to haunt Barack Obama .
Not " monster , " the insult that political adviser Samantha Power lobbed at Hillary Clinton , which forced Power 's embarrassing resignation Friday .
Rather , Obama 's oft - stated promise to take the high road during the campaign could become a liability as his duel with Clinton intensifies in the next few weeks and months , say political pundits .
Last December , Obama said he " did not want to see research that is involved in trying to tear people down personally .
If I found out that somebody is doing that , they will be fired .
And I have been absolutely crystal clear about this , and I have been clear about this for a very long time . "
That vow leaves him in a difficult position :
If Obama goes on the attack , he could be accused of hypocrisy ; if he remains above the fray , he could be overrun by attacks and appear weak , much like John Kerry was hurt by taking too long to respond to attack ads from the Swift Boat veterans .
" For him , the trick is going to be to find a way to make a contrast [ between Obama and Clinton ] in a way that is grounded in hope , " says Democratic strategist Steve McMahon .
" He has to figure it out in a way that is more consistent with the tone of his campaign .
When your campaign is grounded in changing politics , you do n't have quite as much room to operate . "
Since Tuesday night 's election results in which Clinton won crucial votes , with her television ad featuring sleeping children and a red phone ringing in the middle of the night likely contributing to her win , Obama has ramped up his attacks .
His aides accused Clinton of choosing to " align herself with Sen. McCain , " and adviser Susan Rice said it 's not possible to gain national security experience " merely by being married to a commander in chief . "
Yet Obama maintains he wo n't give up his promise to fight clean , telling reporters Tuesday night that he would not " change the tone of our campaign " or " do things that I 'm not comfortable with . "
That vow , exemplified by his campaign 's decision to accept Power 's resignation , may hurt him against the Clintons , who have plenty of experience on both sides of a dirty fight , says Si Sheppard , professor of political science at Boston University .
" He 's trying to maintain his position that this is a campaign of ideas , and setting the bar high for his team but that may give her the initiative .
Look at Michael Dukakis .
His political mastermind John Sasso was held accountable for negative campaigning , and was forced to dump him and that hurt him because Sasso was quite savvy . "
The Clinton campaign has also asked some campaign allies to step down when their personal attacks went over the line : New Hampshire state chairman Billy Shaheen noted Obama 's drug use as a teenager and two Iowa field organizers who sent out e-mails falsely claiming that Obama was a Muslim .
Yet her campaign did not punish fundraiser Bob Johnson , who also referred to Obama 's drug use .
Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson denied any contradiction , telling reporters in a conference call that Johnson " is a supporter of ours , but he is not a senior policy adviser . … I do n't mean to minimize his importance .
But he is not part of the daily campaign life in the way that Samantha Power has been . "
The uproar over Power 's comment and the anguished discussions about negativity in the campaign are unique to American politics when compared with other countries , where acid - tongued lawmakers hurl insults and punches at one another with impunity , says Sheppard .
" Those kinds of insults are par for the course in other countries , " he says .
" Australians are the most notorious .
One prime minister , Paul Keating , referred to his opponents as perfumed gigolos .
During a British parliamentary debate , someone was called a semi- house - trained pole cat .
And New Zealand 's former prime minister David Lange once referred to a union boss as " like Muamar Qadaffi except without the ethnic charm . "
And American politics in the 19th century was just as down and dirty .
" He 's nothing more than a well - meaning baboon , " Gen. George B. McClellan once said about Abraham Lincoln .
Sheppard says that political discourse seemed to de-escalate in the post - World War II era , after the contentious McCarthy hearings .
" Candidates seem to maintain a mutually assured destruction pact and leave it to their advisers to engage in whispering campaigns . "
As for Obama , Sheppard predicts that he will maintain the high road because it's in his interest .
" He 's established his reputation in that manner , " he says .
" If he starts changing , his character will be questioned . "
But what 's been largely overlooked is Paul 's candidacy as a reflection of a powerful lingering dissatisfaction with the Arizona senator among the party 's most conservative conservatives .
As anticipated in late March in The Ticket , that situation could be exacerbated by today 's expected announcement from former Republican Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia for the Libertarian Party 's presidential nod , a slot held by Paul in 1988 .
Paul 's presidential candidacy has been correctly dismissed all along in terms of winning the nomination .
He was even excluded as irrelevant by Fox News from a nationally - televised GOP debate in New Hampshire .
But in the m eantime , quietly , largely under the radar of most people , the forces of Rep.
Ron Paul have been organizing across the country to stage an embarrassing public revolt against Sen.
John McCain when Republicans gather for their national convention in Minnesota at the beginning of September .
Virtually all the nation 's political attention in recent weeks has focused on the compelling state - by - state presidential nomination struggle between two Democrats and the potential for party - splitting strife over there .
... potentially damaging internal splits that could cripple their chances for victory in a narrow vote on Nov. 4 .
Just take a look at recent Republican primary results , largely overlooked because McCain locked up the necessary 1,191 delegates long ago .
In Indiana , McCain got 77 % of the recent Republican primary vote , Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney , who 've each long ago quit and endorsed McCain , still got 10 % and 5 % respectively , while Paul took 8 % .
On the same May 6 in North Carolina , McCain received less than three - quarters of Republican votes ( 74 % ) , while Huckabee got 12 % , Paul 7 % and Alan Keyes and No Preference took a total of 7 % .
Pennsylvania was even slightly worse for the GOP 's presumptive nominee , who got only 73 % to a combined 27 % for Paul ( 16 % ) and Huckabee ( 11 % ) .
As Politico.com 's Jonathan Martin noted recently , at least some of these results are temporary protest votes in meaningless primaries built on lingering affection for Huckabee and suspicion of McCain .
Given the long - since settled GOP race , thousands of other Republicans in these states , who might have put up with a McCain vote , crossed over to vote in the more exciting Democratic primaries , on their own for Sen .
Barack Obama or at the urging of talk - show host Rush Limbaugh , who sought to support Hillary Clinton and prolong Democratic bloodletting .
According to a recent Boston Globe tally , Paul has a grand total of 19 Republican delegates to Romney 's 260 , Huckabee 's 286 and McCain 's 1,413 .
In the last three months , Paul 's forces , who donated $ 34.5 million to his White House effort and upward of a million total votes , have , as The Ticket has noted , been fighting a series of guerrilla battles with party establishment officials at county and state conventions from Washington and Missouri to Maine and Mississippi .
Their goal : to take control of local committees , boost their delegate totals and influence platform debates .
Paul , for instance , favors a drastically reduced federal go vernment , abolishing the Federal Reserve , ending the Iraq war immediately and withdrawing U.S. troops from abroad .
They hope to demonstrate their disagreements with McCain vocally at the convention through platform fights and an attempt to get Paul a prominent speaking slot .
Paul , who 's running unopposed in his home Texas district for an 11th House term , still has some $ 5 million in war funds and has instructed his followers that their struggle is not about a single election , but a long - term revolution for control of the Republican Party .
So eager are they to follow their leader 's words , that Paul 's supporters have driven his new book , " The Revolution : A Manifesto , " to the top of several bestseller lists .
While Paul has consistently refused a third - party bid , he has vowed not to endorse McCain , a refusal mirrored by hundreds of his supporters who have left comments on The Ticket in recent weeks .
And , no doubt , they 'll flock back here today to spread the gospel below .

Tech researchers find human virus in chimpanzees

After studying chimpanzees in the wilds of Tanzania 's Mahale Mountains National Park for the past year as part of a National Science Foundation ( NSF ) grant , Virginia Tech researcher Dr. Taranjit Kaur and her team have produced powerful scientific evidence that chimpanzees are becoming sick from viral infectious diseases they have likely contracted from humans .
In an article to be published in the August issue ( available on - line in June ) of the American Journal of Primatology featuring a special section on " Disease Transmission , Ecosystems Health and Great Apes Research , " Dr. Kaur , an assistant professor in the Virginia - Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine 's Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology at Virginia Tech , will report the results of extensive field studies conducted in the jungles of Africa .
The journal article will present data from molecular , microscopic and epidemiological investigations that demonstrate how the chimpanzees living at Mahale Mountains National Park have been suffering from a respiratory disease that is likely caused by a variant of a human paramyxovirus .
The work complements and validates work published in a recent edition of Current Biology by investigators from European research institutes that describes evidence of human viruses in deceased chimpanzees found in West Africa 's Taï Forest .
The Mahale Mountains National Park 's free - ranging , " human - habituated " chimpanzee population provides excellent opportunities for scientists and tourists alike to study and view chimpanzees , the closest genetic relative of humans , in their natural habitat , Kaur said .
" Although evidence increasingly suggests that infectious diseases may be transmitted from research teams and eco-tourists to endangered great apes , we believe that this is still a bit of a leap and more research must be conducted in order to establish a comfortable level of proof , " said Kaur who has been unraveling the mystery in collaboration with scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and researchers from Japan who are conducting behavioral studies on Mahale chimpanzees .
" Exactly where this virus has come from and the specific route of transmission remains unclear at this time , " said Kaur , but she admits that mounting evidence suggests a linkage between visiting scientists and tourists and the viruses that are threatening the endangered chimpanzee population .
Scientific establishment of that linkage could affect the eco-tourism industry , which is an important source of economic development in the region and has been credited with protecting the animals from poachers and the dangers of shrinking habitats for chimpanzees and other species of great apes .
She believes more research must be conducted in order to protect the region through science - based changes and interventions .
Contributing to the efficacy of Kaur 's scientific work is her background as a veterinarian who is board - certified by the American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine and her expertise in public health .
" In the past , investigators have been bringing parts of the natural world into the laboratory for scientific study , " she said .
" Now we can bring the expertise and rigor of the laboratory into the natural world . "
The researchers can do that because of the development and deployment of an innovative , eco-friendly field laboratory called " PLUG , " which is an acronym for " portable laboratory on uncommon ground . "
After Kaur 's husband and research partner , Dr. Jatinder Singh , a research assistant professor and molecular biologist , expressed frustration over " trying to conduct space - age science with stone - age tools at geographically remote study sites , " the pair collaborated with Virginia Tech 's College of Architecture and Urban Studies ( CAUS ) to develop a prototype field laboratory .
Working with Matt Lutz of CAUS and a team of university students , using " biomimicry " as the initial design direction , and incorporating state - of - the - art environmental technology to model the adaptability found in living organisms , the PLUG was born .
The field laboratory weighs much less than a ton and can be assembled and disassembled in only a few hours by as few as two people using no tools .
PLUG was field - tested in March 2007 then packaged for transatlantic shipment where further ' in - situ ' testing has been conducted at Mahale Mountains National Park .
The PLUG has become an integral part of the base station where Kaur , Singh , and their four - year old daughter have been living in western Tanzania on the shores of Lake Tanganyika , the second deepest lake in the world , as part of a broader research project that seeks to establish a long - term health - monitoring program for these endangered great apes .
The project is sponsored through a five - year National Science Foundation CAREER grant awarded to Dr. Kaur in 2003 so she can develop a more " holistic " approach for the integration of technology , research and education through a program called " Bush - to - Base Bioinformatics . "
Kaur and Singh have been working for several years with Tanzania National Parks ( TANAPA ) and Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute ( TAWIRI ) officials on the project that seeks to protect the endangered species .
The family has learned to adjust and function in the bush , where diseases such as malaria and cholera can be contracted , and dangerous creatures like black mambas , crocodiles , leopards , and others must be avoided .
Living in the wild has also encouraged their resourcefulness .
A stubborn warthog kept digging up an area near the PLUG 's external photo- voltaic cables and batteries .
Their solution was to install an automobile alarm .
The loud , piercing voice ordering the marauding warthog to " Step away from the car , step away from the car " every time it disturbed the laboratory seemed to solve the problem .
You can toss your empty soda cans in the recycle bin instead of the garbage , saving energy and reducing landfill .
Or you can wear hemp clothes and drive a hybrid car plastered with bumper stickers requesting the salvation of everything from owls to dust mites .
There are lots of little ways to go green , but if you really want to help save the Earth , you can start by dropping a few pounds .
It 's no secret that obesity has plenty of personal health consequences ; the list of diseases that have been associated with being overweight include higher risk of high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease , stroke and less sex , to name only a few .
But being fat also has consequences for our planet — often in ways we might not expect .
The fact is that lean is green , and larger people leave larger carbon footprints on the world .
A few examples :
Food consumption
There 's an old joke about a mother telling her son to finish the food on his plate because there are starving children in Africa .
The smart - aleck 's response is , " Got a stamp ? "
What 's not a joke is that there is a finite amount of food in the world , and it is growing scarce .
Recent food riots Haiti , Sudan , Yemen , Mexico , Egypt , and other countries are a stark reminder that many people do not have enough to eat .
The cost of staple foods such as corn , rice , and wheat are at record highs across the globe , and some can't afford to feed their families .
Meanwhile in the United States , obesity is at an all - time high ; two - thirds of adults in the Land of Plenty are overweight or obese .
Obesity is perhaps the ultimate symbol of resource consumption ; it 's visible proof that overweight people already has more than they need — and take more anyway .
The causes of food shortages are varied and complex , but if Americans simply ate less food , there would be more for the rest of world .
By some estimates , the average American consumes about 4,000 calories per day ; that 's twice what they need .
Those 2,000 fewer calories would be available for those who truly need the food , and help to conserve Earth 's natural resources .
Air pollution
Overweight people create more air pollution than thin people do .
It 's simple physics : Extra pounds translate into extra fuel in automobiles and airplanes .
Extra fuel means increased energy usage , oil drilling , and air pollution .
A 2004 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that for every ten pounds gained by the average American , airlines burned 350 million more gallons of fuel to carry the additional weight .
That fuel spewed an estimated 3.8 million extra tons of carbon dioxide into the air .
And as for that smaller hybrid car ?
It 's a good start , but there 's not much point in buying fuel - efficient vehicles if you 're going to fill that large seat with your extra - large butt ; you might as well throw a few sandbags in the trunk .
Fuel efficiency drops dramatically with more weight the engine has to pull ; the lighter you are , the less gas you burn , the more money you save , and the less pollution you emit .
Of course , going green by going lean is easier said than done , and only part of the problem .
But by getting ourselves healthier we also help save the planet .
Not a bad deal .

Pictionary played online is a quick way to fritter away a few hours of your life trying to figure out random people ’s scribblings in a harried state .
Isketch and Xsketch are two flash games that lets you play pictionary in real time against other people on the web .
The premise of the pictionary is simple , you watch as somebody tries to draw a word thats hidden from your view and be the first to guess what they are trying to draw , when your turn comes around , you will be asked to draw while everybody else tries to guess .
Isketch and Xsketch spins this familiar family game to the online world each with its own spin on the point system and gameplay .
Isketch is a friendlier game and you can start playing almost immediately .
During the game it provides hints as each round progresses and has multiple winners .
Collect more points for getting it first or early .
Xsketch has a point system that you win with each successful round .
The more points you have , the higher ranking you get , and you qualify to play on higher levels , which gives you more opportunities to win larger points with each round .
Similar to a poker table , each player has to ‘ ante ’ up points to play .
The drawer also puts up a sizable chunk of points for the other players to win .
If you are the first to guess the word , you win the pot .
Additionally , if you were the drawer , you win the amount that you put up .
This point system provides a more tension filled environment since every round will cost you points .
They allow you to purchase points to help you get started and be qualified to play the higher rounds immediately , this is not necessary nor required to play the game .
I prefer isketch .net because of its simplicity and ease of use .
The interface is much more friendlier and cleaner .
That whole soliciting ( albiet optional ) pay - for - points of xsketch turned me off .
The Interwebs should be freeeee !

Motorcycles and scooters are an appealing alternative to shelling out big bucks filling up the family truckster , which is one reason sales are going through the roof .
But riding on two wheels may not be any more environmentally responsible than riding on four .
Turns out the average motorcycle is 10 times more polluting per mile than a passenger car , light truck or SUV .
It seems counter - intuitive , because motorcycles are about twice as fuel - efficient as cars and emit a lot less C02 .
So what gives ?
Susan Carpenter lays it all out in a Los Angeles Times column .
She found that , although motorcycles and scooters comprise 3.6 percent of registered vehicles in California and 1 percent of vehicle miles traveled , they account for 10 percent of passenger vehicles ' smog - forming emissions .
Motorcycle engines are twice as efficient as automobile engines , she notes , so they generally emit less carbon dioxide .
But they emit large amounts of nitrogen oxides , which along with hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are measured by state and federal air quality regulators to determine whether vehicles meet emissions rules .
Catalytic converters and other emissions control devices would clean things up , but they 're often too big , too heavy or too hot to install on motorcycles .
For that reason and others that Carpenter outlines in the column , the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board are more lenient when it comes to motorcycle emissions .
" The emissions picture [ for motorcycles ] is pretty grim , " she quotes John Swanton of the Air Resources Board saying , " but we think it 's fair for where motorcycles are today . "

More than 110,000 " problem families " with disruptive youngsters will be targeted as part of a crackdown on knife crime , Gordon Brown has said .
They will get parenting supervision , with the worst 20,000 families facing eviction if they do not respond .
The prime minister , who backed more curfews for young people , aimed to make it " unacceptable " to carry a knife Meanwhile the home secretary denied she wanted to make youngsters caught with knives visit stab victims in hospital .
' Wholesale retreat ' Conservative leader David Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live : " I 'm completely baffled .
Over the weekend we were told by the government that knife criminals were going to be taken to accident and emergency departments .
" It sounded like a gimmick ...
Now they [ ministers ] are in wholesale retreat . "
Ms Smith insisted she had been talking at the weekend about " knife referral schemes " - where young people caught with knives would " face up to the consequences of their actions " , including " graphic " weapons awareness workshops and visits to hospitals to talk to health workers to hear about the impact of knife wounds .
" We are not , and I have never said we are , proposing to bring young people into wards to see patients , " she added .
The concept that you have been stabbed and you are in hospital and you are going to be visited by knife criminals - they have n't thought it through
David Cameron
Conservative leader
Hospital visits ' a soft option ' Earlier Mr Brown used his monthly news conference to defend the government 's plans for tackling knife crime in England and Wales .
Mr Brown said the measures would focus on " prevention , enforcement and punishment " .
The prime minister also urged more councils to impose night - time curfews for teenagers " where there is a problem " .
" What I want to see is anybody who is using a knife goes to prison .
Anybody who is carrying a knife is subject to either prison or a strong community payback that forces them to give service to the community , " he said .

" These are the types of sentences that young people must know will be applied against them .
There is in all cases a presumption to prosecute . "
He said stop and search powers would be increased , with more visible policing and 110,000 " problem " families with " disruptive young people " would be dealt with .
These are children who have either been excluded from school , been in trouble with the law or identified as likely to be in trouble later on , Mr Brown said .
' Tougher action ' Parents will be put on intensive courses to help them supervise their children .
There will be more " community pay back sentences " , where young offenders have to " pay back for doing wrong " , with communities choosing penalties such as cleaning streets on a Friday or Saturday night or clearing up graffiti .

Mr Brown said he also backed plans for a roll - out of curfews for children by councils trying to tackle anti-social behaviour .
According to the British Crime Survey ( BCS ) , overall violent crime has decreased by 41 % since a peak in 1995 .
Knives are used in about 8 % of violent incidents , according to the BCS , a level that has largely remained the same during the past decade .
The home secretary told MPs people caught carrying knives were now three times more likely to end up in custody - and to get a longer sentence .
But the BCS figures do not include under - 16s , something which Ms Smith recently announced would change .
Discipline
The government 's measures , overseen by Alf Hitchcock who is deputy assistant commissioner for Scotland Yard , will focus on eight police areas including London , the West Midlands , Greater Manchester , Merseyside , Lancashire , Essex and the Thames Valley .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Is it seriously suggested that they be abandoned to live on the streets ?
Or is it more likely that another local authority will have to find emergency accommodation for them ?
Jacques Francis , Westcott Mr Hitchcock told the Daily Mail a non-military version of national service could include helping vulnerable people and volunteering overseas .
He said most young people were not " beyond the pale " but had been " let down " and it was now time to give them the " hope they deserve " as well as a sense of " responsibility and achievement - and some discipline " .
Conservative leader David Cameron said the measure was an example of " jumbled up ideas " .
" The concept that you have been stabbed and you are in hospital and you are going to be visited by knife criminals - they have n't thought it through , " he said .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne described Ms Smith 's knife crime plans as " half - baked " , and said the government had been in denial about the scale of the knife crime problem .

He has a national reputation for a brilliant legal mind and has developed a reputation as a champion of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and expression .

The dating project , in one of the largest studies of its kind , has shown that the country was not visited by humans over 2000 years ago , as some previous research suggests .
An international team of researchers , led by Dr Janet Wilmshurst from Landcare Research , spent 4 years on the project which shows conclusively that the earliest evidence for human colonisation is about 1280 - 1300 AD , and no earlier .
They based their results on new radiocarbon dating of Pacific rat bones and rat - gnawed seeds .
Their results do not support previous radiocarbon dating of Pacific rat bones which implied a much earlier human contact about 200 BC .
The original old rat bones dates have been hotly debated ever since they were published in Nature in 1996 .
The ages are controversial because there is no supporting ecological or archaeological evidence for the presence of kiore or humans until 1280 - 1300 AD and the reliability of the bone dating has been questioned .
This is the first time that the actual sites involved in the original study have been re-excavated and analyzed .
Dr Wilmshurst and her team researchers re-excavated and re-dated bones from nearly all of the previously investigated sites .
All of their new radiocarbon dates on kiore bones are no older than 1280 AD .
This is consistent with other evidence from the oldest dated archaeological sites , Maori whakapapa , widespread forest clearance by fire and a decline in the population of marine and land - based fauna .
“ As the Pacific rat or kiore cannot swim very far , it can only have arrived in New Zealand with people on board their canoes , either as cargo or stowaways .
Therefore , the earliest evidence of the Pacific rat in New Zealand must indicate the arrival of people ” Dr Wilmshurst said .
The dating of the rat bones was also supported by the dating of over a hundred woody seeds , many of which had distinctive tell - tale rat bite marks , preserved in peat and swamp sites from the North and South Islands .
advertisement
“ These rat - gnawed seeds provide strong additional evidence for the arrival of rats , and therefore humans , and are an indirect way of testing the veracity of the dates we have done on rat bones , ” said Dr Tom Higham , Deputy Director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at Oxford University .
Rats leave rows of narrow grooves or bite marks on woody seed cases when they gnaw open the seed , and these distinctive teeth marks can be seen with the naked eye .
“ The width of the teeth marks left on the woody seeds exactly match those of a rat's two front teeth , and can not be mistaken for any other seed predator .
We have dated over 100 individual seeds , some rat - gnawed , others intact or bird - cracked , which show that rat gnawed seeds only occur in both the North and South Islands of New Zealand after about 1280 AD ” , Dr Wilmshurst said .
With over 165 dates on seeds and bones from a large number of sites , the overwhelming evidence suggests that rats and their human carriers did not reach New Zealand until about 1280 AD .
“ The earliest dates for rat and human arrival are strikingly consistent with the oldest dates from archaeological sites , the first large clearances of forest by fire , and declines or extinctions of marine and land - based fauna .
It now seems certain that the first M ori settlers arrived in New Zealand sometime about 1280 AD .
The consistent picture emerging now is that settlement was much later than the old rat bone dates led many people to believe ” said Professor Atholl Anderson , from the Australian National University .
This age has several important implications ; firstly rat predation only began after 1280 which is much shorter period than previously implied and makes the risk to currently declining populations of rat- sensitive species more pressing as they could be diminishing faster than previously assumed .
Secondly , colonisation did not involve a protracted delay between initial discovery and subsequent colonisation , an idea implicit in earlier theories .
The first people arriving in New Zealand from tropical east Polynesia initiated an immediate and rapid transformation .
“ A precise date for the arrival of the rat helps us to fully understand both the history of human settlement and the past and present ecological impacts of kiore on native fauna and flora .
It also allows the human settlement of New Zealand to be placed more accurately in the context of the broader settlement pattern of East Polynesia ” Dr Wilmshurst said .
Dr Wilmshurst and her colleagues are now turning their attention to other islands in East Polynesia where similar controversies exist over the timing of initial human settlement .
Dates on rat - gnawed seeds and rat bones are likely to be just as helpful in resolving controversies on other Pacific islands where rats were also introduced prehistorically .
John McCain has set off a firestorm by suggesting that the timing of the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq is " not too important . "
What is important , he said , are the casualties in Iraq , pointing to long - term US troop presence in Japan , South Korea , and Germany .
He should be commended for his " straight talk " in articulating what he believes , despite its unpopularity .
But Senator McCain has yet to give the American people clear answers to three fundamental questions :
What , exactly , are the political objectives of keeping large numbers of American soldiers in Iraq for years to come ?
What plausible outcome would benefit the United States enough to justify the wrenching costs of achieving those objectives ?
And what , concretely , is the strategy for getting there ?
McCain may genuinely believe there is still a political objective , albeit a far more modest one than President Bush and the war 's supporters originally articulated , that can justify the sacrifice of still more American lives and treasure .
But if he can't do better than slogans such as " winning " and " stability , " it 's hard to avoid the conclusion that such an objective simply does n't exist .
And in that case , we can add one more exorbitant cost to the war 's bill : the death of strategy .
Carl von Clausewitz famously explained that war is simply a continuation of policy by other means .
Distasteful as that might seem , it has the virtue of ruling out wars that have no defined political objective .
Writing under the shadow of the political upheavals resulting from the Napoleonic wars , the Prussian strategist understood that war is inherently political , and not merely a technical and mechanical confrontation between armies .
As such , " victory " cannot be defined solely by the body count of the enemy .
McCain , who fought in a conflict the US lost despite defeating the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army in every battle of military consequence , should instinctively appreciate Clausewitz 's insight .
Instead , McCain , Bush and many leading Republicans chide Barack Obama and fellow Democrats for refusing to concede that the US is now " winning " in Iraq .
But in their focus on tactical - level progress – military fatalities and sectarian killings are down , and pacified neighborhoods are up – they duck the more fundamental question :
What larger strategic and political objectives are being served ?
" Stability " is hardly a worthy political objective for the sacrifices US soldiers and taxpayers continue to make in Iraq .
From an American perspective , stability matters only if its terms are consistent with the US national interest ; stability for its own sake is meaningless .
Just what type of newly " stable " Iraq can emerge under the protection of American forces ?
There are several possibilities .
The first is that after the " moderate " Sunni Arabs ( including Saddam Hussein 's former henchmen ) wipe out Al Qaeda , and after the Shiite establishment consolidates supremacy on its side of the sectarian divide , there will be an Iraqi civil war .
Like other civil wars , it will end , after months , years , or decades , either in compromise , the decimation of one side , or partition .
Another possibility is that the Arab Iraqis will reach some kind of compromise so as to focus their energies on destroying the US - backed Kurdish statelet and blocking Turkish inroads into northern Iraq .
Most likely , the Shiite Arab forces will retain control of most or all of Mesopotamia .
Though historical animosities between Arabs and Persians are strong , even among Shiites , such an Iraqi government will probably continue to be penetrated by Iranian agents of influence and tilt toward Tehran .
Which of these plausible outcomes is a worthy political objective that could justify even a reduced level of American deaths , further damage to US global standing , and continued deferral of attention to other pressing challenges ?
Some will argue that the simple fact of planting democracy in Iraq – assuming it could be achieved in one of the above scenarios – would suffice as a political objective calling for further American sacrifice .
But with the experience of democratic elections in the Palestinian territories , and even to some extent in Iran , can we reasonably expect that an Iraqi democracy without the presence of American troops would respect individual rights and be friendly to the US ?
On the campaign trail this summer , McCain may be right in repeating his hope that the US will win the Iraq war by 2013 .
The question we should be asking him is this :
Win what ?

Andy Zelleke is a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and codirector of its Center for Public Leadership .
The energy produced by power plants that provide both heat and electricity could be almost tripled in the UK , according to an analysis of nine industrial sites .
So - called combined heat and power ( CHP ) plants are far more efficient than conventional power stations because they harness heat that is normally wasted , by piping it to industrial or domestic users .
The report was written by Pöyry Energy Consulting for Greenpeace , and the additional CHP energy generation it suggests is feasible on the nine sites is equivalent to the energy needs of more than two - thirds of UK homes and half the nation 's natural gas imports .
Currently 5.5GW of electricity is produced by CHP plants , but the new report suggests there could be up to 16GW more , the equivalent of 8 nuclear power stations .
The sites included clusters around Grangemouth in Scotland and in the Humber .
The latter area already has the largest CHP site in Europe , producing 730 MW of electricty .
The report suggests an additional 2,550 MW could be produced there .
Building CHP stations near industrial sites means that the heat can be piped into factories or buildings as high pressure steam or hot water .
Greenpeace said that the increased efficiency would reduce the UK 's carbon dioxide emissions by 10 m tonnes a year .
Tim Warham , principal consultant at Pöyry , said : " We were surprised at the large technical potential for industrial combined heat and power we encountered .
Provided the policy framework is right , CHP could make a huge contribution to securing power supplies for UK . "
John Sauven , Greenpeace executive director , said : " Energy technologies like industrial - scale CHP beat nuclear and old - style coal plants on every front .
They 're cheaper , they 're much quicker to construct , they 'll cut more carbon emissions , they could halve gas imports and they wo n't leave behind an expensive radioactive legacy . "
He added that heat was key because it accounted for 49 % of the UK 's final energy demand , compared to just 17 % for electricity .
Greenpeace says that CHP had been neglected in the UK as part of the energy mix , noting that the Netherlands and Denmark are 40 % powered by CHP .
The government recently held a consultation on a heat strategy for the UK and is expected to publish its results later this year .
A spokesperson for the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform said on Thursday : " The government recognises the benefits of the combined production of heat and power .
Our target is to install 10 GW of electricity of good quality CHP by 2010 and with current generation from CHP at 5.5GW , we 're over halfway there . "
At the launch of the report , Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , is expected to highlight the record high prices of oil and gas , saying these have brought the UK 's energy crisis into focus .
He will say that CHP makes both environmental and economical sense .
" The political debate to address this crisis is at a crossroads : do we stick with old centralised technologies like nuclear power or should we instead be investing in efficient localised energy production and usage ? "
Graham Meeks , director of the Combined Heat and Power Association , warned : " Without effective and enduring incentives to make these investments , the fact remains that our next generation of power stations will simply replicate the failings of the past and continue with a needless waste of valuable heat .
It really is time to stop fiddling as gas burns . "
How is it that a statement by the Vatican has delayed my annual report to the National Institutes of Health ?
Not being Catholic , I generally do n't pay much attention to Papal announcements , but maybe I need to start listening .
Apparently back in March , the Vatican suggested that " genetic manipulations which alter DNA " are mortal sins .
Since just about everything I do in the lab involves genetic manipulations which alter DNA ( in fact the only organisms in our lab which are n't genetically engineered are the people who work there ) , I can add one more item to my long list of reasons for why I 'm headed to eternal condemnation .
But before I get to Hell , I need to submit my annual NIH Fellowship update .
I have a fellowship from the National Institutes of Health , which pays my not - so - large salary .
In return for the money , I tell the NIH what I 've been doing every year .
That 's fair enough - the NIH should expect something for their money .
Everything that I have done this year , however , has involved some sort of genetic engineering - which apparently upsets the Pope .
This is unfortunate , because if we eliminated all genetic engineering , essentially all biomedical research would grind to a halt .
Genetic engineering , in some restricted applications , has its risks , but the vast majority of genetic engineering that goes on every day in thousands of labs all over the world is essential to our efforts to understand both basic biology and the impact of genes on our health .
How do we get from the Vatican to my NIH progress report ?
It starts with the fact that in order to receive money from the NIH , I have to comply with NIH guidelines concerning recombinant DNA .
Recombinant DNA is a fairly uninformative , non-specific term that essentially means genetic engineering using the techniques of modern molecular biology .
This includes cutting and pasting pieces of DNA together , and putting them into different organisms - such as taking a human gene and putting into bacteria .
Back when recombinant DNA work was still new , people became worried that scientists might be about to unleash a new plague on humanity in the form of genetically engineered super - organisms .
The concern led to the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA , which produced a set of recommendations detailing what types of genetic engineering experiments are acceptable .
Thirty years later , worries about this recombinant DNA work in standard laboratory organisms proved unfounded .
There are unquestionably some nasty things you can do with recombinant DNA - making an antibiotic resistant strain of anthrax , or putting a cancer - inducing gene into a virus that has the potential to infect humans .
But recombinant DNA work , of a more innocuous kind , has become the essential tool of nearly all biomedical research .
We learn about genes by manipulating them - you really cannot do biochemistry , molecular biology , or molecular genetics today without manipulating genes using recombinant DNA techniques .
To study the function of a human protein , scientists often need large amounts of that protein for test tube experiments .
The best way to get large amounts of human protein is to take that particular human gene and pop it into bacteria .
The bacteria will make gobs of that protein , which biochemists can purify and use in their experiments .
This method is n't limited to research either - pharmaceutical companies make drugs like insulin and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) by producing the protein in bacteria .
People who take insulin for diabetes , or FSH for fertility treatments , are beneficiaries of genetic engineering .
Sequencing the human genome would have been impossible without genetic engineering : to sequence a genome , you have to chop up the DNA in to pieces , and then splice those pieces into DNA carriers called BACs ( Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes ) , which are propagated in bacteria .
We would n't understand the basic process of cell division ( and how that process goes awry in cancer ) without decades of studies in genetically engineered yeast , studies that resulted in a Nobel Prize .
Genetic engineering is not just essential for everyday biology research .
It 's also largely harmless .
Yes , we should think about the ecological implications of genetically engineered crops , and we should put strict controls on recombinant DNA work with pathogenic microbes and viruses , or gene therapy involving human subjects .
But this kind of work is relatively rare compared to the day - to - day genetic engineering that goes on in research labs .
Much of that work involves making genetically engineered model organisms such as a harmless strain of E. coli , baker 's yeast , flies , or worms .
These creatures , in their laboratory forms , are incapable of surviving outside of the coddled environment of the lab .
Producing a new plague by genetically engineering these organisms is about as likely as producing a nuclear bomb by tinkering with fireworks .
But just to be safe , the NIH has a set of lengthy guidelines for working with recombinant DNA .
These guidelines specify experiments that might be dangerous , and require researchers to submit to a stringent approval process before they can do these experiments .
If you want to do recombinant DNA work with viruses that can infect humans , you have to have approval from a university safety committee , and have the appropriate containment equipment .
By far , the vast majority of experiments done in today 's biomedical research labs fall under the category of exempt experiments : experiments which the NIH has deemed harmless enough that they do n't require any special institutional approval to perform - mainly basic manipulation of single genes in harmless microbes , and deleting or modifying native genes in laboratory model organisms like flies and worms .
This kind of low - risk molecular biology is the kind of thing I do - thus on past NIH forms , I have simply been able to list my recombinant DNA work as " exempt " from NIH guidelines , and my university left it at that - there was no special approval process .
That was before the Pope stepped into the issue .
Shortly after the Vatican suggested that genetic engineering is a mortal sin , my university ( not the NIH - just the local university ) eliminated the " exempt " status .
Although my research is still exempt under NIH guidelines , my university now requires everyone who works with recombinant DNA , even the routine , harmless stuff , to submit their research protocols for university approval .
Keep in mind that this new policy does n't actually change any of the research that 's being done - it just adds another layer of pointless bureaucratic paperwork for procedures so basic , that just about about every biological research lab at our University will now have to get specific approval to do the basics in the lab .
This makes about as much sense as requiring restaurants to have not just a license to serve alcohol , but one to serve coffee as well .
Our society worries about genetically modified designer babies , genetically modified crops that contain allergens or put an ecosystem at risk , and genetically engineered biological weapons in the hands of terrorists .
These are all reasonable things to worry about , but we have to recognize that these scenarios are just the extreme end of the things we can do with genetic engineering .
When the Vatican , or any other influential institution , makes vague and ill - considered statements about genetic engineering , the response should not be more bureaucracy to cover up what almost all biologists do .
Instead , the science community should explain how genetic engineering benefits us all .
Gosh , darn !
It happened again !
Another McCain supporter gets so worked up about their candidate that in the heat of the moment nonsense like this just innocently bubbles up .

The world 's most advanced , commercially available , bionic hand has clinched the UK 's top engineering prize .
The i-LIMB , a prosthetic device with five individually powered digits , beat three other finalists to win this year 's MacRobert award .
The technology has been fitted to more than 200 people , including US soldiers who lost limbs during the war in Iraq .
The device started life in Scotland in 1963 as part of a project to help children affected by Thalidomide .
The complex device finally went on sale in July 2007 .
It is produced by a company called Touch Bionics based in Mid Calder , Livingston .
See how the hand works " It 's such a fantastic invention , " Ray Edwards , a quadruple amputee and one of the first people in the UK to be fitted with the device , told BBC News .
" When the arm was put on , I had tears rolling down my face .
It was the first time in 21 years that I had seen a hand open .
" I can do a thumbs - up , I can hold a pen and I can do many things that I could n't do before . "
' World first '
The technology beat off three competitors to claim the Royal Academy of Engineering award at a ceremony in London .
The other finalists included a robotic system designed to care for millions of biological samples in sub-zero temperatures ; a chemical sensor which could detect early stages of disease and a compact soot filter for diesel cars .
Psychologically , it has been the greatest thing .
Physically , it 's hard to get things moving again .
Ray Edwards
" Touch Bionics have fundamentally changed the benchmark for what constitutes an acceptable prosthesis , " said Dr Geoff Robinson , chairman of the MacRobert Award Judging Panel .
" Having tried it myself , I can vouch for the fact that it really does work in the way portrayed , even if one is fortunate enough to still have one 's own real hand alongside . "
The i-LIMB hand has advanced a concept first outlined by NHS researchers .
" The hand has two main unique features , " explained Stuart Mead , CEO of Touch Bionics .
" The first is that we put a motor into each finger , which means that each finger is independently driven and can articulate .
" The second is that the thumb is rotatable through 90 degrees , in the same way as our thumbs are .
" The hand is the first prosthetic hand that replicates both the form and the function of the human hand . "
Other companies and organisations , such as the US space agency ( Nasa ) and the country 's military research arm , Darpa , have developed more advanced hands .
" All of those are laboratory - based - ours is commercially available , " said Mr Mead .
The hand does not require surgery to be fitted to the patient 's stump , according to Mr Mead .
" There are two electrodes that sit on the skin that pick up myoelectric signals , " he explained .
These impulses are created by the contraction of muscle fibres in the body .
" They are used by the computer in the back of the hand , which does two things : it interprets those signals and it controls the hand , " he told BBC News .
The prosthetics have been fitted to more than 200 patients around the world , including Mr Edwards who is CEO of the Limbless Association .
" I 'd love to get another one , " he said .
" Psychologically , it has been the greatest thing .
Physically , it 's hard to get things moving again . "
Mr Edwards likened wearing the hand to " carrying a brick " .
However , he said , the benefits far outweighed any negatives .
" I 'm very fortunate , " he said .
The firm is now looking to improve the design of the i-Limb as well as expanding its range of smart prosthetics .
" We are working a full - arm system - we have a prototype wrist , elbow and shoulder , " said Mr Mead .
The i-LIMB will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 12 June .

What are these ?
Google 's Partnership with Communist China and the Censorship of Search Results
Is Google working against the People ?
Who 's on the advisory board of Google Health ?
Reinforcing the illusion of disease
How Google further protects Big Pharma
Do we really need Google Health anyway ?
The most shameful Google project yet
I 'm going to build a better health database than Google
( Natural News ) Google Health was launched with much fanfare this week , positioned by Google , Inc. as a technological solution to the rather embarrassing problem of an advanced nation still running on medical records that seem to be stuck in 1970 's - era technology .
The Google Health service promises to give users a free , central storehouse for all their medical records , providing a convenient way to share medical histories with doctors , insurance companies and other primary health care players .
But is Google Health secure ?
And is the company behind it guaranteed to protect your privacy ?
In this review , NaturalNews takes a critical look at Google Health and examines several areas of increasing concern .
Let 's start by looking at the first area of concern : Consumer privacy .
In its terms of service , Google Health openly says it may share a user 's personal health records with the following groups : • Subsidiaries , affiliated companies or other trusted businesses who process personal information for Google . •
The U.S. government , following a request of such information from the government . •
Merger or acquisition partners , if Google sells off its Google Health assets someday .
Under this scenario , Google promises to " provide notice " before personal information is transferred and " becomes subject to a different privacy policy .
"
In other words , under Google 's own terms of service , which you can read at ( http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.... ) , Google could first get a hundred million people to enter their health records under Google Health , thenwhich might have a new privacy policy that eliminates any real right to privacy and gives the new owner of the records the right to sell such records to anyone ( such as drug companies , governments , employers and more ) .
How would you like to find yourself going to a job interview one day , then suddenly finding out you 're denied the job because your potential future employer bought your health records from this third party company that purchased them from Google ?
Although this is certainly not the intention of present - day Google , it remains a disconcerting possibility that 's actually written right into Google 's own privacy policy .
Regardless of whether Google everto someone else , the language of their privacy policy enables them to sell off the Google Health unit -- and all its records -- to any other business , government or individual at any time , with no recourse on your part.under such a scenario .
They become the " property " of the new buyer .
But would Google ever really do such a thing ?
That 's where we take a closer look at the ethics of this company that claims to " do no evil .
"
It is a well known fact that over the last few years , Google openly conspired with the Communist Chinese government to build a custom search engine that would censor freedom - related subjects , eliminating such topics from the search results delivered by Google to the citizens of China .
This campaign of Google - engineered mass censorship was created to keep the Chinese population enslaved by a tyrannical , Communist government regime that believes reading the Bible is a criminal offense , or that meditating in a public place justifies your arrest and prosecution by the Chinese government .
China , you see , does n't want its population to see search engine results on topics like the Dalai Lama , the Tiananmen Square uprising , or even articles that are critical of the current government regime .
And when given an opportunity to engineer a search engine that enforced this " thought crime " censorship across a nation of one billion people , Google jumped right into step with the Chinese Communist government and applied its considerable technical resources to the challenge of figuring out the most efficient way to keep an entire nation enslaved by limiting its ability to engage in the free exchange of ideas .
Thus , Google -- the company that once claimed to " do no evil " -- became the architect of one of the most colossal " Big Brother " projects in the history of the internet :
The creation of a search engine for China that specifically sought to limit freedom , limit access to information , and protect the power base of a corrupt , aging Communist dynasty that feared it might lose its grip on the population if people had open access to the internet .
A search engine is a dangerous thing , did n't you know ?
China thinks it is , anyway .
Google 's " do no evil " slogan slid down that slippery slope of corporate ethics and inevitably became " Do no evil unless there 's money to be made . "
And this company , which openly and willfully conspired with the Chinese government to deny its citizens access to " dangerous " ideas , now wants to hold on to your private health records !
But do n't worry , Google promises it wo n't do anything evil to you .
In its own defense , Google says it 's better to do business with China in the hope that it might be able to influence that nation 's internet censorship policies in the future .
While this initially sounds like a potentially justifiable line of reasoning , it is the same line of reasoning that , throughout the history of human civilization , has been invoked by entrepreneurs and corporations doing business with tyrants .
It 's the same line of reasoning used by the pharmaceutical companies who manufactured Zyklon B gas for Nazi Germany , or who manufactured Depleted Uranium weapons for the U.S. military to use in Iraq .
The very idea of " doing business with evil groups in order to achieve some future good " is actually just a form of self - deception .
No lasting good has ever been produced by cooperating with evil regimes .
( But it sure makes for a slick - sounding spin campaign , does n't it ? )
The disconnect between Google 's " do no evil " slogan and its actual behavior presents us with an interesting form of corporate schizophrenia , or a Jekyl - and - Hyde behavior pattern that hardly lends itself to trust .
Add on to that the fact that Google employs U.S. government spooks ( see http://www.google-watch.org/jobad.html ) and you start to wonder : Just who is Google really working for anyway ?
It already admits that it will turn over your private health records to the U.S. government , if requested , but it fails to detail just what kind of requests it will honor vs. reject .
The turning over of private health records to the government is probably not even a real issue anyway , given that under Big Brother legislation passed since 9/11 , the U.S. government is no doubt already secretly tapping into data feeds from Google .
I have no doubt that user searches , for example , are routinely profiled and searched for keywords that might indicate a " terrorist " is searching for a way to build a bomb ( or whatever ) .
Web pages are probably mined on a regular basis to find hints of terror - related activity , and Google 's famous PageRank technology offers a perfect framework by which web pages of known terrorists can lead investigators to related pages from other potential troublemakers .
There 's simply no question at all in my mind that Google is either knowingly or unknowingly sharing information with the U.S. government right now .
If you 're not familiar with these facts , just read up on the government ' sprogram here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awa...
You 'll soon come to realize that every e-mail , phone call , credit card charge and financial transaction you make is recorded , archived and mined by the federal government as part of their search for whatever group they 're calling the bad guys this year .
Does anyone really believe search engines are n't also part of this illegal domestic surveillance system operated by the government ?
Of course , we can't say for sure whether Google is cooperating with such efforts , but it 's not too difficult to imagine a bunch of dark suits showing up at Google corporate headquarters one day and demanding that back doors be engineered into the search engine archives as a matter of " natural security . "
The simple invocation of " natural security , " it seems , is justification enough for practically any degree of spying on Americans these days .
Google Health is operated with input from an advisory board .
Ever wonder who 's on that board ?
It reads like a who's who of Big Brother freedom haters who run pro-military think tanks , drug company front groups and billion - dollar drug retailers .
Here 's a partial list of who sits on Google Health 's advisory board right now : Research Scientist , RAND Health , RAND Corporation ( a militaristic think tank group involved in numerous covert events of the past several decades ) Executive Vice President , Risk Management , Benefits and Sustainability , Wal - Mart ( one of the country 's largest retailers of harmful prescription drugs ) Former head of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , Health Editor & Columnist , U.S. News & World Report ( a pro-drug rag that rakes in tens of millions of dollars each year from Big Pharma while its ad pages are filled with promotions for toxic medications that kill people ) Chief Operating Officer , The American Medical Association ( AMA ) ( a highly corrupt pharmaceutical front group that has already been found guilty of conspiracy to destroy alternative medicine in U.S. federal courts ) .
Read " How the AMA Got Rich " here : https://www.naturalnews.com/023195.html
Former FDA Commissioner , Vice Chancellor - Medical Affairs & Dean , School of Medicine , UCSF ( as the former head of the FDA , David Kessler led one of the most evil , corrupt and law - breaking government organizations that has ever been created , aside from the CIA , perhaps )
Put all these people together , and what do you get ?
The advisory board for Google Health !
Of course , a few other people sit on the advisory board , and they 're not all bad people , but just the fact that the people listed here are sitting on the Google Health advisory board should make you wonder about the real motive behind such a system .
Google Health , as I see it , is a way to sucker people into a system of disease and ongoing pharmaceutical treatments by creating .
But let me be the first to say this :
An organized list of all the pharmaceuticals a person is taking and all the false diagnoses they have been given by ignorant doctors is no replacement for the real health policies we need in this country if we hope to have a future .
What kind of health policies do we really need ?
The teaching of cancer prevention , the banning of drug advertising , the banning of junk food marketing , the outlawing of toxic food additives , the banning of toxic chemicals in personal care products , the overthrow of the FDA and its ongoing campaign of tyranny and censorship against nutritional supplements , and so on .
Google Health may , indeed , look like a great way to organize health records , but in the end , all it 's doing is lending the illusion of order to a system of medicine that 's based primarily on fraudulent science , harmful chemicals and corporate greed .
Google Health even goes out of its way to reinforce the existence of fictitious diseases and disorders that have no basis in reality .
ADHD , for example , is one of the diseases that can be selected by users of Google Health , which describes it like this : " ADHD is a problem with inattentiveness , over - activity , impulsivity , or a combination . "
It then goes on to provide a " reference page " of information supporting this false disorder , which reads must like a full - page advertisement for the drug companies : https:// www.google.com/health/ref/Attention+Deficit+...
Nowhere does Google Health indicate that the " disorder " is entirely fictitious , or that it was invented by drug companies and corrupt psychiatrists in order to sell amphetamines to children .
( See my article on this topic here : https://www.naturalnews.com/021944.html
Instead , Google Health just perpetuates a cult - like belief in toxic , synthetic chemicals that harm children and now kill at least 100,000 Americans a year .
Thus , just like in China , where Google openly cooperated with the mass censorship of the Chinese population , Google Health is now a program of mass brainwashing for the U.S. population .
It attempts to create the illusion of bringing organization to an industry that 's ultimately based on the motivation to keep people in a state of ongoing degenerative disease so that drug companies can rake in billions of dollars in profits without actually curing anybody .
The entire Google Health interface , in fact , is engineered precisely in a way that reinforces false beliefs about fictitious disease , since many users seeing ADHD appear in a " conditions " list might figure , well gee , if it's on this Google list , it must be real !
The Google Health page goes on to urge readers that children should be subjected to " treatment " that begins with medicating the child .
Finally , this Google Health page goes on to insist that alternative or natural therapies are utterly useless by stating , " Alternative remedies have become quite popular , including herbs , supplements , and chiropractic manipulation .
However , there is little or no solid evidence for many remedies marketed to parents .
" Thus , Google Health has now joined the ranks of all the pro-Pharma drug pushers who are doping up our children on dangerous drugs while calling it " treatment . "
It has become a purveyor of poison ; a promoter of fictitious disease labels and a force that now attempts to discredit nutrition , vitamin D , avoidance of food toxins and other strategies that completely eliminate symptoms of so - called ADHD within just a few weeks .
And remember ; all this is from a company that claims to " do no evil . "
I suppose even George Bush thinks he 's God 's gift to human civilization , too , which just goes to show you that even the most insane , twisted individuals and organizations can easily find ways to justify their destructive behaviors and call them " good . "
( George Bush thinks God told him to invade the Middle East .
Wow .
Too bad nobody ever told him the voices in his head are actually coming from his medication ... ) This is n't the only thing Google has done over the last few years to prop up the pharmaceutical industry .
Try to enter an Adwords ad on the name of any drug , and you 'll be greeted with a screen that declares you can't use such keywords unless you first prove you are a licensed pharmacy .
So my own articles about the dangers of Ritalin , for example , cannot be advertised on Google Adwords because I cannot use the word " Ritalin " in an ad .
This is just one more way in which Google cooperates with powerful corporations to censor information that 's critical about pharmaceuticals , thereby contributing to the ongoing brainwashing of the U.S. population ( it was never limited to China , get it ? ) I do n't mean to say that all Google 's employees are evil people , by the way .
In fact , most Google people are pretty darned cool .
They 're smart , capable and well - meaning .
But as we 've seen in many other cases , a powerful corporation can easily begin to take on a negative role that in no way reflects the individual intentions of the people working there .
Corporations want to get bigger , more powerful and more profitable .
And sadly , most corporations end up compromising their principles in their eagerness to achieve greater size , power and profitability .
But let 's suppose for a moment that Google Health is 100 % private , secure and honest .
Let 's take a trip to imagination land and pretend there 's a zero chance of Google ever selling off that business unit and sharing your private health records .
There 's still a very important question that comes to mind :
Why not just type them into a Word document ?
Is there really any underlying need to go online and enter these records somewhere else ?
And if so , what 's next : Will Google launch " Google Car Repair " that stores your car repair records online ?
Will they launch " Google Resume " where you enter your educational records online ?
There 's really no compelling reason , you see , to enter your personal records online , especially when you want to keep them private .
Just type them into a document at home , and bring a copy with you to the doctor .
Finally , here 's another important point we seem to forget these days in our over - medicated American society : I 've seen people come into local health clinics taking eight , ten or even a dozen different medications all at once !
Neither they , nor their doctors , have any idea whether such cocktail combinations of chemicals are dangerous ( hint : they are ! ) .
They 've never even been tested in such a way .
But you can bet these people are suffering from all kinds of side effects , symptoms and health problems due to the taking of all those medications .
Have you ever met a person taking ten prescription drugs whoOf course not .
They do n't exist .
Pharmaceuticals make people sick , diseased and dysfunctional .
That 's why they 're such profitable business products :
Once you start taking one , you soon need another one , and then another one , until one day you can't sleep , can't poop , ca n't breathe and can't get an erection .
They have pills for all those things , too , which I suppose you can just add to your 5000 - word Google Health medical record that proves you 're a walking bag of Big Pharma chemicals .
Nowhere , by the way , does Google Health warn people that taking so many medications is extremely harmful to the environment ( because those drugs pass right through you and damage aquatic ecosystems ) , and nowhere does Google Health even mention the simple fact that vitamin D can prevent 77 % of all cancers , thereby eliminating the need for hundreds of different drugs and medical labels that are included in their system .
It 's almost as if Google Health was constructed by Big Pharma itself , then licensed to Google .
In all , Google Health is a monumental failure by a company that should frankly know better .
Rather than creating something that helps make the world a better place , Google chose to follow the Big Pharma / conventional medicine lies and disinformation , promoting drugs and fictitious diseases labels as " health . "
In doing so , Google has wasted this monumental opportunity to make a positive difference in the world and has once again reinforced the fact that when it comes to promoting powerful organizations vs. helping real people , Google will side with the rich , powerful corporations and disease organizations .
If Google really wanted to create a useful health technology that could change the world and make a huge difference in the prevention of disease and the quality of life for everyday Americans , they should have invited the top natural health experts to sit on the board and design a system that promoted real health , not fictitious disease .
But alas , they did not .
I searched my mailbox twice and did n't see an invitation [ chuckle ] , and after this article goes live , I sort of doubt I 'll ever see one from Google .
I can tell you this much :
If I had the financial resources and influence of the Google founders , I would n't waste it sitting around on my duff creating useless health databases that promote a mindset of disease and medication .
Instead , I 'd be teaching health , nutrition and disease prevention ( all the things that the Google ADHD page says do n't work , quite hilariously ) .
I 'd be using my money and influence to make the world a better place byinstead of perpetuating a system of diseasification and medication .
In fact , I 've got something to announce right here , right now . , starting right now .
This year , in 2008 , I 'm going to single - handedly build a massive database of natural health knowledge that Google could not accomplish with tens of millions of dollars , and I 'm going to do it for the sole purpose of bringing health freedom and information solutions to the People of our world .
I 'm going to do it from my home office , with no more than a couple of PCs and a single internet connection .
So take this as my official announcement : I 'm going to build what Google could n't -- a massive natural health information database that will be offered free to the public as a way to counter the disinformation being perpetuated by Google Health .
And in doing so , I 'm going to demonstrate that I know exactly what to do to make this a reality , and thanks to nutrition and Mother Nature 's medicine , I have the presence of mind and cognitive function to make this happen .
My project will be powered by superfoods !
( I also happen to have a software engineering background , which might come in quite handy on such a project ... )
Google , watch out .
A one - man operation with deep - rooted compassion for fellow human beings and a genuine healing purpose is about to put your entire Google Health project to shame .
And when it 's done , no , Google you can not buy it from me .
It 's not for sale .
It belongs to the People of our world and will be donated to my non-profit Consumer Wellness Center so that it can remain freely available to the People through the years .
Watch NaturalNews.com for announcements throughout this year about my natural health global electronic library project .
I am also welcoming friendly bets from wealthy Google executives on whether or not I can succeed in building such a project before the end of Calendar year 2008 .
The minimum bet is $ 1 million .

With the tabling of Bill C - 61 in the Canadian Parliament , I ’ve become concerned with the lack of a concise set of “ talking points ” that summarizes the ramifications of the bill in plain language .
This post attempts to capture such a set of talking points for review by the copyfighter community at large .
Keep in mind that this document must provide a rational argument against C - 61 , as a fact - based , non-emotional debate is key to our success in defeating C - 61 .
If you have additional points or comments , please add them in the comments and I ’ll integrate them as appropriate .
This document is designed to provide you with a concise set of talking points to use when educating your friends and informing your Member of Parliament of the wide - reaching ramifications of Bill C - 61 on consumers ’ rights .
What is C - 61 ?
Bill C - 61 is a federal bill that has been introduced in the Canadian House of Parliament by Minister of Industry Jim Prentice and Canadian Heritage Minister Josée Verner to reform the Canadian Copyright Act .
It is designed to , among other things , “ update the rights and protections of copyright owners to better address the Internet , in line with international standards ” , “ permit certain uses for educational and research purposes of Internet and other digital technologies to facilitate technology - enhanced learning , inter-library loans , the delivery of educational material and access to publicly available material on the Internet ” , and “ permit certain uses of copyright material for private purposes ” .
Why is C - 61 bad for Canadians ?
The bill faces criticism for several reasons , including the lack of public consultation on the matter by the government , as well as the appearance that the bill is the result of heavy lobbying by the US media industries to replicate the United States ’ Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) .
In particular , the bill replicates provisions making it illegal to circumvent digital rights management ( DRM ) technologies used to protect copyrighted materials .
The bill is bad for Canadians for a number of reasons :
It reduces your rights : Consumers will continue to be able to use copyrighted materials for research , private study , criticism , review or news reporting , but will no longer have the means to exercise those rights when the copyrighted materials are protected by DRM .
It reduces the usefulness of your media : Consumers will no longer have the right to take commonly purchased physical media , such as DVDs , or downloaded DRM - protected files , such as digital music , and make copies for their personal use .
It forces you to buy media you ’ve already purchased : Consumers will be unable to unlock media they ’ve legally purchased in the past for use on new devices , and hence will be forced to buy the same content again and again .
It makes your devices less useful : Consumers will be able to do less , not more , with new devices they purchase , as many of these device may , at any time , limit the user ’s access to media they have a legal right to view , modify , or redistribute .
It reduces competition and innovation : Consumers will be unable to influence the market by finding new uses for their existing media and copyrighted materials , limiting the application of ingenuity that can lead to the creation of new applications and markets for Canadians and the world .
It makes the public domain works inaccessible : Consumers will have the right to re-use works in the public domain , but in cases where those public domain works are protected by DRM consumers will not have the means to exercise those rights and hence lose access to their own heritage .
What wo n’t I be able to do under C - 61 ?
The following is a short list of the potential ramifications of C - 61 on your rights to use your legally purchased media .
Under C - 61 , you will not have the right to :
Make backups of your DVDs : Let ’s say you ’re a parent – do n’t you want to be able to make a copy of the DVDs you purchase for your kids so you have a way to easily replace the movie when they get their peanut butter - covered hands all over them ?
Doing so would require you to break the copyright protection software on those DVDs .
Under C - 61 , it will be illegal to do this – instead , you ’ll have to buy a whole new DVD .

Under C - 61 , it will be illegal to do this – instead , you ’ll have to buy a whole new DVD .
Move your media to other devices :
Let ’s say you ’ve purchased a shiny new digital media gadget for your home entertainment center – would n’t you like to be able to fill it with content you already own , such as DVDs , CDs , or music you ’ve legally purchased from online services ?
If that media is protected by DRM , C - 61 makes it illegal for you to copy this data – you will only be able to use your media on devices that support the media ’s DRM format .
If your new device does n’t support some ( or all ) of your existing content ’s DRM technology , you ’ll have to purchase it again .

If your new device does n’t support some ( or all ) of your existing content ’s DRM technology , you ’ll have to purchase it again .
Use your media in perpetuity : Let ’s say you purchased a movie or a song from an online service – do n’t you expect to be able to keep using that movie or song forever , even if the online service goes out of business ?
If your media is protected by DRM that contacts a server to authorize your access and the service goes out of business , you will no longer be able to access media you legally purchased .
Under C - 61 , it will be illegal for you to break the DRM to access the media you legally purchased .

Under C - 61 , it will be illegal for you to break the DRM to access the media you legally purchased .
Exercise your rights to fair dealing :
Let ’s say you ’re a student doing a documentary and want to use some video in your documentary which falls under Canada ’s fair dealing doctrine allowing use of copyrighted materials for research , private study , criticism , review or news reporting .
Under C - 61 , you will not be able to exercise your rights to include the video in your film if the video is protected by DRM .
In essence , you have the right use the video , but no way to do so without breaking the law .

Re-mix DRM - ed public domain materials :
Let ’s say you ’re working on some cool photo montage that takes photos from the public domain and re-uses them in some new and interesting way .
If the photos are stored in a DRMed format , you ca n’t access them without breaking the law under C - 61 .
Again , you have the rights to use the photos , and in fact they ’re a part of the public domain and belong to humankind as a whole – you just ca n’t exercise your rights .

Unlock your phone :
Let ’s say you ’ve been lusting after a new phone , but it ’s only available for another carrier .
If that carrier has “ locked ” the phone to restrict it to their network , you will not have the right to unlock the phone to work with your current carrier .
While this is not specifically forbidden under C - 61 , a carrier could argue that unlocking a phone circumvents of a copyright control , which would be illegal under C - 61 .

Use all of your phone ’s features :
Let ’s say you realize your phone has some really cool features that the carrier decided to disable .
If you employ software tools to re-enable these features , it could be argued that you are circumventing a copyright control , which would be illegal under C - 61 .
You paid for the device and all its features , you just are n’t allowed to use them .

Remove DRM software :
Let ’s say you ’ve purchased a CD that has DRM on it and you decide to play it on your computer – is n’t it fair to assume that you have the right to uninstall any software the CD installs on your system ?
Under C - 61 , disabling or uninstalling this software may be illegal .
Your computer is no longer yours to control .
This sounds alarmist – are n’t you over - reacting ?
The outcome of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States over the past ten years , coupled with the actions of media corporations , has illustrated the ramifications of overly restrictive copyright law on the rights of consumers .
Here are some examples of the egregious behavior that has resulted from the DMCA and the industry ’s insistence on the use of DRM technology :
Consumers unable to access media they purchased legally : A number of online music services have closed up shop , leaving consumers without the right or the means to access they legally purchased .
Examples include the closure of the MSN Music store , the closure of the Sony Connect Music service , and the closure of Google ’s Video Store .
In all cases , the user ’s were unable to access their media as - is ; in the case of Sony , users had to undertake a number of cumbersome manual steps to maintain access to their music , and in the case of Google , users were refunded their money only after a public outcry .

Consumers unable to use their devices as intended : Some popular digital video recorders include a “ broadcast flag ” technology desire to allow the manufacturer to limit how long a user may access programs they record , or prevent them from even recording some programs at all .
Most recently , NBC accidentally enabled this technology , preventing users of Microsoft ’s Home Media Center from recording an episode of American Gladiators .

Consumers ’ privacy and security risked by faulty DRM solutions :
In an effort to prevent users from copying CDs onto their computers , some manufacturers have embedded software that is automatically installed on the user ’s computer when they insert the CD .
This software not only uses up the user ’s computing resources , but also reports on the user ’s activities to the manufacturer .
The most noteworthy example of this is Sony ’s use of a DRM system that illicitly installs software on the user ’s machine , is very difficult to remove , and sends information to a third - party about the user ’s activities .
What can I do to stop C - 61 ?
Dust mites live in soft furnishings
Asthmatics should not waste money on special mattress protectors and vacuum cleaners to tackle dust mites - as they are of little use , experts have said .
Many asthmatics are allergic to tiny mites that live in dust in carpets , bedding and cuddly toys .
The Cochrane Collaboration research group reviewed 54 earlier studies , involving 3,002 people , to assess how well specialist equipment worked .
They found there was some dust mite reduction but nothing too significant .
Mattress protectors , specialist cleaners , high - efficiency vacuum cleaners and air filters were among the products tested ..
Thirty - six trials assessed physical methods , such as mattress casings , 10 chemical methods , and eight a combination of chemical and physical methods .
The products were largely ineffective , but the team did find mite reduction occurred in 17 trials although it was judged not significant enough to help ward off asthma .
The level of allergens is so high in most homes that what remains after the treatment is still high enough to cause asthma attacks
Dr Peter Gotzsche , lead author Lead author Dr Peter Gotzsche said : " We can conclude with confidence that there is no need to buy expensive vacuum cleaners or mattress covers or to use chemical methods against house dust mites because these treatments do not work .
" If you are wondering why it is that mattress covers and the other strategies are not effective , the likely answer is that all these treatments do not have a large enough effect on the occurrence of allergens from house dust mites .

" The level of allergens is so high in most homes that what remains after the treatment is still high enough to cause asthma attacks . "
Leanne Male , assistant research director at Asthma UK , said : " This updated review confirms previous evidence which suggests that dust prevention methods have little effect on reducing overall asthma symptoms . "
She said the charity recommended washing bed linen at high temperature and removing soft toys from beds could make life easier for the 90 % of people whose asthma is triggered by dust mites and may enable them to manage their asthma with less medicine .
There are currently 5.2 m people in the UK receiving treatment for asthma .

What are these ?
When you think of high oil prices , you ’re probably reminded of huge bills at the pump and inflating costs on goods and services .
However , the high cost of oil brings on so much more than that ( for instance , it affects retirees invested in crude oil ETFs in their 401 k’s , and it affects manufacturing of clothing in Southeast Asia ) .
Here we ’ll take a look at some of the lesser - known ways high oil prices affect the global economy .
Less Asian growth :
As China and India grow , they rely heavily on oil , which is part of the reason for the spike in prices .
However , they ’re shooting themselves in the foot because the higher prices go , the less they can afford , and their growth is slowed .
They also use energy less efficiently , so the prices are exacerbated .
Bargaining power :
With higher oil prices , oil - exporting countries hold the power .
This might embolden these nations to become more assertive or demanding of other countries in both political and economic ways .
Alternative energy grows :
As oil gets more expensive , alternative energy becomes much more attractive .
Investment and employment in clean technology goes up right along with high oil prices .
European countries are marginally affected :
With the dollar declining on the euro , Europeans feel the rising cost of oil much less than others .
Bad monetary policy : Rising energy costs are a cause for concern in most households , and governments tend to react to this sort of situation .
However , if they react with inappropriate policies , they can make things worse by simply prolonging the inevitable .
Exporters hold on to their money : Instead of pumping profits back into the global economy , exporters tend to save them .
That means that the global demand will tend to fall .
Helps US dollar :
Although we ’re not seeing this currently , in theory , higher oil prices should support a stronger dollar .
This is because oil is priced in dollars , and demand for dollars will increase with higher oil prices and dollar - denominated investment from exporters .
Other energy exporters flourish : Exporters of non-oil energy like coal and gas flourish as consumers attempt to shift to cheaper energy .
New capital shift :
As prices are hiked , investors consider putting their money in other sectors , which has a stimulating effect on the economy .
China has a cushion : Although as a developing country China is hit harder by oil prices , they seem to have a cushion as investment moves away from oil , and they maintain a fixed exchange rate with the dollar .
The US does n’t have it so bad :
Although your wallet may beg to differ , the United States is not hit as hard as other oil importers because we still produce about 40 % of the oil we consume .
Government subsidies fail : Some governments subsidize fuel , and higher oil prices put pressure on them .
The subsidies interfere with supply and demand , as consumers continue to demand more while prices stay relatively flat .
Interest rates go up :
As higher oil prices lead to inflation and rigidities in government expenditures , interest rates rise .
Oil - producing countries do n’t earn as much as you ’d think :
While the dollar suffers , oil exporting countries are subject to reduced purchasing power as they buy goods in euros .
International business suffers :
When the cost of oil goes up , flights get more expensive and corporate travel costs go up .
This leads to less frequent business trips to international locations .
The virtual economy flourishes :
As the cost of transportation rises , virtual work and net meetings become more popular .
The travel sector suffers : Hotels , cruises , airlines , and others in the travel industry are affected negatively by high oil prices because transportation costs are higher , and consumers are spending less because of stress on their budgets .
Countries will stop paying bills :
At some point , many countries may be forced to choose between oil and international debt repayments .
As they default on these loans , they ’ll hurt large international finance institutions .
Consumers save more :
When consumers are faced with rising oil costs , many create precautionary savings just in case things get worse .
Consumers buy cars :
Although budgets are being squeezed , consumers will buy more cars , presumably to upgrade to a more fuel - efficient foreign model .
The survivors often heard the engines of passing search aeroplanes and helicopters , but it was n't until Wednesday that they finally saw a helicopter and were able to signal to it for help .
They were near to leaving the site on foot in search of help when they were rescued , Mr Almonacid said .
Some readers scolded me in comments below the previous post for suggesting that sexism is more a problem in this election cycle than misogyny .
Frankly , I ’m trying to think through these issues — in part because of a book my wife and I are writing on women in the developing world — and so I ’d welcome some more discussion on this issue .
Until I reported this column , I simply assumed that the discrimination that women faced around the world was rooted in misogyny ; now I wonder if sexism is n’t the better term .
Let me explain the evolution of my thought .
Initially , I focused on misogyny because women in so many places are targeted for particularly brutality .
For example , in South Asia , acid attacks are common against women , but almost never against men .
Likewise , many different cultures report incidents in which women are picked out and stripped naked or otherwise sexually humiliated , in ways that rarely happen to men .
And as best the records tell us , women were executed about twice as often for witchcraft as men .
Granted , in conflicts men and boys are invariably killed at far higher rates than women and girls , but that ’s functional : it facilitates robbery and reduces the men ’s ability to bear arms in a rival militia .
In contrast , women are often assaulted in ways that seem less functional and just gratuitously barbarous .
The rape - caused fistulas in Congo are one example .
So all that is why I tended to reach for misogyny as an explanation .
Then in the reporting for this column , I spoke to evolutionary psychologists who emphasized the distinct origins of racism and misogyny / sexism .
Racism seems based in a hard - wired tendency of ancient humans to divide into groups to improve odds of survival , and it was an evolutionary advantage to be able to identify strongly with your own tribe and to fear or kill members of other tribes .
That may be why even very small children — even infants — draw racial distinctions or other in - group / out - group distinctions .
In contrast , the evolutionary origins of attitudes toward women were based presumably less on hatred and more on desire to control them and impregnate them , so as to pass on one ’s genes .
Acquiring and enforcing a harem , so as to improve the odds of one ’s own genes being passed on , might involve ruthlessness , enslavement and brutal beatings , but there was no evolutionary incentive for gender hatred as there was for hatred of different tribes .
And of course much of the anti-women behavior around the world , from genital cutting to bride burnings to sex trafficking , is typically overseen by women themselves , and it ’s easier to see their behavior as opportunism or deeply - embedded sexism than as hatred of fellow women .
So that ’s why I wonder if sexism , in the sense of discriminatory attitudes toward males and females , is n’t a better way of thinking about the issue than misogyny , in the sense of hatred toward women .
Other anthropologists I spoke to also noted that the most discriminatory restrictions against women tend to come not from those who profess to hate women , but from those who profess to honor and protect them .
Think of Afghan society , for example .
After interviewing many men who beat and lock up women and threaten to kill them if they take a false step , I ’d say that their attitudes for females are a mix of bizarre honor and contempt , but not usually hatred .
I ca n’t say I ’m fully convinced of the argument I ’m making .
There are still the acid attacks and similar behavior , which I find hard to explain short of misogyny .
And maybe the distinction between sexism and misogyny is artificial .
Wife - beating may be rooted in the male desire to control a mate and ensure that she passes on his genes and no one else ’s , and such behavior is n’t driven by hatred of women in the way that lynchings were driven by racism or that attacks on gays were driven by homophobia .
But for the woman with multiple broken arms , that may seem a meaningless distinction .
What do you think ?
I ’m thinking aloud here and would welcome your thoughts .

Pentagon stops planting ' analysts ' to provide talking points Nick Juliano
Published : Monday April 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The Pentagon has stopped feeding its talking points directly to retired generals and officers who then recited the military 's arguments to major television networks as their own ostensibly " independent " analysis .
In a blockbuster expose this month , the New York Times revealed the Pentagon's " hidden hand " behind the military talking heads who helped it sell the Iraq war to the American people .
Since the story appeared eight days ago it has been all - but - ignored by the major television networks who served as conduits for the Pentagon 's message men .
Now the program has been " temporarily suspended " a Pentagon spokesman says , so the Department of Defense " can take a look at some of the concerns . "
Chief among those concerns is that the military analysts participated in what amounted to a propaganda campaign aimed at the American people because of their own financial interests .
Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) has asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the legality of the program , which one former analyst told the Times was like " psyops on steroirds . "
Kerry wrote a letter to Comptroller General Gene Dodaro ( reprinted below ) in which he asked the GAO to determine who at the Pentagon was involved , how often the contacted the military analysts and what financial ties those analysts had to securing defense contracts .
 Americans need to be able to trust that defense contractors secure government contracts based on how well they protect our soldiers , not how closely they follow Pentagon talking points , " Kerry said in a news release .
" I look forward to hearing from the GAO about the legality of this alleged covert practice , who was involved , how it operated , and its impact on media coverage . 
Both Democratic presidential candidates , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , also have weighed in on the program , in statements to The Nation .
( Republican nominee John McCain has said nothing about the program . )
The Clinton Campaign said that given the Bush administration 's record on intelligence and misinformation , an investigation is critical to determine how the Pentagon shaped the " commentary of putatively independent television military analysts " for " selling ' the Iraq war and our country 's defense policy now . "
The campaign statement also flagged " serious questions about the potential linkage of government contracts to favorable public commentary by military analysts . "
The Obama Campaign called for " greater transparency to ensure that those who lobby the Pentagon are not rewarded for favorable commentary about the Administration 's policies . "
Obama spokesperson Jen Psaki also broadened the argument to indict the ongoing debate over war policy , saying " it 's past time that we conducted an honest dialogue about the situation in Iraq . " ...
McCain 's refusal to comment on the program is unsurprising , given his staunch support for every major aspect of the President 's Iraq policy .
However , the Democratic candidates ' delay in responding is more complicated .
There has been a virtual blackout of the topic on television news , so the candidates have not been pressed in recent interviews , such as Obama 's Fox appearance on Sunday .
And the issue is politically delicate because it implicates the conduct of retired generals .
The campaigns were careful to criticize the administration , not the generals , who hold a hallowed position in foreign policy discourse .
The Clinton Campaign even stressed that its criticism did not impugn " the honor and patriotism of our dedicated career military officers , " and neither candidate advocated a congressional or independent inquiry .
Teleconferences and briefings for the military analysts have been halted pending the review , which is being conducted by the Pentagon 's public affairs office , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said .
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates has not directly addressed the issue since the lengthy report on the program appeared in the Times April 20 , except to say that the analysts should make clear they were speaking only for themselves .
The Times found that the Pentagon laid on special briefings and conference calls for the retired officers , many of whom then repeated the talking points as military experts on television news shows .
The paper also found that many of the media analysts also worked as consultants or served on the boards of defense contracting companies , but that those ties often went undisclosed to the public .
Gates last met with the military media analysts in September , Whitman said .
With wire reports Sen. John Kerry sent the following letter to the GAO Monday :
The Honorable Gene Dodaro
Acting Comptroller General ,
United States Government Accountability Office
441 G St. , NW
Washington , DC 20548
Dear Mr. Dodaro :
Recently , the New York Times reported that the Department of Defense ( DoD ) led a covert effort to cultivate military analysts with distinguished service records to produce favorable press coverage of the Administrations wartime policies .
There is great public concern that DoD would systematically enlist military analysts , many of whom had business interests tied to the Administrations war effort , to spread its message over the airwaves .
At a time when confidence in Washington is at an all - time low , there is a very real worry among Americans that when they turn on the television to hear objective analysis from a military commentator they might instead be hearing what they would deem to be propaganda . 
Collectively , this cadre of analysts may represent over 150 military contractors as lobbyists , senior officials , and board members .
The analysts  business relationships raise legitimate concerns as to whether some of them were encouraged to tailor their commentary in order to maintain their companies  good standing with DoD .
In fact , some analysts reportedly echoed message points they sometimes suspected to be inaccurate or false for this reason .
So that Congress may understand the full reach of this alleged operation , as well as what steps may be necessary to prevent a similar effort in the future , I ask that your office pursue a full investigation into this matter .
I ask that this investigation consider the following :
 The names of all senior Pentagon officials involved in this effort , and the extent of that involvement ;
 The extent of the contact between Pentagon officials and the military analysts in question regarding what was said by the analysts over the public airwaves ;
 The extent to which the military analysts involved had personal financial interests that were in some way linked to their analysis , including a list of federal contracts that are in any way linked to the companies that employ any of the analysts in question ;
 The extent to which the personal financial interests of the analysts were known , and potentially used , by the Pentagon to promote misleading , inaccurate or false information through the media ;
 The extent to which the personal financial interests of the analysts were disclosed to the public and to the media outlets that employed their service ;
 Whether the actions taken by Pentagon officials to recruit and employ the military analysts were in fact illegal , and if so , whether those involved were made aware at the time that they were breaking the law ;
 What procedures are in place to ensure that military analysts with close ties to government officials or information are not using preferential access to senior officials to further business opportunities ; and
 What steps need to be taken by Congress and by the Pentagon to ensure that this type of effort is not repeated .
As the answers to these questions will do much to address the level of doubt and cynicism created by these actions , I ask that you pursue this request with a sense of urgency and report your findings to Congress as expeditiously as possible .
Thank you for your consideration of this request .
Sincerely ,
John Kerry
I think moonhowler Alex Jones owes 'em some moolah for the name ...
It sounds like Lou Dobbs ' wet dream -- assuming the dyspeptic geezer 's still capable of one : Operation Endgame , a comprehensive plan by Immigration and Customs Enforcement 's Office of Detention and Removal to " remove all removable aliens " by the magical year of 2012 .
Released in June 2003 , this ambitious and oft - times chilling document has surfaced on several lefty Web sites , and is sometimes offered as proof that a sinister conspiracy to enslave the nation is afoot , using corporate - run concentration camps that might one day be used to hold political activists instead of undocumented foreigners .
Despite the occasional references to the humane treatment of detainees , and a meek , brief discussion of alternatives to incarceration , the plan seems perfectly suited to the paranoid mental playgrounds of left - wing tinfoil - hat types .
But the document itself is all too real .
And even if the conspiracy theories it has spawned are straight from planet woo , this post - 9/11 detention and removal strategy still has a creepy , Orwellian feel to it .
" As the title implies , DRO [ Office of Detention and Removal ] provides the endgame to immigration enforcement , " wrote then DRO Director Anthony Tangeman in his cheery introduction to Endgame .
" And that is the removal of all removable aliens .
This is also the essence of our mission statement and the `golden measure ' of our success .
We must endeavor to maintain the integrity of the immigration process and protect our homeland by ensuring that every alien who is ordered removed , and can be , departs the Unites States as quickly as possible and as effectively as practicable .
We must strive for 100 percent removal rate . "
I 'll be honest , when I first was alerted to this document by Phoenix activist Rick Romero and self - described border ambassador Jay Johnson - Castro , I felt that familiar Spidey tingle I get when confronted with 9/11 conspiracy kooks .
No offense meant to Romero or Johnson - Castro .
They 're the ones who organized the recent Citizens Walk for Human Dignity , wherein Johnson - Castro and others made a 10 - day trek via foot from Tucson to Phoenix to highlight the abuses of our immigration system , and the ongoing persecution of the undocumented .
The walk concluded at the Arizona capitol May 11 , though I spoke to both men in Guadalupe the day before , where the walk had diverted itself to demonstrate solidarity with the resistance that occurred during Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's anti-immigrant sweep at the beginning of April .
Jay Johnson - Castro :
This man only looks crazy ...
" Endgame is the blueprint for what ’s happening , " the tall , tanned Texas - based Johnson - Castro told me .
" Arpaio actually fits in perfectly to what they want to do nationally .
They want our whole nation to morph into Maricopa County – stopping everybody for every little pretext violating everything that we ’ve ever been taught as Americans . "
In many ways , I agree with that .
Arpaio has 160 ICE - trained officers , the largest local force of 287g gendarmes in the country .
And I have no doubt that Homeland Security views Arpaio 's 287g - men as a test case for the nation .
That 's why ICE continues to say that Arpaio 's use of his federal powers is consistent with the Memorandum of Agreement he has with ICE .
This , in spite of all the controversy Arpaio 's provoked .
Yet , after reading Endgame , I still had my doubts that it was legitimate .
Might some activist have concocted this wack - ass white paper to convince others that a government conspiracy was afoot ?
' Fraid not , Jethro .
Looking at the Department of Homeland Security 's site , and doing a simple search for the word " Endgame , " I found a handful of documents that made reference to Endgame , the most recent of which was dated March 2007 .
If you hit Ctrl - F after opening the doc , titled An Assessment of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement ’s Fugitive Operations Teams , you 'll read what seems to be an admission that Endgame was too hopeful in its goals by far :
" In its Strategic Plan , Endgame , dated June 2003 , the Office of Detention and Removal Operations indicated that the National Fugitive Operations Program ’s goal was to eliminate the backlog of fugitive aliens by the end of 2012 and acknowledged that the initial allocation of 40 positions to fugitive operations would not be enough to reach that goal . "
I called Vinnie Picard , ICE 's PIO in Phoenix , and he conceded that Endgame was an ICE plan at one time , but he asserted that it was no longer .
At least not as written in 2003 .
" It was a plan formulated under prior ICE leadership , " he explained .
" It has since been replaced by a more comprehensive strategy under DHS that includes the border and interior immigration enforcement .
Basically , there are some components from operation Endgame that have been folded into our current operational structure .
Fugitive operations , for instance , is one element .
This is something that existed right at the beginning at 2003 , and it has been replaced by a more comprehensive strategy . "
More comprehensive than having all the auslanders booted out by 2012 ?
Well , for one thing , according to Picard , they 've dropped the deadline .
" I would characterize it by saying that we ’re focusing our priorities not so much on dates but on other kinds of goals , said Picard .
" Like reducing the percentage of foreign - born criminals in the state jails here in Arizona .
I ’m not aware of any current ICE operational data that provides a target date for removing all illegal aliens .
Certainly some components of operation Endgame have carried on and were folded into parts of our strategy .
But certainly that ’s not one of them . "
Yep , someone along the line probably stopped sniffing the gas pipe and realized that there 's no way ICE is going to deport 12 - to 20 - million people back to their country of origin .
ICE does n't have the manpower .
Which may explain ICE pimping the 287g agreements .
If all local law enforcement entities had 287g officers , and were further empowered to arrest and detain every illegal potato - peeler in the U.S. , then the ethnic cleansing could begin in earnest .
No wonder CCA , the Corrections Corporation of America , is building prison facilities to house undocumented men , women , and children like there 's no tomorrow .
CCA is the publicly traded company that runs prisons like those at Eloy and Florence , as well as Texas ' T. Don Hutto facility , where illegal immigrant kids are detained .
The Endgame for CCA is the almighty dollar .
Or to be more specific , dividends and stock splits .
Making bank off the incarceration of others .
It does n't get more American than that .
Or more Arizonan ; e.g. , former Arizona Senator Dennis DeConcini now sits on CCA 's board of directors .
Last year , the ACLU of Massachusetts insisted that the Endgame file was once available on ICE 's site , but that ICE deleted the doc shortly after an op -ed by two of ACLUM 's directors .
Probably a smart PR move on ICE 's part .
The plan 's language at times is a little too wonkishly enthusiastic , and veers into the sort of bureaucratese that recalls one of history 's more notorious mass deportations .
Needless to say , the comparison 's not a kind one
I ’m going to share the rules of the road that summer interns should live and breathe – follow them and you ’ll save yourself some embarrassment and start impressing your new coworkers .
Get to it :
Observe first — then speak .
You ’re an intern for a reason .
Do I really need to explain this further ?
Aim high .
You ’ve got a real job now .
While the rest of your friends fold clothes at the latest department store , you ’re starting your professional career .
Go you .
Introduce yourself to others .
That ’s right : I do n’t know you and I probably deleted the email announcing your arrival .
Make the most of your bathroom breaks , copy machine runs and TPS reportdeliveries – say hello to people on the way .
Set goals .
You ’re going to report on Project XYZ every Monday .
While you ’re at it , you ’ll be reporting on Project ABC every Wednesday .
You get the idea -** ** become the always - gets - things - done kid .
Listen , there ’ll be plenty of grunt work ; get that done , efficiently and professionally , then focus on the real reason you ’re here .
Ask for work .
There ’s nothing greater than an intern that asks to get involved in projects .
Sure , do the work that your boss assigns you but do n’t be shy when you hear about a project that interests you .
Attend every meeting .
Every .
Single .
One .
While you ’re at it , go to every lunch that you ’re invited to .
( Best practice :
If invited for a date , do n’t go . )
It ’s the best way to learn how a business works .
There ’s no better way to learn about office politics , decision making , interpersonal communication and management hierarchies .
Come prepared to work , well rested , and ready .
Seriously , no one cares that you were out , like , drinking and , like , hanging out with hotties .
You ’re working with professionals now , start acting like one .
Make friends with everyone , equally .
Sure , make a list of everyone you ’re dying to meet and go knock on their doors ; if they ’re not in their offices , pop them an e-mailed hello .
Do n’t discriminate : the new employee that no one knows might be the one to tip you off about a job opening next year .
Get over yourself .
An internship is an opportunity .
You were good enough to get hired , so give yourself a pat on the back but now it ’s time gain experience .
Be a sponge .
Take every assignment .
Attend every event .
Who cares if you look like an ass ?
This is n’t the time to play it cool .
Figure out who the ‘ stars ’ are and do what they do .
This is the most important tip – memorize it .
These people have done all the hard work for you , all you need to do is mimic them .
What could be easier ?
Remember :
You ’re going to get ahead by working your ass off and showing up for everything .
That ’s it – now get back to work .
Someday , when you ’re my new boss , please do n’t forget that I helped you succeed in your first internship .
So work hard and have a great summer .
Now go get me a coffee , intern !
Her advice :
Those who choose to call while driving should " do it hands - free " and " make it as quick as possible . " " Hang up and get back to driving , which is the only thing that you should be doing when you 're behind the wheel . "

At this point we feel that one single little - known fact can move people towards asking more questions about the fall of the towers on 9/11 ( bolding added ) :
" About a year after the official program to identify victims had ended , more human remains turned up on top of the Deutsche Bank Building , which stands about 400 feet to the south of the location of the former South Tower .
According to the Associated Press , more than 300 human bone fragments were recovered from the roof of the 43 - story skyscraper as workers removed toxic debris in preparation for a floor - by - floor take - down of the building .
Most of the fragments were less then 1/16th of an inch in length and were found in gravel raked to the sides of the roof of the building .
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation purchased the building and is planning to begin its deconstruction in June , after removal of toxic waste -- including asbestos , lead , and other materials ( including human bone fragments ) deposited on it by the destruction of the Twin Towers .
( USA Today ) ( source )
OK , so one minute a person is standing in a high rise office building , and the next minute they are so small as to be found amongst the gravel on top of a building more than a football field away ...
If this seems curious to you , please continue your journey , here are some more sources of information for you to pursue .

Dr. Biederman is one of the most influential researchers in child psychiatry and is widely admired for focusing the field ’s attention on its most troubled young patients .
Although many of his studies are small and often financed by drug makers , his work helped to fuel a controversial 40 - fold increase from 1994 to 2003 in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder , which is characterized by severe mood swings , and a rapid rise in the use of antipsychotic medicines in children .
The Grassley investigation did not address research quality .

Doctors have known for years that antipsychotic drugs , sometimes called major tranquilizers , can quickly subdue children .
But youngsters appear to be especially susceptible to the weight gain and metabolic problems caused by the drugs , and it is far from clear that the medications improve children ’s lives over time , experts say .
In the last 25 years , drug and device makers have displaced the federal government as the primary source of research financing , and industry support is vital to many university research programs .
But as corporate research executives recruit the brightest scientists , their brethren in marketing departments have discovered that some of these same scientists can be terrific pitchmen .
To protect research integrity , the National Institutes of Health require researchers to report to universities earnings of $ 10,000 or more per year , for instance , in consulting money from makers of drugs also studied by the researchers in federally financed trials .
Universities manage financial conflicts by requiring that the money be disclosed to research subjects , among other measures .
The health institutes last year awarded more than $ 23 billion in grants to more than 325,000 researchers at over 3,000 universities , and auditing the potential conflicts of each grantee would be impossible , health institutes officials have long insisted .
So the government relies on universities .
It used to be that just the entertainment industries wanted to control your computers – and televisions and iPods and everything else – to ensure that you did n't violate any copyright rules .
But now everyone else wants to get their hooks into your gear .
OnStar will soon include the ability for the police to shut off your engine remotely .
Buses are getting the same capability , in case terrorists want to re-enact the movie Speed .
The Pentagon wants a kill switch installed on airplanes , and is worried about potential enemies installing kill switches on their own equipment .
Microsoft is doing some of the most creative thinking along these lines , with something it 's calling " Digital Manners Policies . "
According to its patent application , DMP - enabled devices would accept broadcast " orders " limiting capabilities .
Cellphones could be remotely set to vibrate mode in restaurants and concert halls , and be turned off on airplanes and in hospitals .
Cameras could be prohibited from taking pictures in locker rooms and museums , and recording equipment could be disabled in theaters .
Professors finally could prevent students from texting one another during class .
The possibilities are endless , and very dangerous .
Making this work involves building a nearly flawless hierarchical system of authority .
That 's a difficult security problem even in its simplest form .
Distributing that system among a variety of different devices – computers , phones , PDAs , cameras , recorders – with different firmware and manufacturers , is even more difficult .
Not to mention delegating different levels of authority to various agencies , enterprises , industries and individuals , and then enforcing the necessary safeguards .
Once we go down this path – giving one device authority over other devices – the security problems start piling up .
Who has the authority to limit functionality of my devices , and how do they get that authority ?
What prevents them from abusing that power ?
Do I get the ability to override their limitations ?
In what circumstances , and how ?
Can they override my override ?
How do we prevent this from being abused ?
Can a burglar , for example , enforce a " no photography " rule and prevent security cameras from working ?
Can the police enforce the same rule to avoid another Rodney King incident ?
Do the police get " superuser " devices that cannot be limited , and do they get " supercontroller " devices that can limit anything ?
How do we ensure that only they get them , and what do we do when the devices inevitably fall into the wrong hands ?
It 's comparatively easy to make this work in closed specialized systems – OnStar , airplane avionics , military hardware – but much more difficult in open - ended systems .
If you think Microsoft 's vision could possibly be securely designed , all you have to do is look at the dismal effectiveness of the various copy - protection and digital - rights - management systems we 've seen over the years .
That 's a similar capabilities - enforcement mechanism , albeit simpler than these more general systems .
And that 's the key to understanding this system .
Do n't be fooled by the scare stories of wireless devices on airplanes and in hospitals , or visions of a world where no one is yammering loudly on their cellphones in posh restaurants .
This is really about media companies wanting to exert their control further over your electronics .
They not only want to prevent you from surreptitiously recording movies and concerts , they want your new television to enforce good " manners " on your computer , and not allow it to record any programs .
They want your iPod to politely refuse to copy music to a computer other than your own .
They want to enforce their legislated definition of manners : to control what you do and when you do it , and to charge you repeatedly for the privilege whenever possible .
" Digital Manners Policies " is a marketing term .
Let 's call this what it really is : Selective Device Jamming .
It 's not polite , it 's dangerous .
It wo n't make anyone more secure – or more polite .

Summary of Findings
Americans continue to hold their local and state governments in fairly high esteem , but positive views of the federal government are at their lowest point in at least a decade .
Only 37 % of people say they hold a favorable view of the federal government , while 58 % express an unfavorable opinion .
By comparison , 59 % hold favorable views of their state governments and 63 % hold favorable views of their local governments , figures that have been essentially stable since 2002 .
Favorability ratings of the federal government in Washington have tumbled over the past year .
As recently as January 2007 , as many Americans offered a favorable ( 45 % ) as unfavorable ( 46 % ) opinion .
In December 2002 , favorable opinions of the federal government outnumbered unfavorable opinions by more than two - to - one ( 64 % vs. 27 % ) .
Ratings of the federal government are tracking Americans ’ low opinions of the president and Congress , as well as their overall frustration with the state of the nation .
George W. Bush ’s approval rating has reached an all - time low of 27 % , and Pew ’s March survey found just 22 % expressing satisfaction with the way things are going in the country , while 72 % were dissatisfied .
Asked whether most members of Congress should be re-elected , only 36 % said yes in late February , and only 31 % approved of the job Democratic leaders in Congress were doing when asked in January .
Partisanship also matters .
A slim majority of Republicans ( 53 % ) view the federal government favorably , an opinion shared by just 34 % of independents and 29 % of Democrats .
For all groups , opinion is down sharply from December 2002 , when majorities of all three held favorable opinions of the federal government .
By contrast , political affiliation is less of a factor in ratings of state and local governments .
Most Republicans ( 64 % ) , Democrats ( 59 % ) and independents ( 57 % ) view their state governments favorably , figures that are largely unchanged from 2002 and 2005 .
Substantial majorities of all three partisan groups look favorably on their local governments as well , but Republicans are more favorable ( 73 % ) than either Democrats ( 62 % ) or independents ( 61 % ) .
The U.S. Military
The military continues to get high marks from a large majority of Americans .
More than eight - in - ten ( 84 % ) offer very or somewhat favorable opinions of the military , up six points from July 2007 .
Positive ratings of the military have not fallen below 75 % since 1990 .
Positive views of the military reached 94 % in March 1991 , shortly after the Persian Gulf War .
Currently , Republicans are more likely than Democrats to offer favorable views of the military , and conservatives and moderates are more likely than liberals to offer positive ratings .
There is virtually no difference in opinion by gender .
Supreme Court Viewed Favorably
The Supreme Court , now in its third term under Chief Justice John Roberts , is viewed favorably by most Americans : 65 % hold very or somewhat favorable opinions of the court , while 25 % express an unfavorable opinion .
In July 2007 , 57 % had a positive view of the court while 29 % expressed a negative opinion .
Republicans , in particular , express a favorable opinion of the Court .
Eight - in - ten Republicans view have a very or somewhat favorable opinion of the Supreme Court , compared with 64 % of Democrats and 60 % of independents .
The News Media
Most Americans ( 56 % ) have an unfavorable opinion of the news media , while just 40 % express a favorable view .
Positive opinions of the news media have declined since March 2007 ; at that time , 49 % expressed an unfavorable view while 45 % had a favorable opinion .
Women hold more favorable views of the press than do men , and Democrats hold more favorable views than either Republicans or independents .
Conservatives are much more negative in their assessments of the press than are moderates or liberals .
Business Corporations
Americans are divided in their opinions of business corporations .
About half ( 47 % ) view corporations favorably , while nearly as many ( 45 % ) view them negatively .
Positive ratings of corporations have declined 10 points since January 2007 ( 57 % ) .
Opinions about business corporations have fluctuated substantially in recent years ; favorable ratings have been as high as 73 % in August 1999 and as low as 45 % in October 2005 .
In the current poll , men express more positive views of business corporations than do women , and those with more education are more positive about corporations than are those with less education .
Republicans are notably more positive than are Democrats or independents .
A human smuggler cuts a border fence while illegally bringing Zimbabwaen refugees across the border into South Africa May 27 , 2008 near Musina , South Africa .
Facing economic strife and political oppression at home , Zimbabwaens continue to flood accross the border , despite recent violent attacks against foreign immigrants in South Africa .
A human rights group recently reported that up to 49,000 Zimbabwaens are illegally crossing into South Africa each month , adding to the 3 - 5 million Zimbabwaen refugees already residing in South Africa .

Last month , during two weeks in May , 2008 , a series of attacks took place all over South Africa .
In a clash between the poorest of the poor , gangs of local black South Africans descended on informal settlements and shanty towns , armed with clubs , machetes and torches , and attacked immigrants from Mozambique , Malawi and Zimbabawe .
Locals accused these immigrants of taking jobs away from them , among other grievances .
Over the course of those two weeks , over 60 foreigners were killed , several hundred injured , and many thousands of immigrants are now displaced , or are returning to their home countries .
Dealing with the aftermath of the attacks has become a large problem for South Africa - prosecuting attackers , accommodating refugees , dealing with a labor shortage , political damage control , seeking to address root causes , and some soul - searching are all taking place .

Are American Teens Losing the Humanities ?
A study shows American teens blanking on the basics of history and the arts .
Feb. 26 , 2008  --
A recent study sponsored by Washington , D.C. - based organization Common Core revealed that almost 20 percent of 1,200 American teens could not identify the American enemy in World War II , and more than 25 percent mistakenly believed that Columbus sailed to America after 1750 .
Half did not know whom Sen. Joseph McCarthy investigated .
" It is easy to make light of such ignorance .
In reality , however , a deep lack of knowledge is neither humorous nor trivial , " said Lynne Munson , Common Core 's executive director .
Test your 17 - year - old knowledge .
Take parts of the quiz HERE .
The report , titled " Still at Risk : What Students Don't Know , Even Now , " was Munson 's brainchild .
It was her idea to conduct a survey drawn on a pool of questions from an earlier survey taken in 1986 .
Munson and her assistant selected the questions , then consulted Frederick M. Hess , director of education policy studies for the American Enterprise Institute , who analyzed the results of the survey and authored the report .
" The question of how much our 17 - year - olds know is particularly pressing , given broader social trends .
After all , these students are less than a year away from reaching legal adulthood , making them eligible to vote and serve in the nation 's armed forces , " Hess said .
He noted that there is no current reliable national measure of how much students know about history and literature , and pointed out , " More disturbing than the aggregate results may be some of the items that many 17 - year - olds did not know . "
Hess pointed out some of the following results from Common Core 's survey :
- Nearly a third could not identify " ask not what your country can do for you " as the words of President John F. Kennedy .
- A third did not know that the Bill of Rights is the source of American rights to freedom of religion and speech .
- Just two in five could place the Civil War in the correct 50 - year period , and just half knew that The Federalist papers were written to encourage ratification of the U.S. Constitution .
- Nearly a quarter could not correctly identify Adolf Hitler .
- Less than half could identify the literary figures of Job or Oedipus , while barely one in two could identify the plot of George Orwell 's immortal book " 1984 . "
" What should we take from these findings ?
It is essential that parents , policymakers , and educators examine what we are doing when it comes to the teaching of history and culture , " Hess said .
" We must ask whether popular reform currents are delivering the results we wish and , if not , what we should do about it . "
Every year , before I start teaching I like to think about the cultural background of the incoming freshmen class .
It helps me teach and relate to them .
It ’s also pretty interesting to think about .
This year , I decided write some of those thoughts down .
I ’m assuming that the average incoming freshmen student was born in 1990 .
With that in mind , here ’s 16 things you should know about the incoming freshman college students .
They were n’t alive in the 80s !
I just had to get this one out of the way .
I know you can do the math when I told you above that they were born in 1990 , but it is somehow more shocking when you put it this way .
They have lived almost half of their life during the US War on Terror .
They were about eleven years old on September 11 .
When Bush leaves office they will be pushing 19 years of age .
So , 8 out of those 19 years will have been lived during the Bush administration ’s war on terror .
I started to become politically aware around the age of 9 .
If that ’s somewhere close to average , then for almost all of their politically aware lives Bush has been president and we have been fighting his elusive axis of evil .
They were n’t alive when the Internet really started to take off .
I know there is some debate about when the internet really took off , but I remember watching TV one day and seeing an internet address on a television commercial in prime time .
It was 1995 .
I marked that as the year that the internet was demonstrably HUGE .
So , it was still a pretty big deal in 1990 – when they were born .
They were n’t alive for MacGyver or Alf .
OK .
I cheated on this one .
MacGyver aired from 1985 - 1992 , but let ’s be honest – do the last two seasons really count ?
No .
Which means they were n’t alive for MacGyver .
Even if you count the last two seasons – they were only two years old when it went off the air which means they were n’t alive for most of MacGyver .
They definately were n’t alive for Alf .
They also turned two during the last season of The Cosby Show .
Seinfeld and The Simpsons first aired a year before they were born .
They missed MacGyver , Alf , and the Cosby show , but they also pretty much missed Seinfeld and most of the early Simpsons .
Both shows launched in 1989 .
If you count the Simpson shorts on the Tracey Ullman Show , then the Simpsons have been around since 1987 – three years before they were born .
Oh , and they were only four years old when Friends and ER first launched .
They were n’t alive when the Berlin Wall came down
That ’s right .
The Berlin Wall came down in 1989 .
You wanna know something else ?
If you assume that the cold war ended with the fall of communism in Russia – they were only a year old when the cold war ended .
They have no recollection of any of the incredibly ironically awesome 80s propoganda films unless they showed up on TBS marathons in the mid90s .
MC Hammer and Vanillla Ice had the two most popular albums in the year of their birth .
In 1990 MC Hammer ’s album Please Do n’t Hurt ‘ Em , Hammer dominated in sales for most of the year .
It was soon trumped by Vanilla Ice ’s first album .
By 1991 everyone had Hammer pants and University of Miami sweatshirts .
You Ca n’t Touch This and Word to Your Mother were part of the common vocabulary several years before they even had a mastery of the English language .
They Probably Didn’t Really Start Listening To Rap Music until The Next Episode Snoop Dogg ’s best album came out when they were 3 .
Same goes for the Wu Tang Clan .
They were 6 when Tupac was shot and 7 when Biggie was shot .
If By the time they were listening to rap music Eminem was popular and Dr. Dre had a comeback album as everybody had already been acting like they forgot about Dre .
They do n’t remember The Chronic .
It ’s always been The Chronic 2 .
Computer Generated Animation Has Always Been the Norm .
Toy Story came out when they were five .
By the time they were watching animated cartoons – computer generatred Pixar - style animation was pretty clearly the new norm .
Kids who grew up on color television may have enjoyed watching Black - and - White TV , but they always wondered why people ever bothered to make black - and - white TV in the first place .
I imagine there ’s something similar going on here .
Sure they watched and loved ordinary animation , but they grew up in CGI explosion , and I bet many of them wondered why we ever bothered with regular animation .
No Saturday Morning Cartoons
I remember when I woke up one Saturday morning hankering for a bit of nostalgia and thought – Let me see what the kids are watching now .
To my horror , there were no Saturday Morning Cartoons .
Saturday Morning Cartoons were gone by the time they were old enough to start watching them .
NBC and CBS replaced the cartoon line - up in 1992 with morning shows .
ABC followed suit in 1994 .
Nick - at - Nite TV was in Color I remember when Nick - at - Nite played things like Dennis - the - Menace , My Three Sons , The Donna Reed Show , and Mr. Ed. Check out what the 1990s and 2000s line - up were .
You see shows like Taxi , Welcome Back , Kotter , The Facts of Life , Diff ’rent Strokes , Family Ties , The Wonder Years , The Brady Bunch , Laverne and Shirley , Mork and Mindy , and Cheers .
Most of their Nick - at - Nite TV was in color .
They Were n’t Alive for the Original NES Heyday Super Nintendo launched the year they were born which means they missed the regular Nintendo ’s heyday .
Here ’s something else that ’s intereseting .
Assume that the advanced gamers in the group may have started playing video games around 4 or 5 .
I suspect that means that most of them did not really start playing video games seriously until 1996 or 1997 .
Playstation
One had been out for three years and Playstation 2 was just three years on the horizon .
By the time they became really good gamers – they were into Playstation 2 or Xbox .
They did n’t make cell phones the norm in high school .
Their older brothers and sisters did .
It ’s always seems to shock colleagues to think that these students will have always known cell phones are the norm in high school .
But here ’s something more shocking .
Cell phones were the norm in high schools before these students even got to high school .
Their older brothers and sisters were the real pioneers of cell phones in high school .
By the time they hit high school , cell phones were the well established norm .
Gas has always been over $ 1 ( and over $ 3 when they started driving )
In 1990 , average gas price was $ 1.16 a gallon .
By the time they started driving it was 2006 .
That ’s probably around the time that they actually paid attention to gas prices .
So , by the time they could actually tell you what the price of a gallon of gas was – it was around $ 3 a gallon .
Their Parents Are Not Baby Boomers
Assuming the last Baby Boomers were born 1960 and the average age of an incoming freshmen parent was 31 years of age in 1990 , the average parent of the incoming freshmen class is technically not a baby boomer .

Pro-Hillary picketer : Mike Huckabee got me fired Nick Juliano
Published : Monday April 28 , 2008

Print This Email This Does Mike Huckabee want to be John McCain 's running mate so badly that he would pull some strings to have a young woman fired from her job for having the temerity to hold up a Hillary Clinton sign as the GOP nominee landed in Little Rock ?
Micah Qualls 's seven - year stint as a waitress at a diner in the Little Rock airport came to an end last Friday , and she says the former Arkansas governor is to blame .
The story began that morning as McCain 's flight was landing in Little Rock with Huckabee waiting to greet him on the tarmac .
There were few customers in the Central Flying Service restaurant where Qualls worked , so she took a break , went to get a " Hillary for President " sign from the trunk of her car and stood with it along the fence a little ways away from where McCain was de-boarding .
Qualls called it a " simple act of patriotism " and a unique opportunity for someone whose politically minded , like she is , to express her viewpoint .
" I want them to be reminded every single time they 're anywhere that people have different views , " Qualls told RAW STORY in an interview Monday .
" Is n't that what you 're supposed to do , express yourself ? "
It seemed the small exercise in free speech would end there with little fanfare .
As soon as McCain and his entourage had left the runway , Qualls returned to work and began working the growing lunch rush .
But by the time her shift ended , she was out of a job .
Qualls ' boss , Dick Holbert , said the decision to fire her was his alone , and Huckabee has denied involvement , but the former waitress said the circumstances of her dismissal do n't support their stories .
" I have no qualms about telling that Huckabee is boldface lying , the owner of my company is boldfaced lying , " she said .
Huckabee 's denial came in the form of a phone call to Arkansas Times reporter Max Brantley .
Got a call at home tonight ( Friday ) from former Gov. Mike Huckabee .
Yes , really .
I did .
It was a cordial call .
But he wanted to say 1 ) he had not seen the young woman with the sign at Central Flying 2 ) he 'd made no complaint to anyone about her presence because he had n't seen her 3 ) any suggestion otherwise was " absolutely unbelievable " ( if I read my scrawled notes on a hotel notepad correctly ) .
He said the McCain plane landed at a Central terminal not easily in view of where Micah says she stood .
In short , a la Sgt. Schultz , he knows " no - thing . "
The call itself is unusual because Brantley has been no friend or fan of the former governor , and the two have been " on the outs " since 1991 .
Qualls says she was in full view of Huckabee and McCain when the GOP candidate landed .
A co-worker who was on the tarmac when McCain stepped off the plane told Qualls he said , " Well it looks like we have protesters already , " referring to Qualls .
The same co-worker overheard Huckabee asking her supervisor , " Is n't that one of the girls from the restaurant ? "
In this video shot by a Fox News producer , Huckabee and the supervisor are seen chatting before McCain steps off the plane , and McCain seems to glance towards where Qualls is standing .
Noise from McCain 's plane drowns out much of the conversation between Huckabee and McCain .
Qualls also says a friend who works at a nearby hotel was recounting the story of her firing to an acquaintance who knows Huckabee well .
The man , who 's not being identified because of his long association with the former governor , promply called Huckabee on a cell phone .
Huckabee told the man he found the display " completely tasteless " and " disrespectful , " Qualls said after speaking to him .
Qualls said the man changed his story after speaking to her and has threatened her with legal action for recounting their phone conversation .
A local television station reported on Qualls ' firing without including the Huckabee angle .
Only Brantley at the Arkansas Times , an alternative weekly , has delved into that aspect of the story .
Qualls suspects a cover-up .
" This is backroom politics and everybody knows everybody , " she said .
On Saturday , Brantley reported that while Huckabee himself might not have called for Qualls to get the ax , his former campaign manager Chip Saltsman does quite a bit of business with Central Flying and may have intervened on Huckabee 's behalf .
" All I can think is he believes I 'm just some dumb waitress , and he 's used to getting away with stuff like this , " Qualls said .
Qualls ' boss , Dick Holbert , provided this statement to KTHV television .
" I did n't witness Qualls demonstration .
After hearing the details I told the flight deck manager to relieve her .
That she was holding a Clinton sign was beside the point .
She was on my time wearing my uniform and she spoke loudly and a lot of people noticed . "
But Qualls said that explanation does n't sit right with her .
If her actions were such an egregious breach of company policy , she asks , why was she allowed to stay for the rest of the shift .
" I worked my shift .
He came in and sat at table 32 and had catfish and went back [ to his office ] after lunch , " she said .
" Obviously he was not in distress over what I had done . "
According to a search of campaign finance records , Holbert has donated to Little Rock 's Democratic members of Congress , and he gave Bill Clinton $ 1,000 back in 1995 .
Qualls said employees at her restaurant have appeared in uniform other times at rallies to support political candidates , including John Kerry and Howard Dean when they visited Little Rock .
She suspected the threat of lost business was behind her firing .
" I guess I 'm just naive , " she said , " but I thought this just did n't happen to people . "
This video of McCain 's arrival comes from Fox News :
The Internet — Life , or Just a Game ?
Leading a Double Life
Imagine that there is a door in your apartment or house .
Each day you step through that door and visit a distant and strange world for a few hours .
In that world you have a different name and face and body .
You live , work , earn money , face challenges , create , succeed , and grow – every single day .
And then , you return to your everyday , ordinary life .
The contrast between the two worlds is dramatic .
You ca n’t give up either one , and you ca n’t see how to bring them together .
If one person leads this double life , the two worlds may remain forever separate
But what if 100 ’s of millions of people lead this double life ?
Soon , they will demand that their everyday world becomes more like their magical one .
In Part 1 of this series , we spoke of virtual worlds on the Internet as the new frontier .
We suggested that the 100’s of millions of people living hours of their days in these worlds would have a profound effect on our everyday world .
Second Life , or Escape from Reality ?
Why do so many people find the virtual worlds so enticing , so enjoyable , and so meaningful ?
Is it just the adrenaline rush of a world with fast action , danger , wish fulfillment , and the opportunity to express dark sides of us that are unacceptable in everyday life ?
While we ca n’t completely discount this aspect of video games in general , and virtual worlds , in particular , this is only the surface of it .
It ’s much the same as the way pornography was a driving force in the adoption of video , dial - up bulletin boards , newsgroups , and even the Internet .
The opportunity to express and pursue certain behaviors dominates some new technologies , at least for a while .
But we would be foolish to conclude that those behaviors are the measure of those technologies .
The Meaning of Fun and Games
Exodus to the Virtual Worlds , by Edward Castronova , discusses life in the virtual worlds in great detail .
Castronova identifies a number of profound benefits that visitors find in these virtual worlds :
Equal beginnings .
Each player starts with nothing , and succeeds through her own efforts .
Players proceed at their own pace , but when they finally succeed , they gain new skills and resources , and they join a community of players at that level .
Exceptional players find recognition within the community of their peers who truly understand and appreciate their efforts .
The worlds provide challenges which are appropriate to the skill level of the player
There are clear measures of success and failure .
The benefits of success are available without long delays .
Failures do not permanently stop you .
There is always the opportunity to start again .
There is clarity in the virtual worlds between good and evil , and the world calls upon individuals to make choices .
Activities are performed alone , and in groups , and typically benefit you and others .
others .
The most successful virtual worlds have clear rules , which are as simple as possible .
The virtual worlds , like our lives , are games — environments with rules , where the outcome is not certain .
But unlike many people ’s experience of their everyday lives , these games are designed to be satisfying , meaningful , and fun .
One of Castronova ’s most profound observations is that people quickly lose interest in games / worlds that provide no challenge , or challenges that are too easy or too hard for the current skill level of the player .
I would add a few points :
We crave the opportunity to remake ourselves , to break out of our current boundaries and find a way to explore the possibility that we know is waiting for us .
While we want to break out of our old patterns and rules , we do n’t want a world without order .
We want fair , consistent rules that shape a predictable world , but leave us plenty of freedom to change .
We want a world with stable civilization , and frontiers .
We can then choose how much of our time to spend in the more civilized areas , and how much of our time to spend in the more wild areas .
The frontiers provide unique challenges and opportunities to grow .
The Death and Rebirth of Civilization
Civilizations that lose their frontiers become old and frightened of change , and ultimately collapse and die .
Sometimes civilizations with frontiers still decay .
This often happens when the frontiers are too far away from everyday life , and have little influence on the old world .
The virtual worlds are always close by .
They have an ever - growing population that will bring their lessons of possibility and meaning back to the old world .
As the Internet began and developed , we saw a glimpse of frontiers in the distance .
The virtual worlds will continue this process , as they restore ever - growing , ever changing frontiers to us .

There might be more to Snow Leopard than meets the eye , as rumors have emerged outlining tremendous cuts in application size for 10.6 .
Mail.app will drop from 287MB to 91MB , iChat from 111MB to 52MB , and iCal from 89 MB to 48 MB .
Cuts are practically universal , with already small apps like the 13MB Calculator , 15 MB Image Capture and 22MB TextEdit each to be recoded to a svelte 2 MB or less .
As a whole , the Snow Leopard 's Utilities folder will take up just 25 % of the space that it does in 10.5 .

AppleInsider chalks the size decreases up to wider use of vector graphics and a centralized localization scheme , so as to prevent redundant language installations .
More likely , however , is that the exclusion of PowerPC support has allowed for some serious pruning , allowing Apple to shed years of IBM residue from each app .

Additional reports confirm , as previously reported , that ZFS will be include in Snow Leopard Server , and claim that new text processing features ( like autocorrect and text insertion ) will be implemented system - wide , and that a multitouch programming tools will be supplied to developers for inclusion into their 3rd party apps .
It looks like Apple is committing to the strategy of optimizing and improving upon an existing product instead of pushing for conspicuous new features , which is bold , to say the least

All the Utopia will come to pass only when we grow wings and all people are converted into angels .
- Fyodor Dostoevsky , " The Diary of a Writer "
WHEN decision - makers call a new policy a “ third way ” it usually signals an unsatisfactory compromise .
That is certainly true of the proposed energy - policy rules agreed on by European Union ( EU ) energy ministers in Luxembourg on June 6th .
Andris Piebalgs , the EU energy commissioner , had set out to force governments to separate or “ unbundle ” energy companies ' production and transmission assets .
What he has achieved with the legislative proposal is a hybrid system that lets governments choose between mandating a proper break - up of their country 's vertically integrated energy giants , and two watered - down forms of separation .
By his own admission Mr Piebalgs has “ mixed feelings ” about the compromise in the draft legislation that will now be submitted to parliamentarians .
But he is under pressure from two rival factions .
Britain , Spain , the Netherlands and the Scandinavians champion “ Independent Transmission System Operation ” ( ITSO ) , which is jargon for full unbundling .
In their view vertically integrated companies such as France 's EDF and Germany 's RWE and e.ON shut rivals out of their transmission systems and shy away from reinvesting their profits in network improvements .
As an alternative to ITSO the Commission also proposed a watered - down version , allowing companies to retain ownership of their spun - off networks .
But even that was too much for a group of eight countries , led by France and Germany , which say that “ effective and efficient ” unbundling of transmission systems does not require such separation .
This group proposed a “ third way ” that merely requires companies to have independent management teams for generation and transmission , and to boost investment .
National governments will be able to decide which of these three options to adopt .
The Commission insists that it has made progress on other fronts .
A new “ Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators ” is to oversee the functioning of energy markets , notably in cross - border co-operation between network operators .
But Dieter Helm , an expert on energy regulation at Oxford University , says there is not much to celebrate .
He argues that the proposal is a muddled compromise that will create cumbersome regulation and more bureaucracy .
In his view unbundling should have been pushed through in the 1990s , when energy prices were low , investment requirements were negligible and supply was abundant .
Unbundling seems much less important today , he says .
Instead , as Russia becomes an increasingly powerful energy producer , the EU should focus on safeguarding its security of supply , in particular by forming a common front in dealings with Gazprom and other Russian energy giants .
By 2030 Russia will provide about 50 % of the EU 's gas imports .
Yet rather than working together , countries are striking bilateral deals with Russia .
Combating climate change should be the EU 's second priority .
Talks are being held at regular intervals , but so far unrealistic targets for the use of renewable energy have been the main result .
“ European energy policy has been a substantive failure , ” says Mr Helm .
The Commission says it had to agree on a compromise .
France , an opponent of full unbundling , will take over the EU 's rotating presidency on July 1st , so the reformers had to get things sorted out this month .
And the new policy may yet help to foster a more unified external energy policy through the new pan-European agency and increased co-operation among network operators .
But implementation will take at least two years .
Meanwhile , Europe 's vertically integrated giants — especially Germany 's RWE and e.ON — will pursue their own foreign energy policy .
And governments will do their very best to help their national champions .
CNNMoney is reporting Credit Card Issuers Face Bigger Losses Than Expected .
" The deterioration in credit cards is accelerating faster than many had expected , " said Christopher Wolfe , an analyst at Fitch and one of the authors of the report published Friday .
" The message we are trying to deliver is that things are going to get worse before they get better .
Thus far , credit card businesses have been profitable but that could change . "
Fitch analysts are expecting an increase in prime charge - off rates - or losses from defaults on card payments as a percentage of loans outstanding - to at least 7 % by the end of the year from 6.4 % in May .
Particularly vulnerable , say analysts , are credit card issuers such as Washington Mutual , or WaMu , and Capital One Financial Corp . ( COF ) with higher subprime exposure , a category of high - risk borrowers with high delinquency who fueled the mortgage crisis .
WaMu , which bought a subprime credit card issuer in 2005 , reported in the first - quarter net charge - offs of 9.32 % on $ 26 billion of credit card loans .
This is up from 6.31 % a year earlier .
It ratcheted up its loss reserves in its credit card unit by more than 60 % .
A WaMu spokesman declined to comment , citing the so- called quiet period ahead of earnings .
Credit card issuers that are part of bigger banking institutions such as Citi are n't in the clear either .
The financial services behemoth had net losses of 5.83 % in its U.S. cards portfolio in the first quarter , a 1.2 % rise from a year earlier .
" While current losses remain below peak levels , they are running above the long - term average , " said Fitch analysts in their report .
A Citi spokesman declined to comment on upcoming second - quarter results .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - With eight months to go before the U.S. presidential election , the candidates have raised almost $ 1 billion to fund their campaigns -- more than the size of the economies of several African countries .
Presidential candidates U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) ( L ) , U.S. Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) ( C ) and Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) meet onstage between back to back Republican and Democratic debates at St Anselems College in Manchester , New Hampshire January 5 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
The unusually long race for the White House -- which began in earnest more than a year ago -- has been a cash bonanza , especially for Democrats who are breaking all records .
Republicans lag behind but still rake in tens of millions and have time to make up ground in the money game between now and the November 4 national election .
Between January 2007 and February , the candidates raised a record $ 814 million .
By the end of this month , analysts expect the total taken in and spent by the candidates and interest groups will reach $ 1 billion .
“ America ’s really taking a big step forward in terms of spending on their elections , ” said Steve Weissman of the Campaign Finance Institute , a research organization affiliated with George Washington University .
Weissman said the three main presidential candidates -- Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Republican John McCain -- are pulling in a combined total of at least $ 100 million a month .
Figures show the candidates are spending up to 93 percent of what they have raised .
To put the numbers into perspective , seven African countries or islands each have a gross domestic product of less than $ 1 billion , according to International Monetary Fund data .
They include Sao Tome and Principe , Guinea - Bissau , Gambia , Comoros , the Seychelles , Liberia and Djibouti .
While they were careful not to criticize the American political process , people in some aid organizations mentioned other possible uses for so much money .
An official with CARE , one of the world ’s leading humanitarian organizations fighting global poverty , said even a fraction of $ 1 billion could help tens of millions of people .
“ An additional $ 150 million could ensure that 10 million girls could receive a quality education .
An additional $ 150 million could help make pregnancy and safe delivery available for 30 million women in 10 countries , ” said Deborah Neuman , senior vice president for resource development at CARE .
Neuman would not criticize the amount of money being spent on the campaign , saying it was important for Americans to become participants in the political process .
But she said , “ Dollars need to be looked at and made room for in peoples ’ philanthropic giving for causes like ours and fighting poverty . ”
WHY SO MUCH ?
Experts said the amounts being spent in this presidential election are much higher than in most other countries , though still only a fraction of what Americans spend advertising some basic products or eating out in restaurants .
A large portion of the money in the United States is spent paying for television and radio time while some other countries provide broadcast time to candidates , Weissman said .
More money is needed also because campaigns in the United States are much longer compared to many other nations .
Under the American electoral system each state holds a nominating contest followed by the November general election .
Usually the battle ends early after only a few states are finished with their nominating contests .
But with no incumbent this election has been different and both parties have waged a long battle to pick nominees for the upcoming election .
“ We started two years out .
Even by American standards that ’s a long election , ” said Gary Klaman , of watchdog group
U.S. PIRG .
Groups like U.S. PIRG and the Center for Responsive Politics say while the use of the Internet has allowed many more people to take part by donating small amounts of money , the bulk of the fund - raising is still from large donors .
“ Yes it ’s a lot of money .
But really -- it ’s less about the overall amount of money than where that money is coming from and who is supplying it , ” said Klaman .
Massie Ritsch of the Center for Responsive Politics said even with the Internet contributions , only about 4 percent of Americans make a contribution to a federal politician .
“ The bulk of the money is coming from a tiny group of largely wealthy Americans who are having a great impact disproportionate to their numbers on something that should be important to everybody , ” he said .
Klaman agreed .
“ That is what should frighten Americans -- when these guys get elected are they looking primarily out for the good of the people or are there debts that they need to pay back , ” he said .

Vi invito ad ascoltare l’intervista di Repubblica.tv a Stefano Rodotà , ex Presidente dell ’ Autorità Garante della Privacy .
Un uomo che non urla , anzi , ma è rispettato e stimato da tutti .
Che dite , c’è da fidarsi oppure è anche lui un servo ?
In breve , sostiene due cose : la pubblicazione delle dichiarazioni dei redditi è perfettamente legittima dal punto di vista legale ( D.P.R. 600/1973 , art .69 ) e al massimo si possono fare considerazioni sull ’ opportunità del provvedimento per tempi e modalità ; lo scopo è quello di permettere ai cittadini di effettuare un “ controllo diffuso ” di legalità ; l’argomento secondo cui questo favorirebbe la criminalità è vecchio e soprattutto non sta in piedi , i criminali hanno ben altri metodi per sapere ciò che gli serve , e lo scoprono comunque .
Io penso che in teoria non ci sia alcun problema : la pubblicazione è stata fatta in applicazione della legge , e sarebbe desiderabile che la trasparenza si tramuti in controllo di legalità generale , diffuso appunto .
Detto questo , dobbiamo tenere conto che in questo
Paese forse la cosa può avere effetti controproducenti : ci sarebe un controllo di curiosità , più che di legalità .
Inoltre , sono pienamente d’accordo con chi dice che i criminali non hanno bisogno della dichiarazione dei redditi per sapere ciò che gli serve .
Chi usa questo argomento sa molto di ipocrita .
Considerazione finale : in realtà i dati erano già disponibili , ma bisognava andare in comune , farsi identificare e seguire una complessa procedura che scoraggiava i più .
Ma non i giornali , che infatti periodicamente pubblicano le dichiarazioni di personaggi conosciuti .
Internet rende tutto molto più facile e veloce .
E allora perchè non si mettono a disposizione i dati solo a patto che ci si registri ?
Si lascerebbe una traccia , potrei persino controllare chi ha controllato la mia dichiarazione !
Ne parlano , con posizioni simili e non , Luca De Biase , Luca Sartoni , Stefano Quintarelli e Roberto Dadda .
E molti altri .
■ 誰からも後ろ指を指されない社内ニートになるため の10の方法
インチキ専門学校卒、フリーターから地元のやや有名企業に潜り込み、社内ニートとしてもうすぐ10年を迎えるオレが経験則から編み出した「いかに仕事をせずに社内ポジションを保持するか(もしくは自分の能力を過大評価させる10の方法)」。一生懸命やっても、どうせ誉めてもらえないという貴方、腐っていてはソンですよ！この10箇条のライフハック（笑）をぜひ実践して、社内評価とお気楽生活を一挙に手にしてみてはいかが？
（１）本当にこの会社にいるべきなのか？
「 会社にいて仕事をしないのは、仕事をすることより難しい」。普通の会社というのは、みんな働いて当然というスタンスですから、この認識が必要です。仕事をしないと居られないような会社であれば、辞めた方がいいでしょう。また、自分以上に仕事をしていない社員が複数見られる場合も、早めに辞めるのが賢明です。新たなステージでこそ、あなたの社内ニートとしての才能は開花するのかも知れません。
（２）立ち位置をしっかり確認する
組織がキッチリしているシビアな会社では、社内ニートは生息できません。義務と責任の狭間に咲くあだ花、それが社内ニートです。あなたが、ちゃんとしている会社にいるなら、ちゃんとした方が間違いなくトクします。ちゃんとした会社かどうかは、2ちゃんとかで確認してみるといいでしょう。残念ながらあなたの会社が「ちゃんとしていた」としても悲観することはありません。ちゃんとした会社にも、ちゃんとしてない部署はひとつふたつあるはずです。そこへ「あえて」転属願いを出す（不採算部署を自分の手で立て直すくらいの大風呂敷を広げて）のも手です。
（３）秘密兵器と錯覚させるために
厳しさを増すビジネスシーンの片隅で、社内ニートとしてひっそり暮らす（そう、高山に咲く希少植物のように！）ためには、まず自身のキャラづけが必要です。例えば、ドラマ「相棒」における水谷豊のように、「独特の才能を持っている雰囲気」を醸し出すことを推奨します。水谷豊であれば物語上、事件を解決しなければなりませんが、あなたは雰囲気を出すことだけに腐心すればいいのです。具体的には、あなたの会社（もしくは事業部）が、まだ手を出していない分野の書籍を買い集めて机上に散乱させたり、できるだけ年輩者の揃った会議の場で、わけの分からないビジネス用語を連発してオッサン社員を煙に巻いたりすればいいでしょう。ただ、その後のフォローはくれぐれもお忘れなく。キーマンを絞った丁寧なフォローで「知識をひけらかす」イメージではなく、「熱心さが故に」専門用語で熱弁を振るったイメージを演出しましょう。
（４）新規事業・困難案件には積極的に参加
社内ニートっていってんのに矛盾してね？ とお思いの貴方、ちっと黙っとけ。社内ニートとなった貴方を守ってくれるもの、それは「イメージという幻影」以外にはありません。（２）のイメージ付けの延長で、ただの扱いづらいキモメン的な評価を避けるために、仕事には積極的なポーズをつねに取り続けましょう。ただし、責任者ではなくあくまでサポートとして。責任者はハイリスクハイリターンなので、失敗したとしても（それは大した問題じゃない）、一定の評価はもらえるサポート的なポジションがお勧め。諸葛孔明気分で「殿！敵は総崩れですぞ！」とか言っておけば、責任者もご満悦です。「おだてに乗りやすいタイプの上司」が責任者になったときは、すかざすそのプロジェクトに参加しましょう。おだてまくれば、勝手にどんどん走っていってくれます。失敗しても、元から「困難案件」なので貴方のせいにはならないはず。むしろ注意すべきは与し易い案件です。
（５）なんとなくネットを仕事みたいにする
どうせ一日中ネットに張り付いているんだろうから、日中ITmediaあたりで集めた、なんとな??く会社に関係ありそうな事案を、週に1回まとめて上司に提出してみたりするといいんじゃないかな（月曜の午前中あたりに「週末に調べ物をしててこんなニュースが…」というスタンス）。とりあえず、IT系のニュースはいろんな業界（とか顧客）に結び付くのでお得です。そのうち、社内でネットを見てても、仕事の調べ物をしてるんだとか思ってもらえるようになります。
（６）人間関係は広く浅く、上司はピンポイントで
リアルニートに一番欠けている能力「コミュ力」。これが社内ニートでは大切なスキルのひとつになります。決して過剰にはならない程度に、ツボを押さえたアプローチ。この距離感が大切なのですが、こればっかりは現場の空気を肌で感じながら調整していくしかありません。ポイントは「広く浅く、上司はピンポイント」。現場社員は年齢・キャリアを問わず広く浅く（仲良しになる必要はありません！笑顔で挨拶を交わす程度で十分）、上司に関しては"現場まで見えていないような、やや上級の上司"とピンポイントで親しくなれれば完璧です。社内の空気を読みながら、大変そうな同僚や部下に声を掛けたり差し入れをしたりする。実は、これが社内ニートで一番大変なポイント。他人に気を遣うとかまっぴらゴメンだぜ！とかいう中二病をこじらせたような人は、社内ニートとかせずに、まじめに仕事をすればいいんじゃないのかな。
（ ７）備えあれば憂いなし
ここまで来ると、あなたは社内ニートとしてかなり居心地の良い住処を見つけているはずです。しかし、過信は禁物。あなたの回りでは、厳しさを増す景気動向に多くのビジネスマン達が喘いでいます。あなたの同僚も例外ではありません。ぬくぬくとお茶を啜っている貴方を見とがめて、「いいかげんに仕事しろ！」と怒鳴り込んでくる場合もあるかも知れません（最悪の場合、直接上司にチクるかも！）。そんな時は務めて冷静に対処しましょう。ヒマに任せて作っておいた企画書（題材はなんでもいい）や、社内システム改善案などを見せて、「実は上司の勅命で内々にこの案件を進めている」と返してみてはいかが？このような状況に備えて、なんか適当な企画書を２本くらい用意しておくと安心です。また、怒鳴り込んでくるような同僚は、きっと仕事で余裕がなくなっている状況のはず。ここは飲みにでも誘って、悩みを聞いてやるふりをしてガス抜きをすれば問題ないでしょう。
（ ８）攻撃は最大の防御
上記のようなケースがあると、どうしてもその怒鳴り込んできた当人を中心に、貴方への疑念の包囲網が出来上がりがちです。上記のケースがあれば、即座に「逆包囲網」形成のための対応が必要です。当人への対応をしっかり終わらせた後で、「あいつ、大変みたいだからフォローしてやってね」と、彼の回りの人たちに彼を気遣うように促します。これで、彼が貴方に対しての不満を口にしたとしても、周囲の人たちには「心配してくれている人を悪し様に言う人間」としてインプットされます。ただ、彼を悪人に仕立てないよう、細心の注意が必要です。本当の悪人は貴方なのですから。自分はラクして、他人に気持ちよく働いてもらう。それが社内ニートの真骨頂です。
（９）記録に残る仕事より記憶に残る仕事を
社内ニートとはいえ、あなたが会社に在籍し続ければ、先輩や退職者からの引き継ぎ物件も入り、大して働かなくてもそれなりの売上を上げている状態になっているはずです（面倒なクライアントは即、元気な後輩に引き継ごう。金額が大きければ感謝までしてくれる！）。一部のしっかりした会社を除いて、中小企業の社内評価なんていいかげんもいいところです。同じ1000万円の売上であれば、より派手にいきましょう。200万円の10年契約より、1000万円の単年契約。取引先が10年後、ホントに続いているかなんて、誰にも分からないのですから。
（ １０）社内ニートで出世できるか？
結果的に言えば、出来ます。一代で財を成したような創業者社長は別ですが、たいがいの中小企業の社長は、人望と調整能力だけのボンクラです。決定権なんて、多くの場合、社長個人に委ねられるなんてことはありません。要は「いかに上手く人を使えるか」。社内ニートである貴方の最終的な目標は、「社長」と言う名の社内ニートなのです。

A 19 - year - old Italian tourist was ambushed by a knife - wielding thug as she headed to a party on the Upper East Side – but she managed to disarm the attacker by grabbing his blade with her bare hands and wrestling it away , police said yesterday .
Carolina Ottone , 19 , of Como , was at Lexington Avenue and 86th Street at about 11:30 p.m. Monday , when the brutal stranger approached her near a pharmacy .
He had been following her for about two blocks .
“ He took his knife outside his pocket and grabbed me from behind , ” she told The Post .
Then the thug put his left arm around Ottone ’s throat .
But he picked the wrong victim because the fiery Italian teen bravely fought back .
“ The only thing I could do in that moment was to try to grab the knife and try to push him away , ” she said .
She put her hand on the blade and pulled it out of his grasp , disregarding the searing pain .
“ I ’m just 19 , I did n’t want to die , ” she told The Post .
“ I just did what my instincts made me do .
I preferred to be without fingers instead of dying . ”
Ottone said she put a strong grip on the knife “ to make sure he would n’t slash my throat . ”
“ I really hurt myself .
I had surgery for that , not just stitches . ”
She said that she then tussled with the creep , and eventually wound up tumbling into a pile of garbage .
Luckily , the attacker had had enough of her resistance , and fled .
She does n’t know why she was targeted , but fears that the assailant had something on his mind other than robbery .
“ He did n’t steal anything from me , ” she said .
“ I had a purse in my hand .
I guess it was n’t his intention to steal anything . ”
She said the thug whispered something in her ear , but she does n’t know what he said .
Ottone tried to flag down passing cars , but none would stop .
But a doorman from a nearby building came to her aid .
“ He saw everything , and he helped me , and after 15 minutes , the police came , ” she said .
She was treated at Lenox Hill Hospital .
“ I could n’t feel my fingers anymore , ” she said .
“ I was afraid and in shock .
I was almost killed . ”
Ottone has been in the United States since April and was staying at the Upper East Side home of friend Julia Fox , whom she met in Italy .
Fox ’s father , Thomas , later went to the scene of the crime and obtained a video from the pharmacy that shows the attack taking place .
He said he is unhappy with the way that the police have handled the investigation and believes they did not take it seriously at first .
An NYPD spokesman said cops are “ working with the victim to solve the crime . ”

Кто бы мог подумать , что люди бывают так счастливы в день развод а
Lucky me .
I 've got an advance copy of the new Woody Allen film , Cassandra 's Dream , so I invite friends rounds for tea and a private screening .
We 're all Woody fans , and as usual there is a starry cast , this time including Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell .
We turn down the lights , and sit back in expectation .
And it is an absolute shocker .
One of the worst films I 've ever seen .
This was supposed to be a treat , and I feel embarrassed that I 've made people sit through it .
The lights come up , and nobody knows what to say .
Cassandra 's Dream is set in London , but for all Allen 's understanding of London and the nuances of Londoners ' language , it might as well have been Mars .
In the film , McGregor and his brother , played by Farrell , find a way out of their financial problems by becoming hit men .
The characters are toilet - paper thin , the story ridiculous , the coincidences and portentous allusions to Greek tragedy even more so .
Unfortunately , I 'm interviewing McGregor the next day .
As my friends leave , one by one they ask if I 'll tell him what we thought about the film .
I tell them it would be dishonest not to , but I 'll try to be tactful .
McGregor shakes my hand firmly .
He 's dressed in black , blessed with lovely teeth , and a handsome , laddish face .
He does n't appear to have aged since he made his name in the Danny Boyle films Shallow Grave and Trainspotting .
He just looks cooler , more sophisticated .
McGregor was born in 1971 , in Crieff , Scotland , to teacher parents .
He moved to London to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1988 and was six months short of graduation when he was given his first television role in Dennis Potter 's Lipstick on Your Collar .
He made a wonderful start to his movie career : within a year of Trainspotting , he was stripped and covered in Japanese calligraphaphy for Peter Greenaway 's erotic love story The Pillow Book , and headed up a poignant story about the last days of a colliery band in Brassed Off.
McGregor seemed an adventurous actor , keen to stretch himself with both populist and arthouse movies .
At the end of the 1990s , he won the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel series and since then there have been any number of forgettable movies - Rogue Trader , Eye of the Beholder , The Island .
Still , he became even more famous as a motorcycle adventurist in two TV series with his friend Charley Boorman : The Long Way Down and The Long Way Round .
The motorbike adventures made for successful TV series and books .
In The Long Way Round , he and Boorman travelled 19,000 miles from London to New York via Europe and Asia , and then in The Long Way Down they went 5,000 miles from John O'Groats to South Africa .
One episode began , perhaps ironically , " apart from two trucks and a camera crew , we 're on our own " .
Would McGregor prefer to have done it without a camera crew ?
" The actual crew do n't get in the way because we just travel with our mate Claudio [ cameraman Claudio von Planta ] , just the three of us , and we just meet the other crew every now and again .
I never felt it got in the way .
I do trips on my own , but I 've never done one as long as that on my own .
But I will do one day , I 'm sure of it . "
He is convinced the trips will help his acting because of the exposure to new experiences .
" Acting is only about real life if you 're representing real people in real situations , so by going out and seeing it , as opposed to just being on movie sets all the time . "
You can get removed from real life on movie sets ?
" Yeah , I suppose .
But I do n't do the trips because I want to escape life on the film sets .
It 's not the case for me at all , I 'm very happy being an actor . "
But filmwise there has been little for McGregor to be proud of this side of the millennium .
There has been the occasional gem - notably Young Adam ( 2003 ) , a bleak tale in which McGregor plays an amoral drifter .
But watching the Woody Allen film , I can't help feel his movie career has stunted or even regressed - at 37 , he 's still playing the twentysomething cheeky - chappy with little going on upstairs .
When we meet , he 's only just completed his run as Iago in Othello at the tiny Donmar Warehouse theatre in London , and he 's raving about it .
He says it 's been a great experience , an incredible journey , the toughest thing he 's done .
" It was hard work in terms of finding it in the first place , through rehearsal ...
There 's some kind of ownership that does n't come straightaway . "
He is surprisingly actorly , his words disappearing into a puff of smoke .
As he talks about Iago , you sense he has still not got his head round just how nasty the Shakespearean villain is .
" He 's despicable . "
Playing Iago has made him think more about the process of acting because Iago himself is a such a consummate actor .
" Only when he's on stage alone does he tell the truth .
It was bit of a headfuck to begin with . "
As we talk , I 'm aware of a stonking big elephant in the room - the Allen film .
I know I have to bring it up , but I want to do so politely .
" So what was it like to star in the worst movie ever made ? " I do n't ask .
" So what was it like working with Allen ? " I do ask .
Great , he says , wonderful , another rewarding journey .
" You go and meet him in New York for 15 seconds .
He says he just wants to meet you in the flesh and then he sends you the script , which I read and loved .
I loved the story , I think the story is fantastic - it's a strong , powerful story of normal guys faced with a huge drama .
I liked it very much . "
Blimey .
I think he means it .
Where does Allen rate among the directors he 's worked with ?
" I 'd work with him every time if I could .
Loved him to bits .
I love the way you have to raise your game for him .
He only likes three or four takes and you really have to nail it , so I found myself working very hard , particularly on the very long scenes . "
All the time he 's talking , I want to shout out : " But Ewan , do n't be daft , you did n't nail it because there was nothing there to nail .
The guy has lost it . "
" It is very tightly written , " he continues .
" But he says before you start shooting any scene : ' Remember these are just words that I wrote .
Say whatever you like . ' "
So there 's scope for improvisation ?
" Completely .
Except you would n't want to change any of his words .
Because it 's so well written you would n't want to change a line . "
I 'm trying to control myself , but finding it increasingly difficult .
I finally tell him I do n't like the film .
He asks why not , and I do n't know where to start .
Well , I say , do n't you feel it 's alien from his normal territory ?
" Not at all , because I do n't know what his normal territory is - because he does a film like Scoop and some comedies but then he also does film that are really hard , like Crimes and Misdemeanours - that 's about hiring a hitman is n't it ? "
Yes , but that was set in New York , which he understands .
He has n't got a clue about London and the dialogue is just awful .
" Right , right , right , " McGregor says diplomatically , but very probably meaning " Wrong , wrong , wrong . "
I apologise for being so forthright , but tell him I can't help myself , I 'm a passionate man .
" I do n't feel like that about it at all .
I think it 's a cracking story , in the same way that Match Point was a great story .
I 'm not going to disagree with you , because that 's the way you saw it , but I did n't have a problem with it . "
At the end of the movie , I tell him , we had to rewind to the opening credits to make sure it really was a Woody Allen film and that we had n't been taken for a ride .
" Right , right , right , " he says again , like a psychiatrist listening to a particularly disturbed patient .
I say it 's not your fault - it was the direction and the script .
" Is it because of the dialogue ?
Or the heaviness of the film ?
Or the tragedy of the film ? "
No , I say , it 's because it seems like a terrible stage production of a terrible film that never belonged to a time or place .
Oops .
Time to change the subject .
I ask about his family - McGregor has been married for 13 years to the French production designer Eve Mavrakis , and they have three daughters .
In 2006 , following the first motorcycle journey , they adopted a four - year - old Mongolian girl Jamiyan .
That must have been a life - changing trip , I say .
" I wo n't discuss that with you , so you could ask me another question . "
Why wo n't he discuss it ?
" I 've never discussed it with a journalist and I 'm not about to change that . "
Fair enough , but he could handle it a little more elegantly .
After all it is hardly the most intrusive question in the world ; he has agreed to be interviewed and how hard would it have been to say , " Yes , she has brought us much joy but I 'd prefer not to talk about her . "
So we return to the subject of his work .
What 's his favourite of the films he 's made ?
" I do n't have a favourite really .
I feel that they 're all stepping stones from one to the next . "
I tell him that he was once described as a " promiscuous " actor - he has taken so many roles , at times with scant regard for their quality .
Does he look back on some of the films , and think they were rubbish ?
" No . Because I do n't ...
Some of them just do n't work , some of them I 'm not very good in , some the films are n't very good . "
That 's honest of you , I say .
So which films do you think you are good in and which are you not so good ?
" No , I would n't . "
Go on !
" No , I 'm not going to , " Pleeeease !
" No , no , no ...
It does n't matter if they 're not successful at the box office .
It 's nice if people see them but it's not the be all and end all for me . "
His publicist pops her head round the corner .
He looks relieved .
" Five minutes , " he says .
" That 's the five - minute call . "
At one point McGregor tells me , " I do n't do things lightly , I do n't take a job then just phone it in , I 've never done that . "
But that is just what it feels as if he 's done in this interview - phoned in a performance .
As we wind up , he tells me why he loves acting .
" I think it 's valid , I like it , I think there 's great depth to it in terms of looking at the world , looking into people 's lives , trying to get to the bottom of what people do and why they do things . "
And as he 's talking , I 'm wondering how on earth I 'm supposed to get to the bottom of McGregor when he is prepared to reveal so little of himself .
But in a strange way , I think , perhaps he has shown more than he intended to .

Anticipating the Supreme Courts expected decision later this month in District of Columbia vs .
Heller , the case that will decide the constitutionality of a D.C. law restricting gun ownership rights , many analysts have turned to the founders  writings in an effort to understand the Second Amendment .
What analysts need to do recognizing that language and word usage change over time is turn to Americas first dictionary .
The Second Amendment states simply :  A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . 
The Supreme Court questioned whether the D.C. statute violated the  Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not affiliated with any state - regulated militia but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for private use in their homes . 
For the answer , turn to Noah Webster .
Known as the  Father of American Scholarship and Education ,  Webster believed that popular sovereignty in government must be accompanied by popular usage in language .
In A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language ,  published in 1806 , and  An American Dictionary of the English Language ,  published in 1828 and adopted by Congress as the American standard , Webster defined all the words in the Second Amendment .
 People  were  the commonality , as distinct from men of rank ,  and right was just claim ; immunity ; privilege . 
 All men have a right to secure enjoyment of life , personal safety , liberty and property ,  he wrote .
Thus , in the language of Websters time ,  the people  meant individuals and individuals have rights . 
 Keep was defined as to hold ; to retain ones power or possession ; not to lose or part with ; to have in custody for security or preservation . 
 Bear was to carry  or to wear ; name ; to bear arms in a coat . 
And arms  were defined as weapons of offense , or armor for defense and protection of the body . 
Only civilians would bear arms in a coat soldiers carried muskets in their hands , while officers carried pistols in holsters .
Thus the words keep and bear arms  suggest a right to hand - held arms that a person could bear ,  such as muskets , pistols and swords but not cannon and heavy ordnance that a person could not carry .
 Infringe was defined by Webster as to violate , either positively by contravention , or negatively by non-fulfillment or neglect of performance .
 Militia was defined as able bodied men organized into companies , regiments and brigades , with officers and required by law to attend military exercises on certain days only , but at other times left to pursue their usual occupations .
 Regulated  was defined as subject to rules or restrictions .
A well - regulated militia consisted of civilians , not soldiers .
What about the phrase being necessary to the security of a free state ?
 Necessary  was defined as that must be ; that cannot be otherwise ; indispensably requisite . 
 Security  was protection ; effectual defense or safety from danger of any kind and free as  In government , not enslaved ; not in a state of vassalage or dependence ; subject only to fixed laws , made by consent , and to a regular administration of such laws ; not subject to arbitrary will of a sovereign or lord . 
 State was defined as a political body , or body politic ; the whole body of people united under one government , whatever may be the form of government . 
A free state , we must conclude , therefore , encompasses the entire body politic .
During most of our history , an exhaustive analysis of the Second Amendment would never have been necessary .
The meaning of each word would have been obvious to citizens of the time .
It was only in the late 20th century that an Orwellian view of the Second Amendment gained currency .
Within this distorted language prism ,  the people  would come to mean the states or state - conscripted militia ; right  would mean government power ; keep  would no longer entail custody for security or preservation ; bear would not mean carry ; arms  would not include ordinary handguns and rifles , and infringe would not include prohibition .
The founders worded the Second Amendment in an easy - to - understand manner .
Individuals have a right to have arms in their houses and to carry them for protection , and the government may not violate that right .
Modern contortions of language cant change that meaning because we can still refer to Noah Webster .
Another day , another potential find to avoid the imminent fuel crisis .
On the docket today is Ernie Brookins ' hybrid drive system , which " captures , compresses , and stores wasted drive - train energy produced when a vehicle 's engine is running . "
Ernie here has concocted a hydraulic transmission that can reportedly power vehicles without the engine running all of the time , and he expects the solution to save motorists around 50 - percent in fuel costs .
Better still , the contraption could theoretically work on nearly any vehicle -- from school buses to grain trucks to high - octane Power Wheel Jeeps .
As these things seem to always go , the project has hit a roadblock without a source of funding , so if any VCs out there are looking for a somewhat solid place to shove $ 250,000 , give this man a ring .

The east Afghan region of Nangahar has seen violent protests after US forces raided a house , killing three people , arresting nine and seizing arms .
The US - led coalition said they had come under attack after targeting a " foreign fighter network " .
But local people said they were civilians and they blocked the main road to the Pakistani border .
Police opened fire and a number of demonstrators are reported to have been killed or injured .
Protesters blocking the main road to Pakistan carried the bodies of the three men killed .
Police who came to break up the five - hour demonstration say they shot into the air as a warning but the head of Nangahar provincial council says they fired into the crowd , killing two people and injuring a number of others .
A spokesman for the interior ministry said the government was investigating the villagers ' claims that civilians had been killed in the raid by US forces operating outside of Nato .
There are often differing accounts of operations against suspected militants by international troops and it is impossible to independently verify claims .
Civilian casualties are a contentious issue across Afghanistan .
International forces have been criticised by President Hamid Karzai for not being careful enough but Nato claims to have reduced the number of civilians killed in fighting with insurgents .
Every year , about 500 million people worldwide are infected with the parasite that causes dysentery , a global medical burden that among infectious diseases is second only to malaria .
In a new study appearing in the June 15 issue of Genes and Development , Johns Hopkins researchers may have found a way to ease this burden by discovering a new enzyme that may help the dysentery - causing amoeba evade the immune system .
" This is the first enzyme to be identified that looks like it could mediate immune system evasion , " says Sin Urban , Ph.D. , an assistant professor of molecular biology and genetics at Hopkins .
The EhROM1 enzyme , it turns out , is part of an ancient group of enzymes — they are found in every branch of life from bacteria to man — known as rhomboid enzymes .
In most animals , rhomboid enzymes seem to play a role in cell - to - cell communication , but a couple of years ago Urban found that malaria parasites use rhomboid enzymes for a more sinister purpose : to enter host cells uninvited .
That led his team to scour the DNA of other parasites to see if any of them also had genes that encode rhomboid enzymes .
They found that the dysentery - causing amoeba Entamoeba histolytica contains one rhomboid enzyme and named it EhROM1 .
" Plasmodia , the parasites that cause malaria , grab onto a host cell and push their way in , " explains Urban .
" Once inside they use rhomboid enzymes to cut themselves loose . "
But amoebas do n't enter cells to cause dysentery , so Urban 's team set out to figure out how these parasites use EhROM1 .
They first identified protein targets cut by EhROM1 by looking for amoeba proteins that had structural signatures similar to those cut by malaria rhomboids .
They found these signatures in a family of proteins — lectins — that are found on cell surfaces .
The researchers put both proteins into cells and verified that EhROM1 does cut one particular lectin , and the more EhROM1 they added , the more lectin pieces resulted .
Every cell has on its surface proteins recognizable by sentries of the immune system that constantly survey the body for intruders , and amoebas are no different .
To evade the immune system , amoebas shift all their surface proteins to the rear end of the cell then , like a dump truck , shed these proteins into the fluid around them .
Lectin , it turns out , is one of the proteins that during immune evasion moves to the rear and is shed by the amoeba .
So collaborating researchers at Stanford University then looked to see if EhROM1 follows lectin and sure enough found that EhROM1 clusters at the cap — the cluster of surface proteins waiting to be shed .
" We 're excited to see if EhROM1 plays a specific role in the cap shedding during immune evasion , " says Urban .
What 's more , the EhROM1 enzyme is remarkably similar to those found in malaria parasites , suggesting that any potential drugs targeting EhROM1 might be able to treat two of the world 's most prevalent diseases .
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Burroughs - Wellcome Fund .
Authors on the paper are Leigh Baxt and Upinder Singh of Stanford University , and Rosanna Baker and Urban of Hopkins .

Sprint is n’t just losing millions of customers and billions of dollars , it ’s in the midst of pioneering a new management philosophy .
We ’ll call it the Three - Megabit Monte .
Similar to the venerable street con , this is where Sprint leads a customer down a confusing line of lies and inflated charges in the hopes of making a buck .
[ digg=http://digg.com/business_finance/Sprint_Losing_Money_says_Gouge_the_Customers]
As detailed by Allen Harkleroad ( who is one wrathful Southerner ) on his web site , Sprint has been charging him almost four times the price of the amount it pays the local telephone company for two T - 1 access lines .
That ’s about a 75 percent gross margin .
But what really drove Harkleroad around the bend was being lied to by a Sprint salesman , who claimed that the company was charged $ 1,998 for the T - 1s ( the phone company , on the other hand , said it charges some $ 500 ) .
Harkleroad has since switched providers and pays about $ 1,500 less per month .
But he ’s not done with Sprint yet .
He figures the company owes him about $ 56,000 ( for charging him so much ) , and he wants to get paid .
Harkleroad also wants to encourage the rest of Sprint ’s customer base on the access side to take a close look at their bills .
And the icing on this cake ?
He alleges that Sprint charged him for providing 3 mbps download speed , but only provided 2.5 mbps , saying that the difference was lost to overhead .
And that ’s where the the Three - Megabit Monte philosophy gets it name .
For more examples of Sprint ’s philosophy in action , check out this story , this story and this one .
There has been much rejoicing recently at the process whereby , apparently , an ISO committee takes full control of OOXML .
But you know , that story is entirely irrelevant .
It will have no effect on what implementors of OOXML , including Microsoft , should or will actually do .
The story ’s ending will I think be mostly tawdry .
Oh , and I have some OOXML news that I think is important , but that I do n’t think anyone else has reported .
First , a bit of back - story .
What ECMA - 376
Is · Microsoft XMLified the internal file formats of the most recent Office release and cooked up a specification with the help of some , um , “ partners ” , and took it to a standards - organization - for - hire , the result being ECMA - 376 .
The result is not a particularly good XML document format , and ECMA - 376 is not a very good specification , but it has a really important virtue : it describes the format you need to read and write to interoperate with an office suite that Microsoft ships 70 to 100 million copies of every year ; there are a lot of ’em out there .
What OOXML Is · The ISO process , brutal and corrupt as it was , has been covered to death by everyone .
Its output , soon to be known as ISO / IEC 29500 , differs from ECMA - 376 in two ways .
There has been a substantial amount of cleanup of things that were specified in an ugly or broken or stupid way in ECMA - 376 .
There has been a bunch of XML markup added , which is blessed by ISO / IEC 29500 but not ECMA - 376 .
We need a name to talk about this new stuff ; let ’s call it “ The ISO Delta ” .
The ISO Delta ·
The important thing is this :
The ISO Delta is completely irrelevant to the marketplace .
It is not implemented in the shipping Microsoft products .
Microsoft may choose to implement some portion of it in some future release of some product , or they may not .
Given
Office ’s release and adoption cycle , it ’s very unlikely that any pieces of the delta they decide to implement will be widely deployed in anything less than five years .
Thus , if you write OOXML software and you generate ISO - Delta markup , it wo n’t be usable by the deployed base of software .
In fact , we have no information as to how gracefully Office will react ; will it bypass such markup or explode messily ?
I ’m not optimistic .
So , implementors should not generate ISO - Delta markup .
Implementors also need not bother reading ISO - Delta markup , because it is entirely absent in the deployed base of documents , which in fact conform to ECMA - 376 .
But Is n’t the Delta an Improvement ?
· Yes , but that ’s irrelevant .
If what we want is a good XML Office Document format , we already have one , in the form of ODF .
OOXML is n’t interesting for reasons of quality or innovation , it ’s interesting because it maps onto this huge existing inventory of high - value documents .
Well , except to the Delta , which does n’t .
Spotting the Delta · So , since ECMA - 376 is mostly a dead letter now , implementors have a problem .
How are they going to spot the ISO - Delta pieces which they can safely ignore , and focus on the ECMA - 376 pieces which correspond to reality ?
Well , it turns out that this is covered .
I ’d like to reproduce one of the resolutions adopted by the BRM :
Resolution 21 : The BRM decides to instruct the Editor to incorporate an informative specification of the following , with a reference to it from the Scope : All XML elements which appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA - 376:2006
All XML elements which do not appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA - 376:2006
All XML attributes which appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA - 376:2006
All XML attributes which do not appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA - 376:2006
All enumeration values which appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA - 376:2006
All enumeration values which do not appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA - 376:2006
All simple types which appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA - 376:2006
All simple types which do not appear in ISO / IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA - 376:2006
This was originally my idea .
Actually , my original idea was that ISO should simply accept all changes which represented corrections to ECMA - 376 , and reject all those which constituted enhancements , since they ’d be irrelevant for the reasons listed above .
I could n’t sell that , but there was pretty well no resistance to Plan B , which was to at least make the ISO Delta obvious .
I ( and , I think , the community of implementors ) owe thanks to my colleagues on the Canadian delegation , and to Brian Jones and Jean Paoli of Microsoft , for getting behind this and cleaning it up , and to Alex Brown , for deftly making sure it got a chance , at the last possible moment , to be voted in .
It ’s Kind of Sad ·
The coverage suggests that future enhancements to 29500 , as worked through by a subcommittee of a subcommittee of a standards committee , are actually going to have some influence on Microsoft .
Um , maybe there ’s an alternate universe in which Redmond - based program managers and developers are interested in the opinions of a subgroup of ISO / IEC JTC 1/SC 34 , but this is n’t it .
I suppose they ’ll probably show up to the meetings and try to act interested , but it ’s going to be a sideline and nobody important will be there .
What Microsoft really wanted was that ISO stamp of approval to use as a marketing tool .
And just like your mother told you , when they get what they want and have their way with you , they ’re probably not gonna call you in the morning .

Space Invaders was the first arcade game before Pinball Machines and other Games came along to work its way out of seedy conservative adults who were certain the games soured the minds of their youngsters .
Residents of Mesquite , Texas pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible - belt community .
The game was so amazingly popular in Japan that it caused a coin shortage until the country 's
Yen supply was quadrupled .
Entire arcades were opened in Japan specifically for this game .
Space Invaders was released in Japan for the Super Famicom , to my knowledge its the same thing as Space Invaders for Super Gameboy .
Many incidents of juvenile crime surrounded the release of this game .

For the attentive in attendance , you likely noticed that none of Toshiba 's newly announced laptops ( yes , even the absurdly powerful Qosmio rigs ) have built - in Blu-ray drives .
Like , there 's not even an option .
When questioned about the obvious oversight ( ahem ) , Tosh 's Europe CEO Alan Thompson noted that " Blu-ray was just one of the many ways that you can get HD content and is not required for accessing HD content . "
Furthermore , it seems as if the outfit is continuing on in its pursuit to develop the best DVD upconverting technology in the whole wide world , as it explained to the press in London that its forthcoming technology would " fill in the gaps " and " add resolution . "
Company representatives even remarked that " Blu-ray was only a storage medium , " and reiterated that BD " was n't the only way to view high - def content . "
It 's one thing to bow out gracefully , pick up the pieces and get on with life .
It 's another thing to douse yourself in ignorance and pretend that Blu-ray ( let alone HD DVD ) never happened Read - Toshiba 's London press event Read - Toshiba Europe CEO comments
The Demise of Criminal Legal Aid : Jan Davies explains how a suspect 's right to legal representation is being curtailed - and why the public has taken no notice
Posted by Jan Davies
Jan Davies - a solicitor in the criminal courts for over 20 years and the author of The Criminal Advocate 's Survival Guide - shows that a suspect 's right to legal representation is fast being curtailed .
Yet this important change to our whole system of justice has gone largely unnoticed .
There are reports of chaos in many police stations as a result of the Legal Services Commission insisting on calls for legal assistance being channelled through a call centre .
Some may remember the Legal Services Commission , or LSC as it is commonly known , as the Legal Aid Board : it is the body which administers the legal aid scheme .
Call centre staff have often been using contact details which are out of date and bungling referrals through insufficient knowledge of what is required .
LSC spokesmen have dismissed the problems as teething difficulties , but the muddle was all predictable .
( See my earlier , CDS Direct - call centre advice for suspects in custody : Jan Davies explains how a little noticed reform of the legal aid system will undermine a suspects ' right to legal representation ) .
The rules for the use of the call centre are farcical : for example , if a solicitor is instructed by a suspect 's family that he is in police custody , they can attend without going through the call centre : if they are contacted by the man himself they should not .
The Criminal Law Solicitors Association is collecting the tales of inefficiency and encouraging its members to make formal complaints .
Unfortunately , this area in which criminal legal aid work is being made inefficient is not the only way in which the LSC 's constant interference is causing difficulties .
Its contracts for barristers to work on very high costs cases ( frauds and other cases which result in lengthy trials ) have been treated with contempt by members of the Bar as inequitable .
Out of 2,300 barristers who were offered contracts to undertake such work only 203 have signed up .
The question the taxpayer has to ask is whether because a service is publicly funded it should be micro-managed in the interests of control , even where this results in additional cost , and whether the independence of our legal system is worth preserving .
Turning what is a public serving provided by private firms into a nationalised service has been shown to be expensive , and it is surely dubious whether those prosecuted by the State should have the State to defend them .
On 14th January 2008 new contracts for criminal legal aid work came into force .
All solicitors ' firms doing such work had to indicate by 31st October 2007 that they would be prepared to sign the contracts , and had to give this indication before the contract had been sent to them , In July new contracts of 18 months ' duration only are to be issued and then the system is to be plunged into competitive tendering .
The LSC prefer to call this Best Value Tendering , presumably on the basis that this sounds softer , but the process is to be competitive and is intended to drive prices down .
14 % of solicitors ' firms who were doing criminal work are said to have decided not to bother continuing .
Some new firms have signed up , but these are likely to be sole practitioners or very small firms fragmenting from those who have given up altogether , operating on shoestrings from home or with very short leases and intending to give up when competitive tendering is introduced .
On 29th November 2007 the Commission issued a press release .
It was an interesting piece of spin .
The Commission described a Court of Appeal judgment as a welcome " clarification " and said :
This now enables us to move forward with greater certainty .
You could be forgiven if you read the press release at speed for thinking that the court case had almost been the Commission 's idea , but the reality was that the Commission had been sued by a respected firm of solicitors in Reading , Dexter Montague , and also by the Law Society and had lost on all points .
The contract for civil work contained clauses which allowed the Commission to amend it almost at will .
While it is inevitable that during the life of a long contract there will have to be some amendments in response to changing circumstances , the Commission had given itself a very wide power to amend it indeed , to the point where they would be able to re-write the contract .
The Court of Appeal described the contracts as " an extreme case " , and the Commission will now have to pay not only the costs of the entire case , including the costs of the Law Society , but also damages .
It will be interesting to know what the ultimate cost of all this will be to the taxpayer .
You might have thought that having lost so decidedly in court the Commission would have taken the opportunity to reflect and to consider how the judgment impacts upon clauses at present in the criminal contracts issued in January .
There was no sign of any humility in their press release , which contained the usual buzz phrases about a " sustainable " legal aid system and " progressing " with reforms .
Even after the court judgment the criminal contracts still contained a clause which said that the Commission may " at our discretion " add to the specification of what is required under the contract " at any time " .
There were provisions for consultation to take no longer than 6 weeks , or even as little as 21 days , but the amendments could be with individual contractors as well as generally .
Put bluntly they wished to amend the contract whenever they felt like it and with whomsoever they pleased .
They also wished to terminate the contracts at short notice , but said they would do so :
only when we consider it necessary or desirable to do so in order to facilitate a reform of the Legal Aid Scheme .
So it would make no difference whether a firm is providing a good service , and the contracts do not even give security for the six months of their duration .
It is impossible to run a business with this uncertainty .
Firms with long office leases will be seeking to escape from them .
Staff will not be offered any sort of job security .
No sensible person is going to want to enter criminal legal aid work .
The Commission talks about firms needing to " restructure " , by which they mean sacking the experienced and qualified staff and employing low paid people to do the bulk of the work .
A person with a problem is unlikely to see a solicitor at the start of his case .
In 1994 Mike McConville , Lee Bridges and others published Standing Accused .
It was widely read , particularly by the Legal Aid Board which was said to have funded the research .
The book describes the behaviour of what I would call the bucket firms - firms which employ a large number of unqualified staff , in which files are passed around like unwanted parcels and there is little care of cases .
The abuses it described were very familiar to those associated with large firms , yet the book 's illogical conclusion was that large firms were to be preferred .
This theme has been taken up enthusiastically by the Legal Services Commission , although as the House of Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee noted in a very thorough and thoughtful report published in May 2007 , there is no evidence to support the contention that quality is provided by the large firms .
In any event , although the Commission may want to deal with large firms , the reality is that they are not there .
Lord Carter noted in his report published in 2006 that 33 % of criminal legal aid firms in 2004 - 5 had an income of less than � 100,000 : it can be presumed that these were either sole practitioners or very small firms indeed .
Criminal work and established large firms do not mix .
In a traditional firm the partners are concerned with fee targets .
The criminal work is rightly seen as low paid and the partners will not want the Commission 's auditors crawling all over their office , ticking boxes and rifling through files and telling them how they should run their business .
The sole practitioner will typically be someone who began his career in a traditional firm , left when that firm decided to give up crime and set up on his own , being prepared to exchange a low income for the satisfaction of running his own ship .
( I am using the word " his " to describe the solicitor , but of course it could also be " her " .
Women who have found it difficult to achieve partnership in a male dominated firm have made a success of running their own small business . )
The situation is different in London and in some major cities like Liverpool , but in the small or medium sized town you are unlikely to find a large criminal firm .
The patchwork of small firms has served the system well , and there is considerable anger at the prospect of being subjected to a competitive tendering process which will undermine the good relations that firms that have with each other .
Those who maintain that large means quality usually have no knowledge of the informal working relationships between small firms .
We all have each other 's home numbers and can easily get help with any police station or court emergency .
I would not expect my doctor or dentist to have to submit to competitive tendering .
I know that my doctor is not a businessman but first and foremost a professional , and I want him to concentrate on my health .
Similarly , I would not want my dentist - always supposing that I could find someone who still did NHS work - to be looking over his shoulder at auditors rather than concentrating on my teeth .
I would also know that once a doctor has been refused a contract he is not going to be there the next time there is a round of competitive tendering - and it is proposed that competitive tendering for legal aid contracts should be every three years .
But sadly , the general public has little regard for solicitors .
It is not until a member of their family is in trouble with the police that anyone realizes that solicitors do provide a service .
People may be shocked by the treatment of lawyers in Zimbabwe or Pakistan , but their concern rarely extends to interest in our own legal system .
Personally , I am considering setting up in business on Brighton Pier , or some other suitable place , and telling fortunes .
It would be less stressful and possibly more secure .

Singing Science Records
When I was a kid my parents got this six - LP set of science - themed folk songs for my sister and me .
They were produced in the late 1950s / early 1960s by Hy Zaret and Lou Singer .
Zaret 's main claim to fame is writing the lyrics to the classic " Unchained > Melody " for the 1955 movie " Unchained " , later recorded by the Righteous Brothers and more recently used in " Ghost " .
Three of the albums ( the best three in my opinion ) were performed by Tom Glazer , semi-famous 1940s folk musician and somewhat of a lyricist himself ( he wrote " On Top of Spaghetti " ) .
The Singing Science lyrics were very Atomic
Age , while the tunes were generally riffs on popular or genre music of the time .
We played them incessantly .
In February 1998 I found the LPs in my parents ' basement .
I cleaned them up , played them one last time on an old turntable , and burned them onto a set of three CD - R discs .
In December 1999 I read the songs back off the CDs and encoded them into MP3 .
I used to host the MP3s here , but I do n't have to any more because ...
...as of October 2013 , the albums are BACK IN PRINT !
You can order a six - CD box set from Amazon right now !
Give it to all your siblings for Hanukkah / Christmas !

Artist Emma
Hack creates beautiful designs that blend her models into their surroundings .
The effects of this artwork kind of looks like 3D human wallpaper .
Emma , who lives in Australia , painstakingly paints the patterns onto the models by hand .
While most of her designs take about 9 hours , she has spent up to 19 hours on just one of her designs .
Emma is a body artist that has been creating designs for over 20 years .
She began as a teenager by painting on children ’s faces and found she was pretty good at it .
She eventually went on to college where she studied make - up artistry and discovered she liked body painting .
She has won many awards for her artwork .
Wallpaper designed by Florence Broadhurst , a designer in the 1930 ’s , was Emma ’s inspiration for her wallpaper art .
She has currently made 29 of these beautiful creations .
She never really has trouble finding any models .
When people see her amazing work they are always quick to offer their body for the sake of her art .
I think it would be fun to have my house designed this way .
People would come over and think they see something move out of the corner of their eye .
While quickly denying that I ’d seen anything , I ’d walk them past the artwork at just the right time for a model to jump out at them .
Yeah , then no one would ever come over to my place ever again .
Ahh , the life of a hermit .
My favorite design is the crocodile wallpaper .
What about you ?
Many thanks to Emma Hack .

Operation : Human Shield – Scientology ’s Latest Means of Suppressing Criticism Posted by RB on June 8 , 2008 · 8 Comments
In the following absolutely hilarious video , OT ( Operating Thetan ) level Scientologists create a human chain to block the view of other Scientologists of Tory “ Magoo ” Christman and her protest sign encouraging Scientology to stop destroying families .
This has got to be one of the cheesiest means of suppressing criticism that I have ever seen .
In her 100th YouTube video , in addition to discussing a number of other things , Tory discusses how ridiculous and hilarious this human chain operation really was .
Lets all collectively laugh at Scientology , both for this gaff and in general ….
Seriously .
Energy companies are planning to revive a polluting technology developed by the Nazis to replace dwindling supplies of oil with synthetic fuels derived from coal .
Senior industry figures told a high - level conference in Paris this week that coal - to - liquids ( CTL ) technology could fuel cars and aircraft for decades to come .
Green campaigners reacted with alarm because the process produces twice as much greenhouse gas as using oil .
Supporters say much of the carbon pollution could be captured and stored underground , and that the synthetic fuel burns cleaner than conventional diesel .
More than 270 people from 28 countries attended the two - day Paris meeting , reflecting growing worldwide interest in the technology .
China will open its first large - scale CTL plant later this year , and similar projects are under way or planned in the United States , India , Botswana , Australia , Germany , Poland , Germany and Indonesia .
Experts say the technology could contribute as much energy as biofuels do within 20 years .
At present , only South Africa uses the technology to produce fuel on a large scale - a legacy of apartheid - era oil sanctions .
Germany relied on CTL to run its tanks and planes on domestic coal stocks during the second world war .
Gerald Doucet , secretary general of the World Energy Council , said : " The future is very optimistic for coal - to - liquids .
Coal is back in more ways than one . "
Despite the recent focus on alternatives such as wind , solar and nuclear power , coal remains the fastest - growing energy source in the world .
China alone added the equivalent of the entire UK national grid in coal power stations last year .
Most coal is burnt to generate electricity .
In theory , converting it to liquid could see it replace oil as an energy source for transport .
A study last year by the Chinese Academy of Sciences said : " Production of liquid fuels from coal is , practically , the most feasible route to cope with the dilemma in oil supply . "
Du Minghua , deputy director of the China Shenhua CTL research institute , said the country had an " urgent need " to develop the technology .
He said a further seven commercial - scale plants were planned and China could produce 30 m tonnes of liquid fuels each year by 2020 .
CTL has been more expensive than using oil , but analysts suggest it could become viable if the oil price stays above $ 25 - $ 40 ( £ 13 - £ 20 ) a barrel .
Khurelbaatar Chimed , minister of fuel and energy for Mongolia , said the recent jump in oil price had damaged its emerging economy , and that it was turning to fuels from coal as a cheaper alternative .
The US air force is very interested and recently flew a B - 52 bomber on jet fuel made from coal .
It wants to complete testing its entire fleet on the fuel within three years .
Bill Anderson , assistant secretary of the US Air Force , told the conference the move would force the RAF and French Air Force to follow , because nations share fuel supplies during operations .
" They need to know they can fly on it , " he said .
Gary Kendall , a senior energy analyst with the green group WWF , said the CTL push was a backward step .
" If the oil price gets high enough then you can turn a Persian rug into diesel , but that does n't make it a good idea , " he said .
" I ca n't imagine a more damaging fuel for the climate . "

Robert Mugabe 's aides have told Zimbabwe 's opposition leaders that he is prepared to give up power in return for guarantees , including immunity from prosecution for past crimes .
But the aides have warned that if the Movement for Democratic Change does not agree then Mugabe is threatening to declare emergency rule and force another presidential election in 90 days , according to senior opposition sources .
The opposition said the MDC leadership is in direct talks with the highest levels of the army but it is treating the approach with caution because they are distrustful of the individuals involved and calling for direct contact with the president , fearing delaying tactics .
Those fears were reinforced last night when at one point Zimbabwe 's election commission abruptly halted the release of official results from the Saturday 's election for " logistical reasons " and the police raided opposition offices .
The MDC 's presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , has already claimed victory on the basis of his party 's tally of the count at polling stations .
The police arrested at least two foreign journalists , one from Britain and a New York Times correspondent , who are banned from Zimbabwe under draconian media laws .
A senior MDC source said " the ball is rolling " in persuading Mugabe to recognise defeat in the presidential election after negotiations with the security establishment and contacts with high levels of Zanu - PF .
The source said the party was approached by senior Zanu - PF officials who said they were speaking for Mugabe and that he is prepared to resign if there are guarantees that he and senior aides would not be prosecuted .
He said there were other demands which he did not specify but the approach was being treated with caution because officials who negotiated for Mugabe in the past had offered commitments which the president had not fulfilled .
The MDC wants to talk to Mugabe directly .
Another MDC official said the party is maintaining a tough negotiating stance in contacts with other elements of the ruling party and had refused a Zanu - PF demand for up to four seats in the cabinet .
He said the MDC had rejected power sharing offers because it had won the presidential race outright even though the electoral commission has yet to start releasing results .
" We can not share power when we 've won .
If you 've won the cup you do n't share it , " the opposition official said .
But senior Zanu - PF officials are attempting to pressure the opposition with the threat of a run-off presidential election by ensuring Tsvangirai 's proportion of the vote falls below 50 % and then delaying the second round .
It should be held within 21 days but the ruling party is threatening to postpone it for three months during which Mugabe 's term in office would expire and he would extend his rule by emergency decree .
The MDC 's leadership has also opened direct talks with the " top , top " of the army according to the source .
The source said that the military leadership is looking for " guarantees for their conditions of service " and to keep farms confiscated from whites provided they are productive .
The MDC said it has no problems with those issues .
Another MDC source said the party had assured Zanu - PF and security officials they would not be prosecuted for past crimes .
The opposition believes the approaches mark a recognition by Mugabe that support for him within Zanu - PF has eroded since the election .
Now , important elements of Mugabe 's party are willing to do a deal because they realise the election results could not be manipulated to overturn a clear opposition victory and that there is little hope of winning a second round of presidential elections without resorting to violence or fraud .
Mugabe 's position was further undermined on Wednesday when Zanu - PF lost control of parliament for the first time since independence in 1980 .
Publicly Zanu - PF has vowed to " fight on " and the opposition said it was still preparing for a second round of elections if Mugabe did not bow to pressure to go .
Bright Matonga , Zanu - PF 's deputy information minister , took a defiant position , saying that the party had " let the president down " by not winning Saturday 's election .
" Zanu - PF is ready for a run-off , we are ready for a resulting victory , " he said .
" In terms of strategy , we only applied 25 % of our energy into this campaign ... ( The run-off ) is when we are going to unleash the other 75 % that we did not apply in the first case . "
The MDC fears that what will be unleashed is an extremely violent campaign because that is its last hope Zanu - PF has of curbing support for the opposition .

Webb , a descendent of Confederate officers , also voiced sympathy for the notion of state sovereignty as it was understood in the early 1860s .

Webb 's rebel roots :
An affinity for Confederacy
Barack Obama ’s vice presidential vetting team will undoubtedly run across some quirky and potentially troublesome issues as it goes about the business of scouring the backgrounds of possible running mates .
But it ’s unlikely they ’ll find one so curious as Virginia Democratic Sen.
Jim Webb ’s affinity for the cause of the Confederacy .
Webb is no mere student of the Civil War era .
He ’s an author , too , and he ’s left a trail of writings and statements about one of the rawest and most sensitive topics in American history .

He has suggested many times that while the Confederacy is a symbol to many of the racist legacy of slavery and segregation , for others it simply reflects Southern pride .
In a June 1990 speech in front of the Confederate Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery , posted on his personal website , he lauded the rebels ’ “ gallantry , ” which he said “ is still misunderstood by most Americans . ”
Webb , a descendant of Confederate officers , also voiced sympathy for the notion of state sovereignty as it was understood in the early 1860s , and seemed to suggest that states were justified in trying to secede .
“ Most Southern soldiers viewed the driving issue to be sovereignty rather than slavery , ” he said .
“ Love of the Union was palpably stronger in the South than in the North before the war — just as overt patriotism is today — but it was tempered by a strong belief that state sovereignty existed prior to the Constitution and that it had never been surrendered . ”
Webb expanded on his sentiments in his well - received 2004 book , “ Born Fighting : How the Scots - Irish Shaped America , ” which portrays the Southern cause as at least understandable , if not wholly laudable .
“ The venerable Robert E . Lee has taken some vicious hits , as dishonest or misinformed advocates among political interest groups and in academia attempt to twist yesterday ’s America into a fantasy that might better service the political issues of today , ” he wrote .
“ The greatest disservice on this count has been the attempt by these revisionist politicians and academics to defame the entire Confederate Army in a move that can only be termed the Nazification of the Confederacy . ”
As in the Confederate Memorial speech , Webb suggests in his book that relatively few Southerners were slaveholders and that the war was fought over state sovereignty , which in the eyes of many at the time included the right to secede from the national government .
“ The states that had joined the Union after the Revolution considered themselves independent political entities , much like the countries of Europe do today , ” Webb wrote .
“ The 10th Amendment to the Constitution reserved to the states all rights not specially granted to the federal government , and in their view the states had thus retained their right to dissolve the federal relationship . ”
There ’s nothing scandalous in the paper trail , nothing that on its face would disqualify Webb from consideration for national office .
Yet it veers into perilous waters since the slightest sign of support or statement of understanding of the Confederate cause has the potential to alienate African - Americans who are acutely sensitive to the topic .
Ron Walters , director of the African American Leadership Center at the University of Maryland and a professor of political science there , said Webb ’s past writings and comments on the Confederacy could dampen enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket , should he appear on it .
“ Unless he is able to explain it , it would raise some questions , ” Walters said .
Edward H. Sebesta , co-author of the forthcoming “ Neo- Confederacy : A Critical Introduction ” ( University of Texas Press ) , said Webb ’s views express an unhealthy regard for a political system that propped up and defended slavery .
His book , in fact , will cite Webb as an example of the mainstreaming of neo-Confederacy ideas into politics , said Sebesta , a widely cited independent historical researcher and author of the Anti-Neo - Confederate blog .
“ I do n’t think people have thought through the implications of how his ideas have racial overtones , even if they are inadvertent , ” Sebesta said .
Webb ’s office declined to comment for this story .
Kristian Denny Todd , who served as communications director in Webb ’s 2006 Senate campaign , said his remarks about the Confederacy should be viewed in the context of paying tribute to his Scots - Irish Southern forbears and his military sense of duty .
“ He does n’t defend the war at all or the practice of slavery .
He does make arguments about why the South seceded , ” said Denny Todd .
“ The individual Confederate soldier , for the most part , did not own slaves .
They were n’t wealthy landowners .
Webb simply talks about why these men — mostly poor and white — stepped up and answered the call to serve . ”
The distinctions Webb makes , however , tend not to receive a full airing in the heat of political debate .
Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft ’s praise for Southern Partisan magazine , a journal sympathetic to the Confederate cause , helped delay his confirmation early in the Bush administration .
Other issues related to the Confederate legacy have proved equally thorny for politicians on both sides of the aisle .
Questions surrounding the Confederate flag contributed to the defeat of Gov. David Beasley ( R - S.C. ) in 1998 and Gov. Roy Barnes ( D - Ga. ) in 2002 .
In the 2004 Democratic presidential primary campaign , Democratic candidates awkwardly struggled with an NAACP - led economic boycott of South Carolina that was designed to force the removal of a Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds .
Later in the campaign , Democrat Howard Dean drew criticism for claiming that he wanted to be the “ candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks . ”
Four years earlier , in his first presidential run , Sen .
John McCain wavered about the Confederate flag removal issue in South Carolina but later apologized for his equivocation .
In advance of the South Carolina primary this year , he issued a full - throated call to take down the divisive symbol , joining the Democratic presidential candidates who took the same position .
Webb ’s comments about the Confederacy already received some airing during his successful 2006 upset victory over then - Sen.
George Allen ( R - Va. ) , when a smattering of news outlets and blogs noted his past statements and writing about the Civil War era .
Most prominent was a May 2006 Richmond Times - Dispatch article revisiting Webb ’s Confederate Memorial speech , which ran about a month before Webb ’s Democratic primary victory and proved to be a one - day story .
In a different context , Webb ’s record might very well have made a bigger splash .
But it was largely overshadowed by other developments .
At the time , it was widely perceived that Webb had more damaging exposure from his 1979 Washingtonian magazine article titled “ Women Ca n’t Fight , ” in which Webb , an ex-Marine , described one of the Naval Academy ’s coed dorms as “ a horny woman ’s dream ” and argued against allowing women to take combat roles .
Then the New Republic and other news organizations ran stories suggesting that Allen had his own racial insensitivity problems , featuring recollections by long - ago acquaintances of racial slurs , a noose that hung in his law office and a high school fascination with Confederate paraphernalia that continued into adulthood .
Webb generally remained silent during Allen ’s Confederacy controversy , focusing instead on the Republican ’s support for the Iraq war and other issues .
Three months later , Allen ’s caught - on - video reference to a Webb campaign volunteer as “ macaca ” took center stage and set in place a campaign narrative that dominated media coverage until his narrow defeat .
Webb won overwhelming support from black voters — 85 percent — who accounted for 16 percent of all voters , according to exit polls .
Congressman Robert Wexler —
Our effort to hold the Bush / Cheney Administration accountable has taken another dramatic step forward .
Last night , Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced the first Articles of Impeachment ever to be introduced against President Bush .
It includes , in total , thirty - five Articles detailing this Administration ’s blatant abuse of power .
Today , I enthusiastically co-sponsored this vitally important bill .
I am grateful for Dennis ’ leadership on this issue and for the steadfast support that countless Americans have given to both of our efforts to redeem our government and expose the crimes of Bush and Cheney .
I will now expand my efforts to secure impeachment hearings in the Judiciary Committee for these new Articles of Impeachment against President George W. Bush .
Many of the charges against President Bush are well known “ “ and would shock the conscience of everyday Americans if only the national media would be willing to report on these stark facts .
The Articles present a stunning narrative of offenses that have go well beyond previous crimes committed by any US chief executive .
In fact no President or Vice President in history has done more to undermine our constitution .
These charges are broad , with 35 separate allegations including the deliberate lies regarding WMDs that led us to war and the approval of illegal wiretapping of American citizens .
The Articles also include new allegations of high crimes “ “ including the explicit approval for high Administration officials to violate treaties and US law banning the use of torture .
The Democratic Party gained a majority in the House and Senate due in large part to our promises to end the corruption of the Republican majority and to hold the Administration accountable to the law .
This courageous bill is a crucial step towards fulfilling this promise , but “ “ like the Articles against Cheney “ “ they require your support to convince Democrats and open - minded Republicans to support this bold but necessary action .
Time is running out so we must work together to spread the message and apply pressure .
First , please encourage your friends and family members to sign up at WexlerWantsHearings.com “ “ as it will allow us to keep in touch with you and speak to a wider audience .
If you have n’t yet put in your phone and address , please sign up again , as we will be doing telephone town halls in the near future .
Second , call your representative and urge them to support Impeachment hearings .
Finally , contact newspapers , news stations , and your favorite bloggers and urge them to report on this movement .
We need to keep Impeachment a significant news story until the Democratic leadership sees the value in it .
McClellan Agrees to Testify :
I was pleased to inform you yesterday that Judiciary Committee Chairman Conyers met my call to have Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan testify under oath .
I am thrilled to inform you that McClellan has agreed to testify on June 20th at 10 AM .
This will be the first step in what we hope will be ongoing and deepening examinations of the stark evidence and charges against both President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Thank you for your continued passion and advocacy .
Your support means so much to me .
Sincerely ,
Congressman Robert Wexler
Congratulations to the Journal Broadcasting Group , the latest media company to hop across the Federal Communications Commission 's not very deep limits on television duopolies .
Journal has won the right to own two TV stations in the Tucson , Arizona market , and to allow one to pretty much operate the other .
What 's the reason for this particular waiver ?
The FCC has classified one of the licenses as a " failing station " — that is , a signal that has floundered for " an extended period of time both in terms of its audience share and financial performance . "
Whoever said that failure is n't an option was wrong , yet again .
The underperforming station in question is Tucson 's KWBA , affiliated with the Warner Brothers CW Network .
It will now be owned by Journal and more or less overseen by its Tucson sister , ABC affiliate KGUN , also a Journal license .
The Commission 's present media ownership rules mostly prohibit a company from owing two TV stations in a Nielsen defined Designated Market Area ( DMA ) if their FCC measured broadcasting contour areas overlap .
But the buyer in question can get around this barrier under two conditions .
First : one of the licenses must rank below the area 's top four most popular stations .
Second : at least eight independently - owned full - power TV signals in the DMA must survive the merger .
Alas , the union of KWBA and KGUN under one corporate roof would not leave the Tucson ( Sierra Vista ) DMA with those requisite eight independents .
And so the Journal group asked the FCC to consider classifying KWBA a " failing station . "
Now , to be fair , the agency 's criterion for failure are pretty rigorous .
You can't just hand over a lousy report card or pull your pocket sleeves out of your trousers and frown .
You 've got to show some serious lack of success .
Your all - day audience share has to measure below four percent .
And you'd be smart to demonstrate a negative cash flow for the previous three years — a waiver being " more likely to be granted " under those circumstances , the FCC says .
Happily , KWBA meets these standards .
Its all - day share of late has averaged around 1.9 percent and has never gone above three , a misfortune the station management attributes to the signal 's loss of its programming contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks ball team .
As for the licenses ' finances , they do indeed look pretty nasty .
In fact , the station " has been monetizing most of its major available assets , " the FCC discloses , a business jargon way of saying that the broadcaster 's owner has sold its building and " all spare equipment . "
As a consequence of these set backs , KWBA certifies that it has not broadcast any news programming for over two years ; not much public affairs programming either .
But there are some upside requirements as well .
The merger must produce " public interest benefits , " the FCC says .
In addition , the buyer must demonstrate that it is the only " reasonably available candidate " able to buy and operate the station — and prove that an " out - of - market " sale , that is to say , a sale to someone beyond the DMA , would result in an " artificially depressed price . "
To fulfill the public interest requirement , Journal has made many promises that the FCC has accepted at face value .
Journal pledges that " using the established news capabilities of KGUN , " the company will launch a 30 - minute daily newscast on KWBA .
Broadcast operations will also be " collocated with the digital high - tech production facilities of KGUN . "
The newly - acquired station will also collaborate with Journal radio station KGMG - FM on various community programs .
" Journal intends to make significant community outreach efforts on the station 's multicast channel to provide additional benefits to Tucson 's growing Latino audience , " the FCC observes .
And the company " has pledged to improve KWBA 's weather and emergency announcement capabilities , as well as its community outreach capabilities . "
As is often the case with these decisions , the Commission establishes no time line or benchmarks by which it can be verified that all these commitments have been kept .
" Allowing KWBA to be operated by a stronger station in the market will result in a definite improvement in facilities and programming , " the agency predicts , " an outcome which clearly benefits the public interest . "
Terrorist Attack Lesson
A terror attack , when added to an election , equals Republican .
In a recent survey , 757 gay and lesbian participants were asked to rank companies by their gay - friendly factor .
Apple came in first place among tech companies with 39 % of participants strongly considering the brand to be gay - friendly .
Among all brands , Apple came in second behind Bravo ( who dominated with a rating of 52 % ) .
But alas , things did n't turn out so well for our friends ( we can no longer be seen in public with ) at Samsung .
Advertisement
Samsung ranked in the lowest tier of companies with a scant 4 % of the polled population feeling the brand is gay - friendly .
That puts them right between Quaker ( 5 % ) and Cracker Barrel ( 3 % ) .
Technically Samsung tied with Wal - Mart and Frito - Lay .
By the way , we attempted to Photoshop the gay pride / rainbow flag onto the old Apple logo , only to find that , duh , their original logo almost did the job for us .

Clark hits McCain 's military credentials
Gen . Wesley Clark , acting as a surrogate for Barack Obama ’s campaign , invoked John McCain ’s military service against him in one of the more personal attacks on the Republican presidential nominee this election cycle .
Clark said that McCain lacked the executive experience necessary to be president , calling him “ untested and untried ” on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ”
And in saying so , he took a few swipes at McCain ’s military service .

After saying , " I certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war .
He was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces , as a prisoner of war , " he added that these experiences in no way qualify McCain to be president in his view :
“ He has been a voice on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
And he has traveled all over the world .
But he has n't held executive responsibility .
That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded — that was n't a wartime squadron , ” Clark said .
“ I do n’t think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president . ”
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , also on CBS , was equally uncharitable towards Obama ’s record on foreign policy as he continued to distance himself from his former party .
“ Sen . Obama , unfortunately , like a lot of the Democratic leadership , continues to take a position that we ought to withdraw ... even though the new policy is working , ” said Lieberman .
“ If we had done what Sen . Obama asked us to do for the last couple of years , today Iran and Al Qaeda would be in control of Iraq .
It would be a terrible defeat for us and our allies in the Middle East and throughout the world . ”
Meanwhile , the opposition narratives for the fall election campaign appeared to be in full force on ABC’s “ This Week , ” with Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill . ) calling McCain a flip - flopper , while Republican Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty accused Obama of not working in a bipartisan fashion .
Emanuel attacked McCain for changing his position on offshore oil drilling , President Bush ’s tax cuts and his relationship with the evangelical community .
Quipped Emanuel : “ If flip - flop was an Olympic sport , John McCain would be the first to win a gold medal . ”
But Pawlenty cited McCain ’s record on immigration and his support of increasing U.S. troop presence in Iraq as ample evidence that he bucks his party on account of principle — and then challenged Emanuel to name one piece of legislation where Obama has worked across party lines .
“ The question really remains , when has Barack Obama stood up and taken on his party
on anything of national significance ? ” Pawlenty asked .
“ It 's not leadership to jump in front of a parade .
And I think Barack Obama 's book ' The Audacity of Hope ' perhaps should be retitled ' The Audacity of Hypocrisy . ' ”
VP watch
A pair of prospective running mates for Obama and McCain downplayed their interest in serving on the presidential tickets on “ Fox News Sunday ” — and one even said he was n’t interested in an immediate Cabinet appointment .
Gov. Ed Rendell ( D - Pa. ) , said he was committed to finishing out his four - year term as governor before accepting any Cabinet position within a potential Obama administration .
“ In 2011 , it 's my intention to walk out the door of the [ Pennsylvania ] capitol ... in January of 2011 .
I know that disappoints some people in the capitol , but that 's my intention , ” Rendell said .
“ And if there was a position open that I was interested in , like energy or transportation , I 'd be honored to serve in an Obama administration , but not at the beginning , not until my time is finished . ”
Rendell , one of Sen. Clinton ’s leading surrogates during the Democratic primaries , said that President Clinton was “ disappointed ” that his wife came up short in the Democratic primary , but “ is going to do every single thing that Barack Obama asks him to do ... and make a great case for Sen.
Obama as our next president . ”
Meanwhile , former Ohio Rep. Rob Portman also disavowed interest in serving as McCain ’s running mate , saying he preferred to remain with his family in Ohio instead of returning to Washington , where he most recently served as director of the Office of Management and Budget .
“ I do n't expect to be asked , honestly , ” said Portman .
" I 'm also , as you know , Chris , home after 15 years of commuting when I was in Congress and in the administration , and I 've got three teenagers .
It 's time to be home .
I love being home . ”
Portman , for his part , reiterated McCain ’s unequivocal support for NAFTA despite the fact that the free trade agreement is viewed skeptically in the Rust Belt , including the electorally critical states of Ohio and Pennsylvania .
“ It 's created an enormous number of jobs , including to Canada , which is our biggest trading partner , ” said Portman .
“ And when that message gets out there , it makes it look a little silly that you have someone going around the state of Pennsylvania and Ohio blaming NAFTA for anything from high energy prices to the common cold . “
Third party
Both third - party presidential candidates appeared on the Sunday talk show circuit , with each offering an ample helping of criticism towards the major - party nominees .
Ralph Nader , who said Obama was “ talking white ” to appeal to voters earlier in the week , continued to attack the Democratic nominee on ABC’s “ This Week , ” accusing him of being too cozy with an assortment of corporate interests .
“ Look at the positions he ’s taken on that corporate America is very congenial to .
If you want to cover everybody on health insurance ... go to single payer .
He 's opposed to single payer , ” said Nader .
Meanwhile , former Republican Georgia Rep. Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party ’s nominee , had harsh words for both McCain and his former party .
“ What 's wrong with John McCain is symptomatic of what 's wrong with the Republican party in these first years of the 21st century .
They talk one thing but do something different and that 's become very obvious to the American people , ” Barr said on Fox .
Barr said he is the only candidate offering the combination of a crackdown on excessive government spending along with concern for civil liberties .
But he had to distance himself from past congressional votes in support of the Patriot Act and for legislation authorizing the war in Iraq — positions anathema to much of the Libertarian Party base .
“ I certainly was wrong , along with a lot of others in Congress , and now realize that the vote in support of military operations in Iraq was not what the administration intended .
They intended to occupy the country even though they did n't tell us or the American people that at the time , ” said Barr .
The governator
And a Sunday show wrapup would n’t be complete without mention of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s appearance on “ Meet the Press , ” where he advocated for McCain ’s candidacy but acknowledged their difference on offshore drilling , a proposal that Schwarzenegger opposes .
“ I 'm 100 percent behind him .
That we do n't agree on everything , that 's clear ; nor do I with my wife .
I mean , it does n't mean that we should split , it just means that we do n't agree on certain things . ”
He also announced his opposition to a statewide referendum that would amend the state ’s constitution to ban gay marriage , while not sounding too opposed to the California Supreme Court ’s recent controversial ruling that legalized same - sex marriage in the state .
“ I think it 's good that California is leading in this way , ” said Schwarzenegger .
“ I personally believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman .
But at the same time I think that my belief , I do n't want to force on anyone else , so I think we should stay with the decision of the Supreme Court and move forward . ”

Your generation was sluttier Your generation was sluttier
I am sick of hearing Baby Boomers and Gen X - ers complain about a perceived cultural decline among the younger generations .
For a variety of measures , things started to go bad already by the 1950s , became obscene during the 1960s and ' 70s , and plateaued some time during the 1980s .
Since roughly 1990 , however , things have gotten steadily better .
This series will catalog such a trend for measures typically given in support of the declinist hypothesis : we begin with sexual behavior , and will eventually cover violent crime , divorce , narcissism , the arts , and whatever other examples I come across or that readers suggest in the comments .
The hope is that the series will prevent the real - world picture from disappearing down the Memory Hole , as every generation thinks that patterns among its usurpers spell doom , regardless of what the data show .
Importantly , I am more interested in the slope or derivative of an indicator at some point in time , and less so in the value of the indicator at that point .
The reason is simple : those who claim that our culture is declining , decaying , rotting , dying , and devolving are making an argument about whether some indicator is increasing or decreasing over time .
What the declinists are really saying is that there are forces that cause promiscuity , say , to increase or to decrease .
Therefore , even if some Bad Thing was lower in 1958 than in 2008 , it may have been in a state of worsening then ( increasing ) , and in a state of improving now ( decreasing ) , so the underlying corrosive forces must have been stronger then and weaker now .
It is the strength of these unseen " causes of decline " that I 'm interested in .
The most straightforward indicator of sluttiness is simply the percentage of people who have had a " high " number of partners for their age .
Since the declinists target the younger generations , let 's look at the percentage of high schoolers who have had 4 or more sexual partners .
I could not find a good national probability sample that included a straightforward measure of sluttiness before 1991 , but we can look at some proxies .
The percentage of adolescents who have ever had sex is one : if you have n't had sex ever , you can't have had multiple partners , and earlier age of first intercourse is correlated with having more partners ( that is not a tautology ) .
The YRBS data above show that this indicator too has been decreasing from 1991 to 2007 .
Before then , we turn to a different dataset , although it is also national and representative : the
Proportions were calculated for adolescent women in each year of age from 15 through 19 who reported having had premarital sexual intercourse by March 1 in 1970 , 1975 , 1980 , 1985 , and 1988 .
For all ages combined for each of these periods , the proportion of adolescent women who reported having had premarital sexual intercourse increased steadily ( from 28.6 % in 1970 to 51.5 % in 1988 ( Table 1 ) ) .
The 1988 figure of 51.5 % is nearly the same as the 1991 figure of 50.8 % from the YRBS data (
We can also look at the spread of sexually transmitted diseases that are very common and have been around long enough for there to be decades of relevant data .
First we look at gonorrhea .
A widespread campaign to treat gonorrhea began when the rate started to decrease , so some of the decreasing trend may be due to better medicine , but combined with the data on number of partners and virginity , some of it must also be due to lower promiscuity .
In any case , the data do suggest an increasing trend in promiscuity starting in the late 1950s and lasting at least until the mid-1970s .
Next we look at type 2 herpes .
Its prevalence has been decreasing since some time in the late 1990s , especially among adolescents (
Taken together , these various indicators -- what percentage of teenagers have had " many " partners , what percentage has ever had sex , and what percentage has a common STD -- all argue for a period of cultural decline starting in the 1960s , perhaps as early as the late 1950s , which lasted until about 1990 .
Since then , however , our culture has been in a state of progress regarding teenage sluttiness .
Thus , if any age cohort gets to brag about improving sexual mores , it is those born about 1975 or after .
Finally , note that the average female 's appearance tells us nothing about the actual level or rate of increase / decrease in sluttiness .
Because this is what most older people use to support the declinist hypothesis -- " young girls did n't used to wear thongs or jeans that low - cut when I was a boy ! " -- it 's worth emphasizing .
Note also that more salacious dance practices among youngsters do n't tell us anything real either , something I pointed out with
Post - script
While oral sex is not worth looking at as a measure of sluttiness compared to intercourse - related indicators , it 's worth mentioning that there is no " oral sex epidemic , " as Oprah phrased it in a typically anti-male way .
( The guys would refer to it as the " efflorescence of oral sex . " )
Nor is oral sex being substituted for intercourse , another worry in the mind of the declinists .
Read the Sluttiness is perhaps the most frequently given example of how far kids these days have fallen -- fallen , that is , from the zenith of innocence embodied by fucking your gf in the back of your car at Make - out Point ( or the drive - in theater ) , round - robin pairing off during the sexual revolution , and the barely - covers - you costumes of the disco era and its spillover into the nightclub scene of the 1980s .
Although there are not national probability samples ( as opposed to convenience samples ) going back decades for the entire diversity of perversions , indicators of sexual misbehavior correlate with each other , so we may need to rely on a proxy indicator if data are lacking for another .
The most straightforward indicator of sluttiness is simply the percentage of people who have had a " high " number of partners for their age .
Since the declinists target the younger generations , let 's look at the percentage of high schoolers who have had 4 or more sexual partners .
Here are the data from the representative National Youth Risk Behavior Survey .
From 1991 to 2007 , this percentage has decreased .
This is the strongest argument against the declinist hypothesis .
I could not find a good national probability sample that included a straightforward measure of sluttiness before 1991 , but we can look at some proxies .
The percentage of adolescents who have ever had sex is one : if you have n't had sex ever , you can't have had multiple partners , and earlier age of first intercourse is correlated with having more partners ( that is not a tautology ) .
The YRBS data above show that this indicator too has been decreasing from 1991 to 2007 .
Before then , we turn to a different dataset , although it is also national and representative : the National Survey of Family Growth .
According to the CDC 's summary The 1988 figure of 51.5 % is nearly the same as the 1991 figure of 50.8 % from the YRBS data ( see here , where the data are broken down by male vs. female ) .
Thus , at least as far back as 1970 ( and probably earlier ) , the fraction of teenagers who had had sex was already increasing , it peaked around 1990 , and has been decreasing ever since .
We can also look at the spread of sexually transmitted diseases that are very common and have been around long enough for there to be decades of relevant data .
First we look at gonorrhea .
This table of gonorrhea rates by year shows that it increased from 1941 to 1946 , decreased until 1957 , increased until 1975 , and decreased until 1997 , leveling off thereafter .
The main trends that emerge are a 20 - year period of increase from the late 1950s until the mid-1970s , and a 20 - year period of decrease from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s .
A widespread campaign to treat gonorrhea began when the rate started to decrease , so some of the decreasing trend may be due to better medicine , but combined with the data on number of partners and virginity , some of it must also be due to lower promiscuity .
In any case , the data do suggest an increasing trend in promiscuity starting in the late 1950s and lasting at least until the mid-1970s .
Next we look at type 2 herpes .
Its prevalence has been decreasing since some time in the late 1990s , especially among adolescents ( free full text here , popular journalism write - up here ) .
It had been increasing at least from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s .
Because herpes is not treatable like gonorrhea is , it must be that more responsible sexual behavior has curbed its spread , again in particular among adolescents .
Taken together , these various indicators -- what percentage of teenagers have had " many " partners , what percentage has ever had sex , and what percentage has a common STD -- all argue for a period of cultural decline starting in the 1960s , perhaps as early as the late 1950s , which lasted until about 1990 .
Since then , however , our culture has been in a state of progress regarding teenage sluttiness .
Thus , if any age cohort gets to brag about improving sexual mores , it is those born about 1975 or after .
Finally , note that the average female 's appearance tells us nothing about the actual level or rate of increase / decrease in sluttiness .
Because this is what most older people use to support the declinist hypothesis -- " young girls did n't used to wear thongs or jeans that low - cut when I was a boy ! " -- it 's worth emphasizing .
Note also that more salacious dance practices among youngsters do n't tell us anything real either , something I pointed out with a field study on my personal blog .
Girls these days may give you a standing lapdance on the dancefloor , but -- although the male receiver may wish otherwise -- this does n't mean she is going to fuck you .
One plausible reason for the disconnect between appearance and reality is that appearances are largely driven by fashion , which changes for its own sake , rather than reflect underlying changes in preferences or behavior .
While oral sex is not worth looking at as a measure of sluttiness compared to intercourse - related indicators , it 's worth mentioning that there is no " oral sex epidemic , " as Oprah phrased it in a typically anti-male way .
( The guys would refer to it as the " efflorescence of oral sex . " )
Nor is oral sex being substituted for intercourse , another worry in the mind of the declinists .
Read the free pdf of the study here , or if you 're lazy , a Newsweek editorial summarizing it .
As is usual in these cases , the only thing that is epidemic here is a fear of an epidemic .
I am sick of hearing Baby Boomers and Gen X - ers complain about a perceived cultural decline among the younger generations .
For a variety of measures , things started to go bad already by the 1950s , became obscene during the 1960s and ' 70s , and plateaued some time during the 1980s .
Since roughly 1990 , however , things have gotten steadily better .
This series will catalog such a trend for measures typically given in support of the declinist hypothesis : we begin with sexual behavior , and will eventually cover violent crime , divorce , narcissism , the arts , and whatever other examples I come across or that readers suggest in the comments .
The hope is that the series will prevent the real - world picture from disappearing down the Memory Hole , as every generation thinks that patterns among its usurpers spell doom , regardless of what the data show .
Importantly , I am more interested in the slope or derivative of an indicator at some point in time , and less so in the value of the indicator at that point .
The reason is simple : those who claim that our culture is declining , decaying , rotting , dying , and devolving are making an argument about whether some indicator is increasing or decreasing .
What the declinists are really saying is that there are forces that cause promiscuity , say , to increase or to decrease .
Therefore , even if some Bad Thing was lower in 1958 than in 2008 , it may have been in a state of worsening then ( increasing ) , and in a state of improving now ( decreasing ) , so the underlying corrosive forces must have been stronger then and weaker now .
It is the strength of these unseen " causes of decline " that I 'm interested in .

The article that you tried to access , which was part of a feed supplied by a news agency , is no longer on available on the Guardian site .
A COUPLE of years ago I received a letter from an American soldier in Iraq .
The letter began by saying that , as we ’ve all become painfully aware , serving on the front lines is physically exhausting and emotionally debilitating .
But the reason for his writing was to tell me that in that hostile and lonely environment , a book I ’d written had become a kind of lifeline .
As the book is about science  one that traces physicists ’ search for nature ’s deepest laws  the soldier ’s letter might strike you as , well , odd .
But it ’s not .
Rather , it speaks to the powerful role science can play in giving life context and meaning .
At the same time , the soldier ’s letter emphasized something I ’ve increasingly come to believe : our educational system fails to teach science in a way that allows students to integrate it into their lives .
Allow me a moment to explain .
When we consider the ubiquity of cellphones , iPods , personal computers and the Internet , it ’s easy to see how science ( and the technology to which it leads ) is woven into the fabric of our day - to - day activities .
When we benefit from CT scanners , M.R.I. devices , pacemakers and arterial stents , we can immediately appreciate how science affects the quality of our lives .
When we assess the state of the world , and identify looming challenges like climate change , global pandemics , security threats and diminishing resources , we do n’t hesitate in turning to science to gauge the problems and find solutions .
And when we look at the wealth of opportunities hovering on the horizon  stem cells , genomic sequencing , personalized medicine , longevity research , nanoscience , brain - machine interface , quantum computers , space technology  we realize how crucial it is to cultivate a general public that can engage with scientific issues ; there ’s simply no other way that as a society we will be prepared to make informed decisions on a range of issues that will shape the future .
Note that this was my very first attempt at homemade air conditioning , preserved for posterity –
if you ’re planning on building your own , take a look at my main page or my final design , the Black Beauty .
Materials :
Salvage from around the house a :
large fan
garbage can
Grab from Home Depot :
25 feet of 1/4 inch outer diameter ( OD ) copper tubing ( ~ $ 14 )
20 feet of 1/4 inch inner diameter ( ID ) vinyl tubing ( ~ $ 6 )
a package of zipties ( ~ $ 3 )
2 small hose clamps ( ~ $ 1 )
Construction
Here ’s the basic setup .
The garbage can is filled with ice water , which is then fed by gravity ( a siphon ) through the copper tubing coiled along the back of the fan .
The hot air passing through the tubing warms the cold water , cooling the air .
Waste warm water is then pumped outside .
The system will cool an average room to a comfortable level in approximately 15 - 20 minutes .
Depending on flow rate , a full bucket of water will last approximately 1 - 3 hours .
I use a single bucket before bed on hot nights , which lets me get to sleep .
Once the water runs out , the house has cooled off enough that the fan alone provides sufficient cooling .
It does n’t rip quite as hard as central air , but for less than $ 25 CAD I ’m not complaining .
( and , btw , that ’s my girlfriend ’s makeup mirror , not mine )
The main factor affecting the performance is the temperature of incoming water .
Cool water will work , but ice water will result in a cooler room , quicker .
Add salt to the water if you ’re adding a large volume of ice , as this will drop the freezing point of the water and increase the cooling effect of the fan .
You can attach the tubing to the front of the fan as well .
This will increase performance , just make sure that your fan can handle the additional torque of tubing full of water attached to the front .
Here ’s what the fan looks like from the back .
The biggest issue in construction was uncoiling 25 feet of copper tubing in a 15 by 20 room .
Just be patient and do n’t attempt to bend the copper too severly , it ’ll fold over on itself and you ’ve effectively chopped your nice copper tubing in two .
When coiling the copper into a spiral on the back of the fan , I started in the middle and put zipties every 15 - 30 cm ( 6 - 12 inches ) .
Use your discretion , you want to preserve the spiral shape and keep the tubing as close to the metal mesh as you can .
If you ’re a bit crazy , sand the paint off the back to improve heat transfer from the metal mesh .
It does n’t really matter how it looks as long as it ’s reasonably spaced out and consistent .
A hint for construction : prebend your zipties into a J shape .
Then you can hook them easily in and back out of the metal mesh on the back of the fan .
I ’d suggest cutting off any extra plastic once you ’ve got them on .
Some have suggested using an old car radiator attached to the front of the fan instead of coiled copper tubing .
Cost prevented me from trying this , but as long as the head loss from the radiator is low enough to allow the siphon ( or pump ) to operate , this should increase the performance ( better heat exchange ) .
You ’ll likely have to construct a frame to hold the radiator in front of the fan .
If you look closely , you can see the condensation from the incoming icewater , but no condensation on the tubing leading out .
This is perfect , as it means that heat is being transferred from the room to the water .
Once you ’ve got the copper tubing coiled , the rest is easy .
Cut your vinyl tubing into 2 pieces , with one about twice the length of the other ( one piece 6 - 7 feet , other piece 13 - 14 feet ) .
Attach the shorter piece to the incoming side of the copper tubing .
It should slide relatively easily over the copper , but be snug .
Attach the hose clamp and tighten .
Following a similar procedure , attach the longer piece to the outgoing side of the copper tubing .
( I do n’t believe it really matters whether you feed cold water from the inside or the outside .
It ’s up to you to run some numbers . )
Submerge the shorter end of the vinyl tubing in the garbage can ( washed and clean ) .
I suggest weighing down the end of the tube , to avoid it drawing in air and stopping the system .
I used twist - ties to attach a thin rock to the end .
If you have fishing weights , I would suggest using those .
Then again , if you have enough stuff for fishing weights to be lying around you can probably afford a real air conditioner .
Next , hang the longer tubing out your window .
For the gravity pump to work , the end of the tubing must be below the water level of your garbage can , plus an allowance for head loss in the pipe .
Just to be safe , get it as low as you can .
I ’d suggest arranging it so the waste water will feed into a garden , but student ghettos do n’t have gardens so in this picture it ’s being fed into a drain by the basement .
I had to poke a small hole in my screen for this to work .
To get the system started , make sure the vinyl tubing in the ice water is completely submerged .
Then , bring the waste water tubing as low as you can and start sucking on the tube .
If you ’ve ever siphoned gas you know the drill .
Basically , suck as much as you can .
Then plug the end of the tubing with you thumb , and repeat .
You ’re done when you start tasting water .
Just let go , and it should continue to flow normally .
I ’ve also hooked this up to a garden hose as the cold water feed .
Check out the improved water supply .
Errata :
A closed circuit version of this is entirely possible .
An example can be seen here .
I would also suggest constructing a geothermal heat pump .
Dig a deep hole near the window , the soil at this depth will be quite cool .
Bury a coil of copper tubing spaced well through the soil , this will act as your heat sink .
Pumping water from the fan coil to the underground coil and back will exchange heat from the warm room to the cold soil .
I ’d love to implement this , but my landlord may not take well to large holes in his backyard .
I realise small air conditioners are quite cheap .
But then you do n’t get to build anything !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain Monday called for tougher worldwide pressure on Iran and painted his potential rival Sen. Barack Obama as naive about the Middle East .
Speaking to a pro-Israeli group , Sen. John McCain calls for targeted sanctions against Iran 's leaders .
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee called for " targeted sanctions that will impose a heavy cost on the regime 's leaders , " such as limiting Iran 's ability to import gasoline , denying travel visas to its leaders , freezing their assets and imposing financial sanctions on its central bank .
McCain was speaking at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the influential pro-Israel lobbying organization .
In a clear sign McCain has begun his general election campaign , the speech was peppered with attacks on Obama , the Illinois senator who is the front - runner for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Watch McCain slam Obama on Iraq »
McCain made his target unmistakable , mentioning Obama by name in two of his three criticisms about Middle East policy matters .
The Obama campaign fired back immediately , sending reporters a lengthy e-mail rebutting McCain 's points one by one as McCain began speaking .
McCain took Obama to task for the latter 's stated willingness to meet with the leaders of countries like Iran , which the Arizona Republican described as the greatest threat facing Israel .
" We hear talk of a meeting with the Iranian leadership offered up as if it were some sudden inspiration , a bold new idea that somehow nobody has ever thought of before , " McCain said without naming Obama .
" Yet it 's hard to see what such a summit with [ Iranian ] President [ Mahmoud ]
Ahmadinejad would actually gain , except an earful of anti-Semitic rants , and a worldwide audience for a man who denies one Holocaust and talks before frenzied crowds about starting another .
He blasted Obama for voting against a measure to label Iran 's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization , noting that three - quarters of the Senate supported the resolution .
" He opposed this resolution because its support for countering Iranian influence in Iraq was , he said , a ' wrong message not only to the world , but also to the region . '
But here , too , he is mistaken .
Holding Iran 's influence in check , and holding a terrorist organization accountable , sends exactly the right message -- to Iran , to the region and to the world . "
McCain also jabbed Obama over Iraq , saying America 's counterinsurgency strategy there was succeeding .
" It 's worth recalling that America 's progress in Iraq is the direct result of the new strategy that Senator Obama opposed .
It was the strategy he predicted would fail , when he voted cut off funds for our forces in Iraq , " McCain said .
" He now says he intends to withdraw combat troops from Iraq -- one to two brigades per month until they are all removed .
...
This course would surely result in a catastrophe . "
The Obama campaign , in response , sought to tie McCain to President Bush , who it said had failed to contain Iranian influence over the past seven years .
Watch Obama say McCain was running for ' Bush 's third term ' »
" Confronted with that reality , John McCain promises four more years of the same policies that have strengthened Iran , making the United States and Israel less safe , " Hari Sevugan , an Obama campaign spokesman , said .
The Obama campaign accused McCain of misrepresenting the Democrat 's positions and offering only empty rhetoric himself .
McCain " promises to continue a war in Iraq that has emboldened Iran and strengthened its hand , " Obama 's campaign wrote .
" He promises sanctions that the Bush administration has been unable to persuade the Security Council to deliver .
" He promises a divestment campaign , even though he refused to sign on to Barack Obama 's bipartisan divestment bill , refused to get his colleagues to lift an anonymous hold on the bill , and willfully ignores the fact that trade and investment between Iran and Iraq continue to expand .
He stubbornly refuses to engage in aggressive diplomacy , ruling it out unconditionally as a tool of American power . "
The campaign said Obama is in favor of divestment from Iran and of labeling the Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization .
It said Republicans had blocked Obama 's own divestment bill , and that the senator had voted against a bill about the Revolutionary Guard because it contained other provisions about Iraq to which he objected .
It also said Obama would base decisions about withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq on facts on the ground .
Obama is due to address AIPAC on Wednesday .
The speech -- one of a series of addresses laying out policies McCain would pursue as president -- included a nod to the United Nations , but the candidate made clear he would press ahead with or without the world body 's support .
" Essential to this strategy is the U.N. Security Council , which should impose progressively tougher political and economic sanctions .
Should the Security Council continue to delay in this responsibility , the United States must lead like - minded countries in imposing multilateral sanctions outside the U.N. framework . "

“ The debate we ’re going to be having with John McCain is how do we understand the blend of military action to diplomatic action that we are going to undertake , ” he said .
“ I constantly reject this notion that any hint of strategies involving diplomacy are somehow soft or indicate surrender or means that you are not going to crack down on terrorism .
Those are the terms of debate that have led to blunder after blunder . ”
Obama said he found that the military brass thinks the way he does :
“ The generals are light - years ahead of the civilians .
They are trying to get the job done rather than look tough . ”
I asked him if negotiating with a theocratic / ideological power like Iran is different from negotiating with a nation that ’s primarily pursuing material interests .
He acknowledged that “ If your opponents are looking for your destruction it ’s hard to sit across the table from them , ” but , he continued : “ There are rarely purely ideological movements out there .
We can encourage actors to think in practical and not ideological terms .
We can strengthen those elements that are making practical calculations . ”
Obama does n’t broadcast moral disgust when talking about terror groups , but he said that in some ways he’d be tougher than the Bush administration .
He said he would do more to arm the Lebanese military and would be tougher on North Korea .
“ This is not an argument between Democrats and Republicans , ” he concluded .
“ It ’s an argument between ideology and foreign policy realism .
I have enormous sympathy for the foreign policy of George H. W. Bush .
I do n’t have a lot of complaints about their handling of Desert Storm .
I do n’t have a lot of complaints with their handling of the fall of the Berlin Wall . ”
In the early 1990s , the Democrats and the first Bush administration had a series of arguments  about humanitarian interventions , whether to get involved in the former Yugoslavia , and so on .
In his heart , Obama talks like the Democrats of that era , viewing foreign policy from the ground up .
But in his head , he aligns himself with the realist dealmaking of the first Bush .
Apparently , he ’s part Harry Hopkins and part James Baker .

Jim Trakas , the Republican candidate challenging Dennis Kucinich in the 10th District Congressinal race , issued a news release yesterday criticizing
Kucinich 's introduction of articles of impeachment
against President Bush .
Kucinich has misplaced priorities , Trakas claimed .
In a news release , Trakas noted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had emphatically said that Congress will not consider a presidential impeachment resolution .
Trakas said that Kucinich 's introduction Monday of 35 articles of impeachment against Bush
Trakas also noted that when voters attempted to recall Kucinich during his mayoral term , Kucinich had argued that was a waste of time , deflecting him from his duties as mayor .
Read Trakas ' statement ( pdf ) .
Kucinich introduced a resolution last year to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
That resolution was killed , but only after Republicans initially voted in favor of taking up the measure to force a debate .
Kucinich won 50 percent of the vote in a five - way House Democratic primary in March , beating back critics who said he ignored business at home to travel the country in his quest to be president .
Trakas and Kucinich face off in November .
Muslim clerics to hold anti-terror rally in Delhi
May 21 , 2008 19:06 IST
In the wake of the Jaipur blasts and subsequent threats to Muslim clerics for raising their voices against the strikes , leading Islamic seminary Darul Uloom , Deoband , on Wednesday said campaign against terrorism will continue even as a mass rally has been convened in Delhi later this month in this regard .
Condemning the terror attacks carried in the name of religion , Darul - uloom Vice Chancellor Moulana Ahmad Khazir Shah said : " Islam is a religion of peace and to give it a bad name , unscrupulous elements are carrying acts of violence and bloodshed , which is highly regrettable . "
Moulana , on a five - day visit to the Kashmir valley , told a gathering in his ancestral village of Anwarabad - Lolab in Kupwara asked Muslims community to isolate " those who try to give a bad name to Islam by their acts and speeches " .
General secretary of Ulema-e - Hind Altaf Ahmad Masoodi stressed on the inclusion of subjects like IT , computer science and science in madarsas to " broaden the horizons of upcoming students " .
He also said it was the right of Indian Muslims to be the part of Organisation of Islamic Countries .
In Muzaffarnagar , deputy VC of Darul - uloom Moulana Kari Usman said campaigns and rallies against anti-Islam activities would continue .
" Our stand against terrorism will not be affected by threats from terrorists , " Usman said .
As many as six Muslim clerics were apparently threatened by terror group Indian Mujahideen , which also claimed responsibility for the May 13 Jaipur blasts that killed 64 people , for their voice against terrorism .
Meanwhile Ulemas and intellectuals will participate in a mass anti-terror rally in Delhi on May 31 .
I was lost in the Darkest parts of my own wicked ways , spiraling down a path of destruction leading me away from His Almighty ways , and all the while im going down ONLY ONE , He could save me .
No matter how far i looked on this lowly planet , i never once found a soul who could manage , to show me the love that i truly needed , because on this planet aint nothing but hate and contempt have been breeded .
the lowly snake slithering as he goes through the towns of man looking for lowly lowly souls , to feed on so that it could plant it 's evil seeds , and so that throughout the generations nothing but evil and hate we could recieve , but those where the ways of the past , my brothers and sisters .
the devil had a hold of us and he managed through our parents , down through the generations
His ways have been lost , and because of the us , the devil has turned and tossed , We can All be saved , all we need is Thanksgiving , to the One who Above , for All of His Givings .
The devils trying to stop me right now as i speak , but Faithful to the Lord and willit He , that i may be meek .
Because it is
He not i that gives you this message but it is The One that we All should seek .
i know that it is hard to find Rest , as we all go through this test some call a game , every single last one of us , probably , training to gain and retain our fame .
But
That is not what this life is about , i have a Strong feeling that we are All getting our Water from the wrong wrong spout .
because thats all the devil has for us is a little bit , of pleasure , then comes the pain .
steady feeding our bodies what i see now Is Insane .
because ya'll hafto see that we are all carnally minded , and This is the reason
The LORD , us he has blinded , binding , ourselves to our own flesh , so that eventually we would All fail this Test .
but know that The Lord , He loves us , and wishes nothing but the best , and all He wants is for us to Love Him all the while through this Test .
some wonder why we see nadoes and quakes ,
He needs ya'll to know that its Ya'lls souls that He is trying to shake .
and bake if you will , so the devil may not have his fill , to letchya'll know that there is NONE like that ALMIGHTY AND ALL POWERFULL ONE .
i say full because
Hes filled with Love , like None that we have seen on this lowly earth , but now that i have SEEN , my Eyes have been UnBlinded , and now it is He , He who signs this , letter so maybe that some of Ya'll could listen , and Maybe get the Message that He is trying to dish , out of His spout , so that ya'll might be fed , with all of His Love , His Water , And His Bread .
Do n't for a second think any of Ya'll are living , All of ya'll are dead and for the devil are you " living " as i sit here and do this all of the " dome " just know that it is Not me and that this is His tomb .
He is singing through me in these words and this song , so that maybe one day we All can be free all the day long , and ya'll can say its cheesy if ya'll want , but just know the devil in you he does flaunt x ) i had to stop and show ya'll how i felt about that one , cuz its the truth , and right now i have a Strong feeling
He is swinging harder than that brother Babe Ruth , or ballin harder than micheal jordan , and in this song he Is Playing His Accordian .
Ya'll just need to know that He is our Guardian , and right now im flying Higher than any single air jordan , because my love i gave to Him more than any of Ya'll so i guess i can say more than them .
But dont getit twizted like boi's if ya'll know , that me and moreover Him , have a lot to show .
we are all brothers and sisters , but i should call us the missers , because we all fail to see the smaller things in this world , without even thinking twice , what truly brings a man alot of happiness or to see the pain that ALOT of us have in us .
i know that we are all hurting on the inside , and for ya'll who say we dont , Boi , you know that is a lie , because only with Him and not that evil leech from down south , can we truly fly .
higher than the highest of trees or the tallest of mountains , But in Him we Have to trust , so that We may Drink From The One and Only True fountain , only because of Him can i do this for days , and its Because i gave Him my love , thanksgiving , and praise .
so now that i have seen what it is truly to be Man , Men of God , all these hater out there who bout to say something aint nuthing more than sod .
sorry if it dont make sense , just know that me and Him the latter first ,
We are just trying to give
His children , ya'll some mother lovin cents .
forgive me if i pause for no longer am i a vulgar man life is just a beach , and Now , He is playing in the sand , hopefully in the minds of the young , the daughters and sons , i have my holster , and now the Lord is my Gun , Shining Brighter , than a million suns , times two , because His love is True , actually make that twenty twenty , because
He is aplenty , in me in you and All , i just hope that ya'll can hear
His call , so that maybe that ya'll may not fall , into the Pit , but right now i can say the devil is probably having a fit , of anxiety cuz he is losing his " children " just know that we are God 's and with me He has been pilfering , in my mind day and night , as i have been in my room trying to stay out of sight , of ya'll because all it seems like to me , that nothing to ya'll it would please , more , than to see one of your own fellow brother get shot and fall .
when i look around me i dont see any real love , this evil surrounds me , but Now i DO NOT CARE , because the Lord , THE LORD , HE has found me .
so now ya'll cannot touch , because with His love , im about to bust .
with loving Faith and Trust , i put in Him , so that i can be led away from this life of sin , and Now that i have His Trust , my brotha's and sista's , not just the black ones , comeon now , that just is not a must , there is no such thing man , all that is , is nothing more than an evil thought , brought up in vain , so that maybe a man 's soul , that leech , can be bought .
Quit being evil , for it is Love , that should be sought , out so once again we may be fed from His Spout , for only He can give us what we need so that in the end we may succeed .
my brothers and sisters all we need to do is Believe , and then , Anything , together , WE CAN ACHIEVE .
this is an ode to ya'll so in hopes once again that ya'll may hear The Call , and will not fall , so one day me , ya'll , and The Almighty , Perfect , like a prefect without the er , Omnipotent , and Patient ONE , that together we May All Ball .
and they keep telling me to stop , but i just cant my brothers me and Him are headed to the top , and right now i got The Heart Of A Lion , King , and pray tell me my brothers and sisters who are reading , what single Beast can stop that king ?
of the jungle we are running but with Him we can be free .
out into the open pasture we all can roam , just know this is not me , and that this is His Tomb .
its wierd how they 're spelled alike but do not rhyme , im talking bout bomb my brothers , and its One of a Kind . in the Hopes that this petty rhyme , can help lead the black sheep , away from the Blind , being themselves , for who ?
tell me can save them from that ?
if you dont answer right then your a part of this blight that runs rampant through the streets , evil im talking about and all it wants to do is eat , your souls because it is angry at the Living God , hahahaha for it is nothing more than a sod , on His Cleat as He is Running , Hoping that some of these Words , hit you right in the stomach , and make you sick , but not you , im talking about the evil you , for we are all children of God , but we have made ourselves nothing more than a sod =( i say with a heavy heart , because all this time we have been playing the devil , his part , but with Him it is nothing but a fart , because He Forgives , and Only Through Him may we EVER , get the chance to Live , and im not talking about on the earth , im talking about another , and maybe one day you can see and i can Truly call you my Brother , for there is Life in Death , but it is only gained through this life which is a test , just know that when we die , if you have lived righteously , on that day you will Fly , for the Lord will Breathe His Breath in you when you die and like i said before You Will Fly , but not if you keep eating from the devil 's table , for you can only eat from one , and i hope its
Not the devil 's table .
for if we Eat from Him , we can All go back into His Stable , and only in doing that can we Ever truly be stable , only only if , we are eating from , The Living God 's Table .

Democrats want to know why the oil industry is asking for more drilling rights when it is n't using the leases it already has .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil companies and many lawmakers are pressing to open up more U.S. areas for drilling .
But the industry is drilling on just a fraction of areas it already has access to .
Of the 90 million offshore acres the industry has leases to , mostly in the Gulf of Mexico , it is estimated that upwards of 70 million are not producing oil , according to both Democrats and oil - industry sources .
One Democrat staffer said if all these existing areas were being drilled , U.S. oil production could be boosted by nearly 5 million barrels a day , although the oil industry said that number is far too high and one government agency said it was impossible to estimate production .
Recent proposals to open up offshore coastal areas near Florida and California , as well as Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , might yield 2 million additional barrels , according to estimates from various government sources that also stressed the difficulty in making forecasts .
The United States currently produces 8 million barrels of oil and other petroleum liquids a day and consumes about 21 million .
Oil companies " should finish what 's on their plate before they go back in line , " said Oppenheimer analyst Fadel Gheit .
Some Democrats also charge that oil companies are deliberately not drilling on the land to limit supply and drive up oil prices .
" Big Oil is more interested in pumping up prices and pumping up their own profits rather than pumping more oil , " said Rep. Edward Markey ( D - Mass ) , who has co-sponsored a bill to charge oil companies a fee for land they hold that 's not producing oil .
" We should not even begin discussing handing over more public land to the oil companies until they first use [ the land ] they already hold . "
But the oil industry says it pays millions of dollars for these leases , and that it would not make sense to purposely leave the areas untapped .
Rather , years of exploration is required before drilling can even begin .
In some cases , no oil is found on leases they hold .
In others , drilling the wells and building the pipelines takes years .
It is especially hard now that a worldwide boom in oil exploration has pushed up the prices - and timelines - for skilled workers and specialized equipment .
" No one is sitting on leases these days , " said Rayola Dougher , senior economic advisor for the American Petroleum Institute .
" Those making those assertions do n't understand the bidding and leasing process . "
Gheit agrees that it 's unlikely that hoarding is going on .
With prices at $ 135 dollars a barrel , everyone is trying to pump as much as they can , he said .
But fearing oil prices will eventually fall , the industry is leery about making too many investments in the fields it has - many of which are in deepwater areas that can be pricey to develop .
Instead , they 're holding out , hoping the government will open areas closer to shore that would be cheaper to work on .
The presumptive Republican candidate John McCain has come out in favor of lifting bans on oil - drilling off most of the East and West coasts of the United States .
Added supply , the thinking goes , would ultimately bring down the price of oil .
The bans were enacted in the 1970s following several coastal oil spills .
Critics say lifting the bans would do little to ease the nation 's energy crisis in part because it would take years to produce meaningful amounts of oil , noting how much is currently going untapped .
Gheit has n't seen the legislation proposed by Markey and others , but he thinks the government should revise the leasing process to encourage more drilling on existing areas before it puts more acres up for bid .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton and dozens of others were arrested on Wednesday for stopping traffic to protest the acquittal of policemen who killed an unarmed black man with 50 shots on his wedding day .
Slideshow ( 20 images )
Hundreds of protesters snarled rush - hour traffic at bridges and tunnels around New York City in a civil disobedience campaign called by Sharpton , who has been close to the slain man ’s family since the November 2006 shooting .
A police spokesman said “ a couple dozen ” people were arrested .
A spokeswoman for Sharpton put the number at 190 .
Last month , a state judge cleared two detectives of manslaughter and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of Sean Bell , 23 , in a case that outraged New York ’s black community .
Bell ’s fiancee and two of his friends who survived the shooting were arrested along with Sharpton , who called on federal prosecutors to bring civil rights charges .
In the main protest , about 30 people knelt and prayed outside City Hall , blocking one of the streets that leads to the Brooklyn Bridge .
“ We are holding you all under arrest for disorderly conduct , ” police announced before handcuffing Sharpton and at least 30 other people .
They put up little or no resistance as they were led to police vans , cuffed by plastic strips .
“ We are all Sean Bell ” the demonstrators shouted .
Some people signed up to be arrested , including Lexine Odom , 47 , a mother of three sons , one of whom recently returned from military service in Iraq .
“ I have three sons and Sean Bell could have been one of them , ” Odom said .
“ To say not guilty is unfair , it was unfair to everyone unfair to the family . ”
The Justice Department , federal prosecutors and the FBI are reviewing the case and could take legal action if investigators suspect a violation of federal civil rights laws .
A decade ago , Sharpton organized similar demonstrations after four police officers who fired 41 shots were acquitted in the death of an unarmed West African man , Amadou Diallo .
Dozens were arrested then , including Sharpton .

An unannounced protest brought the realities of the average home - owner to the very heart of the banking industry .
Wearing yellow shirts that declare , “ Stop Loan Sharks , ” hundreds of protestors from across the US marched on JP Morgan Case headquarters and then into the lobby of Bear Stearns across the street .
Having suffered through the mortgage crisis , and finding themselves unable or struggling to pay off higher interest rates , the participants on Wednesday expressed their outrage at a government backed $ 20 billion dollar bail - out of Bear Stearns , one of the key investment banks behind the melt - down .
The mood in the lobby was strangely relaxed .
We had just entered en masse in what was a powerful show of strength and solidarity .
Now as the protestors , employees , and security took it all in , an air of , “ let ’s get down to business , ” settled on the crowd .
Bruce Marks , head of the NACA or the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America , and organizers began marching up and down the L shaped lobby , right passed the security desk and employee entrance .
Chanting , “ Main street not Wall street , ” and demanding to see Jamie Dimon , CEO of JP Morgan , the demonstrators held the lobby for an hour , as employees either quickly rushed by or stood around long enough to take a picture with their cellphone .
The peaceful demonstration inside the lobby at an end , we walked out and onto the street were the chanting and marching continued .
As Bruce Marks announced , “ Today we marched into their house , we violated their space . ”
Indeed , this unannounced protest brought the realities of the average home - owners to the very heart of the banking industry , and though stricter regulation or a fine instead of a bail - out would please those hurt more , Wednesday ’s show of strength proved a small victory in the larger struggle .

Monkeys are cute , but how cute is a fat monkey , or a super fat monkey ?
This overweight Macaca Mulatta monkey lives in a zoo at Ohama park in Sakai , Osaka Prefecture , Japan .
Due to the visitors ignoring the signs that restrict feeding the monkeys , about 16 of the total 50 monkeys in that zoo are overweight .

drwxr - xr-x 2 tseaver tseaver 4096 1998-06-20 18:31 ./ drwxrwxrwt 19 root root 20480 2008-06-22 13:15 ../ -rw-r--r-- 1 tseaver tseaver 8455 1998-06-20 23:46 biblio.py
It turns out that that script was my very first " real " Python program , written just after finishing the tutorial section of the original edition of Mark Lutz ' Programming Python [ 1 ] .
The job of the script was to make the a small research library 's catalog available for ad - hoc searches , first via a Tk interface , and later as a CGI script .
The most interesting thing about the application today is that I could do both of those tasks within hours of starting the application , having just learned the language .
It did neither of them terribly well ( at least by my standards today ) , but it solved a real problem for a real client , at very little cost .
Finding Python
Up to that summer , I had been earning my keep as a senior developer / software architect on very large C++ / CORBA applications , with some server - side Java / CORBA thrown in for good measure .
I was unhappy with the available tools for testing such applications , in particular because they were nearly as rigid to build as the applications - under - test .
I had been following the evolution of what came to be called Extreme Programming on the " mother - of - all wikis " [ 2 ] , and wanted to make testing a more central part of my toolkit .
After searching a bit , I found Fnorb [ 3 ] , a Python - based CORBA ORB , which promised a more " scripty " way to write my test applications .
I went on to write literally a thousand such tests that summer , vastly improving the test coverage for the CORBA apps , and making what felt like enormous strides in both my productivity and my knowledge of Python .
I was able to set up the testing jig as a simple CGI application , allowing anybody on the team to run one or all of the available tests , and review the results in their web browser , without having to install or learn Python at all , which was a big win for the project .
IPC7 and the birth of Zope
Almost by chance , I learned just a week or so beforehand that the Seventh International Python Conference was being held in Clear Lake , just south of Houston , where I lived at the time .
I registered and showed up , knowing nobody in the Python community .
I felt right at home , and was able to talk to Martin Chilvers , the original author of Fnorb .
More crucially , it was at this conference that Paul Everitt announced that Digital Creations would be open - sourcing their web application server , Principia , under a not - yet - decided name .
I had looked briefly at Bobo , the precursor to Zope 's publisher , during the summer , and was interested in following the new development .
I subscribed very early on to the main Zope list , and have been using / developing / promoting / cursing it ever since ( in no particular order , sometimes all in one day :) .
" When the going gets weird , the weird turn pro . " [ 4 ]
I began using Zope to build project intranets , especially using ZWiki [ 5 ] , and in fact contributed the " classic Wiki " markup implementation to that project .
I was also interested in extending my CORBA stuff to integrate with Zope , and began talks with Rob Page and Paul Everitt about what such and integration might look like .
They suggested that we continue the discussion at the IPC in Washington ( late January 2000 ) .
I came to the conference and learned a lot more , deciding that I would consider leaving self - employed status for a shot at the " dot- com brass ring " with Digital Creations .
I spent five years there , driving several big projects and taking on the job of shepherding the CMF ( nee PTK ) to maturity .
As the company changed directions , from a services - based model to one built around products , and later hosting , I found myself less useful , and less comfortable , and finally left the company to return to self - employed status .
Since then , I formed a new company , Agendaless Consulting [ 6 ] , with two other ex-DC / ZC veterans , Chris McDonough and Paul Everitt .
We continue to do mostly Zope and Plone based consulting , and have kicked off a new effort , " Repoze " [ 7 ] , which aims to make Zope development fit in better with other Python frameworks , while making some of Zope 's innovations easier to use within those frameworks .
Lessons Learned
So , looking back over ten years ' of Python web programming , what stands out ?
" Reuse is hard " .
Because Python often makes it easier to rewrite a feature than to reuse a version which " does almost what I want , " folks often do n't pay enough attention to factoring out the reusable bits from those which are of only local interest .
" Persistence means always having to say you 're sorry . "
( I 've jokingly referred to this as " Seaver 's Law of Software Engineering " ) .
The obvious corrolary is that any system should build in a way to dump and reload precious data from any persistent store , into some format which can be read / manipulated by tools other than those which created it .
" Repeatability is way undervalued . "
We still see lots of cases where the application can only be made to work on one box or OS , or where code is not checked in to a VCS , or where a new developer on a project can flail for weeks without becoming productive .
Paying the up - front tax to make the system software trivially reproducible on any POSIX - compliant box pays enormous dividends over the life of any non-trivial project .
" Testing is no place to get fancy . "
The temptation to factor out " reusable " parts of a testing framework is nearly always a bad idea .
Tests need to be clear , simple , and test exactly one thing , or they lose their value .
Tests which depend on features not impelmented in the module they are supposed to test end up being fragile and slow , as well as tending to do poorer coverage of the moule - under - test .
" The usefulness of a given framework seems inversely proportional to its size . "
Frameworks are about expressing a given feature in terms of interactions between unvarying logic ( implemented in the framework itself ) , and varying logic ( implemented in plugins ) .
The chance that a given framework does what you want is better if it does only that thing .
Looking Forward
I am quite optimistic about where we are going from this point .
I see a lot of shared expectations among Python web developers about sharing code and ideas across project boundaries , and am particularly excited about the trend toward assembling applications from independent parts , using WSGI [ 8 ] .
I think we could be moving toward a shared platform for web development , consisting of a broad spectrum of high - quality components , made to be combined together using the loose coupling provided by the WSGI specification .
Because WSGI allows composing elements together into what is colloquially referred to as a " pipeline " ( really a functional composition ) , the mental model I have for this new platform is one of plumbing together components using standardized connetors ( pipes ) , creating systems which are both agile in the face of changing requirements and simpler to understand , compared to the more monolithic solutions I have seen ( and helped build ) in the past .

Western nations and the US , which chairs the UN Security Council until the end of next month , on Friday condemned the one - candidate presidential runoff in Zimbabwe , warning more serious steps could be taken against Mugabe 's regime .
" Today 's election is a sham .
The election is hollow and its result will be equally hollow and meaningless , " a European Commission spokeswoman said .
Mugabe , in power for 28 years , went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international condemnation after opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew because of state - backed violence against his supporters .
The 84 - year - old Mugabe is the only candidate in Friday 's vote .
" Exercise in mass intimidation "
Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says almost 90 of its supporters have been killed .
There were reports Friday of residents being forced to vote by roving gangs of government supporters searching for those without an ink - stained finger .
Residents of Mbare line up to cast their vote
Tsvangirai said voters were being ordered to record the serial numbers of their ballot papers to identify how they cast their ballots .
Pro-Mugabe militias had threatened to kill anybody abstaining or voting for the opposition , he said .
Tsvangirai said at a press conference Friday the results of the vote would " reflect only the fear of the people : " He added : " What is happening today is not an election .
It is an exercise in mass intimidation . "
Ministers from the Group of Eight ( G8 ) industrialized countries meeting in Kyoto on Friday also strongly condemned the one - man vote in Zimbabwe , saying they would not recognize any Mugabe government that emerged from the runoff vote .
" We will not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people , " Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia and the US said in a statement .
US threatens sanctions
" None of us believe that the quote - unquote election today represents the sort of contest that can bring credit to any country , " British Foreign Secretary David Miliband told reporters .
" There is no legitimacy for a government claiming election on the basis of today 's events because this was an election which was one sided in every aspect , " he added .
Mugabe casting his vote in Harare
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the UN Security Council could consider sanctions against the regime .
" There was strong , strong sentiment in that room today that what is going on in Zimbabwe is simply unacceptable in the 21st century and should not be ignored by the international community , " Rice told reporters .
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said his government would propose that EU ambassadors withdraw from Zimbabwe .
Zimbabwe is also expected to dominate the agenda at a meeting of African Union foreign ministers at a summit in Sharm el - Sheikh , Egypt .
A security committee of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) called earlier this week for the vote to be postponed , saying Mugabe 's re-election could lack legitimacy .
Minister slams German paper firm
Separately , Germany 's Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek - Zeul on Friday pressed a Munich - based specialist paper firm to halt deliveries of banknote paper to Zimbabwe , saying it was helping to prop up the Mugabe government .
The company , Giesecke & Devrient ( G&D ) , is under fire in the German media for continuing to trade with the ostracized regime .
A ministry spokesman said Wieczorek - Zeul had pointed out to the company it was signatory to a code of conduct that included a human rights clause .
A sign on a battered wall points the way to a polling station in the city of Bulawayo
A dozen human rights activists demonstrated in front of the company headquarters in Munich on Friday , holding up banners reading : " No cash for terror . "
A G&D spokesman repeated Friday that it was company policy not to comment on individual clients .
" We stick strictly to World Bank rules with all our deliveries , " he said .
The spokesman said deliveries of banknotes went to central banks and not to governments .
The deliveries have been widely reported in the German and British press , along with allegations that Mugabe is keeping himself in power by literally printing money to pay his ministers and supporters .
G&D is reported to provide banknote paper to more than 100 countries and to be the largest printer of euro banknotes .
Students in California 's Fresno Unified school district have a little something to be excited about this week , as officials have just invested $ 650,000 in 1,000 Asus Eee PCs , set for classroom deployment over the next few weeks .
The concept is to use the miniscule laptops alongside good , old - fashioned textbooks , with each student being given the chance to create a " digital portfolio " of essays , drawings , and whatever else they can get away with .
The computers will remain in roughly 60 classrooms , and will be shared by students -- but some worry they 'll hinder the learning process by distracting pupils .
Says Stephen Lewis , a geology professor at California State University , Fresno , " Teaching and learning is a person - to - person business .
Are we moving toward a remote - control classroom ? "
We 're not sure what he means by that ... then again , we drifted off half - way through his statement to watch a video of that dog on a skateboard .
Rep. Luis Gutierrez AP file WASHINGTON 
Further evidence that times are tough :
It now costs more than a penny to make a penny .
And the cost of a nickel is more than 7 cents .
Surging prices for copper , zinc and nickel have some in Congress trying to bring back the steel - made pennies of World War II , and maybe using steel for nickels , as well .
Copper and nickel prices have tripled since 2003 and the price of zinc has quadrupled , said Rep. Luis Gutierrez , D - Ill. , whose subcommittee oversees the U.S. Mint .
Keeping the coin content means " contributing to our national debt by almost as much as the coin is worth , " Gutierrez said .
A penny , which consists of 97.5 % zinc and 2.5 % copper , cost 1.26 cents to make as of Tuesday .
And a nickel — 75 % copper and the rest nickel — cost 7.7 cents , based on current commodity prices , according to the Mint .
That 's down from the end of the 2007 , when even higher metal prices drove the penny 's cost to 1.67 cents , according to the Mint .
The cost of making a nickel then was nearly a dime .
Gutierrez estimated that striking the two coins at costs well above their face value set the Treasury and taxpayers back about $ 100 million last year alone .
A lousy deal , lawmakers have concluded .
On Tuesday , the House debated a bill that directs the Treasury secretary to " prescribe " — suggest — a new , more economical composition of the nickel and the penny .
A vote was delayed because of Republican procedural moves and is expected later in the week .
Unsaid in the legislation is the Constitution 's delegation of power to Congress " to coin money ( and ) regulate the value thereof . "
The Bush administration , like others before , chafes at that .
Just a few hours before the House vote , Mint Director Edmund Moy told House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , that the Treasury Department opposes the bill as " too prescriptive " in part because it does not explicitly delegate the power to decide the new coin composition .
The bill also gives the public and the metal industry too little time to weigh in on the new coin composition , he said .
" We can't wholeheartedly support that bill , " Moy said in a telephone interview .
Moy said he could not say whether President Bush would veto the House version in the unlikely event that it survived the Senate .
Sen. Wayne Allard , R - Colo. , who is retiring at the end of the year , is expected to present the Senate with a version more acceptable to the administration in the next few weeks .
The proposals are alternatives to what many consider a more pragmatic , but politically impossible solution to the penny problem : getting rid of the penny altogether .
" People still want pennies , which is why we 're still making them , " Moy said .
Even Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson acknowledged in a radio interview earlier this year that getting rid of the penny made sense but was n't politically doable — and certainly nothing he is planning to tackle during the Bush team 's final months in office .
In 2007 , the Mint produced 7.4 billion pennies and 1.2 billion nickels , according to the House Financial Services Committee .
Other coins still cost less than their face value , according to the Mint .
The dime costs a little over 4 cents to make , while the quarter costs almost 10 cents .
The dollar coin , meanwhile , costs about 16 cents to make , according to the Mint. Copyright 2008 The Associated Press .

sqlite still causes excessive CPU usage and disk I/O ( the 2nd )
===
Browsing with Firefox 3.0b5 on Hardy ( All updates applied ) causes Xorg to use 50 - 60 % CPU all the time .
This is not limited to a particular site or page - it happens any time when Firefox is rendering pages .
The high CPU usage makes browsing very jerky - switching tabs takes more time than it should , pages appear frozen for a brief moment .
===
From https:/ /bugzilla. mozilla . org/show_ bug.cgi ? id=430530 # c4 :
After some testing , it looks like this gets pretty bad on linux .
Once we hit sqlite 's cache size , sqlite starts hitting the disk pretty hard .
While the database is small this is n't a big deal ( we do n't hit the cache
limit ) , and once we 're up - to - date it is n't as bad ( we are n't adding as much
data ) .
But during the middle / end of the push to get the complete database , things take
way too long , and we 're thrashing the disk the whole time .
We can reduce the amount of IO by increasing the cache size , and that 'll help
some ( it 'll help a whole lot if we increase the cache size by enough to hold
the db ) .
We might also need to look at throttling the update process a bit , so
that we do n't slam the system all at once ...

Findings
The Congress finds the following :
(1) The freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution .
(2) Free speech , the free exchange of information , and the free expression of ideas and opinions are essential to the functioning of representative democracy in the United States .
(3) The free expression and publication by journalists , academics , commentators , experts , and others of the information they uncover and develop through research and study is essential to the formation of sound public policy and thus to the security of Americans .
(4) The First Amendment jurisprudence of the Supreme Court , articulated in such precedents as New York Times v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 ( 1964 ) , and its progeny , reflects the fundamental value that Americans place on promoting the free exchange of ideas and information , requiring in cases involving public figures a demonstration of actual malice — that is , that allegedly defamatory , libelous , or slanderous statements about public figures are not merely false but made with knowledge of that falsity or with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity .
(5) Some persons are obstructing the free expression rights of Americans , and the vital interest of the American people in receiving information on matters of public importance , by first seeking out foreign jurisdictions that do not provide the full extent of free - speech protection that is fundamental in the United States and then suing Americans in such jurisdictions in defamation actions based on speech uttered or published in the United States — speech that is fully protected under First Amendment jurisprudence in the United States and the laws of the several States and the District of Columbia .
(6) Some of these actions are intended not only to suppress the free speech rights of journalists , academics , commentators , experts , and other individuals but to intimidate publishers and other organizations that might otherwise disseminate or support the work of those individuals with the threat of prohibitive foreign lawsuits , litigation expenses , and judgments that provide for money damages and other speech - suppressing relief .
(7) The governments and courts of some foreign countries have failed to curtail this practice , permitting lawsuits filed by persons who are often not citizens of those countries , under circumstances where there is often little or no basis for jurisdiction over the Americans against whom such suits are brought .
(8) Some of the plaintiffs bringing such suits are intentionally and strategically refraining from filing their suits in the United States , even though the speech at issue was published in the United States , in order to avoid the Supreme Court ’s First Amendment jurisprudence and frustrate the protections it affords Americans .
(9) The Americans against whom such suits are brought must consequently endure the prohibitive expense , inconvenience , and anxiety attendant to being sued in foreign courts for conduct that is protected by the First Amendment , or decline to answer such suits and risk the entry of costly default judgments that may be executed in countries other than the United States where those individuals travel or own property .
( 10 ) Journalists , academics , commentators , experts , and others subjected to such suits are suffering concrete and profound financial and professional damage for engaging in conduct that is protected under the United States Constitution and essential to informing the American people , their representatives , and other policy - makers .
( 11 ) In turn , the American people are suffering concrete and profound harm because they , their representatives , and other government policymakers rely on the free expression of information , ideas , and opinions developed by responsible journalists , academics , commentators , experts , and others for the formulation of sound public policy , including national security policy .
ADEL , Iowa –
In the wide field of Democratic presidential candidates , Senator Barack Obama is the only one who represents the nation ’s heartland .
Illinois ranks fifth in overall agricultural output , producing more corn , soybeans and hogs than most states in America .
That , of course , does not make Mr. Obama a farming expert .
He said so himself , moments after arriving here this afternoon on the Van Fossen Farm , where he stood between a tasseling corn field and a soybean field with leaves slowly rippling in the breeze .
“ Although there are an awful lot of farms in Illinois , in the neighborhood where I live , the main livestock is squirrels , ” said Mr. Obama , who lives on Chicago ’s South Side .
“ So I do n’t pretend to know everything there is to know about agricultural issues . ”
So the Obama campaign convened a Rural Issues Forum outside this central Iowa town , about 30 minutes from Des Moines .
For more than an hour , he took questions about a smattering of issues .
When the conversation veered away from farming – as it often did – Mr. Obama sought to steer it back to agriculture policy .
In case you ’re wondering , yes , Mr. Obama did reprise the ongoing exchange he has been having with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton over whether they would agree to meet with foreign leaders .
Weaving it in a larger message of change , he said : “ Some of you noticed that this week I got into a debate with one of my colleagues who is also running for the presidency .
The debate was about whether or not we talk to world leaders even when you do n’t like them .
My theory is you do and you do it without preconditions . ”
Hearing that , the crowd applauded .
And the conversation returned to food and farms , including a question from one man at the back of the crowd who extended an offer to Mr. Obama .
“ You can come and help me load hogs in the morning , ” he said .
“ You can tell that I ’m dressed for it , ” replied Mr. Obama , casually dressed in slacks and a pressed shirt .
Again , the crowd applauded and laughed .
One line that landed a little flat , though , was when Mr. Obama sympathetically noted that farmers have not seen an increase in prices for their crops , despite a rise in prices at the supermarket .
“ Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula ? ” the senator said .
“ I mean , they ’re charging a lot of money for this stuff . ”
The state of Iowa , for all of its vast food production , does not have a Whole Foods , a leading natural and organic foods market .
The closest ?
Omaha , Minneapolis or Kansas City .
Mr. Obama , perhaps sensing a lack of reaction from the crowd , moved along to the next topic .
After all , he never claimed to be a farming expert .
By Qin Yue and Qi Yue , Sound of Hope , via the Epochtimes , Updated Mar 28 , 2008 -
Evidence is accumulating that the Chinese regime orchestrated violence in Lhasa in order to discredit the peaceful protests of Buddhist monks .
According to the Dalai Lama ’s Chinese translator , Ngawang Nyendra , a witness reported that a Chinese policeman in Lhasa disguised himself as a Tibetan and joined the protesters holding a knife in his hand .
This witness also recognized the man from BBC news footage and news photos provided by China .
A Chinese woman from Thailand ( who prefers that her name not be used ) was studying in Lhasa when the protests broke out in March .
As one of her friends is a policeman , she visited him at the local police station quite often and got to know other policemen there .

After the protests on March 14 , she and other foreigners were sent to the police station where she saw a man with a knife in his hand walking in with some arrested Tibetans .
The man later took off the Tibetan - style clothes and put on a police uniform .
This woman was sent out of Lhasa with other foreigners the next day .
When she arrived in India via Nepal , she recognized the policeman she had seen in Tibetan garb from BBC TV news and photos that the Chinese embassy had provided to the media .
Ngawang Nyendra said the witness was shocked when she saw the policeman in the BBC broadcast .
She realized then that the man had disguised himself as a Tibetan in order to incite people to riot .

The witness contacted a Tibetan organization in India and told them what she had seen .
At a rally on March 17 , the organization publicized a news photo originally provided by the Chinese Embassy in India in which the policeman appeared as a Tibetan rioter .
On Xinhua and other Chinese - language Web sites friendly to the regime , after the rally at which the witness spoke , the policeman in disguise had disappeared from photos taken at the same scene in which he had previously been visible .
Recently , the original man - with - the - knife photo has returned to these Web sites .
Ngawang Nyendra said , “ This photo with this man in it was sent by the Chinese embassy to BBC and Radio Free Asia .
The other photo was sent out later .
They are exactly the same except the man has disappeared from the second photo .
“ From the TV news footage , you can see this man attempting to stab other people with a knife .
But in later shots you can’t find this person any more .
They were acting .
After people raised questions about these shots , this footage never appeared on TV again . ”
Other Evidence
The main claim of the dramatic story told last week by the Dalai Lama ’s translator — that the Chinese regime incited the riots in Lhasa — has lately found corroboration from other sources .
There is first of all the Chinese regime ’s track record of staging this kind of deception .
This is not the first time that the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) has sent policemen to act as rioters in civilian protests in Tibet to stir up violence and frame the protesters .
In his “ Events in Lhasa March 2 - 10 , 1989 ” , the Chinese journalist Tang Daxian revealed how the CCP orchestrated violence as part of a plan to suppress the 1989 protests in Tibet .
According to the article , “ On the dawn of March 5 , the Armed Police in Tibet received the action order from the Chief Commander of Armed Police headquarter , Mr. Li Lianxiu .
… The Special Squad should immediately assign 300 members to be disguised as ordinary citizens and Tibetan monks , entering the Eight - Corner Street and other riot spots in Lhasa , to support plain - clothes police to complete the task .
“ Burn the Scripture Pagoda at the northeast of Dazhao Temple .
Smash the rice store in the business district , incite citizens to rob rice and food , attack the Tibet - Gansu Trading Company .
Encourage people to rob store products , but , only at the permitted locations . ”
According to the commentator Mr. Chen Pokong , “ In this year ’s protest , the riot scene was quite similar to that of 1989 .
A group of young men in their twenties acted in a well organized way .
They first shouted slogans , then burnt some vehicles near the Ramoche Monastery , and then broke into nearby stores and robbed them , and finally burnt scores of the stores .
“ The actions seemed well planned and coordinated , and were conducted with skill .
At the crossroads near the Ramoche Monastery , someone prepared in advance many stones of a similar size , each weighing a couple of kilograms .
These stones magically escaped the attention of numerous policemen and plainclothes agents who flooded the city . ”
Mr. Chen ’s account of what happened this year is corroborated by the British high - tech spy agency GCHQ , whose satellites observed Chinese police incite the riots in Lhasa , according to a report in the G2 Bulletin .
These accounts also help make sense of puzzling aspects of a report in the New York Times on the scene on the streets of Lhasa on March 14 .
According to the NY Times , “ Foreigners and Lhasa residents who witnessed the violence were stunned by what they saw , and by what they did not see : the police .
Riot police officers fled after an initial skirmish and then were often nowhere to be found . ”
“ One monk reached by telephone said other monks noticed that several officers were more interested in shooting video of the violence than stopping it .
‘ They were just watching , ’ the monk said .
‘ They tried to make some videos and use their cameras to take some photos , ' ” according to the NY Times .
The publication of the photo of the man with the knife by Xinhua and its distribution by the Chinese Embassy , as reported by the Dalai Lama ’s translator , would be consistent with this monk ’s observation .
Meanwhile , the Tibetans continue to assert that the Chinese regime has been hoodwinking the world about what happened during the protests in Lhasa .
30 young monks broke into a press briefing behind held on Thursday by the Chinese regime in Jokhang Temple in Lhasa .
According to USA Today reporter Callum MacLeod ( as reported by Reuters ) , the young monks shouted , “ Do n’t believe them .
They are tricking you .
They are telling lies . ”

After paying $ 75 to fill his black Dodge Ram pickup truck for the third time in a week , Douglas Chrystall could n't take it anymore .
Feeling pinched at the pump , and guilty as well , Chrystall , a 39 - year - old father from Wellesley , is putting ads online to sell the truck , and the family 's other gas - guzzler , a Jeep Grand Cherokee .
He knows it will be tough to unload them because he is one of a growing number of consumers downsizing to smaller , more fuel - efficient cars .
Americans are turning away from the boxy , four - wheel - drive vehicles that have for years dominated the nation 's highways .
Sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks - symbols of Americans ' obsession with horsepower , size , and status - are falling out of favor as consumers rich and poor encounter sticker shock at the pump , paying upward of $ 80 to fill gas tanks .
The sale of new SUVs and pickup trucks has dropped precipitously in recent months amid soaring gas prices and a weakening economy : SUV sales for the month of April alone fell 32.3 percent from a year earlier and small car sales rose 18.6 percent .
This fundamental shift comes against a backdrop of relentless gas increases , and growing concerns over the environment and US oil consumption , according to auto analysts and car dealers .
" The SUV craze was a bubble and now it is bursting , " said George Hoffer , an economics professor at Virginia Commonwealth University whose research focuses on the automotive industry .
" It 's an irrational vehicle .
It 'll never come back . "
With stocks of unwanted new SUVs and pickups piling up at dealerships across the country , automakers are offering unprecedented promotions .
Incentives for large SUVs , including cash rebates , topped $ 4,000 in March , or more than double those offered in March 2002 , according to Edmunds.com , which monitors the motor industry .
At the same time , consumers like Chrystall are flooding the market with used SUVs , trying to trade in hulking Hummers for compact Corollas , and getting thousands of dollars less than they would have just a few months ago .
In April , the average used SUV took more than 66 days to sell , at a 20 percent discount from vehicle valuation books , such as Kelley Blue Book , compared to 48 days and a 7.8 percent discount a year earlier , reported CNW Marketing Research , an automotive marketing research company .
With a sun-drenched boardwalk just a short ferry ride across the bay from San Francisco , the former shipyard community of Vallejo ought to be buzzing .
But it is n't - the city has officially gone bust .
Pushed over a financial precipice by wider economic woes , Vallejo 's city authority has declared itself bankrupt .
Its demise has triggered anger in a place that was once , for a fleeting few months in the 1850s , the capital of California .
Funding for police , firefighters , senior citizens , road maintenance , libraries and parks is up in the air until a bankruptcy judge has scoured the books .
The city of 117,000 people is $ 17 m ( £ 8.7 m ) short of what it needs to pay the bills .
" Bankruptcy is n't your first choice .
Or your second or third , really .
It 's your last choice , " says Stephanie Gomes , a local council member .
" But for us , the system is so broke it 's actually a huge opportunity to get in , clean out all the good ol ' boy politics and fix the problems . "
A stone 's throw from the Napa Valley wine district , Vallejo was known for its warships - the nearby Mare Island naval shipyard produced 500 vessels including several nuclear submarines before it shut in 1996 .
Since then Vallejo has prospered from a housing boom fuelled by commuters seeking affordable homes within reach of San Francisco .
For years , taxes and fees rolled in as developers speckled the city 's scorched hills with immaculate estates .
The sub - prime mortgage crisis in the United States was a jolt .
Homes in many estates lie empty because their owners could not afford loan repayments and , with lots of vacant homes , construction has halted .
" There are n't many housing starts so we are n't getting the fees , " says council spokeswoman JoAnn West .
Extreme
A Californian law , Proposition 13 , constrains cities from raising tax rates on existing properties .
With prices in some areas falling 50 % , savvy residents have had their homes revalued and are paying much lower rates .
John Quigley , a professor of economics at the University of California , says : " Vallejo may be extreme but other cities exhibit the same symptoms . "
In some parts of the state , he says , property prices doubled over 15 months in 2003 and 2004 .
The extent of the boom has made the downturn more dramatic .
" I do n't see any evidence that we 've hit the bottom in California , " he says .
" You 're talking several years of decline . "
The state of Vallejo 's finances has prompted questions .
Why , for example , is it paying six - figure salaries to many police officers and firefighters ?
Marc Garman , a community activist and blogger , says powerful unions representing the emergency services won generous deals from politicians that are unaffordable in tough times , adding : " They left reality in the dust . "
Some say the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre led to pay inflation in the emergency services as local authorities found it hard to say no to workers held in high public esteem .
" Kids grow up wanting to be firemen , " says Gomes .
" It 's a hero 's job and 9/11 put that on a whole new level .
If you criticise police or firefighters , you 're anti-hero . "
According to the police union , though , Vallejo 's bankruptcy is a ploy to diddle its members out of money .
Only with permission from a bankruptcy judge can Vallejo break its pay contracts .
Mat Mustard , vice - chairman of the Vallejo Police Officers '
Association , says his members have made $ 10.6 m in salary concessions over six years .
" This bankruptcy has nothing to do with financing .
This bankruptcy has to do with breaking union contracts and obligations the city has to its employees . "
Vallejo is not the first US municipal authority to declare bankruptcy , but is the biggest to do so as a result of a deficit in tax revenue .
Orange County sought protection from creditors in 1994 after making bad investments and New York came close when President Ford refused to bail it out in 1975 , the Daily News proclaiming : " Ford to city : drop dead . "
On Vallejo's main drag , Georgia Street , is a motley selection of antiques stores and discount retailers .
Along the waterfront , the city shows a more prosperous face as commuters park their cars and dash for a boat across the bay .
Taking a morning walk , retired management professor Carlyle Johnson says bankruptcy is dismal news for those reliant on local services .
" The federal government can print money but local governments can't .
There 's no way for them to come up with any more money . "
Case study
Manicured lawns and ornamental stone cladding are the norm in Hyde Park , a gated community in the hilly suburbs of Vallejo .
But the estate is peppered with for sale signs , many of which bear two giveaway words - " bank owned " .
At the peak of the market two years ago , a typical Hyde Park home of four or five bedrooms went for $ 1 m and the estate was sold out .
Buyers can pick up a house now for as little as $ 400,000 ( £ 205,600 ) .
" The banks are competing with themselves to drop prices , " says Ron Lee , a broker at a north Californian estate agency .
And lenders have become more circumspect .
" At least you have to prove your income now , " Lee says .
" They 're not just taking your word for it . "
Valerie Wilson may be the best known former intelligence operative in recent history , but a federal judge in New York ruled Wednesday that she was not allowed to say how long she worked for the Central Intelligence Agency in the memoir she plans to publish this fall .
Although the fact that Ms. Wilson worked for the C.I.A. from 1985 to 2006 has been published in the Congressional Record and elsewhere , the judge , Barbara S. Jones of Federal District Court in Manhattan , said Ms. Wilson was not free to say so .
“ The information at issue was properly classified , was never declassified and has not been officially acknowledged by the C.I.A. , ” Judge Jones wrote .
Asked whether the ruling would affect the book ’s scheduled publication date in October , Adam Rothberg , a spokesman for Ms. Wilson ’s publisher , Simon & Schuster , said only that the book would appear “ this fall , ” suggesting that revisions required by the decision may cause a slight delay .
David B. Smallman , a lawyer who represented Ms. Wilson and Simon & Schuster in the suit they had filed to include the information , said his clients had not decided whether to appeal .

The four remaining members of the Baby team will be honoured in Manchester
Sixty years ago the " modern computer " was born in a lab in Manchester .
The Small Scale Experimental Machine , or " Baby " , was the first to contain memory which could store a program .
The room - sized computer 's ability to carry out different tasks - without having to be rebuilt - has led some to describe it as the " first modern PC " .
Using just 128 bytes of memory , it successfully ran its first set of instructions - to determine the highest factor of a number - on 21 June 1948 .
" We were extremely excited , " Geoff Tootill , one of the builders of Baby told BBC News .
" We congratulated each other and then went and had lunch in the canteen . "
Mr Tootill , and three other surviving members of the Baby team , will be honoured by the University and the British Computer Society at a ceremony in Manchester .
Number cruncher Baby was the successor to machines such as the American ENIAC and the UK's Colossus .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement ENIAC was built to calculate the trajectory of shells for the US army , whilst Colossus was used to decrypt messages from the German High Command during World War II .
Both computers were able to be reprogrammed but this could involve days of rewiring .
Baby was designed to overcome this limitation .
" It was the earliest machine that was a computer , in the sense of what everyone today understands a computer to be , " explained Chris Burton of the Computer Conservation Society ( CCS ) .
" It was a single piece of hardware which could perform any application depending on what program you put in . "
The key to this ability was its memory , built from a cathode ray tube ( CRT ) , which could be used to store a program .
" It was an extraordinary analogue for today 's DRAM ( dynamic random access memory ) , " said Mr Burton .
Electrical charges on the screen of the CRT were used to represent binary information .
A positive charge represented a one and a negative charge a zero .
It really must have been an extraordinary , exciting and heady time
Chris Burton
A metal grid attached to the screen read the different charges .
A graphical representation - dashes for a one and dots for a zero - was displayed on a second CRT wired in parallel to the memory device .
" The operator peered at the monitor tube and he could see the same patterns as in the storage tube , " said Mr Burton .
The memory gave programmers a total of 1024 bits , or 128 bytes , to play with .
This had to store both the program and all of the data to be crunched .
By comparison , a modern 1GB DRAM chip can store around 8 billion bits .
Dashing times
However , the size of the memory did not prevent the Manchester University team writing relatively complex programs .
" You can write very sophisticated and interesting programs even with that limitation , " said Mr Burton .
Programming the machines took a great deal of hard work

" They 're not efficient , but nobody was talking about efficiency , it was about feasibility . "
The first program was written by the late Tom Kilburn to work out the highest factor of a prime number .
" We used this , of course , to test the machine , " said Mr Tootill .
" It took it a very long time , so we had our leisure to see how the circuits were working - to see if any were on the verge of failure , that sort of thing . "
Because of the limitations of the display the team tested the machine using prime numbers .
" If you give it a prime number to try then the highest factor of that is one , " said Mr Burton .
" If what they saw when they ran the program was a one - in other words , a dash when everything else was dots - then bingo , they knew it was working . "
The team eventually refined their techniques , writing more complex programs and adding to the computers memory .
Baby morphed into the Manchester Mark I and eventually the first commercial general purpose computer , the Ferranti Mark I .
" It really must have been an extraordinary , exciting and heady time , " said Mr Burton .
A working replica of Baby is on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester .

I love these precious flower pots shaped like large eggs ( ostrich egg size , I think ) which are , in fact , mini gardens .
They guys from Chocosho think these would make great gifts and I agree with them .
The eggling comes as an intact peat egg ( a fortified mixture ) , but when you crack the top by tapping it with a spoon or something you will find a plant ready to grow : cactus , lavender , basil and even strawberry .
The seeds are already sown into so the cultivation is easy .
Water it , place it in a bright spot and enjoy your lovely egg - shaped nature corner .
Price $ 9.50 , available at Chocosho .
I am amazed at how often bacon and candy cross paths .
Candy Addict has done articles on chocolate - covered bacon , gummi bacon , and bacon jellybeans .
Now we can add Bacon Mints to the list .
When I was offered some Bacon Mints to review , I immediately said “ hell , yes ! ” but wondered what they would taste like .
When the package arrived , it contained two tins of Bacon Mints and two tins of Bacon Flavored Toothpicks ( more on those later ) .
Opening the shipping package brought a scent to my nose that I was n’t prepared for .
It was bacony , minty , and had a smell of a hospital .
The smell was odd and did n’t hit me as being an appetizing smell .
I opened a tin and took a big sniff and it nearly knocked me over and I do n’t mean that in a good way .
It was an absolutely awful smell .
It ’s really hard to describe , but it ’s not a smell you want to get a whiff of .
At this point I was n’t really looking forward to trying them , but reviewing candy is n’t all about tasty chocolate – sometimes you must eat some questionable candy .
The mints taste as bad as I thought they would .
It was maybe 30 seconds in my mouth and I had to spit it out .
It was awful .
It ’s one of the worst tasting candies / mints I have ever had .
Just thinking about it makes me nauseous .
I took a tin to work to share with my co-workers too ( with fair warning ) .
I set the tin on my cabinet shelf behind me at about 8:00 AM and I could only last til 11:00 AM and I had to move them to my car – the smell ( even through the closed tin ) was overwhelming .
Nobody at work dared try them – even the guys that ate crickets with me would n’t try them .
My sisters tried them with me one day and we all spit ours out in less than ten seconds .
I just tried one more while writing this to make sure the taste was fresh in my mind and palette .
Good lord they ’re hideous .
I ’m not sure who came up with the idea of mixing mint and bacon , or who gave the final OK to start making these , but I have to question that person ’s sanity .
The only good use I can think of for these is hiding ten or so of these in your enemy ’s workspace and watching them go crazy trying to find the source of the smell .
If I have n’t convinced you not to buy these yet , two tins of 100 mints will run you $ 4.95 .
Oh – and for the record – one of my dogs ate one , the other refused .
And the Bacon Flavored Toothpicks ?
Almost made me gag .
Seriously .
I have an unopened tin of the Bacon Mints and an unopened tin of the Bacon Flavored Toothpicks that I must get rid of so leave a comment on this post before Thursday , March 1 , 2007 and I ’ll randomly draw one of the commenters to get them – be sure and leave a real email address so we can contact you ( your email wo n’t appear on the site ) .
Do n’t say I did n’t warn you though .
UPDATE : Congratulations to Austin – he is the winner of the bacony badness !
AMERICAN motorists got more bad news this week as the Department of Energy said the price of petrol is likely to stay around the recent record of $ 4 a gallon ( 3.8 litres ) until 2010 .
Drivers have already been cutting back .
The latest figures from the Department of Transportation show that in March , when fuel was a far more modest $ 3.22 a gallon , Americans drove 11 billion miles ( 17.7 billion km ) fewer in comparison with a year earlier .
The decrease compared with the previous year , of 4.3 % , is the first since 1979 , and the sharpest since 1942 .

The Advertising Standards Authority has received nearly 200 complaints about the Heinz mayonnaise ad , which - assuming a higher final tally - should make it one of the five most offensive this year .
Let me describe the controversial sales pitch .
There are some kids , with a mum in a white apron , and a dad , but - ah ha !
- when the dad goes to leave , it turns out the mum is n't a mum , she 's a bloke from a New York deli .
The dad gives the him - not - her a kiss goodbye .
Smack on the lips , like some kind of gay , except it has nothing to do with being gay - it is a joke about the mayonnaise being so authentic it's as if your mum has turned into a bloke from a New York deli .
Complaints have centred on the fact that one man kissing another could be construed as homosexuality , and oblige parents to explain to children what that is .
Never mind that mayonnaise can't be advertised between kids ' programmes because the fat and salt content is too high .
So it does n't matter that the product is so injurious to health that the mere mention of it is thought too toxic for pre-watershed telly ; and it does n't matter that both the stated and tacit messages of the advert are nothing to do with sexuality of any sort , it 's a straight " mayonnaise is nice " underpinned by the British - ad fascination with men dressed as women revealed as men ( think Bounty - wipe not bar ) .
I do n't mind the existence of the odd humourless homophobe , but I 'm interested by their sense of entitlement , considering what a marginal view they hold .
They look around , see anti-discrimination legislation all about , see a gay wedding officiated by an actual bishop , and still think the ASA will be on their side .
It never occurs to me to lodge a complaint with the ASA and this is categorically not because I 'm never offended .
I 'm constantly offended .
I hate the preponderance of alternative indie music on the ad circuit , so that everything from a Samsung camera to a Toyota people carrier or an Orange chat plan is flogged with the voice of some sub-Joanna Newsome no mark .
Not only is it cynical , this pretence that buying a big square car is the " alternative " choice , but it appropriates and tramples over the aural landscape of the outsider so that there 's nowhere for even an outsider to feel at home .
It 's disgraceful ; a genuine traducement of the purpose of art , which is to make us feel that we 're not alone .
On feminist grounds , I object to the Corsodyl advert ; a camera travels pervily over the body of a young woman , lingering on her thighs , arse and breasts , before coming to a stop at her mouth , where she 's missing a tooth because of her poor oral hygiene .
I guess it 's meant to be funny , though it 's hard to pin it down - is it a take - off of sexist 70s ads ?
I do n't think it 's even that self - aware .
I think it 's an old - fashioned reversal - of - expectation gag .
" Ah !
The shock !
Her breasts were so promising , and yet she has a mouth like a graveyard .
While we 've got your horrified attention , ladies , might we suggest this mouthwash ? "
What a nauseating comic backwater .
Who would want to explain to their daughter why this kind of thing would never happen to a boy ?
Ok , I am rustling up a bit of this outrage .
I have to admit that Corsodyl does work , and my mouth would be an emptier place without it .
But my objections would have no greater trouble - considerably less , I think - gathering adherents than would those of people who do n't like the kissing men .
Why do n't lefties complain more ?
First , we assume watchdog bodies such as the ASA will be on the side of a very old - fashioned respectability , despite all evidence that mainstream culture is more evolved than that .
Second , we are lazy bleeders .
When an ad featuring men kissing is one of the most complained about , that matters : not as a reflection on the nation 's scattered homophobes breathing their last gasp , but as a sign that the rest of us do n't complain anything like enough .

The news that the unemployment rate jumped half a percentage point in May has certainly received plenty of coverage in the news .
A closer look at the data reveals some interesting sub-plots .
As several analysts have pointed out , the rise in the unemployment rate is probably picking up a significant increase in the labor force participation rate resulting from high school and college students going into the labor market with the end of school .
The civilian labor force grew by 577,000 , comprising 2/3rds of the 861,000 increase in the number of unemployed ( the remainder were those who lost jobs they had ) .
But what only one or two people have noted is the two groups where the jump in the unemployment rate was the largest : teenagers , where the rate went up 3.3 percentage points and blacks , where the rate went up 1.1 .
The unemployment rate for adult men is 4.9 % and 4.8 % for adult women , but for teenagers it is 18.7 % and 9.7 % for African - Americans .
It is at least possible that in addition to the more general problems in the US economy , last summer 's increase in the federal minimum wage as well as the next jump coming in late July are behind the particulars here .
Last July , the federal minimum wage increased to $ 5.85 / hr and it will go up to $ 6.55 on July 24 of this year .
With a sluggish economy , it certainly seems possible that the higher minimum wage is discouraging employers from hiring lower - skill workers whose productivity cannot justify paying them that wage , particularly if they know they will have to give them a raise come late July .
Economic theory predicts that minimum wage laws will disproportionately harm lower - skill workers such as teenagers and non-whites ( not , it is worth noting , because the latter are inherently less - skilled , but because they have not had the same educational opportunities or other ways to increase their human capital as have whites ) .
This effect of the minimum wage is why higher - skill workers have long supported it as a way to shut out cheaper competition ( e.g. , US unions shutting out immigrants and blacks 60 years ago , white South Africans shutting out black natives 100 years ago , etc. ) .
It would seem that this prediction is born out by some of the facts in the latest US unemployment data .
It might also temper arguments that the May unemployment rate reflects " market " problems as opposed to the undesirable consequences of bad government policies .
And to link this to another discussion here , if one is tempted to minimize the role of self - interest in the political realm , one might wish to read the debates surrounding the creation of the first federal minimum wage law in the US as well as similar laws as part of apartheid in South Africa .
The backers of the US law were not ignorant of its effects ; they knew exactly what it would do ( shut out immigrant and black labor ) , which is precisely why they supported it , and also why a number of politicians voted for it .
For example , in the April Freeman , David Henderson reports the following story :
At a 1957 hearing on increasing the minimum wage , a northern U.S. Senator who favored the increase stated : “ Of course , having on the market a rather large source of cheap labor depresses wages outside of that group , too — the wages of the white worker who has to compete .
And when an employer can substitute a colored worker at a lower wage — and there are , as you pointed out , these hundreds of thousands looking for decent work — it affects the whole wage structure of an area , does n’t it ? ”
Who was the senator ?
Here ’s a hint : just four years later he was the President .
His name : John F. Kennedy .
JFK was not ignorant of the economics of the minimum wage and neither were the unions he was responding to .
The unions were looking after their collective self - interest and JFK knew where the votes came from .
Finally , abolishing the minimum wage is also a good example of using free markets to accomplish Rawlsian ends .
Oops , did n't realize I had n't opened comments !
Go right ahead folks .

A Gloucester bus -spotter ( " omnibologist " ) is being forced to abandon his 40 - year - old hobby of snapping pictures of busses and trams because security kooks keep calling him a terrorist and even a pedophile .
A 30,000 - photo veteran shooter , Rob McCaffrey 's been at this since he was ten , and he says that the harassment in the UK is off the charts — worse than in former Soviet states .
The credit controller , from Gloucester , says he now suffers " appalling " abuse from the authorities and public who doubt his motives .
The bus -spotter , officially known as an omnibologist , said : " Since the 9/11 attacks there has been a crackdown .
" The past two years have absolutely been the worst .
I have had the most appalling abuse from the public , drivers and police over - exercising their authority .
Mr McCaffery , who is married , added : " We just want to enjoy our hobby without harassment .
" I can deal with the fact someone might think I 'm a terrorist , but when they start saying you 're a paedophile it really hurts . "

Chemists measure chilli sauce hotness with carbon nanotubes
( Nanowerk News )
If you cant stand the heat , get out of the kitchen and into the lab  chemists can now use carbon nanotubes to judge the heat of chilli sauces .
The technology might soon be available commercially as a cheap , disposable sensor for use in the food industry .
Richard Compton and his team at Oxford University , UK , have developed a sensitive technique to measure the levels of capsaicinoids , the substances that make chillies hot , in samples of chilli sauce .
They report their findings in the Royal Society of Chemistry journal The Analyst ( " Carbon nanotube - based electrochemical sensors for quantifying the heat of chilli peppers : the adsorptive stripping voltammetric determination of capsaicin " – free access article ) .
The current industry procedure is to use a panel of taste - testers , and is highly subjective .
Comptons new method unambiguously determines the precise amount of capsaicinoids , and is not only quicker and cheaper than taste - testers but more reliable for purposes of food standards ; tests could be rapidly carried out on the production line .
They tested a range of chilli sauces , from the mild  Tabasco Green Pepper sauce to  Mad Dogs Revenge , which sports an extensive health warning and liability disclaimer .
The well - established Scoville method  currently the industry standard  involves diluting a sample until five trained taste testers cannot detect any heat from the chilli .
The number of dilutions is called the Scoville rating ; the relatively mild Jalapeño ranges from around 2500 - 8000 , whereas the hottest chilli in the world , the  Naga Jolokia , has a rating of 1000000 .
High performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) can also be used , but this requires bulky , expensive equipment and detailed analysis of the capsaicinoids .
In Comptons method , the capsaicinoids are adsorbed onto multi-walled carbon nanotube ( MWCNT ) electrodes .
The team measures the current change as the capsaicinoids are oxidised by an electrochemical reaction , and this reading can be translated into Scoville units .
The technique is called adsorptive stripping voltammetry ( ASV ) , and is a relatively simple electrochemical method .
Compton says , ASV is a fantastic detection technique for capsaicinoids because its so simple - it integrates over all of the heat creating constituents because all of the capsaicinoids have essentially the same electrochemical response . 
Here ’s some low - level hackery fun which revealed something I did n’t know about unix until yesterday .
Yi ( the emacs clone in haskell ) currently implements “ code updating ” by persisting the application state , and calling exec ( ) to replace the program code with the latest version , and then restores the previous state .
Lots of applications do this to some extent .
However , yi needs to be a bit smart because ( like emacs ) it can have open network connections and open file handle which also need to survive the restart but are n’t trivially persistable .
For example , yi could be running subshells or irc clients .
Fortunately , this is possible !
When you call exec ( ) , existing file descriptors remain open .
This is very different from starting a new process from scratch .
So all we need to do is persist some information about which descriptors were doing which particular job .
Then , when we start up again , we can rewire up all our file handles and network connections and carry on as if nothing has happened .
Here ’s an example haskell app which shows this in action .
First of all we need to import various bits :
import System .
Posix .
Types import System .
Posix .
Process import System .
Posix .IO import System .IO import Network .
Socket import System ( getArgs , getProgName ) import Foreign .
C.Types
Next we have a “ main ” function which distinguishes between “ the first run ” and “ the second run ” ( ie. after re-exec’ing ) by the presence of command line arguments :
main :: IO ( ) main = do args < - getArgs case args of [ ] -> firsttime [ file_fd , net_fd ] -> reuse ( read file_fd ) ( read net_fd )
The first time we run , we open a network connection to http://example.com and we also open a disk file for writing .
We then re-exec the current process to start over again , but also pass the disk file fd as the first command line argument , and the network socket fd as the second argument .
Both are just integers :
The Clinton campaign is now saying that if Obama does n’t win every single primary / caucus this coming Tuesday with a decisive victory , then he ’s lost big .
Forget the fact that if she does n’t win 65 % of the delegates in both Ohio and Texas , it ’s actually over for her – the math says she simply can’t win the nomination without that margin of victory .
What ’s really disturbing here is that the Clinton campaign is making it clear that if Obama does n’t win Texas , Ohio , Vermont and Rhode Island on Tuesday , and by a huge margin , Hillary plans on staying in the race for the long haul , even if Tuesday is the coup de grace to her campaign .
Yes , it sucks to lose , but once you ’ve lost it ’s better to get out than take us all down with you .
This race is getting far too bitter .
I see it in our own readers – it went from friendly competition to a death match about 4 weeks ago .
If Hillary does n’t get her 65 % of delegates in Ohio and Texas on Tuesday , she needs to accept that she lost , and quit the race .
If she does n’t , then I suspect the negative attacks that are going to be making news next week wo n’t be Hillary ’s at all .
They ’re going to be from the rest of the party demanding that she concede .
O'Reilly , Kucinich spar over impeachment , unite on gas prices David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday June 12 , 2008

Print This Email This Bill O'Reilly introduced Dennis Kucinich on The O'Reilly Factor by referring dismissively to Kucinich 's current attempt to impeach George W. Bush .
" A House vote to impeach President Bush was tabled this afternoon , " O'Reilly remarked snidely .
" This sent it to committee , which means a majority of Congresspeople do n't want to deal with it . "
" It was referred to committee .
It was n't tabled , " Kucinich immediately objected .
The normal first step whenever impeachment charges are brought is to refer them to committee for review .
However , O'Reilly was not to be swayed .
" It 's not going anywhere , " he insisted .
" People on my radio program are saying , ' Why is a smart guy like Dennis Kucinich wasting everybody 's time , taxpayers ' money , on this nonsense ... when we 've got out of control gas prices ? ' "
In response , Kucinich pointed to his attempts to pass a windfall oil profits tax .
He then attempted to change the subject to the Iraq War and the recent Senate Intelligence Committee report , leading O'Reilly to grumble , " Can I get on to really what I want to talk about here ? "
" It 's your show , " Kucinich grinned .
O'Reilly complained that a windfall profits tax would be useless because the oil companies would either pass it on to consumers or just refuse to drill for oil , to which Kucinich replied that " it would be a tax not at the pump , but on profits , " with the money going into a fund to support more fuel - efficient vehicles .
However , when Kucinich mentioned his investigation of " the role of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , " O'Reilly immediately caught fire .
" Oh , I 'm with you on that ! " he exclaimed .
" Go get 'em ! "
" They 're actually standing back while all the speculation is going , " Kucinich explained . "
" Has nothing to do with supply and demand , driving the price of oil ... "
" Look , Congressman , I 'm your best friend on that issue , " O'Reilly chimed in .
" You ought to take all of your time , knock off the dopey partisan impeachment stuff ... get those bad guys . "
" You want me to tell you how they 're connected ? " Kucinich asked .
" This administration is tied very closely to the oil industry , which is why nothing 's been done . "
He suggested that impeachment hearings might pry loose documents like those on Cheney 's secret energy task force which the administration has refused to reveal .
The two men concluded by reaffirming a willingness to work together on the Commodity Futures Trading matter .
" I want those SOB 's taken down , " O'Reilly stressed .
" Let 's work together to save the American consumer at the pump , " Kucinich smiled . "
" Bill O'Reilly and Kucinich , together at last , " This video is from Fox 's O'Reilly Factor , broadcast June 11 , 2008 .

The Democratic Party asked a judge Thursday to order the disclosure of 68 pages of White House e-mails that the Bush administration is trying to keep secret .
The Democratic National Committee is suing the Justice Department over the firing of U.S. attorneys , seeking electronic messages by White House staffers who performed political duties on e-mail accounts of the Republican National Committee .
Dozens of White House staffers had RNC e-mail accounts and the Democratic Party is trying to determine the extent to which those accounts were used in the U.S. attorneys controversy .
Under former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Justice Department officials consulted with the White House on the firings of at least nine federal prosecutors , triggering a furor over a hiring process that favored Republican loyalists .
( Original Article )
By Inés Hayes , with reports from Montevideo by Cristina Camusso and Julio Louis .
Dilemma : From May 22 to 25 , the XIV Sao Paulo Forum was held in Montevideo , Uruguay .
Under the banner ` The Latin American and Caribbean left in the new time , richness in diversity ’ , 844 delegates from 35 countries in Latin America , Asia and Europe participated in this historic meeting .
The first encounter was held in Sao Paulo , Brazil , in 1990 .
The debates over the crucial issues of the 21st century are embodied today in the governments which have emerged through the electoral road .
The historic dilemma of reform or revolution once again returns to centre stage .
The Sao Paulo Forum was born in 1990 at the hands of the Partido de los Trabajadores ( PT , Workers Party ) of Brazil and the Partido Comunista de Cuba ( Communist Party of Cuba ) .
In the context of the disintegration of social and political struggle , the forum achieved an important task .
Nevertheless , with the arrival of governments such as those of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela , Rafael Correa in Ecuador , Evo Morales in Bolivia and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua , and the possibility of once again believing in socialism , the reformist and social democratic positions of some political organisations now clash with the dynamic embodied in new and old experiences of revolutionary organisations .
In this , the XIV edition of the encounter , it was possible to clearly distinguish the two positions .
While these strategies are being debated within administrations such as those in Brazil and Uruguay , governments like those of Venezuela , Ecuador , Nicaragua , Bolivia and Cuba start from the conviction that capitalism is intrinsically inhuman and has to be surpassed .
The opening of the forum was like a frozen snapshot .
Almost as if it was an expression of desires , the Frente Amplio ( Broad Front , Uruguay ) opened the encounter focusing on the issue of governability , the construction of a more humane society , Latin American integration and the construction of another possible world based on more solidarity .
Afterwards came the turn of the secretary of the PT , who put emphasis on the struggle against neoliberalism and on inclusion and integration .
The Cuban , Fernando Ramirez , changed the tone and climate of the encounter .
Ramirez put forward the necessity of revolution and gave a historic outline of the situation of the continent when the forum first emerged 18 years ago .
``We are at the end of an epoch ’’ , he said .
He was the first to mention Hugo Chavez and to talk about what the Bolivarian Revolution had meant for turning around the situation in the continent .
Moreover , he assured that gaining access to government did not presuppose having access to power .
``We are witnessing an epoch of wars , of conflicts , of environmental problems and preventive wars by the United States ’’ , detailed Ramirez , mentioning the failure of Free Trade of Americas Agreement as well as the imposition of the free trade agreements in the continent .
``ALBA , Unasur , Petrocaribe and Petrosur are the real path forward ’’ , he emphasised .
[ ALBA is the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas , an anti-neoliberal trading alliance led by Venezuela , Cuba and Bolivia ; Unasur unites two existing customs unions – Mercosur and the Andean Community – as part of a continuing process of South American integration ; a Caribbean oil alliance with Venezuela to purchase oil at fair prices ; Petrosur is a similar oil agreement involving Venezuela , Brazil and Argentina . ]
Ramirez outlined in detail the way in which the United States was financing the coup - plotting plans in Venezuela , Ecuador and Bolivia and underlined the importance of the unity of parties and movements :
`` The struggle for socialism must be constructed by each one of our peoples ’’ , he concluded .
Integration versus unity
During Saturday May 23 , the speeches in support of socialism gained more strength .
José Renaldo from the Communist Party of Brazil ( Partido Comunista de Brasil ) spoke of the structural crisis of capitalism and marked out Cuba as a permanent example [ of the alternative ] .
Furthermore he highlighted the importance of Venezuela in once again placing socialism on the agenda and the necessity of counting on an anti-imperialist front in Latin America and the world .
``Unasur is a beacon in this sense ’’ , he assured
For his part , Ricardo Patiño , coordinating minister for policy in Ecuador , outlined the consequences of the Ciudadana Revolucion ( Citizens ’ Revolution ) and the risky situation which Latin American finds itself in , denouncing the ``assassinations of Raul Reyes and other people in Ecuadorian territory ’’ and said that [ Colombian President ] ``Uribe will have to prove that a country like Colombia possesses technology that no one else in the continent has ’’ .
Patiño ratified what Correa had said in regards to establishing a Latin American regional organisation to replace the Organisation of American States , without tutelage and with Cuba .
`` There is an attempt to destabilise Ecuador and regionalise the conflict through the use of preventive war doctrines .
The Sao Paulo Forum should ratify its rejection of intervention and aggression against the countries of Latin America ’’ , explained the minister .
Referring to the sovereign decision by Ecuador to dismantle the Manta US military base he said : `` There needs to be , on the part of the Sao Paulo Forum , a line of action , a collective labour to ensure that no United States base exists in our countries . ’’
Moreover , Patiño highlighted the defeat of the right in electoral politics and the coup - plotting role of the mass media .
``Latin American unity has its central axis in Unasur .
None of our countries will be able to triumph on its own : the socialist revolution must spread throughout all of Latin America ’’ , he concluded .
Following the potent speech by Patiño , there was an intervention by Roberto Regalado , member of the Communist Party of Cuba .
``We talk about neoliberalism but neoliberalism is the capitalism of our day ’’ , emphasised Regalado , confronting the positions of those who assure that capitalism can be humanised .
The Communist Party of Paraguay was also present in the forum .
It argued in favour of its support for the recently elected president , Fernando Lugo , and pointed out the importance of the peasant movement .
The Paraguay Communists assured that there was a programmatic agreement with Lugo , including over agrarian reform and the defence of Paraguayan sovereignty against United States ’ intervention .
For their part , both the Partido Humanista and the Communist Party of Chile harshly criticised the Concertación government : `` [ President Michelle ]
Bachelet and the [ ruling ] Concertación [ alliance ] are not involved in the Banco del Sur [ Bank of the South ] , nor in Telesur [ a new pan -Latin American TV channel based in Venezuela ] .
They did not allow Operación Milagros in Chile and the Concertación is intact , exactly how Pinochet designed it .
One example of this is the repression against students and the [ indigenous ]
Mapuche people , who are permanently attacked and persecuted . ’’
The exposition was shorter than the others because the organisers of the forum signalled that their time had run out .
`` It seems that the Concertación cannot be criticised here ’’ , said the speakers .
In concordance with a progressive viewpoint , Marco Aurelio Garcia , vice - president of the PT said that many different lefts exist , not just the reformist and revolutionary ones .
He put forward the necessity of import substitution and the complementarity of sectors .
`` This is a favourable moment for progressive countries ’’ , concluded Garcia .
Taking a Copernican shift , Osvaldo Peredo , member of the Bolivian MAS [ Movement Towards Socialism ] affirmed : ``We are embarking on a socialist project following the examples of Cuba and Venezuela .’’
Ortega : ` Only socialism will make us free ’
The closing speech , given by Nicaragua ’s President Daniel Ortega , was also a counterweight to the positions more focused on the immediate problems of government and electoral issues .
Without equivocation he assured : `` There is no good empire and bad empire , there is no good capitalism and bad capitalism .
We need to bring down the tyranny of global capitalism and the power of the empire .
Elections can no be seen as an end in themselves , this is not the goal . ’’
The death of the FARC ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) leader , Marulanda , traversed throughout all of Ortega ’s speech .
``Marulanda was an extraordinary fighter in a struggle which is rooted in the deep inequalities faced by the Colombian people .
The terrorist is the Yankee government , the European governments , not only because they use military force , but because they have been practising terrorism in a systematic way , assassinating human beings with their economic policies and eagerness to concentrate wealth ’’ , he stated .
Ortega ratified the example of Cuba , Bolivia and Venezuela and classified Colombia as the most destabilising country in Latin America .
``War and narcotrafficking are the big business of the United States ’’ , said the Nicaraguan president , who also warned of the interventionist activity of the Fourth Fleet of the United States , deactivated since 1950 .
`` We need to redouble our capacity to struggle , only socialism will make us free ’’ , he finalised .
The dilemma between reform or revolution was present throughout all the discussions and debates in the forum .
The mark of this encounter will be the struggle between those forces who propose to moderate capitalism and that those that openly come out on the side of the construction of socialism of the 21st century

Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s financial troubles returned to the forefront of the Democrats ’
White House marathon on Thursday as Barack Obama reported raising $ 40 million last month -- double what the New York senator collected .
Clinton ’s $ 20 - million take would be staggering in any other race .
But she faces a rival who has shattered fundraising records , and this latest benchmark highlights Clinton ’s broader difficulties in catching up to the Illinois senator in the protracted nomination fight .
She has reported millions in debts and unpaid bills .
Drawing mainly on earnings from her best - seller , “ Living History , ” Clinton has lent her campaign $ 5 million to keep it from going broke .
She cannot come close to matching Obama in spending on TV ads and mailers in contests over the next two months in eight more states , along with Guam and Puerto Rico .

Clinton , who wrapped up a 24 - hour California fundraising tour Thursday with stops in San Francisco , Pasadena and Beverly Hills , faces further strains in meeting day - to - day expenses -- everything from charter planes and buses to stage equipment for campaign rallies .
“ It ’s stunningly expensive , ” said Jim Jordan , who ran John F. Kerry ’s campaign for part of the 2004 primary season .
“ It ’s hundreds of thousands of dollars a day . ”
For all that , Clinton ’s lag in fundraising is unlikely to drive her from the race , analysts say .
But it is making her climb to the nomination that much tougher .
For starters , it can deter potential donors from giving her money by creating the impression that her campaign is a lost cause .
Advertisement
It also bolsters Obama ’s argument to superdelegates -- the party and elected officials likely to settle the nomination -- that he would raise more money than Clinton for the general - election battle against Sen.
John McCain of Arizona , the Republican nominee - in - waiting .
“ One of the things we consider is electability , and fundraising has a lot to do with electability , ” said Edward Espinoza , an undecided Long Beach superdelegate .
“ It ’s sad , but it ’s true .
I think both of these candidates have proven they can raise enormous sums of cash . ”
So far , Obama has collected $ 230 million to $ 190 million for Clinton .
McCain , who faces a dismal fundraising climate for Republicans , has had less success .
While he has not yet reported numbers for March , he had raised $ 60 million by the end of February .
Advertisement
By some measures , Clinton ’s $ 190 million understates her trouble keeping up with Obama .
It includes the $ 5 - million personal loan and $ 10 million shifted from her Senate campaign .
Also inflating her total , she has made it a practice to raise money -- upward of $ 22 million -- that she can spend only if she wins the nomination .
Clinton has also returned $ 850,000 to donors whose money was gathered by Norman Hsu , a financier who faces federal fraud charges .
From the start , Clinton has relied more than Obama on big - money donors , who gave the $ 2,300 maximum and are legally barred from contributing more .
Advertisement
The $ 40 million that Obama raised last month came from 442,000 donors , 218,000 of whom were new contributors , according to the campaign .
Their average donation was $ 96 .
As for Clinton ’s debt , her report for March is not due until April 20 .
But as of the end of February , her campaign was $ 8.7 million in arrears .
She owed $ 2.5 million to the consulting firm co-founded by her chief strategist , Mark Penn ; $ 807,000 to MSHC , an ad firm ; $ 466,000 to the media firm of Mandy Grunwald ; and $ 427,000 to a charter aircraft company .
Smaller debts included $ 228,000 to Aetna and $ 62,744 to Blue Cross for healthcare premiums ( a spokesman said they were later paid ) , and tens of thousands of dollars to universities where Clinton has campaigned .

Cal State Northridge is awaiting a $ 13,611 payment from Clinton ’s campaign for security and other expenses at an event that she held there Jan. 17 , a university spokesman said .
Clinton ’s money troubles could be worse .
She is well known to voters , and her campaign is drawing intense media coverage , which compensates somewhat for her inability to match Obama in ad spending .
“ There ’s just a huge amount of free press in this -- probably more than I ’ve ever seen before , ” said G. Terry Madonna , a political scientist at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania .
“ It ’s front - page stuff every day . ”
Clinton has tried to turn Obama ’s money edge to her advantage .
She has made it part of her pitch to donors and used it to cast herself as an underdog , a posture that worked well for her in New Hampshire and Ohio .
Speaking to reporters on Thursday in Burbank , where she appeared on NBC ’s “ Tonight Show with Jay Leno , ” Clinton said : “ I ’m used to being outspent . ”
Advertisement
Chris Lehane , a Democratic strategist who worked in the Clinton White House , said her fundraising might not reach Obama ’s “ astronomical level ” but was still better than McCain ’s -- and certainly enough for key contests ahead in such states as Pennsylvania , West Virginia and Indiana .
Hollywood mogul Haim Saban , one of her biggest fundraisers , echoed that argument , borrowing a phrase that former President Bill Clinton used this week in urging Democrats to stop fretting about the campaign ’s extended length : “ Chill out . ” Hillary Clinton , Saban wrote in an e-mail , “ will have all the money she needs to stay competitive . ”

Export Ban on Mercury Compounds Takes Effect
On January 1 , 2020 , the ban on the export of five mercury compounds from the United States takes effect .
The chemicals prohibited from export are mercury ( I ) chloride ( or calomel ) , mercury ( II ) oxide , mercury ( II ) sulfate , mercury ( II ) nitrate , and mercury sulphide ( or cinnabar ) .
The export of elemental mercury was prohibited on January 1 , 2013 .
Read the Federal Register notice prohibiting the export of mercury compounds .
It 's pretty amazing when a sitting President and your ties to his failed policies are the number one liability to your run for the Oval Office .
Despite any real attempt to define McCain as Bush44 , the public already sees the connection loud and clear .
I 've seen conservative after conservative go on TV today to talk about how mavericky John McCain really is .
Nonsense .
On the two most important issues this country faces -- Iraq and the economy -- John McCain is on the same exact page as George W. Bush .
MSNBC :
Sen. Barack Obama ’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright could hurt his presidential hopes .
So could his comment about “ bitter ” small - town America clinging to guns and religion .
And Americans might question Sen. Hillary Clinton ’s honesty and trustworthiness .
But according to the latest NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll , the bigger problem appears to be John McCain 's ties to President Bush .
In the survey , 43 percent of registered voters say they have major concerns that McCain is too closely aligned with the current administration .
Wow .
NES
Final Fantasy IV
Cheeky Squaresoft .
In the flush of success with their initial Final Fantasy games , they cobbled together a screenshot of what they ‘ imagined ’ the next game would look like , along with a cunning press release that promised new job classes like “ cook ” and “ carpenter ” .
That ’s right - though planned , the game never existed at all , and the company instead opted to dedicate their resources to their first SNES title - the Final Fantasy IV we know and love today .
Drac’s Night Out
A woeful tale of in - game advertising run amok .
Drac’s Night
Out got its funding by promising Reebok to put its protagonist , Dracula , into a pair of then - popular pumps .
You ’d then guide the vampire to his girlfriend ’s house for a bloodsucking rendezvous .
But like Dracula himself , Drac ’s Night
Out never saw the light of day , though a prototype of the game sold on eBay for $ 760 in 2005 .
SimCity
A recent discovery , this .
Back in 2005 , somebody doing the housework at Nintendo HQ discovered a SimCity development cartridge - reportedly the only one ever made .
If it really was going to be developed , it makes a kind of cosmic sense , given that the NES was practically the only console that never received a SimCity port .
California Raisins : The Grape Escape
With such corkers as McDonald Land ( McDonald ’s ) and Yo! Noid ( Domino ’s Pizza ) , the NES was no stranger to the awkward advergame .
But this would have been different .
Hammered into shape by Capcom , California Raisins ’ gameplay resembled some of the company ’s other NES classics such as Duck Tales and Chip ‘n Dale Rescue Rangers .
Sadly , the claymation raisins ’ waning popularity led to the finished game getting axed before release .
Master Fighter II
Okay , this is n’t exactly a cancelled game .
In fact , it was n’t even legal .
Master Fighter II was a pirated Famicom conversion of the SNES ’s Street Fighter II .
Amazingly , its gameplay remained pretty faithful to its bigger brother despite the fact it was all kinds of ripped - off .
This sort of piracy is common in China , where shoppers can even pick up some crazy soul ’s conversion of Final Fantasy VII ( which originally came on three CDs , remember ) for the NES .

JUST how much oil is there off the coast of Brazil ?
Until recently , Brazil 's oil reserves were thought to be relatively modest : about 12 billion barrels at the beginning of 2007 , according to BP , or about 1 % of the world 's total .
But last year , Petrobras , Brazil 's partly state - owned oil firm , announced the world 's biggest oil discovery since 2000 : the Tupi field , which it hopes will produce between 5 billion and 8 billion barrels .
Now the head of Brazil 's National Petroleum Agency ( ANP ) says another nearby discovery might hold as much as 33 billion barrels , which would make it the third - largest field ever found .
That alone would be enough to raise Brazil to eighth position in the global oil rankings — and there is talk of further big discoveries .
But the peculiar way in which the information came to light is casting doubt on its significance .
The ANP , which regulates the oil industry in Brazil , was quick to distance itself from the remarks of its boss , Haroldo Lima .
His comments were of a personal nature , it said , and were based on past reports in the media .
It helpfully cited an article from a magazine , World Oil , that had mentioned the magic figure of 33 billion barrels in February .
Petrobras and its partners in the field , BG of Britain and Repsol - YPF of Spain , said that they had not yet done enough tests to determine exactly how much oil it contained .
But no one dismissed the estimate as preposterous .
That , plus the fact that a senior official had given any credence to such a dramatic number , caused the share prices of the three firms to jump , despite the fact that Mr Lima claims he does not even know where the stockmarket is , and certainly did not intend to influence it .
At one point Repsol 's was up by 14 % .
The shares of Hess , an American firm which is part of a consortium looking for oil nearby , posted their biggest gain since 1981 .
Both Tupi and the field mentioned by Mr Lima , Carioca - Sugar Loaf , lie far below the seabed , beneath a thick layer of salt that is some 800 km long and 200 km wide .
José Sérgio Gabrielli , Petrobras 's boss , has hinted that there are vast reserves of oil to be found in this “ pre-salt ” formation .
At any rate , Petrobras has struck oil every time it has drilled there .
It is currently assessing the reserves of yet another nearby discovery , Jupiter , which appears to be very similar in scale to Tupi .
The firm 's head of exploration says “ there is practically no exploratory risk ” in the area .
While this does not necessarily transform Brazil into an oil power on a par with Venezuela or Saudi Arabia , as Dilma Rousseff , the chairman of Petrobras 's board and chief of staff to Brazil 's president , has excitedly proclaimed , it suggests that the volumes of oil involved are very big .
Nonetheless , the immediate impact of the “ pre-salt ” discoveries will be small .
It will be several years at least before any of the new oil comes to market .
What is more , it will be expensive to produce .
The fields are all far out at sea , deep under ground that is itself far below sea level .
Simply drilling the first test well at Tupi cost $ 240 m , and costs are likely to rise , thanks to fierce inflation throughout the oil industry .
As if to underscore the point , the oil price hit a new record , of $ 114.41 a barrel , a couple of days after Mr Lima dropped his bombshell .
Even if there is an ocean of oil off Brazil 's coast , it will not necessarily be of much benefit to big oil firms , which have struggled to gain access to promising territory for exploration of late , thanks to growing nationalism in oil - rich countries .
Brazil had been a heartening exception .
But after Petrobras announced the discovery at Tupi , the ANP cancelled a planned auction of rights to explore for oil in several adjacent areas .
Mr Gabrielli , the boss of Petrobras , says that the state 's relatively low share of the revenues from oil production in Brazil should be increased to reflect the decreasing risks and increasing profitability of exploration .
The discoveries do suggest that the gloomiest pundits are wrong to predict that the world will soon run out of oil .
It is not that there are still lots of huge oil fields out there : the number of mammoth discoveries is declining , Tupi ( and perhaps Carioca - Sugar Loaf and Jupiter ) notwithstanding .
But the new finds do illustrate how the technology with which oil firms hunt for , extract and process fossil fuels is constantly improving .
Petrobras 's recent success is only possible thanks to recent advancements in seismic surveys , drilling , and offshore platforms .
Other technological developments are allowing a greater proportion of the oil found around the world to be recovered and are even expanding the definition of oil , as firms conjure liquid fuel from the solid tar - sands of Canada , for example , or from coal and natural gas .
Indeed , among the shares that rose in the wake of Mr Lima 's comments were those of the firms that supply Petrobras with all its clever kit .
The climax of Barack Obama ’s 1995 memoir , “ Dreams from My Father , ” occurs in rural Kenya when the author sits between the graves of his father and his grandfather and weeps .
Obama , then in his late twenties , hardly knew his father and never met his grandfather , but in the course of writing the book he had learned their stories in devastating detail .
Both were proud , ambitious men who travelled far from the Luo- speaking villages where they grew up — indeed , Obama ’s grandmother still has her son ’s Harvard diploma hanging in her house nearby .
Their respective struggles in the world ended painfully , in bitter loneliness .
Beside their graves , Obama , a middle - class American , both mourns and , for the first time , understands his African forebears .
People in Illinois seem largely unaware of Obama ’s long , annealing trip into their midst , although they often remark on his unusual calm .
Now forty - two and a state senator , Obama emerged , in March , from a raucous primary as the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate .
In a seven - person field , he received a remarkable fifty - three per cent of the vote — he even won the “ collar ” counties around Chicago , communities that supposedly would never support a black candidate .
And everyone recalls that , as the votes were being tallied at his headquarters on Election Night , he seemed to be the least agitated person in the place .
Obama ’s Republican opponent in November will be Jack Ryan , a wealthy political neophyte .
The seat they are competing for is now held by a Republican , Peter Fitzgerald , who is retiring .
An Obama victory thus would move the Senate Democrats , at present outnumbered fifty - one to forty - eight , one seat closer to a majority .
It also would make Obama only the third African - American to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction .
On a raw , rainy late - April day in Springfield , the state capital , Obama , who represents a district on Chicago ’s South Side , ducked out of the statehouse for a meeting with labor leaders from southern Illinois at an A.F.L. - C.I.O. building down the street .
“ This is a kiss - and - make - up session , ” he told me as we entered a ground - floor conference room — the state A.F.L. - C.I.O. had supported one of his opponents in the Democratic primary .
Twenty - five white males , in windbreakers and golf shirts , sat around the room .
They represented the building trades — the painters ’ union , the carpenters .
Obama , lanky and dapper in a dark suit , his shoulders almost strangely relaxed , seemed to know most of the men there .
He broke the ice with a joke at the expense of Ed Smith , a huge , tough - looking delegate from Cairo .
Obama had met Smith ’s mother on a recent downstate swing and had discovered that “ she ’s the one who really calls the shots there . ”
Smith laughed , and the other delegates said they wanted her phone number .
Then Obama gave a short , blunt , pro-labor speech .
The men eyed him carefully .
Heads began nodding slowly , jaws set , as he drove his points home : “ two hundred thousand jobs lost in Illinois under Bush ; overtime rights under threat for eight million workers nationally ; the right to organize being eroded . ”
Then he said , “ I need your help , ” and took questions .
The questions were terse , specific , well informed .
They dealt with federal highway funding , non-union companies coming in from out of state on big contracts , the implications of the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement .
Obama listened closely , and his answers were fluent and dauntingly knowledgeable , but he kept his language colloquial .
“ It ’s not enough just to vote right , ” he said .
“ You gotta advocate .
You gotta reframe the debate , use informal power .
A lot of these bills coming up now are lose - lose for Democrats . ”
“ That ’s right , ” somebody said .
“ I have a reputation as this abstract guy talking about civil rights , ” Obama went on .
“ But anybody who knows my state legislative district knows I fight for our share of resources .
And I will fight for Illinois highway dollars . ”
He mostly told the union men what they wanted to hear .
Then he said , “ There ’s nobody in this room who does n’t believe in free trade , ” which provoked a small recoil .
These men were ardent protectionists .
A little later , he said , with conviction , “ I want India and China to succeed ” — a sentiment not much heard in the outsourcing - battered heartland .
He went on , however , to criticize Washington and Wall Street for not looking after American workers .
Later , I asked him if he was n’t waving a red flag in front of labor by talking about free trade .
“ Look , those guys are all wearing Nike shoes and buying Pioneer stereos , ” he said .
“ They do n’t want the borders closed .
They just do n’t want their communities destroyed . ”
Back at the statehouse , Obama , who is chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee , rushed from meeting to floor vote to committee room .
Everybody seemed to want a word with him .
Terry Link , the senate majority whip , complained about Obama ’s successes in a long - running poker game .
“ I ’m putting his kids through college , ” Link said .
Kirk Dillard , a leading Republican senator from the Chicago suburbs , looked chagrined when I asked him about Obama .
“ I knew from the day he walked into this chamber that he was destined for great things , ” he said .
“ In Republican circles , we ’ve always feared that Barack would become a rock star of American politics . ”
Still , Dillard was gracious .
“ Obama is an extraordinary man , ” he said .
“ His intellect , his charisma .
He ’s to the left of me on gun control , abortion .
But he can really work with Republicans . ”
Dillard and Obama have co-sponsored many bills .
Though Dillard was unwilling to concede the general election to Obama , he described Illinois as “ a major player in recognizing African - Americans .
We are proudly the state that produced Abraham Lincoln . ”
Obama was actually born in Hawaii .
His father , also named Barack Obama , was a foreign student there .
His mother , Ann , was white , and only eighteen when she married his father .
She and her parents , originally from Kansas , had moved to Honolulu .
When her husband left for Harvard , she and their toddler stayed behind — there was no money in his scholarship for them to go East — and the father ultimately returned alone to Kenya , where he worked as a government economist .
Barack ’s mother ’s second marriage , to an Indonesian oil manager , occasioned a move to Jakarta , when Barack was six .
He lived there for four years , and in his book he writes about his time in Indonesia as simultaneously lush and a harrowing exposure to tropical poverty — more harrowing , perhaps , for his mother than for the little boy who barely remembered any other life .
Then Barack returned to Hawaii , where he was brought up largely by his grandparents .
The family lived in a small apartment — Barack ’s grandfather was a furniture salesman and , later , an unsuccessful insurance agent ; his grandmother worked in a bank — but Barack managed to get into Punahou School , Hawaii ’s top prep academy .
His mother always said that he got his brains from his father , and he was raised on tales of his father ’s brilliance .
The great man wrote to them regularly , but , though he travelled around the world on official business for Kenya , he visited only once , when Barack was ten .
He was a black child , by American lights , but his mother and his grandparents — the only family he knew — were “ white folks , ” and his confusion was acute .
In “ Dreams from My Father , ” Obama describes how , as a teen - ager , he tried marijuana and cocaine .
( “ I guess you ’d have to say I was n’t a politician when I wrote the book , ” he told me .
“ I wanted to show how and why some kids , maybe especially young black men , flirt with danger and self - destruction . ” )
He went to Columbia University , and liked New York , but he found the city ’s racial tension inescapable .
It “ flowed freely , ” he wrote in his memoir — “ not just out on the streets but in the stalls of Columbia ’s bathrooms as well , where , no matter how many times the administration tried to paint them over , the walls remained scratched with blunt correspondence between niggers and kikes .
It was as if all middle ground had collapsed . ”
What do brain surgeons know about cellphone safety that the rest of us do n’t ?
Last week , three prominent neurosurgeons told the CNN interviewer Larry King that they did not hold cellphones next to their ears .
“ I think the safe practice , ” said Dr. Keith Black , a surgeon at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , “ is to use an earpiece so you keep the microwave antenna away from your brain . ”
Dr. Vini Khurana , an associate professor of neurosurgery at the Australian National University who is an outspoken critic of cellphones , said : “ I use it on the speaker - phone mode .
I do not hold it to my ear . ”
And CNN ’s chief medical correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta , a neurosurgeon at Emory University Hospital , said that like Dr. Black he used an earpiece .
Along with Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’s recent diagnosis of a glioma , a type of tumor that critics have long associated with cellphone use , the doctors ’ remarks have helped reignite a long - simmering debate about cellphones and cancer .
That supposed link has been largely dismissed by many experts , including the American Cancer Society .
The theory that cellphones cause brain tumors “ defies credulity , ” said Dr. Eugene Flamm , chairman of neurosurgery at Montefiore Medical Center .

Listen to Alex ’s Bilderberg report
Calling into his show today from the Bilderberg confab in Chantilly , Virginia , Alex Jones told stand - in Jason Bermas that the Infowars team — bearing press credentials and obviously part of the media — were incessantly and repeatedly harassed by security personnel at the Westfield Marriott where the Bilderberg meeting is scheduled to take place .
Infowars records the coming and going of the Bilderbergers and their security goons at the Westfield Marriott in Chantilly , Virginia .
As noted earlier , this campaign of harassment and intimidation was timed to interrupt Alex ’s interview with Coast to Coast AM last night .
At approximately the moment Alex was scheduled to begin the interview with George Noory , a fire alarm went off in the Marriott .
Fifteen minutes prior to this oddly timed event , Alex had an encounter with the head of night security in the lobby of the hotel .
" Hey , have you every heard of people pulling fire alarms ? " the head of security asked , adding that people often pull fire alarms in hotels as a diversion in robbery attempts .
Alex believes security was attempting to set him up , but admitted he was unable to confirm this .
Upon exiting the building in response to the fire alarm , the head of security , noticing the Infowars team had cameras , " ran up and said , ‘ I ’m gonna f— you both up if you video tape , do you hear me Alex and Rob ? ’ "
Meanwhile , other hotel guests exiting the building in response to the fire alarm were shooting video and taking photos and they were not approached by the head of security , who specifically singled out Alex and Rob Jacobson .
Bilderberg car with the letter " B " in the window .
As Alex noted , it was peculiar the head of security would address Rob by name , as his name was not registered with the hotel .
Aaron Dykes had registered with the hotel and had not mentioned Rob by name .
" He knew our names , he knew everything .
He said , ‘ I ’ve called the police , they are coming , and they are going to f— you up . ’"
At this point Alex pointed out that other guests were videotaping and the security man repeated his threat .
Earlier in the evening , as they sat in a restaurant at the Hilton , where Alex had secured a room for the safe stowage of equipment , they were approached by a man , a " big guy who looked just like , acted just like a cop , " who attempted to provocateur them into " infiltrating some federal buildings " and asked if they wanted " to get really serious and go into the State Department . "
Alex told him he is non-violent and the Infowars team was there as reporters to cover the Bilderberg event , not engage in violence .
Limos and security arrive at the Marriott .
The following morning , security continued its orchestrated campaign of harassment , approaching Alex and telling him they knew who he was and declaring they would throw the Infowars crew out of the hotel before check - out at noon .
In addition , the security goon made a point of threatening them with arrest .
At noon check out , black sedans began arriving with large letter B’s affixed to the windows , a sign that the limousines were delivering Bilderberg security to the hotel .
When Alex and crew left the hotel grounds in their rented van , security followed close behind .
" Coming out the main entrance , we saw about seventy five great infowarriors out there videotaping , police everywhere … there is just like a fog of infowarriors out there totally overwhelming them , there are all these huge army intelligence guys , average six foot two , six foot three , two hundred fifty , two hundred seventy pounds , running around with earpieces everywhere in suits and in plain clothes watching us , following us , they ’re all over the streets … this is a complete spectacle . "
As the experience with security at the Marriott demonstrates , minions of the Bilderbergers have absolutely no respect for freedom of the press or the First Amendment — that is unless the press is corporate and following the New World Order script consisting of obfuscation and diversion .
Over the years , the corporate media has refused to acknowledge the existence of the Bilderbergers , but now that the cat is out of the bag and the agenda of our globalist rulers increasingly faces the light of day due to the work of Alex Jones and others , the lapdog corporate media declares the annual Bilderberg meetings be nothing more than business people harmlessly gathering to talk shop and refuse to cover their events , an absurd joke now revealed for the world to see .

Unlike the attack on Iraq five years ago , to deal with Iran there need be no massing of troops .
And , with the propaganda buildup already well under way , there need be little , if any , forewarning before shock and awe and pox  in the form of air and missile attacks  begin .
This time it will be largely the Air Force ’s show , punctuated by missile and air strikes by the Navy .
Israeli - American agreement has now been reached at the highest level ; the armed forces planners , plotters and pilots are working out the details .
Emerging from a 90 - minute White House meeting with President George W. Bush on June 4 , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the two leaders were of one mind :
" We reached agreement on the need to take care of the Iranian threat .
I left with a lot less question marks [ than ]
I had entered with regarding the means , the timetable restrictions , and American resoluteness to deal with the problem .
George Bush understands the severity of the Iranian threat and the need to vanquish it , and intends to act on that matter before the end of his term in the White House . "
Does that sound like a man concerned that Bush is just bluff and bluster ?
A member of Olmert ’s delegation noted that same day that the two countries had agreed to cooperate in case of an attack by Iran , and that " the meetings focused on ‘ operational matters ’ pertaining to the Iranian threat . "
So bring ’em on !
A show of hands please .
How many believe Iran is about to attack the U.S. or Israel ?
You say you missed Olmert ’s account of what Bush has undertaken to do ?
So did I .
We are indebted to intrepid journalist Chris Hedges for including the quote in his article of June 8 , " The Iran Trap . "
We can perhaps be excused for missing Olmert ’s confident words about " Israel ’s best friend " that week .
Your attention  like mine  may have been riveted on the June 5 release of the findings of the Senate Intelligence Committee regarding administration misrepresentations of pre-Iraq - war intelligence  the so - called " Phase II " investigation ( also known , irreverently , as the " Waiting - for - Godot Study " ) .
Better late than never , I suppose .
Oversight ?
Yet I found myself thinking :
It took them five years , and that is what passes for oversight ?
Yes , the president and vice president and their courtiers lied us into war .
And now a bipartisan report could assert that fact formally ; and committee chair Jay Rockefeller could sum it up succinctly :
" In making the case for war , the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted , or even non-existent .
As a result , the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed . "
But as I listened to Senator Rockefeller , I had this sinking feeling that in five or six years time , those of us still around will be listening to a very similar post mortem looking back on an even more disastrous attack on Iran .
My colleagues and I in Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) issued repeated warnings , before the invasion of Iraq , about the warping of intelligence .
And our memoranda met considerable resonance in foreign media .
We could get no ink or airtime , however , in the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) in the U.S.
Nor can we now .
In a same - day critique of Colin Powell ’s unfortunate speech to the U.N. on Feb.
5 , 2003 , we warned the president to widen his circle of advisers " beyond those clearly bent on a war for which we see no compelling reason and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic . "
It was a no - brainer for anyone who knew anything about intelligence , the Middle East , and the brown noses leading intelligence analysis at the CIA .
Former U.N. senior weapons inspector and former Marine major , Scott Ritter , and many others were saying the same thing .
But none of us could get past the president ’s praetorian guard to drop a memo into his in - box , so to speak .
Nor can we now .
The ‘ Iranian Threat ’
However much the same warnings are called for now with respect to Iran , there is even less prospect that any contrarians could puncture and break through what former White House spokesman Scott McClellan calls the president ’s " bubble . "
By all indications , Vice President Dick Cheney and his huge staff continue to control the flow of information to the president .
But , you say , the president cannot be unaware of the far - reaching disaster an attack on Iran would bring ?
Well , this is a president who admits he does not read newspapers , but rather depends on his staff to keep him informed .
And the memos Cheney does brief to Bush pooh - pooh the dangers .
This time no one is saying we will be welcomed as liberators , since the planning does not include  officially , at least  any U.S. boots on the ground .
Besides , even on important issues like the price of gasoline , the performance of the president ’s staff has been spotty .
Think back on the White House press conference of Feb. 28 , when Bush was asked what advice he would give to Americans facing the prospect of $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline .
" Wait , what did you just say ? " the president interrupted .
" You ’re predicting $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline ?
… That ’s interesting .
I had n’t heard that . "
A poll in January showed that nearly three - quarters of Americans were expecting $ 4 - a - gallon gas .
That forecast was widely reported in late February , and discussed by the White House press secretary at the media briefing the day before the president ’s press conference .
Here ’s the alarming thing : Unlike Iraq , which was prostrate after the Gulf War and a dozen years of sanctions , Iran can retaliate in a number of dangerous ways , launching a war for which our forces are ill - prepared .
The lethality , intensity and breadth of ensuing hostilities will make the violence in Iraq look , in comparison , like a volleyball game between St. Helena ’s High School and Mount St. Ursula .
Cheney ’s Brainchild
Attacking Iran is Vice President Dick Cheney ’s brainchild , if that is the correct word .
Cheney proposed launching air strikes last summer on Iranian Revolutionary Guards bases , but was thwarted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff who insisted that would be unwise , according to J. Scott Carpenter , a senior State Department official at the time .
Chastened by the unending debacle in Iraq , this time around Pentagon officials reportedly are insisting on a " policy decision " regarding " what would happen after the Iranians would go after our folks , " according to Carpenter .
Serious concerns include the vulnerability of the critical U.S. supply line from Kuwait to Baghdad , our inability to reinforce and the eventual possibility that the U.S. might be forced into a choice between ignominious retreat and using , or threatening to use , " mini- nukes . "
Pentagon opposition was confirmed in a July 2007 commentary by former Bush adviser Michael Gerson , who noted the " fear of the military leadership " that Iran would have " escalation dominance " in any conflict with the U.S .
Writing in the Washington Post last July , Gerson indicated that " escalation dominance " means , " in a broadened conflict , the Iranians could complicate our lives in Iraq and the region more than we complicate theirs . "
The Joint Chiefs also have opposed the option of attacking Iran ’s nuclear sites , according to former Iran specialist at the National Security Council , Hillary Mann , who has close ties with senior Pentagon officials .
Mann confirmed that Adm. William Fallon joined the Joint Chiefs in strongly opposing such an attack , adding that he made his opposition known to the White House , as well .
The outspoken Fallon was forced to resign in March , and will be replaced as CENTCOM commander by Gen. David Petraeus  apparently in September .
Petraeus has already demonstrated his penchant to circumvent the chain of command in order to do Cheney ’s bidding ( by making false claims about Iranian weaponry in Iraq , for example ) .
In sum , a perfect storm seems to be gathering in late summer or early fall .
Controlled Media
The experience of those of us whose job it was to analyze the controlled media of the Soviet Union and China for insights into Russian and Chinese intentions have been able to put that experience to good use in monitoring our own controlled media as they parrot the party line .
Suffice it to say that the FCM is already well embarked , a la Iraq , on its accustomed mission to provide stenographic services for the White House to indoctrinate Americans on the " threat " from Iran and prepare them for the planned air and missile attacks .
At least this time we are spared the " mushroom cloud " bugaboo .
Neither Bush nor Cheney wish to call attention , even indirectly , to the fact that all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last November that Iran had stopped nuclear weapons - related work in 2003 and had not resumed it as of last year .
In a pre-FCM age , it would have been looked on as inopportune , at the least , to manufacture intelligence to justify another war hard on the heels of a congressional report that on Iraq the administration made significant claims not supported by the intelligence .
But ( surprise , surprise ! ) the very damning Senate Intelligence Committee report got meager exposure in the media .
So far it has been a handful of senior military officers that have kept us from war with Iran .
It hardly suffices to give them vocal encouragement , or to warn them that the post WW - II Nuremberg Tribunal ruled explicitly that " just - following - orders " is no defense when war crimes are involved .
And still less when the " supreme international crime "  a war of aggression is involved .
Senior officers trying to slow the juggernaut lumbering along toward an attack on Iran have been scandalized watching what can only be described as unconscionable dereliction of duty in the House of Representatives , which the Constitution charges with the duty of impeaching a president , vice president or other senior official charged with high crimes and misdemeanors .
Where Are You , Conyers ?
In 2005 , before John Conyers became chair of the House Committee on the Judiciary , he introduced a bill to explore impeaching the president and was asked by Lewis Lapham of Harpers why he was for impeachment then .
He replied :
" To take away the excuse that we did n’t know .
So that two , or four , or ten years from now , if somebody should ask , ‘ Where were you , Conyers , and where was the U.S. Congress ? ’ when the Bush administration declared the Constitution inoperative … none of the company here present can plead ignorance or temporary insanity [ or ] say that ‘ somehow it escaped our notice . ’ "
In the three years since then , the train of abuses and usurpations has gotten longer and Conyers has become chair of the committee .
Yet he has dawdled and dawdled , and has shown no appetite for impeachment .
On July 23 , 2007 , Conyers told Cindy Sheehan , Rev. Lennox Yearwood , and me that he would need 218 votes in the House and they were not there .
A week ago , 251 members of the House voted to refer to Conyers ’ committee the 35 Articles of Impeachment proposed by Congressman Dennis Kucinich .
Former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman , who sat on Judiciary with Conyers when it voted out three articles of impeachment on President Richard Nixon , spoke out immediately : " The House should commence an impeachment inquiry forthwith . "
Much of the work has been done .
As Holtzman noted , Kucinich ’s Articles of Impeachment , together with the Senate report that on Iraq we were led to war based on false pretenses  arguably the most serious charge  go a long way toward jump - starting any additional investigative work Congress needs to do .
And seldom mentioned is the voluminous book published by Conyers himself , " Constitution in Crisis , " containing a wealth of relevant detail on the crimes of the current executive .
Conyers ’ complaint that there is not enough time is a dog that wo n’t hunt , as Lyndon Johnson would say .
How can Conyers say this one day , and on the next say that if Bush attacks Iran , well then , the House may move toward impeachment .
Afraid of the media ?
During the meeting last July with Cindy Sheehan , Rev. Yearwood and me , and during an interview in December on " Democracy Now , " Conyers was surprisingly candid in expressing his fear of Fox News and how it could paint Democrats as divisive if they pursued impeachment .
Ironically , this time it is Fox and the rest of the FCM that is afraid  witness their virtual silence on Kucinich ’s very damning 35 Articles of Impeachment .
The only way to encourage constructive media attention would be for Conyers to act .
The FCM could be expected to fulminate against that , but they could not afford to ignore impeachment , as they are able to ignore other unpleasant things  like preparations for another " war of choice . "
I would argue that perhaps the most effective way to prevent air and missile attacks on Iran and a wider Middle East war is to proceed as Elizabeth Holtzman urges  with impeachment " forthwith . "
Does Conyers not owe at least that much encouragement to those courageous officers who have stood up to Cheney in trying to prevent wider war and catastrophe in the Middle East ?
Scott McClellan has been quite clear in reminding us that once the president decided to invade Iraq , he was not going to let anything stop him .
There is ample evidence that Bush has taken a similar decision with respect to Iran  with Olmert as his chief counsel , no less .
It is getting late , but this is due largely to Conyers ’ own dithering .
Now , to his credit , Dennis Kucinich has forced the issue with 35 well - drafted Articles of Impeachment .
What the country needs is the young John Conyers back .
Not the one now surrounded by fancy lawyers and henpecked by the lady of the House .
In October 1974 , after he and the even younger Elizabeth Holtzman faced up to their duty on House Judiciary and voted out three Articles of Impeachment on President Richard Nixon , Conyers wrote this :
" This inquiry was forced on us by an accumulation of disclosures which , finally and after unnecessary delays , could no longer be ignored … Impeachment is difficult and it is painful , but the courage to do what must be done is the price of remaining free . "
Someone needs to ask John Conyers if he still believes that ; and , if he does , he must summon the courage to " do what must be done . "

In June of 2007 , the American Medical Association ’s Council on Ethics and Judicial Affairs stated , “ RFID tags may promote the timely identification of patients and expedite access to their medical information .
As a result , these devices can improve the continuity and coordination of care with resulting reduction in adverse drug events and other medical errors . ”
Approved by the FDA in 2004 and marketed by the VeriChip Corporation , the VeriChip is a microchip about twice the length of a grain of rice .
It is implanted below the skin and above the triceps area of the patient ’s right arm .
The procedure can be performed in a doctor ’s office after a local anesthetic is given to numb the area .
The VeriChip contains a 16 - digit number that , once scanned at the right frequency , can provide information on the patient ’s health .
The subscriber controls information in the database .
A VeriChip reader is needed to gain access to the information in the database .
Hospitals who become part of the system are provided with a secure logon , and a record is made anytime anyone accesses a subscriber ’s information .
Potential medical complications of chip insertion are infection of the tissue at the site of implantation and migration of the chip .
There have been studies that have shown a small risk of tumors in small lab animals that were implanted with RFID ’s , but there is no evidence that VeriChip has ever caused such a problem .
One of the biggest medical concerns with the VeriChip is that patients who have one implanted may not be able to undergo an MRI .
A MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) is a valuable test that can image different tissues and does not use radiation .
Any implanted device containing metal such as a pin , plate , screw , or artificial heart valve , to name a few , can cause patient burns when the patient undergoes a MRI .
The recommendation is that only VeriChip patients who are awake and alert should have a MRI exam , so that they are able to alert medical personnel if they feel any heating of the implant .
The other obvious issue , and perhaps the most important one , is that of privacy .
Although the chip contains only a 16 - digit number and one would need to be in possession of a VeriChip reader and an access code , it seems possible that others with no right to your personal information could find a way to get it .
Although undoubtedly designed with good intentions , the risk for abuse of patient privacy in this situation is difficult to ignore .
Time will tell .
In the meantime , one can always wear a MedicAlert bracelet .
They ’re cheap , and you can take them off before you climb into that MRI machine .

The Wolfram Functions Site — which just tripled in size — has a rich story .
I have spent most of my career deriving integrals and formulas about mathematical functions .
When I lived in the Soviet Union , I co-wrote some of the largest books of formulas ever , which contained altogether about 5,000 pages and a total of about 30,000 formulas , and have been reprinted in several languages .
While writing these works , I hoped to eventually automate the process of evaluating integrals .
Later , I developed some prototype programs .
Then , 18 years ago , I moved to Wolfram Research and I found a fantastic new world of formula derivation made possible by Mathematica , which had a baby ’s age — only two years old .
I saw that this “ child ” was born absolutely healthy ( without wrong automatic transformations like Sqrt [ z ^ 2 ] -> z ) and it had all the necessary abilities to become the strongest and smartest “ man ” of the future .
Its health was inherited from his father Stephen Wolfram , who was sure that Mathematica must absolutely and correctly reflect nature without non-natural simplification .
I decided to devote my life to that “ child ” by the building of corresponding formulas and programs , which has permanently increased the abilities of Mathematica for symbolic operations with mathematical functions .
It has been a difficult job , full of complexity and subtlety , but most of what we did was hidden — evident only in the fact that all of Mathematica ’s many mathematical functions work correctly and consistently .
All important formulas , whether derived ourselves or found in the literature , we tried either to implement into Mathematica ’s commands or to provide other support from Mathematica ’s operations .
The growing power of Mathematica allowed us to derive more and more original formulas , which we also tried to implement or use in Mathematica .
Such a combination of brains and powerful tools allowed people to make really incredible discoveries .
In particular , we are rebuilding and rethinking the entire chaotically presented world of “ classical mathematical formulas and functions , ” converting it into a new , absolutely correct and internally consistent “ computer ’s world of formulas and functions . ”
This new world satisfies the basic statement :
The restriction -π < Arg[z ] ≤ π applies for any complex number z .
In the existing literature , formulas haphazardly use this restriction , or use the more restricted form Abs [ Arg[z ] ] < π , ignoring behavior of the formulas on the special line Arg[z ] == π .
The last aspect is a crucial difference , which leads to numerous consequences , separating the Mathematica world of mathematical formulas from the classical published literature of formulas .
The Mathematica world is presented at the Wolfram Functions Site and provides the core of mathematical function operations for the Mathematica system .
The building of this new world is an important contribution of Wolfram Research to mathematics .
In the mid-1990s , following the success of our Riemann zeta function and quintic posters , Stephen Wolfram suggested that we should make a poster presenting our work on mathematical functions in Mathematica .
At the time , Mathematica already had about 200 built - in mathematical functions , and we wanted to give important formulas and properties for each one .
But we had so many formulas .
As we started to lay them out on a poster , it got bigger and bigger .
Indeed , by the time of the International Congress of Mathematicians in August 1998 , we actually had five separate posters , altogether 36 feet long :
As Mathematica itself grew , more formulas and functions went on the ever - expanding posters .
It soon became clear that this was not the correct medium .
In October 2000 , we finished putting all our 37,366 formulas into a new website : the Wolfram Functions Site .
The formulas there cover the range from “ elementary ” mathematical functions , like sine , cosine and logarithm ; to advanced functions , like Bessel , MeijerG and generalized hypergeometric functions — the hundreds of types of special functions that arise in pure and applied mathematics .
Wolfram Research has always taken special functions very seriously ( see , e.g. , this essay by Stephen Wolfram ) , and over the past 20 years Mathematica has taken a vast range of special functions that had been treated only theoretically for a century or more and , for the first time , successfully implemented them in practice .
Our 37,366 formulas of October 2000 were only the beginning .
By January 2004 , we had expanded the site to 87,160 formulas .
Many of these formulas , such as the differentiated gamma functions or inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions , appeared in the Wolfram Functions Site for the first time ( see , for example , this entry ) .
Now after several more years of work , and the development of several new generations of tools , we have been able to grow the site to more than triple its 2004 size — with a total of 307,409 formulas !
The site now contains ten times as many formulas as I and my colleagues in the Soviet Union ever derived .
Printed out , it would be 80 volumes .
It is probably more formulas than have ever been derived in all the mathematical literature on mathematical functions throughout history .
So how did we do it ?
The answer , of course , is Mathematica .
We use Mathematica throughout everything we do .
We use its symbolic capabilities to create algorithms for constructing new formulas .
We use its graphics to visualize the behavior of functions and get intuition about them .
And we use its high - precision numerics to spot - check results to thousands of digits .
Sometimes we let Mathematica do systematic searches on its own in the space of possible formulas .
But more often we work alongside it , exploring mathematical functions together .
When we derive a new formula , we wonder whether it exists somewhere in the literature .
But most of the time , we know that it cannot — not only because we know the literature well , but also because the new formula relies on a long sequence of derivations that have only been made possible by the capabilities and functions that we have put into Mathematica .
When we compare our work with the literature , we often find mistakes in the literature — some of which have been undetected for hundreds of years .
But of course , it ’s an unfair competition .
Because with Mathematica , checking is automatic .
When I used to produce books of formulas by hand , transcription errors were a big issue .
But not with the Wolfram Functions Site — the whole site from beginning to end , from Mathematica input to web pages , PDFs and MathML , is built and checked with Mathematica .
By now , it is 30 gigabytes of data .
Back in the Soviet Union I could never imagine that by 2008 we could have learned so much about mathematical functions .
Of the 210,000 + new formulas , many were generated with powerful symbolic programming for generalized hypergeometric functions that is unique to Mathematica .
In addition , concise introductions are now included to the various groups of special functions , such as elliptic integrals .
The introductions allow a novice to get a gentle overview of the most important characteristics of a special function .
I ’d like to thank the many people who have helped make this possible , especially Michael Trott ( who is the real coauthor of this site ) , as well as Sasha Pavlyk , Yury Brychkov and the whole Mathematica team , together with Brendan Elli , Andy Hunt , Eric Weisstein , Adam Strzebonski , Daniel Lichtblau , Ed Pegg , Jean Buck and everyone who has helped in the final creation of the Wolfram Functions Site .
We are especially thankful to Stephen Wolfram , who steadfastly supported this project over the course of nearly two decades .
An archaeological excavation at a site near Pulborough , West Sussex , has thrown remarkable new light on the life of northern Europe ’s last Neanderthals .
It provides a snapshot of a thriving , developing population – rather than communities on the verge of extinction .
“ The tools we ’ve found at the site are technologically advanced and potentially older than tools in Britain belonging to our own species , Homo sapiens , ” says Dr Matthew Pope of Archaeology South East based at the UCL Institute of Archaeology .
“ It ’s exciting to think that there ’s a real possibility these were left by some of the last Neanderthal hunting groups to occupy northern Europe .
The impression they give is of a population in complete command of both landscape and natural raw materials with a flourishing technology - not a people on the edge of extinction . ”
The team , led by Dr Pope and funded by English Heritage , is undertaking the first modern , scientific investigation of the site since its original discovery in 1900 .
During the construction of a monumental house known as ‘ Beedings ’ some 2,300 perfectly preserved stone tools were removed from fissures encountered in the foundation trenches .
Only recently were the tools recognised for their importance .
Research by Roger Jacobi of the Leverhulme - funded Ancient Human Occupation of Britain ( AHOB ) Project showed conclusively that the Beedings material has strong affinities with other tools from northern Europe dating back to between 35,000 and 42,000 years ago .
The collection of tools from Beedings is more diverse and extensive than any other found in the region and therefore offers the best insight into the technologically advanced cultures which occupied Northern Europe before the accepted appearance of our own species .
“ Dr Jacobi ’s work showed the clear importance of the site , ” says Dr Pope .
“ The exceptional collection of tools appears to represent the sophisticated hunting kit of Neanderthal populations which were only a few millennia from complete disappearance in the region .
Unlike earlier , more typical Neanderthal tools these were made with long , straight blades - blades which were then turned into a variety of bone and hide processing implements , as well as lethal spear points .
“ There were some questions about the validity of the earlier find , but our excavations have proved beyond doubt that the material discovered here was genuine and originated from fissures within the local sandstone .
We also discovered older , more typical Neanderthal tools , deeper in the fissure .
Clearly , Neanderthal hunters were drawn to the hill over a long period time , presumably for excellent views of the game - herds grazing on the plains below the ridge . ”
The excavations suggest the site may not be unique .
Similar sites with comparable fissure systems are thought to exist across south east England .
The project now aims to prospect more widely across the region for similar sites .
Barney Sloane , Head of Historic Environment Commissions at English Heritage , said : “ Sites such as this are extremely rare and a relatively little considered archaeological resource .
Their remains sit at a key watershed in the evolutionary history of northern Europe .
The tools at Beedings could equally be the signature of pioneer populations of modern humans , or traces of the last Neanderthal hunting groups to occupy the region .
This study offers a rare chance to answer some crucial questions about just how technologically advanced Neanderthals were , and how they compare with our own species . ”
The project , which has been running with the assistance of the landowners since February 2008 , has been directed by Dr Matthew Pope of UCL and Caroline Wells of Sussex Archaeological Society , working closely with specialists from the Boxgrove Project and the Worthing Archaeological Society .
Cabal - 1.4 and cabal - install - 0.5 are now released !
If you were already using a pre-release of cabal - install then you can just :
$ cabal update $ cabal install cabal - install
The Cabal library
There are no huge new features in the Cabal library itself .
The main new feature is that is supports a significantly improved version of cabal - install .
Cabal - 1.4 does have a number of incremental improvements and lots of bug fixes .
You can see the full list in the changelog .
So the most exciting thing is the release of cabal - install ...
New features in cabal - install
Command line improvements
The most immediately noticeable thing is that the command line interface now has all the commands that runhaskell Setup .hs has .
Of course it still has the features to download and install packages from hackage .
It also gained an upload command .
So it now provides a command line interface to the whole Cabal / Hackage system .
There 's no need to use runhaskell Setup .hs ever again .
There is also bash command line completion support included which I find is a great time saver .
Installing and upgrading
The next big thing is that it includes a new package dependency resolution system that finds correct and sensible solutions more of the time and has better default behaviour .
The new behaviour should be similar to other package managers that people are used to .
For example , suppose you 've got xmonad - 0.5 installed and version 0.7 is the latest on hackage , then
$ cabal install xmonad
will upgrade to xmonad - 0.7 .
The behaviour of install is to upgrade as little as possible to satisfy your request , but sometimes you want to upgrade all the dependencies too .
Supposing now that we have xmonad - 0.7 installed , but we 're still using X11 - 1.4.1 and the latest version on hackage is X11 - 1.4.2 , then
$ cabal upgrade xmonad
will install X11 - 1.4.2 and re-install xmonad - 0.7 , this time built against the newer X11 - 1.4.2 .
So in general , the install command will install the latest version of things but will try and use any existing installed versions of dependencies while the upgrade command will also try to use the latest versions of all dependencies .
As a special case , cabal upgrade on its own will try to upgrade all the packages that you have installed .
For both command there is a - - dry - run flag so you can see what would be installed without actually doing it .
Hugs
Yes , it even works with hugs .
That is , cabal - install built by ghc can manage the installation of packages for hugs .
In principle cabal - install should be able to be run by hugs but currently the zlib binding is using a function that hugs does not support .
Note that for hugs , Cabal does not know what packages are already installed because there is no equivalent of the package database that ghc has .
So that means cabal - install cannot do very sensible installation planning .
It should work ok so long as all the dependencies are already installed .
Windows
Yes , it even works on Windows .
The one caveat is that cabal - install cannot currently upgrade itself because Windows makes it hard for a process to overwrite its own executable file .
It needs more complex trickery with the Win32 API .
In the meantime the workaround is to rename the cabal .
exe file first eg to cabal - foo. exe , then say cabal - foo install cabal - install .
Build reporting
One feature that made it into this release is build reporting .
cabal - install keeps logs of all packages that you install ( at least packages from hackage , not local ones ) .
It records a bit of information about each package , in particular whether the outcome was successful or not .
You can see these build reports in ~/.cabal/ packages/$server/build-reports.log .
The plan in the longer term is to let people upload these build reports to hackage so we can get a wider range of testing data about the packages on hackage .

A woman has been evicted from her home for letting the weeds in her garden grow so high they can be seen from space .
The ten foot - high undergrowth in Rachel McGarie 's backyard has swamped a six foot child 's swing , a garden shed and reach the window of the flat on the floor above her .
The 29 - year - old who has not managed the foliage for six years is now living with a dense mass of brambles that can be recognised on satellite map Google Earth and has been evicted by her housing association .
Scroll down for more ...
The brambles have grown as high as the second storey flat
The local council in Yate near Bristol repeatedly warned her of the consequences if she continued to let the weeds growing .
Managing the garden was part of Ms McGarie 's tenancy agreement when she moved into the two - bedroom flat approximately a decade ago .
Merlin Housing Society , which owns the property , took legal action against her last month and after a hearing at Bristol County Court she moved out on April 18th .
Roy Didcott who lives in the flat above claims he could pick blackberries from his window .
The 63 - year - old said : " I even took photos of the front garden because it was getting overgrown and sent them to the council .

From space :
The eyesore garden jungle on Google Earth
" I think it 's a good thing that she has been moved out but it should have happened a long time ago . "
An elderly neighbour , who did not want to be named , said : " I have lived here for six years and the garden has been like that for as long as I can remember .
" We have had a lot of of problems with the brambles spilling over .
I would hate to imagine what 's under there . "
Yate area housing manager Hazel Grey agreed , saying : " The garden is in a completely unacceptable condition and we have no way of knowing what is under all those weeds . "
This gives John Conyers - who was not in the secret meetings - a historically strong hand to disregard the party leader 's " keep it off the table " and instead insure that justice is done .
All Conyers has to do is publicly state Pelosi 's conflict - which should be obvious to anyone with legal training anyway .
Note that Pelosi 's compliance with torture revelations was not revealed publicly until December 2007 , and impeachment was only filed yesterday .
If Conyers acts now he will not be obstructing or derelict in his duty .
I 've seen this raised and raised it myself repeatedly at the Daily Kos - always with recommends , and never disputed .
It should be as obvious as if a prosecutor or judge said , " Yes , I was in the room while someone in the gang talked about bribes he'd made , but they said to keep it secret and I never reported it to the police . "
For that prosecutor or judge to later say " That bribery case is divisive and I 'm keeping off the table ! " would rightly lead directly to charges of obstruction of justice .
House Judiciary Chair John Conyers need only say :
Speaker Pelosi is apparently a witness who may be subpeonaed ; perhaps an accessory , accomplice , or conspirator .
She may also be innocent , and she may even be the whistle blower who contacted the Times .
But whatever is the case , she can not in good faith be among those who decide whether the case is tried .
To protect Speaker Nancy Pelosi and my colleagues from any risk of future obstruction charges , I respectfully request that Speaker Pelosi and the other Gang of 8 witnesses recuse themselves from discussion of these Articles of Impeachment , and do everything in their power to cooperate in the impeachment process .
First we have to do our part .
We need to keep it on the front page so the Honorable Congressman Conyers , Huffington Post , and the press see it - so instead of being viewed as a betrayal of his party leader , making the statement above is seen as the only prudent thing he can do .
On your marks ...
By the way - to Conyers or anyone else who is n't certain whether Impeachment protects the Constitution , whether or not the president is removed from office - the Impeachment discussion with Bruce Fein and John Nichols on Bill Moyers should be mandatory viewing .
Congressman Conyers , please keep your oath and do your duty .
Congressman Wexler - it 's time to act decisively on your impeachment talk .
Congressman Kucinich - thanks for getting this party started .

The decision was the third in the last six years to place a categorical limitation on capital punishment .
In 2002 , the court barred the execution of mentally retarded defendants .
In 2005 , it ruled that the Constitution bars the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18 .
Nonetheless , despite this trend toward narrowing the application of the death penalty , there was no suggestion from the majority that the court was moving toward the abolition of capital punishment , which Justice John Paul Stevens called for in an opinion two months ago that no other justice joined .
Justice Kennedy said Wednesday that while the court ’s death penalty jurisprudence “ remains sound , ” it should not be expanded to cover a crime for which no one has been executed in the United States for the past 44 years .
The case , Kennedy v. Louisiana , No. 07-343 , was an appeal by one of the two Louisiana inmates , Patrick Kennedy .
He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8 - year - old stepdaughter , whose injuries were severe enough to require emergency surgery .
The Louisiana Supreme Court upheld Mr. Kennedy ’s conviction and rejected his challenge to the constitutionality of his sentence .
The United States Supreme Court prohibited capital punishment for rape in a 1977 case , Coker v. Georgia , in which the victim , while only 16 years old , was married and had the legal status of an adult .
It was not clear at the time whether that decision was limited to the rape of an adult woman , or whether it barred the death penalty for any rape .
The court on Wednesday treated the issue of capital punishment for child rape as a fresh question , not governed by any existing precedent .
As a matter of constitutional analysis , the question in the case was whether the death penalty was so disproportionate to the offense as to amount to cruel and unusual punishment , in violation of the Eighth Amendment .
The court ’s modern precedents interpret the Eighth Amendment according to “ the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society . ”

But before long , the investigators learned that the money was being moved to pay for sex and that the transactions were being manipulated to conceal Mr. Spitzer ’s connection to payments for meetings with prostitutes , the official said .
Then , with the assistance of a confidential informant , a young woman who had worked previously as a prostitute for the Emperor ’s Club V.I.P. , the escort service that Mr. Spitzer was believed to be using , the investigators were able to get a judge to approve wiretaps on the cellphones of some of those suspected of involvement in the escort service .
The wiretaps , along with the records of bank accounts held in the names of the shell companies , revealed a world of prostitutes catering to wealthy men .
At the center was the Emperor ’s Club , which arranged “ dates ” with more than 50 beautiful young women in New York , Paris , London , Miami and Washington .
But its finances moved through the shell companies  the QAT Consulting Group , QAT International and Protech Consulting  which held bank accounts into which clients wired their payments , according to court papers in the case .
One of the booking agents , a woman named Temeka Rachelle Lewis , 32 , told a client that wiring his payments to QAT Consulting was safe because it would show up “ like as a business transaction , ” according to an affidavit filed in federal court the case .
But the transactions proved to be anything but safe for Mr. Spitzer , who , aides said on Monday , was weighing possible resignation .
Last week , Ms. Lewis was one of four people charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with operating the prostitution ring .
Also arrested were Mark Brener , 62 , who is accused of heading the operation ; Cecil Suwal , 23 , who is said to have managed it day to day ; and Tanya Hollander , 36 , who worked part time as a booker .
Fewer than three - quarters of Canadians believe in a god , suggests a new Canadian Press Harris - Decima survey .
" Religion in Canada today is not a particularly divisive subject and tolerance levels for different beliefs are high , " said Harris - Decima president Bruce Anderson .
" This is evident in the fact that one in four people feel comfortable saying they do not believe in a god . "
The poll found 72 per cent of respondents said they believed in a god , while 23 per cent said they did not believe in any god .
Six per cent did not offer an opinion .
Polls have told a different story in the United States .
" Canada 's secularism stands in clearer distinction , when compared to the cultural and political influences of religion in the United States , " said Anderson .
" In one Harris Interactive study in the United States , conducted in 2007 , the number who said they were non-believers was only eight per cent . "
Keith Howard , a United church minister and executive director of the church 's Emerging Spirit program , said the results of the new survey do not represent a dramatic change from previous polls about Canadians ' beliefs .
" We are past the time of people trashing God , " he said .
" They are now trying to find a safe place where they can nurture that spirituality . "
He said a poll done for the church last year indicated Canada is a nation of believers , not belongers .
Howard said his sense is that people who believe in a god increasingly imagine a nebulous but powerful force for good , rather than the traditional concept of a deity .
Indeed , he likened the concept to that of the Force in the Star Wars movies .
A study quoted by Statistics Canada in 2006 , found " adult Canadians attach a higher degree of importance to religion than religious attendance figures alone would indicate . "
The study noted only one - third of adult Canadians attend religious services at least once a month .
But the study , conducted in 2002 , found more than one - half engage in religious activities on their own at least on a monthly basis .
Howard said a recent survey done for the United Church rating the importance of religion in the daily lives of people around the world placed Canadians fourth , behind the United States , Mexico and Italy .
The Canadian Press Harris - Decima survey data were gathered by telephone from just over 1,000 people between May 22 and May 26 .
A sample of the same size has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points , 19 times out of 20 .
The Harris - Decima poll also indicated :

There is a common misconception held in America that in Oct.
2002 , Congress gave the Bush administration a blank check to invade Iraq .
Today , two Presidential candidates voted for Authorization For Use Of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution Of 2002 , or P.L. 104-243 , and a third has accepted the common misconception .
This article is not being written in support of any Presidential candidate .
This article is being written for the sole purpose of representing truth , a concept with which the mass media has a problem .
First , a little background to put everything in perspective .
Hard to believe , but back in Oct. 2002 President Bush was an extremely popular Commander - in - Chief .
He was a war President defying Islamic extremism defined by 9/11 .
Also , during that period , by and large Americans were thirsty for revenge , the image of the falling towers still very vivid .
The last statement is still true today , but this is not the place for the wrong war at the wrong time against the wrong enemy .
Suffice to repeat that Bush was quite popular , and for Congress to defy an embattled war President striving for justice in response to 9/11 was largely an impossibility .
Many Americans , including this writer , shared those thoughts .
Perversely , a small minority aware of the vast intricacies of the Mideast , including this writer , were troubled by one single thought .
What did Iraq have to do with 9/11 and al Qa'ida ?
But that question was a concern for intellectuals while Joe Sixpack and Mary Wonderful were all in favor of giving Bush everything he wanted .
This did not go unnoticed by our duly elected representatives in Congress .
When one criticizes a leader , to be fair , it is wise to refer to the context of the times , the environment , in which that leader made his / her decision .
This applies to the members of Congress who voted for P.L. 104-243 .
In the early 1970's , our representatives in Congress were dismayed that our nation had fought two devastating wars without the benefit of a Declaration of War , a prerogative granted Congress in our Constitution to the exclusion of the executive branch .
Our representatives also control the purse strings of war .
The two wars in question were the Korean War ( over 54,000 dead troops ) and the Vietnam War ( over 55,000 dead troops ) .
As a consequence , Congress passed the War Powers Act over President Nixon 's veto in 1973 that severely restricted the President 's ability to wage war on his own say so .
A key provision of this act is Sec. 5 ( b ) , which basically requires that the president notify Congress within 48 hours of committing troops to military action and forbids troops from remaining for more than 90 days without a declaration of war .
Assuming our good Senators did their homework , they were aware of this provision .
The entire act can be seen here : http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal22/warpow.htm
To be perfectly candid in this analysis , there was an instance where the good Senators did not do their homework .
Two months prior to the Senate vote , the CIA presented a uniquely prophetic NIE .
It warned that a U.S. invasion could result in al - Qaeda taking " advantage of a destabilized Iraq to establish secure safe havens from which they can continue their operations . ' "
It added , " that a U.S. invasion could produce anarchy in Iraq , reduce European confidence in U.S. leadership , expand Iran 's influence in the region , destabilize Afghanistan and Pakistan , and bolster Islamic hostility toward the United States . "
Six Senators read the NIE .
None were named Hillary Clinton nor John McCain .
So , in compliance with the War Powers Act of 1973 , what did these Senators vote on ?
What did P.L. 104-243 say ?
After a lot of whereas's the essential part of the resolution passed by Congress said this ,
( b) Presidential Determination .
--
In connection with the exercise of
the authority granted in subsection ( a ) to use force the President
shall , prior to such exercise or as soon thereafter as may be feasible ,
but no later than 48 hours after exercising such authority , make
available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the
President pro tempore of the Senate his determination that --
( 1 ) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or
other peaceful means alone either ( A ) will not adequately
protect the national security of the United States against the
continuing threat posed by Iraq or ( B ) is not likely to lead to
enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions regarding Iraq .
Setting aside section ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ) because it has no bearing on this narrative - in Oct. 2002 there was no U.N. mandate for use of force in Iraq - what this says is that President Bush must show indisputable evidence to Congress that Iraq poses a threat to our national security before use of force is authorized .
That would be no small feat , and members of Congress knew that .
Declaring Iraq , militarily devastated by the Gulf War ( 1991 ) , a threat to the national security of the United States would be a singularly difficult task .
The skies above Saddam 's Iraq were controlled by the U.S. and British Air Forces via the Northern and Southern No-fly zones .
An Iraqi sergeant could n't pick his nose without our knowing about it .
In addition , an American expert , Scott Ritter , Marine captain [ ret. ] stated openly before hostilities began that Saddam had no WMD's .
That they were all destroyed along with the infrastructure to make these dreaded weapons .
It should be mentioned that the Marine was a lead weapons inspector in Iraq for eight years following the Gulf War.
Captain Ritter 's assertions are supported by subsequent U.N. weapons inspection teams .
Even Joe and Mary knew there were no WMD's for the simple reason that no evidence existed that warranted believing the opposite was true .
It can easily be assumed that members of Congress shared this same insight .
It can be argued that voting for P.L. 104-243 was pro forma .
In tune with a popular President , but use of force simply wo n't happen .
Iraq a security risk to America was just too farfetched .
What members of Congress did not know - perhaps should have known - was the degree of duplicity and treachery inherent in the Bush administration .
What Americans did not know in Oct. 2002 , was that the White House and the Pentagon were in the grips of an obscure movement called neoconservatism , and they had a stranglehold on the Presidency .
What many did not know at the time is that an intellectually - challenged President was being governed by a group of highly - ranked , highly intelligent individuals , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Rice , Wolfowitz , Feith , and others whose goals included a unitary executive and an American Empire .
To America 's everlasting chagrin , all of this was learned later .
To this day , incredulously , many Americans refuse to believe this about the Presidency despite overwhelming evidence .
And so it began .
Using the principle that it is impossible to prove a negative , soon after the passage of P.L. 104-243 the propaganda began .
The White House sent out its highly ranked troops , Rumsfeld , Cheney , Rice , Wolfowitz , even Bush and the disgraced SecState Powell ( the only rational member of the bunch and not a neocon ) to proclaim from their pulpits that Iraq had WMD's .
They created from thin air that Saddam had thousands of barrels of CBW ( Chemical / biological Warfare ) and that he was in the process of building or acquiring a nuclear weapon .
They swore that Saddam was in league with Osama bin Laden , ignoring the rather obvious fact they were , in fact , enemies , deadly enemies .
Using David Feith 's Office of Special Plans , they cooked the intelligence books produced by our intell agencies .
The White House and the Pentagon concocted their own " intelligence " that supported the general plan , American hegemony .
Offering no proof for their conjectures , the American citizen was inundated by the accusations and began believing it because if the highest officials in the land keep saying it , over and over again , well , it must be true .
The disgraceful performance of Powell before the U.N. Security Council , Feb. 2003 , was the last straw .
He proved nothing .
If anything , he proved that Iraq was a toothless tiger , hardly capable of defending itself let alone attacking the United States .
In Feb . 2003 , I became very concerned .
He 's going to do it .
Bush is actually going to invade Iraq .
In my Midwestern column that I had at the time , I challenged the Bush administration to provide a casus belli .
Unproven conjectures and a conflicting supposition ( Saddam / al Qa'ida ) were insufficient .
Then came March 19 , 2003 , and America lives in the shadow of an egregious strategic military error that will haunt us for many years to come .
How is all of this relevant today ?
To criticize members of Congress for their vote in Oct. 2002 is pure folly .
We , none of us , knew what we know now .
No one knew that the Bush administration would trample all over the very foundation of our government , the U.S. Constitution .
The responsibility for this duplicity does not lie with members of Congress .
The sole responsibility for this treasonous behavior lies with President Bush and Vice - President Cheney .
How else is this relevant ?
There is mounting concern that Bush will unilaterally attack Iran before his term is over .
The military and economic debacle that would follow such an attack is beyond description .
It is one thing for pundits to describe such a ridiculous scenario , but when Rep. John Conyers , Jr. is concerned about that threat , it is time for all of us to be concerned .
Conyers , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , thought it prudent to write a letter to the President .
In it , he stated ,
West Michigan residents concerned about sinking Great Lakes water levels will get a chance to share their views this week when U.S. and Canadian officials studying the issue visit Muskegon .
The International Joint Commission , a U.S. - Canadian panel that advises the two nations on Great Lakes issues , is studying water levels in lakes Michigan , Huron , Superior and Erie .
A committee working on the IJC's International Upper Great Lakes Study will host a public hearing on lake levels Sunday , from 10 a.m. to noon , at Grand Valley State University 's Annis Water Resources Institute , 740 W. Shoreline .

" We want to hear lots of people come out and squawk at this public meeting , " said John Nevin , an IJC spokesman .
" We want to hear what this issue means to people when the water is really high or really low . "
IJC officials might get an earful .
Lake Michigan 's water level has dropped nearly four feet since 1997 , according to federal data .
The low lake level has widened beaches but created safety hazards for recreational boaters and caused freighters to run aground in Muskegon , Grand Haven and other ports around the lake .
On the flip side , record - high lake levels in 1986 caused severe beach erosion that sent several Grand Haven cottages tumbling into the lake .
The IJC study is focused on two issues : Whether dredging in the St. Clair River over the past century has caused excessive lowering of water levels in lakes Michigan and Huron ; and if the volume of water flowing out of Lake Superior daily through control structures in the St. Marys River should be adjusted to account for below - average precipitation and global warming , which some studies suggest could lower lake levels by several feet over the next century .
The study could prompt changes , such as the construction of a water control structure in the St. Clair River , that would affect water levels in lakes Michigan and Huron , said Gene Stakhiv , co-chair of the International Upper Lakes Study Board .
" There are a whole range of changes in the regulation of flow and physical structures in the ( Great Lakes ) system that could help us control water levels , " Stakhiv said .
" But we do n't know yet if there is a need for that . "
A growing chorus of critics -- from scientists and shoreline property owners in Lake Huron 's Georgian Bay , to marina owners and shipping interests -- want the U.S. and Canadian governments to plug what amounts to an unnaturally large drain hole in the St. Clair River .
Studies have shown that dredging in the St. Clair River between 1900 and 1962 caused water levels in lakes Michigan and Huron to drop by at least 15 inches .
The lower water levels have forced freighters to lighten loads , caused some ships to run aground , made recreational boating dangerous and left some islands in Georgian Bay high and dry .
Nearly all the water in lakes Michigan and Huron , which are technically one lake , drains into the St. Clair River , which flows into the Detroit River and Lake Erie .
Michigan and Huron are the only Great Lakes without manmade structures to control water flow and lake levels .
Lake Michigan 's water level has dropped nearly four feet over the past decade and Lake Superior dipped to a record low last year .
The plunging water levels have some Great Lakes scientists and residents wondering whether factors other than weather conditions are causing lake levels to drop .
This year 's hard winter , which delivered above average precipitation to the region , has slightly elevated lake levels , but the water level in Lake Michigan - Huron remains 21 inches below its long term average .
Lake Superior 's level is 11 inches below average but Lake Erie , the recipient of water from lakes Superior , Michigan and Huron , is eight inches above average , according to government data .
A recent study commissioned by the Ontario - based Georgian Bay Association claimed a 1962 dredging project in the St. Clair River caused the river bottom to erode to twice its natural depth , effectively creating a larger drain hole for lakes Michigan and Huron .
The deeper channel is siphoning off 2.5 billion gallons of water daily out of the two lakes , according to the group 's study .
That water flows through Lake Erie , Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River en route to the Atlantic Ocean .
Roger Gauthier , a hydrologist with the Great Lakes Commission , said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could fix the excessive loss of water down the St. Clair River within a year by installing flow control structures near Port Huron .
" They could control erosion in the St. Clair River with underwater speed bumps -- inflatable bladders that could hold back water ( in Lake Huron ) when water levels are low , " Gauthier said .
When the Corps of Engineers deepened the St. Clair River channel in 1962 , the agency drafted blueprints for a concrete weir on the river bottom to control water levels in lakes Huron and Michigan .
But the weir was never built because lake levels were generally above average from 1964 through about 1997 ; water levels have dropped like a stone since 1997 .
Kay Felt , the U.S. co-chair of an advisory group working on the Upper Great Lakes Study , said it makes no sense to consider possible remedies before the $ 14.5 million study is completed .
" There are a lot of people who want a quick and dirty fix , " Felt said .
" It may sound like a good idea to go right to a solution but that 's not an appropriate thing to do at this point -- people do n't want a truncated solution , they want a solution based on science . "
The St. Clair River portion of the study is scheduled to be finished in June 2009 ; the Lake Superior study will be completed in 2011 .
Rise of the gold - digger :
The young women who shamelessly pursue older men for their money
When did it become acceptable to be a gold - digger ?
After all , is n't a woman who sleeps with a man for money - or at least for extensive use of his credit card - called something else ?
But then , ' prostitute ' does n't have quite the same glamorous , diamond - encrusted platinum ring to it , does it ?
A new French film opens in the UK this week called Priceless .
It tells the story of a woman who selects her mates entirely on the basis of the size of their wallets .
Who needs sexual chemistry when you can have cold hard cash ?
Determined : Audrey Tautou in the new film Priceless
Audrey Tautou is predictably Gallic and gamine in the lead role , but underneath the pretty tousled hair and shiny Chanel handbags , the message is an ugly one .
A man exists not as an equal partner in a kind , loving , relationship , but merely as someone to be fleeced for as much money as possible .
How depressing and how insulting to the millions of women who do n't live their lives according to these mercenary rules .
While we are the majority , the sad fact is , we are all judged as a result of movies like this .
It makes us all look cheap .
Priceless cannot be blamed alone .
The message it delivers is one that has been subtly gaining currency in recent times and not just on film .
A string of high - profile divorce cases - most notably that of Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills , where she walked away with £ 24 million , but also that of Susan Sangster , who amassed a fortune of £ 18 million from three marriages ( before ex-husband number four successfully got a judge to call a halt to her divorce trolley dash ) - contribute to the growing view that women are for sale and men are to be used as human cashpoints .
Calculating : Heather Mills received a £ 24 m payout from her marriage to Paul McCartney
There is also , of course , the whole WAG phenomenon , predicated almost entirely on a cynical pact between rich , bored , badly behaved men ( Ashley Cole comes to mind ) and the women who want to live off them .
The gaggle of wannabe WAGs hovering outside any nightclub frequented by Premier League footballers is proof that there is an increasing number of women who believe that far from having their own life and their own job , the notion of being a human leech is to some degree a preferable career .
As evidence that bleeding a man dry is on the up , there is now a fashion label called Golddigga and even websites such as www.golddiggers .
uk.com , devoted to ways of hooking a rich guy .
Click on www.sugardaddyforme.com and the deal being struck is clear .
A glamorous - looking young woman appears on the screen .
' Attractive , ambitious , insatiable , ' it reads .
In other words , she 's offering sex on tap .
When the picture of the tastefully greying man floats into view , it says : ' Affluent , caring , generous . '
Yet , we 're not supposed to call these women prostitutes .
That would be rude .
But the line between the girl who asks for cash up front and the one who is taken to a designer boutique to choose the latest handbag is surely now as thin as the strap on a La Perla push - up bra .
I write as someone who could have taken the gold - digger route on two occasions .
On the first , I met a chap on a plane .
He was sitting next to me in business class .
We chatted politely and then the subject moved to shopping .
' I like to buy nice things for ladies , ' he said .
I noted the plural .
' Would you like me to take you shopping when we land ? ' he asked .
That was too naked a business deal for me , which was what I presumed he would expect in return , so I declined .
On the second occasion , I met a man at a very posh party .
He dealt in diamonds .
He was persistent and persuasive and , in the end , I agreed to have dinner with him .
When he arrived , his chauffeur gave me a look as I got in which said : ' So , you 're the new one ? '
At the restaurant , the maitre d' , who clearly knew my date well , did the same thing .
Before the starter had even been served , my dinner partner took a small packet out of his pocket , carefully unwrapped it and slid something across the table , with the words : ' So what does it take to become your lover ? '
I looked down and saw it was a diamond .
I could have taken it .
I did n't .
I felt insulted , cheapened .
I pushed it back across the table .
Looking back , I should have walked out , butthe whole episode felt so surreal that I did n't feel fully enraged until afterwards and a small part of me also thought it would , perhaps , be rude to walk out .
But a growing number of women would slip that diamond straight in their handbag .
Let 's not get this out of proportion .
Cynical pact : Badly - behaved Ashley Cole and wife Cheryl Tweedy from Girls Aloud
Of course , it is still only a tiny percentage of women that would dream of behaving like this ; it 's just that percentage - which is rising - think what they do is so acceptable .
Listen to Sophie Sharp , a dancer from Bromley in Kent , who says : ' I 've always been into expensive clothes and accessories and think nothing of paying £ 400 for a dress .
But on my earnings it was hard to afford everything I wanted . '
Well , um , yes it would be .
Still , Sophie 's solution was not to visit Primark but to get herself a sugar daddy instead .
' My friends told me to go to Chinawhite ( the fashionable club in London ) , ' she reveals .
So she put on her best low - cut black frock and , hey presto , she 'd hooked herself a Dubai businessman .
' I did n't find him attractive , ' she admits .
Even so , she accepted his offer to take her shopping .
A total of £ 2,500 later , she says , he flew back to Dubai with nothing more than a chaste peck on the cheek in return , to which it 's tempting to say , is a likely story .
Sophie 's current sugar daddy is a personal trainer with a celebrity client list .
He runs a chain of gyms .
He has given her a one - bedroom house of her own near Bromley and presented her with a brand new £ 18,000 Toyota MR2 sports car just two months after meeting her .
They do have sex , and she says : ' I love him , ' although whether she 'd love him if he was a street sweeper is an open question .
Dangerous message : Audrey 's character is an insult to women
In Sophie 's world , being a golddigger is par for the course .
All Sophie 's friends are doing the same .
' I have friends who are dating rich men just to get designer clothes and jewellery , and one who was seeing a 50 - year - old just so he would pay for her to have breast implants , ' she says .
Rachel MacLynn is head of global membership for millionaires - only networking service Seventy Thirty .
' There are gold - diggers everywhere in London and other British cities .
I 'm constantly approached by young women , ' she says .
' They are desperate for me to match them with our millionaire members .
' One posh girl in her early 30s approached me at a swish members club in West London and said she'd be willing to date any man up to the age of 80 .
' What 's interesting about the new breed of gold - digger is that they tend to be well - educated and come from good families .
Jess Kent , 23 , a promotional assistant , is the daughter of a surgeon and a teacher from Northampton .
She was just 17 when she told her parents she was flying to the Mediterranean for a modelling job .
In fact , she had arranged a liaison with her 52 - year - old boyfriend , who spent a small fortune with her at the roulette tables in Monte Carlo .
Or what about Natalie Parker , 24 , who 's studying French and Spanish at university in Southampton ?
Her parents - a property developer and a housewife - live in a four - bedroom , four - bathroom house with a gym and a pool in Spain .
' I 've always dated wealthy men , even though I 've not really been attracted to them , ' Natalie muses .
So , has she ever had to offer sex with a sugar daddy to secure a lavish gift ?
' Some of these men do want more at the end of the night , ' she concedes , without actually answering the question .
It is worth saying that the men are not blameless in this unpleasant sex for designer clothes / jewellery / breast implants transaction .
A man who buys a woman is no better than the woman who agrees to sell herself .
It all reduces human interaction to the level of a business deal .
Still , it is the women 's attitudes that are so shocking .
It 's as if feminism never happened .
Did it ever occur to Sophie or Heather or all the other young women who now aspire to be golddiggers , that they could work to provide a life for themselves rather than just expect a guy to buy it for them ?
Looking further ahead , do these girls know the sort of deal they are doing ?
They are not only throwing away any moral sense , but also their independence , control of their own lives and self - respect .
If the deal is sex for money , the man with the cash may decide to go shopping himself elsewhere .
In Priceless , Audrey Tautou is locked out of her hotel room by one wealthy lover , leaving her standing shivering in a bikini .
In the real world , a relationship where there is such an imbalance of power , where one partner has basically bought the other , might just about work if things go well .
But if Mr Rich tires of Ms Golddigger , he simply trades her in for a younger , firmer rival .
I did n't take the gold - digger route because I think it is wrong .
It is insulting to men and it cheapens women .
Every woman who does it polishes an image of womankind that the rest of us then have to try to argue against .
It makes us all look as if we are for sale for the price of a pair of Gucci shoes .
I have lost count of the number of conversations I have had with men where they have said that basically all a woman is interested in is how much money they have and the size of their car .
When I explain that I have never dated a man for his money , nor have any of my girlfriends , that we have jobs and homes of our own and we would n't dream of expecting a boyfriend to provide either , they look at me with disbelief .
The image of womanhood that the gold - digger propagates is one of a greedily acquisitive airhead .
She never reads a book or a newspaper , but knows the ticket price for the latest designer handbag .
Consumption replaces affection .
Her diamante sandals may be lovely and sparkly , but she tarnishes all of us .

AUSTIN —
An early morning fire at the Governor 's Mansion today was intentionally set , a state fire investigator said .
State Fire Marshal Paul Maldonado declined to discuss further details but said there was no indication the fire was intended as a direct threat to Gov. Rick Perry .
No one was in the building , which has been closed several months for renovation , when the fire broke out .
The governor has been living in a rented house in suburban Austin since last fall .
He and his wife , Anita , are in Stockholm , Sweden , finishing up a weeklong , trade - related trip to Europe .
The fire , discovered by security officers about 1:45 a.m. , was under control by 6:30 a.m. , but there were still hot spots in the building .
Flames broke through a portion of the roof about 9:30 a.m. but were quickly extinguished .
The federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms was assisting the state Fire Marshal 's office in the investigation .
Maldonado indicated security cameras posted around the building were helpful to investigators .
But officials declined to discuss more details , including how an arsonist might have gone undetected by Department of Public Safety troopers assigned to secure the building and its grounds .
Damage to the 152 - year - old historic structure is " extraordinary , bordering on catastrophic , '' including a partially collapsed roof , said Perry spokesman Robert Black .
Millions of dollars worth of antique furnishings , portraits and other heirlooms had been removed from the mansion and placed in storage before renovation began .
But Black said it was impossible to calculate the historic value of the building itself .
He said officials hoped the first floor could be structurally salvaged , but there was more uncertainty about saving the second floor .
Ironically , one of the purposes of the renovation project was to install a sprinkler system in the building , which had none .
Before work began , the mansion had a fire alarm system on the first floor but none on the second floor , where the governor and his family lived .
Former Gov. Mark
White , who lived in the Mansion from 1983 - 1986 and took office shortly before a fire heavily damaged the state Capitol , said he was devasted by the latest fire .
" We just must rebuild it , '' he said , urging state officials to use the occasion to fully restore the Mansion to its original structure , much as state government did to the Capitol following the 1983 fire .
Security officers staying on the mansion grounds in a carriage house were alerted by a fire alarm triggered by smoke getting into the air conditioning system on the mansion 's first floor , Black said .
The fire quickly spread to the second floor and the ceiling .
The problem was compounded by old air shafts and new holes and shafts that had been opened up by workers on the renovation project .
About 100 firefighters responded , and none were injured .
At the height of the fire , they were pumping 8,000 gallons of water a minute on the roof from four ladder trucks and other equipment , Austin Fire Department spokesperson Dawn Clopton said .
The Perrys moved out of the mansion last fall into a $ 9,900 a month rental house to allow for the renovation , a project that was expected to be completed next spring and cost about $ 10 million .
Among other things , outdated plumbing also is being replaced .
Black said the governor was notified of the fire about 2 a.m.
Austin time but planned to conclude his European trip before returning to Austin , as scheduled , on Tuesday .
Perry is scheduled to talk about wind energy at an American Chamber of Commerce event in Stockholm on Monday .
The columns in front of the building were heavily charred , and shrubbery around the building was singed .

Since the virus was first detected in Guangdong Province , China in 1996 , H5N1 ( Bird Flu ) has received much attention as the fear of a global spread of the disease mounted .
Initially , H5N1 was considered merely interesting ; however , alarm bells began to ring when it spread through live - poultry markets in Hong Kong , and eventually to humans , in 1997 .
The virus killed 6 of 18 infected people .
Now , a published clinical trial of a whole - virus H5N1 vaccine derived from a cell culture raises new hopes for a vaccine against the deadly virus .
Since 1997 , we ’ve determined that the virus continues to evolve and mutate .
In an effort to control spread of the disease , millions of birds have been slaughtered and disposed .
Thus far , 45 countries have reported Bird Flu outbreaks .
The virus is endemic in dozens of species of birds in South Asia , and is threatening to become endemic in west Asia and Africa .
Currently , it is very difficult for humans to become infected with H5N1 ; however , intermittent spread to humans will continue as the virus evolves .
The current number of confirmed cases of Bird Flu reported to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as of May 2008 is 383 cases .
Of these , 241 have died .
The whole - virus vaccine was created using a strain from A / Vietnam / 1203/2004 obtained from the CDC and inactivated .
The vaccine was manufactured in Vero cell culture .
The results as published found that ,
… the vaccine induced a neutralizing immune response not only against the clade 1 ( A / Vietnam /1203/2004 ) virus strain but also against the clade 2 and 3 strains .
The researchers conclude that
this may be a useful H5N1 vaccine .
The study raises hopes that a vaccine will be available should the ( some say ) inevitable come to pass , and we are faced with a pandemic the likes of which we have not seen in a long time .
But who will decide who gets the vaccine if and when the time comes ?
Currently , our ability to manufacture a flu vaccine is not great enough to supply the vaccine to everyone .
Although this issue is being addressed , it will likely become an issue of contention .
Pandemic planning is aimed at getting the vaccine to “ front - line ” workers first , as these people will be necessary to controlling the spread of the disease ; for example , health care workers who will be caring for victims of the flu , and the military , who will be charged with keeping the peace among citizens .
Will our public health measures be adequate in the face of an epidemic ?
What will the role of health care workers , and their obligation , be ?
When it is inevitable that the number of sick far outnumber the workers that are available , what ethical obligation will health care workers be held to ?
And what of countries who will not be able to afford to vaccinate their citizens ?
What will they do ?
Will our government step in and provide the vaccine to them ?
Or , will it become a matter of the “ haves ” and the “ have - nots , ” with developing countries being left to fend for themselves ( as they too often are ) ?
Likely , when the time comes , the fact that a vaccine is available will not be a guarantee that everyone will have equal access to it .

Rove defends defiance of congressional subpoena Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 15 , 2008
Print This Email This BEVERLY HILLS , Calif . - Former
White House adviser Karl Rove on Monday defended his defiance of a congressional subpoena , saying he 's offered lawmakers other ways to question him about allegations of political pressure at the Justice Department .
In five letters to the House Judiciary Committee , " my lawyer has offered for me to go up to visit with members of Congress , visit with the staff or respond to written questions without foreclosing any future action by Congress , " Rove said .
Rove , now a Fox News contributor , was responding to questions from Television Critics Association members during a Fox News panel session .
John Moody , Fox News executive vice president , was asked if it undercuts the channel 's credibility to have someone with Rove 's " political baggage " in its lineup .
" No , " Moody replied , calling the former Bush adviser an authority on politics and adding that the current difference of opinion with Congress is between Rove and lawmakers .
But when a reporter tried to press the point with Moody , Rove jumped in to dispute characterization of the dispute as personal .
" It 's not between me and Congress .
I 've not asserted any personal privilege .
This is between the White House and Congress , " Rove said .
The issue centers on " the ability of the president to receive advice from senior advisers and for those senior advisers not to be at the beck - and - call of Congress for testimony , " Rove said .
Lawmakers subpoenaed Rove in May to force him to talk about whether he played a role in prosecutors ' decisions to pursue cases against Democrats , such as former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , or in firing federal prosecutors considered disloyal to the Bush administration .
Rove has said previously he is bound to follow the White House 's guidance , although he has offered to answer questions specifically on the Siegelman case  but only with no transcript taken and not under oath .
After Rove failed to appear Thursday , the Democratic chairman of a House subcommittee ruled that Rove was breaking the law by refusing to cooperate .
It was perhaps the first step toward holding him in contempt of Congress .
The White House has cited executive privilege as a reason he and others who serve or served in the administration should n't testify , arguing that internal administration communications are confidential and that Congress cannot compel officials to testify .
A decision on whether to pursue contempt charges now goes to the full Judiciary Committee and ultimately to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
You know how all the record labels have been dropping their requirements for DRM on their music , opening up more and more venues for DRM - free music ?
Well , according to David Hughes , head of RIAA technology , that 's just a temporary condition .
From now on , we 're going to increasingly rent our music with subscription services that will use DRM to take it away from us if we stop subscribing .
Hughes says that that 's the only possible way to run a subscription service — but of course , Magnatunes has a DRM - free subscription service , and I still have all those issues of Asimov 's they sent me when I had a subscription , even though I let the subscription lapse .
The RIAA believes in " intellectual property , " which is a fancy way of saying : they believe that they get to own property , and you have to rent it .
The bits on your hard - drive belong to them , and that means you have to install DRM that lets them control your PC so that you do n't do bad things with their bits .
In the information age , " property " is the exclusive preserve of giant companies that can afford to register copyrights and sue to defend them , while the rest of us get to sharecrop all our embodiments of their property , from furniture to t- shirts to music to games to cars to PCs .
Hughes believes that per-track purchases are going the way of the dodo in favor of these other models , and that 's why DRM will have a resurgence .
" I think there is going to be a shift , " he said .
" I think there will be a movement towards subscription services and they will eventually mean the return of DRM . "
Hughes did acknowledge that users would rather live in a world where DRM stayed out of their way by saying that as long as they get to use files how they want , users do n't care about DRM .
The problem with DRM is that users can't use the files how they want , which is why they do care .
And we 're miles away from the kind of magical solution solution envisioned by the Hughes that would create the perfect , unnoticeable DRM scheme .
Others on the panel realize this .
Digimarc Corp. director of business development Rajan Samtani pointed out that there are too many ways for the " kids " to get around DRM and that it 's time to " throw in the towel . "

Hundreds of police , firefighters , paramedics and even utility workers have been trained and recently dispatched as “ Terrorism Liaison Officers ” in Colorado and a handful of other states to hunt for “ suspicious activity ” — and are reporting their findings into secret government databases .
It ’s a tactic intended to feed better data into terrorism early - warning systems and uncover intelligence that could help fight anti-U.S. forces .
But the vague nature of the TLOs ’ mission , and their focus on reporting both legal and illegal activity , has generated objections from privacy advocates and civil libertarians .
“ Suspicious activity ” is broadly defined in TLO training as behavior that could lead to terrorism : taking photos of no apparent aesthetic value , making measurements or notes , espousing extremist beliefs or conversing in code , according to a draft Department of Justice / Major Cities Chiefs Association document .
All this is anathema to opponents of domestic surveillance .
Yet U.S. intelligence and homeland security officials say they support the widening use of TLOs — state - run under federal agreements — as part of a necessary integrated network for preventing attacks .
“ We ’re simply providing information on crime - related issues or suspicious circumstances , ” said Denver police Lt. Tony Lopez , commander of Denver ’s intelligence unit and one of 181 individual TLOs deployed across Colorado .
“ We do n’t snoop into private citizens ’ lives .
We are n’t living in a communist state . ”
Local watchdogs
Among recent activities the Colorado contingent detailed :
• Thefts of copper that could be used in bomb - making .
• Civilians impersonating police officers and stopping vehicles — of particular concern with the pending Democratic National Convention in Denver .
• Graffiti showing a man holding an AK - 47 rifle .
• Men filming the Dillon dam that holds Denver ’s water .
• Overheard threats .
• Widespread thefts of up to 20 propane gas tanks .
Future terrorism “ is going to be noticed earliest at the most local level , ” said Robert Riegle , director of state and local programs for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in Washington .
Civil liberties watchdogs warn of unprecedented new threats to privacy .
“ The problem is , you ’re drafting individuals whose job is n’t law enforcement to spy on ordinary Americans and report their activities to the government , ” said John Verdi , director of the open - government project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center .
In Colorado , TLOs report not only illegal but legal activity , such as bulk purchases along Colorado ’s Front Range of up to 150 disposable cellphones .
TLO supervisors said these bulk buys were suspicious because similar phones are used as remote detonators for bombs overseas and can be re-sold to fund terrorism .
Taking photos or videos can be deemed suspicious because “ surveillance is a precursor to terrorist activity , ” said Colorado State Patrol Sgt.
Steve Garcia , an analyst in Colorado ’s intelligence fusion center south of Denver , which handles TLO - supplied information .
Colorado , California and Arizona are among the first to deploy TLOs after establishing robust state - run fusion centers , which initially relied on tips from private citizens .
Federal security agents now sit in 25 of those centers , including Colorado’s .
Florida , Illinois , Tennessee , Wisconsin and Washington , D.C. , also have deployed TLOs , and authorities in dozens of states are preparing to do so , said Norm Beasley , a retired Arizona trooper who has popularized the practice .
181 in Colorado
In Colorado , TLO training began last year , with FBI assistance .
A three - day seminar presented material on how to recognize and stop suicide bombers and included discussion of civil liberties .
State officials declined to release the course syllabus or say specifically how far TLOs are allowed to go in search of information without a warrant .
The 181 TLOs in Colorado were deployed without any announcement over the past year and are posted widely from Durango in the mountains to metro Denver to La Junta on the eastern prairie .
“ The thing that ’s surprising is how much stuff is out there , ” said Denver West Metro Fire Capt .
Mike Kirkpatrick , who declined to specify observations he has submitted , saying some led to investigations .
National intelligence chiefs who coordinate the CIA and 15 other agencies launched an initiative this month to define “ suspicious activity ” for TLOs and develop a process for handling TLO information so that basic freedoms and privacy are protected , said John Cohen , information - sharing spokesman in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence .
Training is crucial “ because what we do n’t want is just people documenting innocent activities .
We do n’t want police officers focusing on people because of their ethnicity and religion , ” Cohen said .
“ What we ’re advocating for is developing a standardized process that can be put in place across the country so that frontline police officers ( and others ) are trained to recognize behaviors associated with certain activities related to terrorism , ” he said .
Major city police chiefs are participating .
“ You ca n’t profile .
So you have to have behavior - based indicators of criminal activity where it ’s terrorism or activity that supports terrorism , ” said Tom Frazier , executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association .
Civil libertarians questioned why firefighters , paramedics and corporate employees — such as Xcel Energy and railroad officials in Colorado — are drafted into the effort .
They say public trust in emergency responders will suffer .
The emerging TLO system “ empowers the police officer to poke his nose into your business when you ’re doing absolutely nothing wrong .
It moves the police officer away from his core function , to enforce the law , into being an intelligence officer gathering information about people , ” said Mike German , a 16 - year FBI agent now advising the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ Where are we going to draw the line ? ”

“ Suspicious Activity ” and Terrorism
Federal authorities currently define suspicious activity as : “ Observed behavior that may be indicative of intelligence - gathering or pre-operational planning related to terrorism , criminal , or other illicit intention . ”
The authorities are considering a broadened definition : “ Reported or observed activity and / or behavior that , based on an officer ’s training and experience , is believed to be indicative of criminal activity associated with terrorism . ”
Here are examples of specific behaviors that terrorism liaison officers deployed in Colorado and a handful of other states are told to watch for and report .
• Engages in suspected pre-operational surveillance ( uses binoculars or cameras , takes measurements , draws diagrams , etc. )
• Appears to engage in counter - surveillance efforts ( doubles back , changes appearance , drives evasively , etc. )
• Engages security personnel in questions focusing on sensitive subjects ( security information , hours of operation , shift changes , what security cameras film , etc. )
• Takes pictures or video footage ( with no apparent aesthetic value , for example , camera angles , security equipment , security personnel , traffic lights , building entrances , etc. )
• Draws diagrams or takes notes ( building plans , location of security cameras or security personnel , security shift changes , notes of weak security points , etc. )
• Abandons a vehicle ( in a secured or restricted location , such as the front of a government building , airport , sports venue , etc . )
• Makes or attempts to make suspicious purchases , such as large amounts of otherwise legal materials ( for example , pool chemicals , fuel , fertilizer , potential explosive - device components , etc . )
• Acquires or attempts to acquire uniforms without a legitimate cause ( service personnel , government uniforms , etc. )
• Acquires or attempts to acquire an official or official - appearing vehicle without a legitimate cause ( such as an emergency or government vehicle , etc. )

Advertisement A treasure trove of artefacts is being recovered from what experts describe as one of the most important maritime discoveries since the Mary Rose .
The late 16th Century shipwreck hails from a pivotal point in England 's military history .
The raised haul includes a 2 m - long ( 7ft ) cannon , which will give archaeologists an insight into Elizabeth I 's naval might .
The wreck , discovered 30 years ago , is situated off the coast of Alderney .
Dr Mensun Bound , excavation leader and marine archaeologist from Oxford University , said : " This boat is really grade A in terms of archaeology - it is hard to find anything that really compares with it . "
Archaeologically and historically this is an important day
Mensun Bound , excavation leader
The excavation of the Elizabethan warship is being filmed for the BBC's Timewatch series .
Recovering the cannon was a delicate operation ; divers had to navigate through reef - strewn waters where strong currents prevailed .
Dr Bound said : " At first the weather was not too kind and we missed out on the window for the first attempt , but then the sea went down and the skies opened up , and everything was suddenly going our way .
" There were a few tense moments , but overall it went really well .
Diving to recover the artefacts is dangerous " The cannon is in perfect condition - nothing has broken - it has an intact hand grenade , part of its carriage system is in place , there is the barrel of a gun or a sword on one side .
" We cannot wait to get a closer look at it once it has been cleaned up .
" Archaeologically and historically , this is an important day . "
The team hopes to raise another cannon in the coming days .
As well as the cannon , the team has also recovered many more objects , including a musket , a soldier 's breastplate and an intact navigational calendar .
These join a large collection of artefacts - including another cannon - raised from another dive in the early 1990s .
Pivotal point Experts believe the Alderney warship and its contents will help shed light on a key point of England 's naval history .
The boat is thought to have sunk in 1592 , possibly after an encounter with one of the area 's many reefs .
Just four years earlier , Elizabeth 's navy had defeated the Spanish Armada and was embarking on expeditions that would exert its maritime and territorial domination around the world .
Dr Bound said : " The wreck illuminates a time when England was fighting for its very survival - the world was at war , the Catholic south was fighting the Protestant north . "
At the same time , he added , the navy was undergoing a technological revolution .
He said : " Henry VIII 's Mary Rose dates to 1545 and is an old - style ship .
It had all sorts of guns , of different types , different shapes , different calibres , different ages , different styles . "
But just 47 years later , the Alderney warship looked very different - and by looking at artefacts such as the raised cannons the team hopes to discover just how advanced the navy really was .
" We hope they will demonstrate that this ship was carrying our first uniform , co-ordinated weapons system , " Dr Bound explained .
" We think that here we have a standardised weapons system here ; the guns are all the same type , the same materials , the same technology , the same calibre .
" It is a different type of navy , its a more professional navy .
We have here the beginnings of broadside naval warfare . "
The cannons and other arms , such as muskets and guns , will now be brought up the Thames to the Tower of London .
There they will be examined and then flown to York for conservation .
The BBC Timewatch team will then follow the archaeologists as they rebuild and test the weapons , putting them through detailed ballistic tests to determine their precision and power .
Text and video reports on the Alderney wreck are published at the BBC Timewatch website .
A BBC Two documentary will be broadcast in later in the year and will detail the findings of the investigation

Vendor Death Penalty : Hewlett - Packard
As a larval nerd , there were two technology companies I held in the highest esteem : Tektronix and Hewlett - Packard .
Tektronix seemed to have a bit more flair : they hailed from the curiously named Beaverton in Oregon , and you 'd often find something funny in the complete schematics they shipped with their oscilloscopes , such as the drive circuit for the lower gun of a dual - beam scope being replicated by a bow - legged cowboy labeled “ top gun ” .
But H - P had real class ; they printed a hardcover product catalogue , and flipping through it you found not just oscilloscopes , signal generators , and the like , but exotica like rubidium atomic clocks .
Not that you were going to buy one , to be sure , but was n't it cool to know you could , given the budget , and that this company provided you the same specifications for the product they did to customers like the National Bureau of Standards who actually bought such gear ?
Perhaps it was a part of the H- P Way , a unique corporate culture created by founders Bill and Dave ( here is a podcast interview with the author of the book ) .
But there was always something special about H-P , and not surprising that a multitude of breakthrough products including the first scientific calculator , the first programmable calculator , and the first desktop laser printer emerged from their laboratories to define entirely new market categories .
using the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act to shut down those who attempt to enter the aftermarket for ink and toner for their printers ,
Well , that was then , and this is now .
Companies mature and enter their dotage , founders pass on management to the next generation , and things change — and how .
What was once a technology company whose products scintillated with quality and endured for decades has become an ink company , whose own cartridges are accused to be programmed to die on a schedule not linked to quality of results , but rather recurring revenue to the vendor .
( Reader S.L. points out that it was Lexmark , not H - P , who invoked the DMCA against toner cloners .
My apologies to H - P for the error .
[ 2008-06-13 20:39 UTC ] )
Fool me once ,
shame on you .
Fool me twice ,
shame on me .
So , foolish me , knowing all of this but seizing on the easy and familiar solution , when my LaserJet 4 Si Mx printer ( bought in 1993 from the original H - P , and built like a Russian tank ) finally expired , I replaced it in May of 2004 with an H - P 2300n network printer .
This printer was easily configured and worked just fine in both PostScript and PCL modes , but , being a product of the new H - P , died in April 2008 , less than four years after its purchase , and without the original toner cartridge having been used up .
It reported a normal status on the LCD panel , but simply stopped talking to the network .
Printer , meet dumpster ; dumpster , meet printer .
Then , consumed by a need to print a few documents and not thinking things entirely through , I ordered another H - P network printer , this time a LaserJet P2015n .
( This is actually the entry from the current H - P Web site for the P2015dn model , which includes both double sided printing and the network interface .
The network - only model no longer appears to be available in the U.S. , although it can still be ordered from resellers in Switzerland . )
Note the price : amazingly cheap for a network printer with these specifications .
Cheap , indeed .
So , I get the printer and configure it for the network in an hour or so , and install it as the site - wide network printer to replace its H - P predecessor now waiting for the next poubelle informatique to be picked up .
It prints the Linux CUPS PostScript test page and random text pages without problems , but whenever I try to print a moderately complex PDF document , it closes its eyes , sucks its thumb , and declares “ low memory ” on its Web status page .
Well , OK , I suppose , it comes with only 32 Mb of built - in memory ( only ! — remember when 64 Kb was an endless expanse of bits to twiddle ? ) .
So , all we need to do is add some memory .
Off to the H - P Web site , and we discover that , like ink , they give away the printers and pick your pocket for the memory .
Here is a screen grab from the current U.S. H - P Web site for the 256 Mb expansion RAM module for this printer .
Hello !
A 256 Mb RAM module costs more than the entire printer !
Well , only if you 're silly enough to buy it from H - P .
It being , a free market ( for the moment ) , let 's see what other vendors charge for the equivalent memory module .
Consulting the Web site of Kingston Technologies , we find this module :
which sells for about what you 'd expect for 256 Mb of dynamic RAM these days , and one thirty - fifth what H - P ask for the equivalent memory module .
Perhaps their printers only work with memory modules sprinkled with pixie dust vacuum - sintered with an alloy of unobtanium and thiotimolene , but it 's inadvisable to attribute to technology what can be explained by greed .
So , I ordered the Kingston module and installed it in the H - P printer .
( And , having run a computer hardware fabrication company in the 1980s , of course I used best practice antistatic precautions in doing so . )
The result : the printer was totally dead with the memory module installed .
Initially , it worked when I removed the memory module , but after a few cycles , it remained dead ( the top two idiots light illuminated continuously ) with the memory module installed or absent .
Enough : Vendor Death Penalty — first Microsoft in 1996 , then Apple , and now H - P .
It 's amazing how turning one 's back upon vendors who betray you can streamline the procurement process for replacement products .
Fourmilab's new printer ?
The Brother HL - 5270 DN which , expanded with a Kingston KTB - HL5200/256 memory module has 288 Mb free for file buffering and image rendering and , presumably , no more “ low memory ” print hang - ups .
Hewlett - Packard ?
I turn my back on you , snuff the candle , and walk away in disgust .

Photographer 's comment :
" Chasing the waves back to the ocean , and running from them in turn . "
It is true that the criminal codes in most Muslim countries do not mandate execution for apostasy ( although a law doing exactly that is pending before Iran ’s Parliament and in two Malaysian states ) .
But as a practical matter , in very few Islamic countries do the governments have sufficient authority to resist demands for the punishment of apostates at the hands of religious authorities .
For example , in Iran in 1994 the intervention of Pope John Paul II and others won a Christian convert a last - minute reprieve , but the man was abducted and killed shortly after his release .
Likewise , in 2006 in Afghanistan , a Christian convert had to be declared insane to prevent his execution , and he was still forced to flee to Italy .
Because no government is likely to allow the prosecution of a President Obama  not even those of Iran and Saudi Arabia , the only two countries where Islamic religious courts dominate over secular law  another provision of Muslim law is perhaps more relevant : it prohibits punishment for any Muslim who kills any apostate , and effectively prohibits interference with such a killing .
At the very least , that would complicate the security planning of state visits by President Obama to Muslim countries , because the very act of protecting him would be sinful for Islamic security guards .
More broadly , most citizens of the Islamic world would be horrified by the fact of Senator Obama ’s conversion to Christianity once it became widely known  as it would , no doubt , should he win the White House .
This would compromise the ability of governments in Muslim nations to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism , as well as American efforts to export democracy and human rights abroad .
That an Obama presidency would cause such complications in our dealings with the Islamic world is not likely to be a major factor with American voters , and the implication is not that it should be .
But of all the well - meaning desires projected on Senator Obama , the hope that he would decisively improve relations with the world ’s Muslims is the least realistic .
Many people have written to ask for concrete examples of how the Canadian DMCA would impact everyday activities .
In response , today I 'm going to start a five part series of a typical Canadian family 's potential encounter with the law .
The fictional family consist of :
Jim and Josee live in a Calgary suburb together with their three children Stephen ( age 16 ) , Rona ( age 10 ) , and Diane ( age 4 ) .
Jim is the chief librarian at the National Energy Library , while Josee teaches media and communications at a local high school .
This post focuses on Jim .
Soon after he arrives into the office on Monday morning , he is contacted by a researcher located in the field who asks him to track down an article and to email an electronic copy as soon as possible .
Jim finds the article , scans and sends it via email .
After work , he drops into the local HMV and purchases a DVD copy of the movie Juno .
At home , he transfers a copy of the movie to his video iPod for viewing on an upcoming business trip .
If the Canadian DMCA becomes law , all of Jim 's copying activities arguably violate the law .
Jim ’s act of scanning and distribution of the article should qualify as fair dealing .
Apparently the government thinks it does not , however , since Bill C - 61 contains a specific provision to allow librarians to digitize a paper copy on behalf of a patron .
That provision only works if they take steps to ensure that the recipient does not transfer the digital copy to anyone else and only uses it for five days .
Since those technical restrictions were not imposed on the researcher , this would not qualify ( Section 30. 2 ( 5.01 ) ) .
The ripping of the Juno DVD to the video iPod clearly violates the law .
Prentice 's format shifting provisions are limited to videocassettes – DVDs are off - limits ( Section 29.21 ) .
Moreover , ripping the DVD likely required circumventing anti-copying technologies , which under Bill C - 61 , would violate the law .
Teenagers listen to an average of nearly 2.5 hours of music per day .
Guess what they ’re hearing about ?
One in three popular songs contains explicit references to drug or alcohol use , according to a new report in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine .
That means kids are receiving about 35 references to substance abuse for every hour of music they listen to , the authors determined .
While songs about drugs and excess are nothing new , the issue is getting more attention because so many children now have regular access to music out of the earshot of parents .
Nearly 9 out of 10 adolescents and teens have an MP3 player or a compact disc player in their bedrooms .
Studies have long shown that media messages have a pronounced impact on childhood risk behaviors .
Exposure to images of smoking in movies influences a child ’s risk for picking up the habit .
Alcohol use in movies and promotions is also linked to actual alcohol use .
Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine studied the 279 most popular songs from 2005 , based on reports from Billboard magazine , which tracks popular music .
Whether a song contained a reference to drugs or alcohol varied by genre .
Only 9 percent of pop songs had lyrics relating to drugs or alcohol .
The number jumped to 14 percent for rock songs , 20 percent for R&B and hip - hop songs , 36 percent for country songs and 77 percent for rap songs .
Notably , smoking references are n’t that common in music today , with only 3 percent of the songs portraying tobacco use .
About 14 percent of songs spoke of marijuana use , 24 percent depicted alcohol use , and another 12 percent included reference to other substances .
About 4 percent of the songs contained “ anti ” drug and alcohol messages .
The study authors noted that music represents a pervasive source of exposure to positive images of substance use .
The average adolescent is exposed to approximately 84 references to explicit substance use per day and 591 references per week , or 30,732 references per year .
The average adolescent listening only to pop would be exposed to 5 references per day , whereas the average adolescent who listens just to rap would be exposed to 251 references per day .
Whether any of this matters remains an open question .
While the impact of exposure to images of smoking and alcohol in film has been well documented , less is known about the effect of music on childhood risk behaviors .
Although music lacks the visual element of film , adolescent exposure to music is much more frequent , accounting for an average of 16 hours each week for music compared with about 6 hours each week for movie images , according to the study authors .
But frequency of exposure is not the only factor .
Unlike visual media , music is a powerful social force that also taps into an individual ’s personal identity , memories and mood .
“ Music is well - known to connect deeply with adolescents and to influence identity development , perhaps more than any other entertainment medium , ” said the study authors .

Dear Zack de la Rocha ,
Welcome back , buddy !
Until you did that reunion gig at Coachella , I had forgotten all about you !
And how you abandoned Rage Against the Machine , its rabid fanbase and those left - leaning political ideals to go wank off with DJ Shadow on a solo record that has still never seen the light of day .
But , hey , nobody 's bitter about the last seven plus years -- it 's not like anything of consequence happened while you were gone .
I 'm not going to be negative .
This week , it 's been really nice to look back on your career with Rage , when you and Tom Morello provided the perfect soundtrack for angst during the prosperous Clinton Era .
( Dude , remember those epic battles against the Parents Music Resource Center ?
How about that Mumia Abu - Jamal guy , huh ?
Oh , and Leonard Peltier , too ! )
You were totally changing the world every day -- Che Guevara did n't even have his own T - shirt before you guys got to him !
Thinking back on that time feels like flipping through old photos from college .
Good times .
Still .
You leaving .
Talk about crappy timing .
After a summer spent flipping off cops and raising a ruckus at the 2000 party conventions , you totally bailed ... just as the Bush administration came into power .
Then September 11 went down , Clear Channel yanked Rage songs off the air , and you ?
Nothing .
After spending seven years sending your fans into street fights with Howitzers , you left them unarmed on D - Day .
Hey , you know , whatever .
Everybody gets a little subjective amnesia about those heady , Lee Greenwood - fueled days after the Twin Towers blew up .
I 'm sure you were probably preparing a scathing hard - rock screed about the foreign policy blunders that led to Al Qaeda 's ascendancy just as Congress was signing off on the Patriot Act .
It 's cool , I mean , Linkin Park was holding it down for you -- they did a record with Jay-Z !
And when the U.S. went into war in Iraq based on sketchy intelligence and utter ignorance of the inherent religious and ethnic conflicts that could arise during an ensuing occupation ?
That Web - only release of March of Death was more than adequate .
The thirty - two people who heard the song were moved .
Why should you use the deplorable Capitalist machine to broadcast your position to millions when you can do the technological equivalent of handing out fliers ?
You have nothing to apologize for .
It 's not your fault " Killing In The Name " has devolved from a protest song to the tune they play after last call at Paddy O'Herlihey 's .
( FYI : it usually comes on right after " Jump Around . " )
Who cares if " fuck you , I wo n't do what you tell me ! " has become the mantra of suburban teens who do n't want to do homework or leave the mall early ?
Its not your fault that the Dixie Chicks and Pink are what passes as subversive or that the task of fighting the Bush regime has been left to grey panthers like Springsteen , Bono and dust - farting hippy Joan Baez , who got kicked off a bill at Walter Reed Medical Center this weekend .
With minorities being treated like fifteenth - class citizens during Hurricane Katrina , habeas corpus being tossed aside like Kim Kardashian 's underwear when a camera turns on , Guantanamo Bay being used as a kennel , Enron mugging employees for their life savings while folding in disgrace , Jack Abramoff playing Texas Hold ' Em with the concept of Congressional ethics , Mark Foley hitting on anything that looked like a mid-'90s Lukas Haas , George Allen reintroducing " macaca " to the national lexicon ...
I 'm sure you had your reasons for walking away .
Subcommandante Marcos and the Zapatistas probably would have done the same thing if they were in your position .
Sincerely ,

ORLANDO , FL — Two suspects seen taking six pairs of Nikes from a Colonial Drive shoe store Sunday afternoon fled in a vehicle but were arrested shortly thereafter , thanks to a cell - phone call from a citizen who followed them in her car .
During the subsequent arrest , in which the suspects were ordered to the ground at gunpoint , a sheriff deputy ’s shotgun accidentally discharged , with one of the suspects slightly wounded from a pellet or pellets hitting him in the cheek , according to the Orange County Sheriff ’s Office report .
The manager of the Shoe Carnival Store at 7649 W. Colonial Drive would not comment on the incident , other than to say it had been a citizen , rather than a store employee , who followed the suspects and called in the report .
The injured suspect was taken to the Health Central hospital in Ocoee where he was treated for his injury .

It ’s a sunny spring afternoon in midtown , and a few hundred feet above Times Square , things are unusually calm on the 30th floor of the Viacom building .
Michael Dare , the director of special events for MTV Networks , has just completed a run of twelve - hour days assembling the Night of Too Many Stars , a fund - raiser hosted by Jon Stewart on Comedy Central , and its after - party at the Mandarin Oriental hotel .
Today , a Monday , Dare has a few moments to catch his breath before heading into the maelstrom of upfront sales events for cable - TV advertisers .
He can just enjoy a cup of green tea , trying to detoxify from what he calls his “ dysfunctional relationship ” with caffeine .
Dare , 39 , never drank coffee growing up in Montana .
His love affair began after he moved to New York in the early nineties .
“ First it was mornings , and then it was afternoons , and then it was mornings and afternoons , ” he says .
“ Lately , I ’ve been kind of freaking people out .
I ’ve been ordering five - shot sugar - free grande soy lattes .
People look at me like I ’m a freak .
But at least they remember my order , right ? ”
On a really busy day , he says , he ’ll take six shots .
A couple of years ago , while working on a rebranding of the USA Network , he was tossing back four or five of those a day .
Dare knows that drinking 30 shots of espresso every day probably is n’t great for him .
And he ’s been having trouble sleeping lately , which is why this week he ’s attempting to rein in his caffeine habit ( For the record , green tea has a small amount of caffeine ) .
But he knows that ’s easier said than done .
“ I ’ll quit for a month and do fine , but then I ’ll be out with friends and smell coffee beans , ” he says , pausing to conjure the aroma .
His most recent attempt to quit ended at a cute little roadside café in Costa Rica .
“ It starts with a cappuccino , ” he says .
“ And then I ’m off to the races . ”
Michael Dare may be an extreme example , but his story is still telling .
Ever since Howard Schultz and his now - ubiquitous Starbucks outlets turned us on to the pleasures of very strong , often Venti- sized coffee , Americans have been guzzling copious , recently unprecedented , amounts of java .
Per capita national coffee consumption , which had been on the decline since the forties , has risen almost 20 percent since 1995 , and the amount of caffeine we consume has almost surely shot up even more than that .
Starbucks and its competitors may not be Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson ( companies that deliberately conspired to get us hooked on known carcinogens ) , but they ’re certainly not shy caffeine enablers .
Coffee shops now beckon from every other corner ( Dare can choose from three Starbucks stores within 500 feet of his office ) .
Serving sizes are far bigger than they used to be ( a Starbucks Venti is twice the size of a traditional corner - coffee - shop cup ) .
And a typical cup of coffee is , ounce for ounce , a lot stronger than it once was .
A Wall Street Journal laboratory analysis of the caffeine levels in takeout coffees found that the coffee served at Starbucks and other gourmet coffee shops had more than 50 percent more caffeine than traditional drip coffee .
The other players in the coffee - selling business , meanwhile , have been following the Seattle giant ’s lead .
Innumerable coffee boutiques have sprung up in Starbucks ’s wake .
Dunkin’ Donuts , once famous for serving passable coffee quickly , now serves a full range of gourmet coffee drinks , and McDonald ’s has begun whipping up lattes at many of its 14,000 stores .
And it ’s not just coffee purveyors who are peddling more and more caffeine .
The twelve - ounce can of Coke has swelled into the twenty - ounce bottle .
The market in energy drinks such as Red Bull has reached $ 4.4 billion .
And you can buy caffeinated water , gum , candy bars , mints , beer , diet supplements , and lip balm .
In a relatively short amount of time , we have become a nation of caffeine addicts .
Science has barely had time to study the effects of consumption at this volume .
New research does , however , suggest that caffeine may not give us the instant jolt of productivity , alertness , and happiness we think it does .
And most of us , it turns out , are using the drug all wrong .
Had coffee been cooked up in a university laboratory instead of evolving on an anonymous bush somewhere near the equator , it might have won someone a Nobel Prize ( and made him obscenely rich ) .
Caffeine is the world ’s most widely used psychoactive substance because it works , and quickly .
Caffeine enters the bloodstream almost instantaneously upon ingestion .
Within 30 to 45 minutes it has permeated nearly every cell in the body .
Because it slips effortlessly across the blood - brain barrier — a sort of filter that prevents bacteria , viruses , and most drugs from entering the brain — it penetrates the cerebral cortex unimpeded .
Once inside the central nervous system , caffeine is believed to plug up the receptors of adenosine , a neuromodulator that acts like a brake on nerve cells firing their messages across synapses .
With the neural sluice gates open , more messages flood through , resulting , it ’s said , in a sense of heightened mental quickness .
“ It makes people feel good , it increases their arousal and alertness , and makes them more friendly and sociable and talkative , ” says Laura Juliano , an American University psychology professor , coffee researcher , and substance - dependence expert .
Adenosine is also linked to the onset of sleep ; rats injected with it have been observed to keel over unconscious , then wake up a few minutes later .
When we pull a coffee - fueled all - nighter , “ we ’re blocking the adenosine telling us to go to sleep because we ’re tired , ” says James Lane , a professor of psychology at Duke University Medical Center who has been studying the effects of caffeine since the eighties .
Caffeine also greatly aids physical endurance and athletic performance , allowing one to go longer and stronger to such an extent that the International Olympic Committee once limited its use as a performance enhancer , though it lifted the restriction in 2004 .
Caffeine is classified pharmacologically as a stimulant , a cousin of cocaine and amphetamines , including Adderall and other substances in the increasingly popular cognitive - improvement prescription - drug toolbox .
According to one psychiatry textbook , caffeine , cocaine , and amphetamines all produce behavioral results that include “ increased locomotor activity and stimulant - like discriminative stimulus effects . ”
In other words , not surprisingly , they pep people up .
The difference between caffeine and other stimulants is , in part , a matter of degree .
Like its pharmacological cousins , caffeine signals the body to release adrenaline ( hence the heightened sense of energy ) .
Caffeine also slightly raises levels of dopamine , the brain ’s feel - good hormone .
Cocaine and amphetamines essentially do the same thing , only they create not just a pleasant feeling but outright euphoria .
Methamphetamine and crack , because they ’re highly concentrated , create an even more intense feeling .
But the higher a drug ’s highs , the lower its lows , which is why a crack user needing a fix might rob an elderly neighbor at gunpoint while a coffee drinker might simply get snippy with co-workers .
There ’s another factor at work , a more substantive difference between caffeine and related stimulants .
Because the brain develops a tolerance to all of these drugs , ever - increasing quantities are required to achieve the same high .
What makes caffeine more desirable , or less potentially dangerous , than other stimulants is its built - in restraining mechanism .
Technically called caffeinism , it ’s the state in which an overcaffeinated user hits the drug ’s “ dysphoric ” range and is overcome by the shakes , anxiety , tension , and nausea .
Caffeine , that is , is self - regulating .
“ That ’s one of the secrets of caffeine and probably why it ’s accepted worldwide , ” says Roland Griffiths , professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Johns Hopkins and the unofficial dean of caffeine researchers .
“ With cocaine and amphetamines , when you increase the doses , you generally get increased stimulation and well - being . ”
Too much cocaine makes you feel invincible ; too much coffee makes you think you ’re having a nervous breakdown .
Still , as with other psychoactive drugs , there ’s a huge variation in how people respond to and metabolize caffeine .
Just as two hits off a joint might make one person acutely paranoid while the same two hits might induce nothing more than a pizza craving in another , some people get anxious and jittery from a little caffeine while others can guzzle coffee all day with no apparent side effects .
Aside from differences in body mass , no one is sure what accounts for these discrepancies .
In one study , Griffiths found that some subjects perceived a buzz after ingesting the equivalent of a couple sips of coffee , while others needed almost twenty times that amount to feel anything .
Caffeine is typically flushed out of one ’s system on a half - life of two to four hours , and requires five or six of those cycles to leave the body entirely , but again there are differences .
Women generally metabolize caffeine faster than men .
Smokers process it twice as quickly as nonsmokers do .
Women taking birth - control pills metabolize it at perhaps one - third the rate that women not on the Pill do .
Asians may do so more slowly than people of other races .
In The World of Caffeine : The Science and Culture of the World ’s Most Popular Drug , authors Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K. Bealer hypothesize that a nonsmoking Japanese man drinking his coffee with an alcoholic beverage — another slowing agent — would likely feel caffeinated “ about five times longer than an Englishwoman who smoked cigarettes but did not drink or use oral contraceptives . ”
New York ’s first coffeehouse opened in Manhattan in 1696 , and coffee drinkers have long been skeptical that the beverage could have so many welcome benefits with so few costs .
In the early 1980s , a spate of negative health studies left caffeine with a particularly awful reputation .
Reports linked the drug with breast lumps , pancreatic cancer , and birth defects .
All of these findings were later discredited , though not before a sort of golden age of decaf came and went .
Since then , considerable evidence has been compiled showing that moderate amounts of caffeine , and coffee in particular , can actually be good for you .
Studies touting newly discovered benefits of coffee and caffeine are published every few weeks .
( April 8 , 2008 , bulletin : Caffeine may help prevent autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis . )
Drinking moderate amounts of coffee is believed to slash rates of Parkinson ’s disease , inhibit the formation of gallstones , and ward off cirrhosis .
It may help prevent Alzheimer ’s .
Caffeine relieves asthma symptoms by acting as a bronchodilator .
Researchers who fed mice caffeinated water found that the animals were less likely to develop skin cancer .
One large - scale study showed that a person ’s suicide risk decreased with each cup of coffee consumed per day , up to seven cups ( notably , though , eight cups or more was shown in a separate study to increase the risk substantially ) .
Caffeine is probably not as bad a diuretic as it ’s reputed to be ; many nutritionists now believe that a cup of coffee hydrates people about as well as a cup of water .
The doctors Mehmet Oz and Michael Roizen , authors of the popular You : The Owner ’s Manual series , recommend downing 24 ounces of coffee daily .
Another study showed that a serving of coffee has more antioxidants than a serving of either grape juice or blueberries .
That ’s the good news .
And now the bad .
A study published earlier this year demonstrated that pregnant women who consume 200 milligrams of caffeine or more per day ( that ’s less than one Tall Starbucks drip coffee or three six - ounce cups of traditional coffee ) are more than twice as likely to have a miscarriage as those who do n’t use any .
Too much caffeine during gestation may also contribute to low birth weights in children and result in babies born with a caffeine dependence .
Large daily doses may also be a factor in female infertility .
A study released in late May found that drinking coffee before breakfast could cause blood - glucose levels to rise sharply , which can be dangerous for people with type 2 diabetes .
Drinking large amounts of caffeine has been found to exacerbate osteoporosis .
And despite the popular idea that caffeine can relieve migraines , doctors say it more often causes them ( Caffeine withdrawal seems to be the trigger ) .
“ Starbucks has been a big boon to our business , ” says Alexander Mauskop , director of the New York Headache Center .
The most serious negative effects of hypercaffeination involve stress and sleeplessness .
Because the drug is linked to the production of adrenaline and cortisol , hormones which are in turn associated with the fight - or - flight response , says Duke ’s James Lane , “ for someone with a busy , stressful job , little stresses elicit big responses on caffeine , and big stresses elicit huge responses . ”
Lane once did a study in which he compared caffeine ’s effects on type - A versus type - B personalities .
“ Caffeine tended to make type Bs into type As , ” he says .
“ Their blood pressure went up .
They rose to challenges . ”
The type As did n’t get any more ambitious ; they just became more excitable .
Stress has been linked to everything from cancer to sexual dysfunction to depression .
Before she prescribes an antianxiety drug like Xanax , Juliano advises her patients to quit coffee .
Caffeine ’s ability to delay the onset of sleep is , of course , one of its chief selling points .
But while caffeine can keep us awake , says Lane , “ it does n’t make the brain any less tired . ”
That ’s why it ’s possible to lie awake at 3 a.m. clicking through infomercials but still feel mentally exhausted .
Depending on one ’s caffeine metabolism , just one strong cup of morning coffee can be enough to disrupt sleep at night ; an afternoon recharge is that much more likely to do so .
“ We routinely ask patients who are insomniacs to discontinue the use of caffeine , or reduce it to a cup or two in the morning , ” says Charles Pollak , director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at the New York Weill - Cornell Medical Center .
“ And no caffeine after noon . ”
The United States Centers for Disease Control reports that sleep disorders are more pervasive than ever .
Americans , on average , are getting 6.7 hours of sleep per night , the lowest amount since records have been kept , and are racking up an hour or more of sleep deficit per day .
Sales of Ambien , Lunesta , and other prescription sleep aids have more than doubled in the past few years .
“ You have people drinking caffeine all day and taking sleeping pills at night , ” Juliano says .
The effects of sleep deprivation are wide - ranging .
The body ’s ability to fight off disease is weakened .
The body produces less leptin , a hormone that regulates appetite , leaving a sufferer hungrier than she would normally be .
For that reason , sleep loss is increasingly seen as a major factor in the obesity epidemic .
The sleep - deprived are more susceptible to depression and tend to have less control over their emotions .
Sleep loss also weakens problem - solving and decision - making skills and , naturally , leaves a sufferer exhausted — all of which are conditions that caffeine is called upon to solve .
“ If we drink coffee all day long , it ’s harder to sleep at night , and we need more coffee to get up and go to work the next morning , ” says Lane .
“ The cycle repeats itself . ”
No one can say for sure how much caffeine is safe , but just about everyone preaches moderation , and 300 milligrams seems to be the upper limit of what ’s considered a moderate daily intake .
That translates to about one Starbucks Grande drip coffee , four and a half six - ounce cups of traditional coffee , eight and a half twelve - ounce Cokes , or six eight - ounce cups of tea .
Doctors note that pregnant women and nursing mothers and those who suffer from any of the health problems associated with caffeine would probably do well to drink little or none of the stuff .
That all said , what if the uptick in energy , alertness , and smarts we feel after drinking a cup of coffee is n’t a real uptick at all ?
What if it ’s an illusion ?
A group of cutting - edge caffeine researchers believes that might be the case .
Anyone who consumes caffeine on a regular basis — especially someone who consumes a lot of it — knows what happens if he skips his morning coffee : fatigue , difficulty concentrating , irritability , headaches .
Research has shown that drinking just 100 milligrams of caffeine a day ( an eight - ounce cup of almost any type contains at least that much ) is enough to develop a dependence and trigger withdrawal symptoms .
The escape from the clutches of withdrawal is a big part of what makes the day ’s first cup of coffee so wonderful .
“ Feeding that dependence feels really good , ” Juliano says .
The implication :
The positive feelings we associate with drinking coffee do n’t represent a net gain in energy or alertness ; they ’re really the result of withdrawal maintenance .
When Griffiths and Juliano teamed up to review 170 years of caffeine research , much of which confirmed the drug ’s reputation as a brain booster , they noticed a pattern :
Most studies had been done on caffeine users who , in the interest of scientific rigor , were deprived of the stimulant overnight .
Because caffeine withdrawal can commence in just twelve hours , by the time each study ’s jonesing test subjects were given either caffeine or a placebo , they had begun to suffer headaches and fatigue .
For the half that received the stimulant — poof ! — their withdrawal symptoms vanished .
The other half remained uncaffeinated , crabby , and logy , and guess which group scored higher on cognitive tests time after time ?
The boost the test subjects who got the caffeine felt may have simply been a function of having been deprived of the drug .
“ They were restoring performance and mood that was degraded from low - grade withdrawal , ” Griffiths says .
Without the withdrawal , the caffeine may not have had any effect .
“ You seem to get the most beneficial effects if you do n’t use caffeine often , ” says one researcher .
“ But that ’s not how people generally consume it . ”
At least one researcher is certain that ’s true .
Jack James , head of the school of psychology at the National University of Ireland , Galway , has been studying caffeine for 25 years and is probably the biggest skeptic of the drug ’s positive effects .
“ Considerable scientific effort has gone into clarifying to what extent benefits generally attributed to caffeine represent genuine net effects of the drug or reversal of withdrawal effects , ” he says .
“ In short , although caffeine is widely believed to be beneficial to mental performance and mood , controlled studies show that these perceived benefits are largely illusory . ”
Even caffeine ’s reputation as a sleep - fighter is overrated , James believes ; fatigue , he notes , is just another symptom of withdrawal .
So the extra alertness we feel after drinking a cup of coffee may be another withdrawal - maintenance mirage .
In keeping with this heretical thinking , researchers have been tinkering with new ways to maximize caffeine ’s benefits while minimizing the drug ’s unwanted side effects and health risks .
Recent studies , some of them funded by the military in order to calibrate peak performance of combatants , have demonstrated that instead of dosing ourselves with caffeine bombs two or three — or in Michael Dare ’s case , six — times daily , we ’d probably get better results from caffeine by taking in multiple small amounts throughout the day .
One experiment conducted by Harvard researchers found that subjects given the caffeine equivalent of two ounces of coffee every hour maintained their alertness , scored well on cognitive tests , and suffered little detriment to their nighttime sleep — even though they continued to ingest it up until 90 minutes before bedtime .
Troops in Iraq are given Stay Alert gum , which comes in 100 - milligram doses .
The upside of slow - drip consumption is that your body is n’t subjected to caffeine ’s roller - coaster ride .
You get the highs without the lows , or the withdrawal .
Another novel idea is to use caffeine not as a faithful companion but on an as - needed basis only .
Most of the researchers I spoke with use caffeine this way , taking small doses ( say , 50 milligrams ) occasionally , and not every day .
“ You seem to get the most beneficial effects if you do n’t use it often , ” says Duke ’s Lane .
“ But that ’s not how people generally consume it . ”
He ’s right , of course .
Coffee is n’t just a drug - delivery system .
It ’s a social and cultural phenomenon .
It ’s a totem of a new day ’s potential , a business - meeting staple , an excuse to linger after dinner and talk .
And it tastes good .
All of which makes it difficult to quit .
One survey found that 13 percent of caffeine users had been told by a doctor or therapist to cut back or eliminate caffeine because it was causing them medical or psychological problems but had been unable to do so .
A couple of weeks after my first chat with Michael Dare , I checked in to see how he was faring with his green - tea - only regimen .
He ’d made it through the upfronts with only a single relapse , triggered by a walk through his neighborhood ’s gauntlet of Starbucks on an especially sunny day .
“ I did manage some restraint and limited myself to a tall four - shot soy sugar - free dolce latte with two Splenda , rather than my megashot usual , ” he reported .
Since all but quitting caffeine , he reported , he ’d been dozing off faster and sleeping more soundly at night , with no measurable drop - off in productivity during the day .
“ I ’ve been alert and able to concentrate in a seemingly smoother fashion , ” he said .
“ Coffee seems to be more frantic on the system . ”
I thought back to our first conversation , in which Dare had described in mesmerizing detail the joy he found in the ritual of removing the top of his freshly poured latte and swirling in his sweetener .
Despite his success so far , I could n’t help but wonder if he was just one stressful premiere party away from slipping back into his old , bad relationship .
In an e-mail he later sent me , he seemed to be reading my mind : “ Do n’t hold it against me , ” he wrote , “ if one of these days I fall prey to the daily coffee grind again . ”

The Simpsons is reaching another unbelievable milestone this Sunday , as the show airs its 500th episode .
To mark the occasion , we thought we'd take another look at our favorite peripheral characters from the series .
With hundreds of Simpsons characters now introduced , it can be a bit tricky figuring out which are " peripheral " at this point , especially since 23 seasons of the show means that there 's now been enough time for even the more minor characters to appear many times .
That being the case , to come up with this list , we eliminated characters that are shown often enough to be considered " regulars " , including the likes of Moe , Milhouse , Mr. Burns , and Smithers or some of the most frequently seen recurring characters such as Krusty , Apu and Principal Skinner .
After all the bigger characters were removed , we narrowed down our list to the 25 peripheral characters we consider the very best .
# 25 : +Bumblebee +Man
¡ Ay , ay , ay !
¡ Es el Hombre Abejorro !
¿ Qué más podemos decir ?
# 24 : +Disco +Stu
" Disco Stu likes disco music . "
That much is for sure .
Mentally stuck in the disco era , Disco Stu does his best to keep it cool and remember the good times .
Usually found in his leisure suit ( with rhinestones ) and massive platform shoes , Stu is just trying his best to keep disco alive .
Just remember , " Disco Stu does n't advertise . "
# 23 : +Dr. + Nick + Riveria
Hank Azaria
Whenever someone says , " Hi , everybody ! " in a Ricky Ricardo - like accent there can only be one response : " Hi , Dr. Nick ! "
Everyone 's favorite quack doctor arguably has a better bedside manner than Dr. Hibbert ( Dr. Nick would never laugh at your condition ) but a lot less medical knowledge ( some would say Dr. Nick has no medical knowledge whatsoever ) .
But when you 're short on cash , as the Simpsons often are , Dr. Nick 's pretty much your only choice in town .
# 22 : +Mr. + Teeny
Dan Castellaneta
The seventh " Mr. Teeny " in a proud line , Louis " Mr. Teeny "
Toot faithfully serves Krusty as his driver , butler and eventual organ donor .
While we know that much to be true , much of Mr. Teeny 's life still remains a mystery – with questions ranging from whether Teeny is a chimpanzee or gorilla to whether he is a he at all !
What we do know for sure however , is that even though Krusty finds him to be less than sufficient ( preferring Mr. Teeny # 3 ) , we find Louis Toot to be one of our favorite citizens of Springfield .
# 21 : +Duffman
Hank Azaria
Duffman is the mascot and spokesperson for the Duff Beer Company .
Showing a resemblance to the Budweiser " Bud Man , " Duffman is the perfect corporate mascot .
Decked out in blue spandex with a giant Duff logo on his chest , Duffman proudly wears his Duff Beer utility belt ( full of beers ) and Duff hat … and cape .
Referring to himself in the third - person , Duffman may be the coolest character in the Simpsons universe .
Really , how can you get any cooler than thrusting your hips in a direction instead of pointing - " Duffman thrusting in the direction of the problem . "
# 20 : +Hans + Moleman
Dan Castellaneta
Although he looks like a decrepit old man , Hans Moleman revealed in the fourth season episode " Selma 's Choice " that he 's actually only 31 years old -- his old looks stem from his heavy drinking .
Hans has been in some classic scenes and had some memorable lines over the years , such as the time cult deprogrammers accidentally captured Hans instead of Bart and returned him in full Bart garb ( " Mom , Dad , I missed you .
Cowabunga , dudes ! " ) or when he was in the stands screaming for blood during Bart and Lisa 's hockey match .
# 19 : +Snake
Hank Azaria
Snake is a Simpsons character who can make almost any line funny , thanks to his voice alone .
It 's hard to explain the odd mixture of thuggishness and pseudo - suaveness Snake has in his voice , but it certainly is amusing , especially the way he stresses the last word in most sentences , whether it be his own name or , " Alright , I 'm taking this thing to Mexico ! "
Often arrested , Snake seems to snake his way out of jail pretty easily , always around to break some laws in Springfield for our comic enjoyment .

Marion Anthony " Fat Tony " D'Amico is the boss of the Springfield Mafia , er , waste management business .
As parodies of all the major mafia characters in pop culture , Fat Tony 's crew engages in such friendly activity as shaking down pretzel businesses , hosting illegal poker games , and supplying the school cafeteria with milk from rats .
One of Fat Tony 's most memorable lines was in the eighth season episode " The Twisted World of Marge Simpson " : " You see , my wife , she has been most vocal on the subject of the pretzel monies .
' Where 's the money ? '
' When are you going to get the money ? '
' Why are n't you getting the money now ? '
And so on . "

Kathy Harris , at 49 , had known pain .
She had given birth before epidurals were fashionable .
She ’d had a hole pushed through her navel for a tubal ligation .
And she had broken a tibia eight years earlier , the last time she ’d been skiing .
But the agony that brought her to the hospital ’s emergency department was different .
It made her think of death and want it .
Nonetheless , she managed a bit of humor when I met her , four days after the worst of her ordeal .
I am a gynecologic surgeon , and when I asked her to describe her pain during that time , she gave me a look that said there are some things a male doctor will never understand .
“ Ever been stabbed in the vagina ? ” she asked .
“ I felt the point go through and come out my left groin . ”
The sudden pain had knocked her to her knees , and she ’d lain on her kitchen floor , leaning on her elbows and staring at the vomit running off her hands , thinking how undignified she was and not giving a damn .
Her husband picked her up off the ceramic tiles and put her on the sofa until the paramedics came .
He had been as gentle as he could be , but he looked sheepish when she told me how he ’d stumbled on the rug and dropped her onto the cushions .
She held herself still while the ambulance crew swung her onto the gurney , the gurney bumped down the steps , and the ambulance pulled away .
She had n’t flinched , because flinching only made the knifing pain worse .
As the ambulance rounded corners and stopped and started and jolted its way to the hospital , she could focus on nothing but the awful sensations .
She was suddenly a connoisseur of pain .
Inside , the staff made quite a fuss over Mrs. Harris .
The resident who saw her first was struck by the way she jumped and cried out not when he pushed down on her belly but when he released the pressure .
He called in the attending physician for the emergency department , who remarked about the same thing , as did the gynecology resident , the radiologist who did her ultrasound scan , and the gynecology attending physician .
That sort of pain , called rebound tenderness , is a sign of inflammation around a ruptured or dying organ .
Thirty years ago that sign would have led a patient straight to the operating room .
But pain is a nonspecific symptom , and rebound tenderness is a crude , unquantifiable finding .
Doctors often under­value these signs , preferring to focus instead on the precision of laboratory values and the hard images of scans .
Mrs. Harris ’s scan revealed that her left ovary was at least three times the normal size .
It filled her left pelvis .
The ultrasound images were mottled , showing lakes of liquid among solid tissue .
Many things can cause that picture .
Ovarian cancer , which has nonspecific symptoms that mimic many conditions , is the worst of them .
But ovarian cancer is usually insidious , painful only when a growing tumor ruptures the ovary .
Another possibility is a benign tumor of fibrous tissue , enlarged by pregnancy or hormonal disorders .
Or the cause can be ovarian torsion , the twisting of an ovary around its stalk , the source of its blood supply .
All the findings — sudden onset , severe pain , a tender mass , and extreme rebound tenderness — pointed to ovarian torsion .
Yet the ultrasound images hinted at something different .
Ultra­sound scanners image organs by emitting ultrahigh frequency waves that are reflected back to the probe at different frequencies depending on the speed of blood flow in the organ ( the Doppler effect ) .
The results showed that blood was flowing in the ovary , and medical dogma says that the pain of ovarian torsion arises when the ovary dies , deprived of oxygen by a twist that cuts off its vascular supply .
Given that interpretation , Mrs. Harris did n’t go to surgery , despite the ominous rebound tenderness .
Instead she received narcotics and intravenous fluids , and within a few hours she began to feel better ; her pain subsided and her nausea passed .
Except for a lump the size of a cantaloupe against her left hip — revealed in the ultrasound — she felt good , and she was discharged with a follow - up appointment to investigate the lump .
It was during her follow - up visit that I learned all the details of Mrs. Harris ’s case .
Now , although her pain had ebbed to a dull ache , the ovarian mass was still present .
As a gynecologic surgeon , my job was to find out if the lump in the ovary was cancerous and , if it was , to cut it out .
The lump was not the only worrisome sign .
Her blood showed a higher than normal amount of CA - 125 , a protein produced by cells that line body cavities and by the cancers derived from them , especially ovarian cancer .
We operated the following week to find out what was going on .
I made a vertical incision in her abdomen , which would allow access to other organs if necessary .
What I found was a dead ovary , its vascular stalk twisted like an old rope .
Instead of having the white color and hard texture of a normal ovary , Mrs. Harris ’s ovary was a spongy , blue - black mass , filled with old clot and already attached by scar tissue to the pelvic wall .
There was no sign of cancer .
We removed the mass , then stitched up the five - inch incision .
Mrs. Harris was home in two days and back to work in a month .
The pathology report showed no evidence of cancer .
How and why ovarian torsion develops is unclear .
It is unusual but not rare , accounting for roughly 3 percent of gyne­cologic emergencies .
In humans the male and female gonads originate early in prenatal development from cells near the kidneys , but they migrate — in males to the scrotum , in females to the pelvis .
The ovaries are loosely tethered to the spine by their elongated blood supply , and ligaments connect them to the uterus .
Interruption of those ligaments , through either hysterectomy or tubal ligation , as in Mrs. Harris ’s case , appears to make a woman more vulnerable to ovarian torsion .
Changes within the ovary can also play a role .
Ovaries with torsion are often found to have cysts in them , and a large cyst may unbalance an ovary , causing it to twist around its stalk .
Once the twist occurs , blood cannot drain out of the ovary through its veins , yet arterial blood , which flows at a higher pressure , continues to pour in .
If a woman has surgery at this point , the ovary can be untwisted and saved ; this can be done laparoscopically , and the ovary can be held in place by stitches to prevent torsion from happening again .
Unless the twist is undone soon after it occurs , however , the ovary becomes so swollen with blood that it cannot accept any more .
The ovary dies .
One result is intense pain , from the ovary itself and from the surrounding pelvic lining , which grows inflamed from the decay of the dying organ .
That peritoneal inflammation can cause buildup of fluids in the abdomen and release of CA - 125 , even in the absence of cancer .
Eventually the nerves of the ovary die , the inflammation subsides , and the pain wanes .
In Mrs. Harris ’s case , the ultrasound images had shown blood flow , so the doctors had drawn the conclusion that the ovary was alive .
More likely what they were seeing was blood still flowing shortly after the torsion occurred .
At her postoperative visit , Mrs. Harris was free of pain , but her sense of humor persisted :
As she went through the door leaning on the arm of her still - sheepish husband , she reminded him that torsion also occurs in testicles .

Early last month five large half - built houses on the " Street of Dreams " , an opulent development in the quiet Washington state suburb of Woodinville near Seattle , caught fire .
Three buildings were gutted and two were seriously smoke - damaged to the tune of about $ 7 m .
The fire brigades took six hours to put the fires out , but no one was hurt .
These were no ordinary houses .
Set in an expensive UK green belt - style " rural cluster development " area ( RCD ) , they were locally unpopular $ 2 m , 4,500 sq ft buildings , dubbed " McMonsters " .
Moreover , they were billed as " green " , built to tick every box of the well - heeled ethically conscious families they were aimed at : formaldehyde - free materials , energy - efficient appliances , pervious pavements , extra insulation , recycled wood for windows and doors .
It did not need a great detective to tell that this was arson .
A large spray - painted bedsheet left at the scene read : " Built green ?
Nope black .
McMansions in RCDs r not green . "
It was signed " Elf " - the Earth Liberation Front .
So whodunnit ?
The Seattle Joint Terrorism Task Force , working with the FBI and the US Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , said this week that they were indeed working on the theory that it was " eco-terrorism " , carried out by a cell of environmentalists using the catch - all title of the Earth Liberation Front .
Assumed by the authorities to be a sister organisation of the Animal Liberation Front , this radical fringe of the broad US environment movement does not physically exist .
It has no membership , HQ or staff , but is said to work in autonomous " cells " .
Some say it started life in the UK - in Brighton , at the time of Twyford Down and the British road protests in 1992 .
Splitting from other British groups , the concept of a non-organisation committed to property destruction never really took off here , but it crossed to the US , where its legend as a group prepared to destroy property grew with the anti-capitalist and globalisation movements .
According to the FBI , " eco-terrorism " , or " ecotage " , is now the number one domestic terrorism threat in the US , greater than that of rightwing extremists , anti-abortion groups and animal rights organisations , and on a par with al - Qaida .
The US building industry , rightwing political groups and the mainstream media all leapt to condemn the ELF after the arson .
" We 've seen this grow over the years and it's very scary , " said Brian Minnich of the Building Industry Association of Washington , which offered a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the arsonists .
" It tends to be done by young , intelligent people , " says FBI special agent Robbie Burroughs .
" There is nothing to suggest that [ the Street of Dreams arson attack ] is anything else than terrorism . "
But the jury on the McMansions arson is very much out .
Instead of striking fear into the heart of middle America , the incident has revealed growing civil liberty fears about the US government 's redefinition of terrorism , and a breakdown of trust in the authorities .
Although rightwing commentators and libertarian bloggers have used the attack as ammunition in their ideological war against environmentalists and the left , few others think it is so simple .
The more anyone looks into the arson , the more they suspect that it has probably got more to do with fraud or political smearing and dirty tricks than with terrorism .
Letter writers to the Seattle press and websites like Treehugger.com and Grist say it is suspicious that the attack on the McMansions should take place in the middle of America 's most serious downturn in the housing market in 30 years , with a recession looming and properties almost impossible to sell .
People are deliberately setting fire to their own properties to escape mortgage misery , they say , and only one of the houses on the Street of Dreams is said to have been sold .
Mainstream greens point out that both the fossil fuel industries and US rightwing groups like the " Wise Use movement " have a long history of trying to discredit environmentalists .
The advice given to the FBI from nearly every quarter has been : " Follow the money " - implying that the arson was possibly insurance - related .
The FBI say it has found nothing to suggest this .
John Heller , the president of Street of Dreams Seattle , was unavailable for comment , but in a statement on his website said : " At one time there were issues involving an environmental group that had opposed the development but it's our understanding that the parties settled their differences . "
While some blame the ELF , many more , like " Wiskidea " on Grist , have pitched in with plausible scenarios suggesting why it was as likely to be kids , or someone who lost a job in the recession : " Maybe someone just went nuts , or a racist saw a bunch of Mexicans working on the houses and torched them . "
" It just does n't make sense .
Why should [ environmentalists ] burn down green homes and cause even more emissions ? " asks John Hunt , a Sierra Club member from Seattle .
" We all know that intelligence agencies regularly plant stories to discredit people that the White House does n't like , " says another commentator .
" Do n't be surprised if the ranks of domestic terrorists swell to include vocal green activists as the election accelerates . "
It has also been pointed out that one dirty trick of the fossil fuel industries in the past 20 years has been to sow the seeds of doubt with fake groups and discrediting of enemies .
Environmental sabotage , also known as " ecotage " , " eco-defence " and " monkey - wrenching " , has been practised widely in the US since the birth of the modern environment movement in the early 1970s .
At its height , in the late 80s and early 90s , metal was being nailed into trees to stop them being felled , factory waste pipes and chimneys were blocked and heavy plant machinery sabotaged .
As green concerns have changed , attacks have moved on to university GM labs , SUV cars and housing developments .
But the case for the McMansion fires being ecotage is weak , because this form of radical protest has all but died out .
While animal rights extremism has continued , in the past seven years , the FBI admits , there have been only a handful of attacks on property that could have been committed by environmentalists .
There are currently seven unsolved cases on the FBI 's books in the US north - west , considered the centre of ELF activities .
Two bear the same hallmarks as the McMansion attack : in April 2005 , a garage close to Seattle was torched and a similar crude message scrawled on a sheet : " Where Are All The Trees ?
Burn , Rapist , Burn , " it said .
A year later , a half - built 9,600 sq ft , $ 3 m house under construction was gutted by fire and a similar message was sprayed on a sheet and draped across the front gate to the house .
Moreover , instead of defending attacks on property as legitimate targets , the ELF has gone silent .
Their website has for six or more years been only sporadically updated , no " communiques " have been issued and the usual ELF defence that attacks on property as opposed to people are legitimate have not been used .
" No one will talk on behalf of anyone remotely linked to ecotage , " said one man who asked to remain anonymous this week .
" It 's off the agenda . "
The website , clearly being monitored by the authorities , does not respond to emails .
The silence is said by people involved in the 1990s US environmental and animal rights activist movements to be partly as a result of ELF groups voluntarily giving up arson as a tactic following an undefined " mistake " .
But above all , they say , 9/11 had the most chilling effect .
The attack on the twin towers led directly to the draconian Patriot Act , which created a new category of domestic terrorism and allowed the FBI to expand its domestic and international powers .
Many actions previously considered vandalism ( and attracting sentences of two to four years ) could now be classed as major acts of terror , and life sentences could be passed .
The new targeting of environmentalists and what some say is a hysterical exaggeration of the seriousness of eco-terrorism is widely seen as the Bush administration 's payback for the humiliation piled on the US and its corporations by environmentalists at the Seattle World Trade Organisation talks in 1999 .
The national guard had to be called out , the talks were abandoned and , as tear gas drifted around the city , US policies were ridiculed around the world .
The new terror laws have also allowed the FBI and federal government to target people it had given up on years before and use new surveillance methods .
One person caught up in what has become known as " the Green Scare " , and whose case may provide a partial answer to the riddle of the Street of Dreams , is 32 - year - old violin teacher Briana Waters , now in Oregon state prison a few hundred miles south of Seattle .
According to two women who testified against her in return for dramatically reduced sentences , this mild - mannered , pacifist tree - sitter with a young child and no previous convictions hid in shrubbery by the University of Washington 's GM tree laboratory back in 1999 while others set fire to it .
Last month she was in court and testified that she was n't even in Seattle that night , but she was found guilty of arson and will now receive a mandatory sentence of up to 20 years .
Remarkably , the attack on the McMansions happened on the same day that Waters ' trial was beginning in Oregon .
It also just happened that the federal prosecutors immediately and very publicly linked her case to the arson .
Depending on who you believe , the attack either worked in the interests of the government , which secured a controversial conviction , or it was a warning shot by other ELF groups that they would not be intimidated by show trials .
Waters is part of what US civil liberty groups are calling an extraordinary witch - hunt being conducted against green activists and animal rights groups , who are being accused of terrorism for arson offences committed before 2001 .
Most , says Lauren Regan , a lawyer with the Civil Liberties Defence Centre in Eugene , Oregon , have been indicted on the testimony of one man , a former ELF cell leader and self - confessed heroin addict called Jake Ferguson , who has admitted being part of 18 arson attacks linked to the Animal and Earth Liberation Fronts between 1997 and 2001 .
In return for up to $ 100,000 of state money , says Regan , Ferguson was wired up by the FBI in 2003 to entrap his co-conspirators .
His testimony and activities are said to have led to a cascade of charges levelled at activists around the US .
" The government built its case against Waters on the testimony of two informants , and several pieces of circumstantial evidence .
The defence argued that the informants - both from relatively wealthy families - pleaded guilty to a minor felony charge and accused her in order to avoid 35 - year prison sentences they were threatened with , " she says .
Of the four others linked to the same firebombing , one is on the run , and another recently died in prison .
According to many , the US is now in the middle of a " Green Scare " akin to the " Red Scare " of the 1950s , when senator Joseph McCarthy launched his infamous communist witch - hunt .
Environmental and animal rights activists are being targeted , it is believed , not because they are dangerous , but because in the wake of 9/11 the government needs scapegoats beyond Muslims , and people - often young , white and middle - class - with defined ideologies who target corporate America are easy and attractive game .
But the venom with which the government has pursued its dissenters has shocked people well beyond the green movement .
Regan and other civil libertarians accuse it of using illegal tactics , threatening people with hundreds of years in prison for their roles in petty arsons , infiltrating groups , massive surveillance , hiring provocateurs , and handing out sentences of 20 years or more for offences that in other times would bring a maximum of two to four years .
The campaign against the environmentalists has been marked by government vindictiveness and prosecution misconduct , it is alleged .
" Environmental groups are being harassed , infiltrated and spied on by the FBI and the police as never before , " Regan says .
" Everyone who is an activist is now a target .
Big Brother is here .
The government has hounded the activist community , overcharged individuals with federal firearms [ laws ] applying to bombs and missiles , and branded them as terrorists , even though none of the events resulted in a single injury . "
Two weeks ago , four people were charged with a 1999 arson at Michigan State University when a federally funded GM research lab was attacked .
The FBI immediately held a press conference labelling the culprits terrorists .
" Domestic terrorism is a top priority of the FBI and we will continue to aggressively investigate and pursue prosecution of all such matters , " said a spokesman .
" Eco-terrorism is what happened in Bhopal , India , " says Regan .
" Eco-terrorism is when Saddam Hussein blew up the oil rigs .
These cases are acts of property destruction , pure and simple .
The [ US government 's ] tactics are designed to scare and silence people who might speak out against the government normally . "
The wave of prosecutions has already resulted in draconian sentences and is likely to lead to more .
Six activists were each given a six - year prison sentence for running a website that only posted information about vandalism attacks , without connecting themselves to the acts in any way .
One man , Jeff Luers , who set fire to three cars in Oregon to bring attention to gas - guzzlers ' contribution to global warming , was given an extraordinary 22 years , eight months .
" A lot of people are scared and intimidated right now , " said Luers in an interview in 2006 .
" They 're either going to fall apart , or they 're going to come together and show that , no matter how many arrests are made or how hard the government tries to crack down on dissent , the people are n't going to be quiet . "
Civil liberty groups expect the green scare to worsen .
The Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act now raises any attacks against the profits of any animal - based industry to the level of terrorism , and a little - known bill making its way through US Congress with virtually no debate is expected to lead to a new crackdown on any dissident activity , under the guise of fighting terrorism .
The Orwellian - sounding Violent Radicalisation and Home - Grown Terrorism Prevention
Act , passed by an overwhelming 400 - 6 vote last month , will soon be considered by the Senate .
Rather than seeking to criminalise " extremist " acts , it targets beliefs , or what many people are calling " thoughtcrimes " .
" It proposes initiatives to intercede before radicalised individuals turn violent .
It could herald far more intrusive surveillance techniques , without warrants , and has the potential to criminalise ideas and not actions .
It could mean penalties for a stance rather than a criminal act , " the American Civil Liberties Union and the Centre for Constitutional Rights have jointly said .
Back in Seattle , the debate in the blogosphere about who was really responsible for the McMansion fires continues .
The police have made no arrests and the trail has gone dead , admits the FBI .
The only thing everyone can agree on , says one blogger identifying herself as a " Christian platonist humanist " , is that " Someone Did Something Bad " .

Japan is facing an alarming new trend : Websites that explain simple ways to commit suicide with household chemicals have led to several deaths and emergency room nightmares .
By mixing toilet cleaner with pesticide , anyone can make a cloud of deadly hydrogen sulfide gas .
If the concentration is too low , it wo n't work , so at least one set of instructions includes a web app that can calculate the perfect amount of each ingredient .
Hydrogen sulfide can stick to the metal ions which sit at the core of many important enzymes in our bodies .
In small amounts , it can put animals into a state of suspended animation .
That trick may work because H 2 S simultaneously suffocates the critters and halts the natural dying process :

Unfortunately , in large doses , inhaling the gas is a one - way ticket to eternity .

Battling rumours of death beams and mind control , an ionosphere research facility in Alaska finally brings science to the fore .
Sharon Weinberger reports .
The HAARP facility includes 180 antennas .

LAB .
It 's a Strangelovian scenario that only the Pentagon could dream up : North Korea , in the throes of a military coup , launches a nuclear weapon that explodes 120 kilometres above the Earth .
The blast fills the atmosphere with ' killer ' electrons that would within days knock out the electronics of all satellites in low - Earth orbit .
It would cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage , and affect military , civilian and commercial space assets .
If this doomsday scenario sounds outlandish , then the possible response may sound even more improbable : injecting radio waves into the atmosphere to force these energetic electrons out of orbit .
Yet this is exactly what the US Department of Defense is looking at in a major ionospheric research facility in Alaska .
The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program ( HAARP ) has been entwined with controversy since its birth .
Originally envisioned as a way to facilitate communications with nuclear - armed submarines , HAARP took almost two decades to build and has incurred around US $ 250 million in construction and operating costs .
It consists of 360 radio transmitters and 180 antennas , and covers some 14 hectares near the town of Gakona about 250 kilometres northeast of Anchorage .

With 3.6 megawatts of power at its command , HAARP is the most powerful ionospheric heater in the world .
At its heart is a phased - array radar that emits radio waves that are partially absorbed between 100 kilometres and 350 kilometres in altitude , accelerating electrons there and ' heating ' the ionosphere ( see graphic , right ) .
In effect , HAARP allows scientists to turn the ionosphere , the uppermost and one of the least understood regions of the atmosphere , into a natural laboratory .
It is one of several ionospheric heaters scattered around the world .
The facilities create unique opportunities to study the fundamental physics behind how plasma and electromagnetic waves interact .
Researchers have already used HAARP to create an artificial aurora and otherwise study the basic physics of how charged particles behave in the ionosphere .
Experiments have been ongoing for several years , but the facility did n't reach full power until last June .
As yet it may be too early to assess whether its research potential has been worth the time and money invested in it , particularly given the ever - changing justifications for building it .
The facility , which has been passed around varying military agencies , including the Office of Naval Research , the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , is perhaps the only research facility that has had to justify itself as being neither a death beam aimed at Russia nor a mind - control device .
So prevalent are the conspiracy theories that HAARP has even been referred to in a Tom Clancy novel , in which a fictional facility is used to induce mass psychosis in a Chinese village .
In fact , HAARP is a unique case of cold war - era military goals meshing with scientific research , and then maintaining that linkage even after the end of the war .
If the conspiracy theories surrounding HAARP draw on fantastical ideas of death beams , then the real history of the facility is almost as colourful .
Death beams and submarines
HAARP traces its origins back to cold war - era concerns over nuclear annihilation , when US and Soviet submarines prowled the deep seas , engaged in an elaborate game of hide and seek .
By staying underwater , the submarines avoided detection , but they also could n't communicate well — the deeper they went , the weaker the contact signal became .
Then , in 1958 , Nicholas Christofilos , a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , proposed using extremely low frequency ( ELF ) waves to communicate with submarines underwater .
His idea , adopted as Project Sanguine , eventually led to the development of operational facilities in Michigan and Wisconsin .
But these were mired in controversy .
They were huge — needing 135 kilometres of antenna wire to transmit the signal — and many took exception to their goals and to the possible detrimental effects on the health of people living nearby .
The Navy eventually closed them down in 2004 , saying that they were no longer needed .
Another approach to ELF submarine communication was to take advantage of electrojets — currents of charged particles that flow through the ionosphere and could act as a virtual antennas , transmitting messages to submarines .
Once this idea was proven experimentally1 in the mid-1980s , physicist Dennis Papadopoulos , then of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , DC , began trying to drum up support for a new facility .
At the time the Pentagon was shutting down over - the - horizon radar sites that had been designed to detect Soviet bombers attacking the United States — including one in Gakona , an ideal location because it is underneath an electrojet .
So Papadopoulos , who is now at the University of Maryland in College Park and has served as a scientific adviser for HAARP since the project 's inception , argued for building an ionospheric heater there .
The facility would help the Navy to study ELF waves , it would provide scientists with an ionospheric heater and it would guarantee continued life for the military site in Alaska , something that Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens , famous for steering congressional dollars to his home state , also liked .
“ That , ” says Papadopoulos , “ was the genesis . ”
But even before construction began , people started to speculate about what the facility could be used for and why it was being built .
In a news conference in 1990 , Stevens talked about bringing energy from the aurora borealis “ down to Earth so it could be used ” to solve the world 's energy crises , earning him the mockery of physicists .
Others such as Nick Begich , the son of another Alaskan lawmaker , began claiming that HAARP was really intended as a missile defence weapon .
According to Papadopoulos , these claims , although far - fetched , were based on a sliver of truth : Bernard Eastlund , a consultant to one of the firms building HAARP , had filed a series of patents making extraordinary claims that HAARP - like technology could be used as a defence shield by transforming natural gas into microwaves , which would knock out incoming Soviet missiles .
The idea , jokingly dubbed the “ killer shield ” , was even reviewed by the JASON defence advisory group , but was dismissed as “ nonsense ” , according to Papadopoulos .
From annihilation to defence
With the breakup of the Soviet Union , submarine communications no longer seemed as crucial , and HAARP needed a new raison d'être .
Supporters proposed new tactics , such as studying ELF waves ' ability to map out underground bunkers like those found in North Korea , a goal that quickly drew scepticism .
“ Scientific research to better understand Earth 's ionosphere is a worthwhile endeavour .
Philip Coyle ”
After the terrorist attacks of 9/11 , however , the military found a new use for HAARP .
In 2002 , a panel headed by Anthony Tether , the director of DARPA , recommended that the facility be used to study ways to counter the effects of a high - altitude nuclear detonation , which would release energetic electrons that could cripple low - Earth satellites .
Electrons are produced naturally in this region when the solar wind , a stream of energetic particles flowing from the Sun , slams into the magnetic envelope that protects Earth .
The planet has its own self - cleaning mechanism to rid itself of the particles : it eventually dumps them lower into the atmosphere through natural auroras and lightning .
Scientists are now looking at whether they can accelerate this process by creating ' whistler ' waves , which would kick the electrons into low enough altitudes — around 100 kilometres — where they would rain out naturally .
No one knows for sure whether it will work .
“ It is what we call a data - starved area — theory is ahead of actual observations , ” says Paul Kossey , HAARP 's programme manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Hanscom Air Force Base , Massachusetts .
Several experiments are being done to look at this possibility .
Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , for example , is involved in the One Hop Experiment , which uses HAARP to inject very - low - frequency waves into the magnetosphere to create whistlers .
The investigators use a buoy and ships in the South Pacific , where the waves fall back to Earth , to measure the presence of whistler waves2 .
Mitigating the radiation from an atmospheric nuclear detonation would require an entirely new facility , and the technology would be daunting .
In 2006 , a New Zealand - led group of scientists published a paper3 arguing that any attempt to remediate radiation could lead to worldwide blackouts of high - frequency radio waves , disrupting communications and navigation .
And some say that countering such high - altitude nuclear detonations is simply unrealistic .
“ I think scientific research to better understand Earth 's ionosphere is a worthwhile endeavour , ” says Philip Coyle , a former associate director of the Livermore laboratory who served as the Pentagon 's chief weapons tester during the administration of President Bill Clinton .
But , he adds , they do n't know how much energy they would need to flush the electrons , or how , ultimately , injecting this much energy would change the ionosphere .
In the meantime , there are plenty of straightforward science questions for HAARP to look into .
The ionized part of the atmosphere has long captivated researchers , going back to the days of Nikola Tesla , who dreamed of using it to send electricity around the world .
In 1933 , scientists found that changing the electron density in the ionosphere could alter the propagation of radio signals4 .
That discovery eventually led to the development of ionospheric heaters to study these and other effects .
Bells and whistles
Radiation from solar flares is one area of interest .
“ These things are really important because it is the radiation coming off the Sun that is the main cause of satellite failure or potential death in human space exploration , ” says Michael Kosch , the deputy head of the communication systems department at Lancaster University , UK .
Other areas include looking at the processes that cause an aurora — when electrons in the magnetosphere collide with the uncharged particles of the atmosphere , creating the optical emissions often seen as brilliantly coloured lights in the night sky .
One of HAARP 's most cited accomplishments is the creation of the first artificial aurora visible to the naked eye5 .
On zapping the ionosphere , HAARP created a green aurora between 100 and 150 kilometres high — in the middle of a natural aurora .
“ That was something you could n't predict , ” says Michael Kelley , a physicist at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , who has been involved with HAARP .
Scientists want to better understand the processes involved in creating auroras .

Other ionospheric heaters around the world include a lower - power US facility in Arecibo , Puerto Rico , which has been offline since a flood several years ago ( although plans are under way to refurbish it ) , and one in the Russian city of Vasilsursk , which has struggled with funding issues .
HAARP 's closest peer is a powerful ionospheric heater at the European Incoherent Scatter ( EISCAT ) Scientific Association in northern Scandinavia .
EISCAT 's heater has cost roughly $ 24 million to build and operate to date , and was the first to create an artificial aurora , even before HAARP .
HAARP , though , has the highest power as well as the most advanced optics and diagnostic equipment .
But most of all , its phased - array radar means that the signals can be steered and controlled digitally .
It can also create multiple beams , which can be shaped , or changed instantaneously to sweep north , south , east and west .
“ I think the main thing that makes it unique is that it has a much wider frequency operating range , ” adds Kosch , who has also worked extensively at EISCAT .
HAARP operates between 2.8 and 10 megahertz , whereas EISCAT operates between 3.9 and 8 megahertz .
“ It can operate in a much lower frequency range than the one we can use here in Europe , ” Kosch says .
As HAARP was only finished in 2007 , scientists and Pentagon officials involved in the project concede that management issues , such as allocating time at the facility , are still in the formative stages .
In fact , one of the most recent HAARP experiments is something that 's not likely to show up in the scientific literature at all : an experiment done in January that involved sending radio waves to the Moon and then having amateur radio enthusiasts and a receiving antenna in New Mexico measure the reflected signals .
But Papadopoulos says that the experiment was more for the amateur radio community than for scientists .
“ HAARP can operate in a much lower frequency range than the one we can use here in Europe .
Michael Kosch ”
At the moment , time at the facility is divided between researcher - directed work , which takes place during ' campaigns ' of two to three weeks , and military needs .
“ It 's a fairly complicated situation in which we support new researchers , and new people , by getting them involved in the campaigns , which is relatively cheap , ” says Kossey .
“ Then of course we also fund [ military ] proposals and contracts that come in under broad agency announcements , in which researchers propose research that is of interest to the various organizations . ”
And even though HAARP is a military - owned facility , academics say that access has not been a problem .
Umran Inan , the lead scientist for the Stanford work , says that Stanford has been one of the most frequent users , with numerous graduate students and foreign scientists working at the site .
“ Obviously , there are security arrangements , because it 's a US Department of Defense facility , ” says Kosch .
“ I 'm a foreigner — escort required — but I am already so familiar to the people there , and so familiar with the facility , that it 's not really a major problem . ”
HAARP 's evolution may not have been straightforward , but it is , in the minds of many scientists who work there , a success .
“ HAARP has been a boon to science in this area , and I think the managers that run HAARP , from the very beginning , have involved the community , ” says Inan .
So unlike many other Department of Defense facilities that are built before there is a clear rationale , “ in this case the community was involved from the very beginning , so the properties of the facilities were all defined with the involvement of the community .
Now , I think it 's a thriving success , ” he says .
As for HAARP 's original legacy , as an antenna to send signals to submarines , that era has come and gone with the end of the cold war .
“ The communications for submarines is not as important any more , ” says Papadopoulos .
“ There are , ” he acknowledges , “ no submarines from the other side . ”

More than 600 filling stations had no fuel to sell this morning as the tanker drivers ' strike came to an end .
Reports of fuel shortages have come in from motorists across the country , but there was particular concern about the supply in the south - west and Welsh borders .
Some fuel station managers have responded to the panic by raising prices - one garage in Exwick , Devon , hiked its prices to £ 1.99 a litre , before backing down in the face of widespread criticism .
The tanker drivers , who are employed by Hoyer to deliver fuel to Shell 's petrol stations , have been on strike since 6 am on Friday because of a dispute over pay .
They returned to work at 6 am this morning .
Unite , the driver 's union , has said it is hopeful about progress in the latest round of negotiations , having previously rejected a six per cent pay offer that the haulage companies claims would have taken a driver 's salary to more than £ 41,000 .
A second strike has been planned for this weekend .
The protests have so far remained peaceful , unlike in Spain , where a tanker driver was run over and killed while trying to stop a van from crossing a picket line .

Everyone loves to pick stocks based on elections .
It combines two American loves : politics and gambling .
Today , Bloomberg weighed in on two big names : Google ( GOOG ) and AT&T ( T ) .
Google will benefit more from an Obama presidency while AT&T stands to benefit is McCain is elected .
Obama is pro net neutrality , which is bad for AT&T :
Before he was a presidential candidate , Obama co-sponsored legislation that would bar cable and telephone companies , including San Antonio - based AT&T , from using ownership of Internet connections to sell owners of sites such as Yahoo !
Inc. premium service on their network .
Without such ``network - neutrality rules '' -- which ensure that networks can't be used to give preferential treatment to one company over another -- Obama says the free flow of information on the Internet is threatened .
Obama 's access subsidies , meanwhile , would be good for Google :
[ His platforms ] include a plan to use about $ 5 billion in subsidies to provide rural and low - income households with high - speed Internet access .
He says the money would come from a decades - old program that now pays for regular voice service for those same homes ...
Such a shift in subsidies would directly boost Google and other Internet - service companies by increasing their potential pool of customers .
McCain , on the other hand is extremely close to the telecom lobby :
McCain 's campaign manager , Rick Davis , is a former lobbyist whose clients included BellSouth Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. before they became part of AT&T , as well as Verizon Communications Inc. Charlie Black , a senior McCain adviser , is another former lobbyist and had AT&T as a client .
McCain also is being counseled on policy issues by Michael Powell , a former FCC chairman who led the agency 's efforts to deregulate local telephone companies .

CHICAGO 
The call by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki for a timetable for the removal of American troops from Iraq presents an enormous opportunity .
We should seize this moment to begin the phased redeployment of combat troops that I have long advocated , and that is needed for long - term success in Iraq and the security interests of the United States .
The differences on Iraq in this campaign are deep .
Unlike Senator John McCain , I opposed the war in Iraq before it began , and would end it as president .
I believed it was a grave mistake to allow ourselves to be distracted from the fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban by invading a country that posed no imminent threat and had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks .
Since then , more than 4,000 Americans have died and we have spent nearly $ 1 trillion .
Our military is overstretched .
Nearly every threat we face  from Afghanistan to Al Qaeda to Iran  has grown .
In the 18 months since President Bush announced the surge , our troops have performed heroically in bringing down the level of violence .
New tactics have protected the Iraqi population , and the Sunni tribes have rejected Al Qaeda  greatly weakening its effectiveness .
But the same factors that led me to oppose the surge still hold true .
The strain on our military has grown , the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and we ’ve spent nearly $ 200 billion more in Iraq than we had budgeted .
Iraq ’s leaders have failed to invest tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues in rebuilding their own country , and they have not reached the political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge .
To understand why Washington insiders are so often so wrong and why big-city newspaper circulation is down so far , read the editorial page of The Washington Post .
Not only was the editorial page dead wrong about the Iraq war when it mattered , becoming the house organ for neoconservatives .
It was so intolerant of alternate opinion that the Post had to write a semi-apology editorial several years ago .
Even the long list of retired military personnel who publicly opposed the war , and active - duty military leaders whom everyone in Washington knew privately opposed the war , were not even mentioned or allowed op - eds in the Post for two solid years .
The Post , of course , published its famous Sunday Outlook story by Victoria Toensing at the moment the Scooter Libby case went to the jury , a ridiculous and outrageous move for a Washington newspaper to do , when the case went to a Washington jury hours after publication .
Now the neoconservative - Washington insider wing of the Post , housed on its editorial and op - ed pages , attacks Barack Obama for his small donors .
First David Broder , once called the dean of Washington political reporters , and today Ruth Marcus , entirely miss the point in their attacks on Obama .
It is true that Barack has bundlers , but it is far truer that the average donation to Obama is now $ 88 per donor , with a huge mass of money from historically small donors who are revolutionizing and reforming campaign finance .
Mr. Broder and Ms. Marcus are not attuned to these average Americans pouring their money , their hearts and their feet into a campaign that represents , objectively , a huge surge of democratic participation .
It is the small donors who have far more power in this campaign than the bundlers .
That is the magic and power of the thing .
The 1.5 million and growing mass of small donors averaging $ 88 per donation have , when they are combined together , far more power than the bundlers , lobbyists and insiders .
Moreover , this money is being used not only for television ads , but for democratizing voter registration , and democratizing get - out - the - vote that will propel even further the surge of democratic participation .
Participation among small donors plus participation in primaries and caucuses plus participation in getting out the vote is the real reform that cleanses the system .
What is amazing about The Washington Post editorial page is not that they disagree with these views , but that they so misrepresent the facts and are so poorly informed about what is really happening .
Supporting the Iraq war before it was waged , standing up for Scooter Libby and Cheney , sounding war drums towards Iran , showing contempt for an army of small donors entering the system , this is no wonder :
The only thing going down faster than the credibility of the Post editorial page is the circulation from readers who no longer believe these editorials speak truth to power , or truth to them .

Community organizing and peer - to - peer communications have worked out well so far in Barack Obama 's presidential campaign .
So well , in fact , that one group of conservative activists is co-opting one of the Obama campaign 's online communications strategies to use it against him .
Willie Horton campaign ad maker Floyd Brown and a couple of other conservative activists are creating a YouTube and viral e-mail campaign against Barack Obama .
Image : Exposeobama.com
This new effort is a viral e-mail campaign that aims to frame Obama as a disastrous - for - the - country left - of - left liberal .
It is on view at a website called ExposeObama.com .
A group of long - time Republican operatives run the effort , the most high - profile of whom is Floyd Brown , a communications and organizational consultant who created the infamous " Willie Horton " television advertisement that sank Democrat Michael Dukakis ' 1988 presidential campaign .
The effort is noteworthy because studies have shown that peer - to - peer communication of political ideas and opinions is more influential than TV ads in swaying voters ' perceptions of candidates .
" ExposeObama.com is trying to create doubt , and trying to create momentum behind that doubt to hit at gut level , " says Jeffrey Feldman , a cultural anthropologist and author of a couple of books on political rhetoric .
" People wo n't necessarily think Barack Obama is a terrorist , but they will come to the conclusion : ' I just do n't know about this Barack Obama guy . ' "
" I think that these ideas will be imprinted in the publics mind and [ if Obama 's elected ] will cause problems to the Obama administration and to the Democratic party , " he adds .
Obama 's campaign created a counter - viral campaign this January when it attempted to fight back against the anonymous smear e-mails that have been circulating widely during this campaign cycle .
The smear e-mails question Obama 's religious and political leanings .
To counter those , the Obama campaign created a web page with the facts about Obama 's background , and it allowed users to upload their e-mail address books to send those facts around .
( For his part , Feldman has started his own awareness campaign on the liberal blog the DailyKos , where he argues the broadcast media is being influenced by Republicans ' efforts to frame political issues . )
But instead of mere text , ExposeObama.com 's website promises to create vivid multimedia content , including cartoons , animations , stories , jokes , illustrations and movies , " all for the purpose of exposing Obama , " the site reads .
The effort sounds similar to an effort called Stop Her Now launched last year by a group of conservatives opposed to Hillary Clinton .
That effort has since been changed to oppose Obama , and it 's called
" Stop Him Now . "
The group behind ExposeObama.com hopes that its readership will spread those caricatures virally through their e-mail address books .
In a welcome e-mail to individuals who sign up to participate in its plan , ExposeObama.com 's executive director Bruce Hawkins writes :
We have also created a network , where thousands , even tens of thousands of people , can become Publishers , receive our messages and in turn pass them on to their own lists .
The objective is to cause our messages to go “ viral ” and to reach millions of people who otherwise may not see or traditional television ad spots .
This is a radically new and innovative approach to political marketing .
. . and it has the added benefit of not being limited by McCain Feingold !
McCain - Feingold refers to a campaign - finance - reform law that attempts to limit the influence of money in political campaigns .
The implication of the message is that this underground peer - to - peer advertising campaign falls outside of the boundaries of the law , and so wo n't have to abide by the rules that prohibit political action committees from certain kinds of activities .
The site 's backers do n't appear to have created much original content of its own yet , apart from a Willie Hortonesque YouTube video that it 's hoping to air on television .
The video criticizes Obama for his position on a crime bill during his tenure as an Illinois state legislator .
The nonpartisan political watchdog group Factcheck.org has debunked the video as " Reprehensible Misrepresentation . "
The site 's " About Us " section also provides a sense of what 's to come .
" We are a committed group of conservatives concerned that Barack
Hussein Obama would be the worst possible President for America at this time , or any time , " write the site 's authors .
" Obama is a liberal , only slightly more stylish than Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton , but equally dedicated to the same causes .
He will not bring unity or harmony rather he will bring back the confusion , depression and humiliation of the dismal Carter era . "
The group is the creation of the National Campaign Fund , a political action committee set up to help the Republican 's presumptive presidential nominee John McCain bid for the White House .
Old muscle got a shot of youthful vigor in a stem cell experiment by bioengineers at the University of California , Berkeley , setting the path for research on new treatments for age - related degenerative conditions such as muscle atrophy or Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases .
In a new study to be published June 15 in an advanced online issue of the journal Nature , researchers identified two key regulatory pathways that control how well adult stem cells repair and replace damaged tissue .
They then tweaked how those stem cells reacted to those biochemical signals to revive the ability of muscle tissue in old mice to repair itself nearly as well as the muscle in the mice 's much younger counterparts .
Irina Conboy , an assistant professor of bioengineering and an investigator at the Berkeley Stem Cell Center and at the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences ( QB3 ) , led the research team conducting this study .
Because the findings relate to adult stem cells that reside in existing tissue , this approach to rejuvenating degenerating muscle eliminates the ethical and medical complications associated with transplanting tissues grown from embryonic stem cells .
" We are one step closer to having a point of intervention where we can rejuvenate the body 's own stem cells so we do n't have to suffer from some of the debilitating diseases associated with aging , " said the study 's lead author , Morgan Carlson , a recent Ph.D. graduate of Conboy 's lab .
The researchers focused on the interplay of two competing molecular pathways that control the stem cells , which sit next to the mature , differentiated cells that make up our working body parts .
When the mature cells are damaged or wear out , the stem cells are called into action to begin the process of rebuilding .
advertisement
" We do n't realize it , but as we grow our bodies are constantly being remodeled , " said Conboy .
" We are constantly falling apart , but we do n't notice it much when we 're young because we 're always being restored .
As we age , our stem cells are prevented , through chemical signals , from doing their jobs . "
The good news , the researchers said , is that the stem cells in old tissue are still ready and able to perform their regenerative function if they receive the appropriate chemical signals .
Studies have shown that when old tissue is placed in an environment of young blood , the stem cells behave as if they are young again .
" Conversely , we have found in a study published last year that even young stem cells rapidly age when placed among blood and tissue from old mice , " said Carlson , who will stay on at UC Berkeley to expand his work on stem cell engineering either as a QB3 fellow or a postdoctoral researcher .
He will be supervised by Conboy ; Tom Alber , professor of biochemistry ; and David Schaffer , associate director of the Berkeley Stem Cell Center and professor of chemical engineering .
Adult stem cells have a receptor called Notch that , when activated , tells them that it is time to grow and divide , the researchers said .
But stem cells also have a receptor for the protein TGF - beta that sets off a chain reaction activating the molecule pSmad3 and ultimately producing cyclin- dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors , which regulate the cell 's ability to divide .
" Interestingly , activated Notch competes with activated pSmad3 for binding to the regulatory regions of the same CDK inhibitors in the stem cell , " said Conboy .
" We found that Notch is capable of physically kicking off pSmad3 from the promoters for the CDK inhibitors within the stem cell 's nucleus , which tells us that a precise manipulation of the balance of these pathways would allow the ability to control stem cell responses . "
Notch and TGF - beta are well known in molecular biology , but Conboy 's lab is the first to connect them to the process of aging , and the first to show that they act in opposition to each other within the nucleus of the adult stem cell .
advertisement
Aging and the inevitable march towards death are , in part , due to the progressive decline of Notch and the increased levels of TGF - beta , producing a one - two punch to the stem cell 's capacity to effectively rebuild the body , the researchers said .
" What we discovered is the interplay between two pathways - one an aging pathway , and the other a youthful pathway , " said Conboy .
But what would happen if researchers blocked the adult stem cells in old tissues from reacting to those TGF - beta signals ?
The researchers put that question to the test in a living organism by comparing the muscle regeneration capacity of old , 2 - year - old mice , comparable in age to a 75 - to 80 - year - old human , with that of 2 - month - old mice , similar in age to a 20 - to 25 - year - old human .
For a group of the old mice , the researchers disabled the " aging pathway " that tells stem cells to stop dividing by using an established method of RNA interference that reduced levels of pSmad3 .
The researchers then examined the muscle of the different groups of mice one to five days after injury to compare how well the tissue repaired itself .
As expected , the researchers found that muscle tissue in the young mice easily replaced damaged cells with new , healthy cells .
In contrast , the areas of damaged muscle in the control group of old mice were characterized by fibroblasts and scar tissue .
However , muscles in the old mice whose stem cell " aging pathway " had been dampened showed levels of cellular regeneration that were comparable to their much younger peers , and that were 3 to 4 times greater than those of the group of " untreated " old mice .
The researchers cautioned that shutting down the TGF - beta / pSmad3 pathway altogether by turning off the gene that controls it could lead to many health problems .
The ability to suppress cell division is critical in controlling the development of tumors , for instance .
" When we are young , there is an optimal balance between Notch and TGF - beta , " said Conboy .
" We need to find out what the levels of these chemicals are in the young so we can calibrate the system when we 're older .
If we can do that , we could rejuvenate tissue repair for a very long time . "
The researchers also warn against interpreting this research as the cure - all for aging .
" We 're not at a point where we 're ready to inject ourselves with TGF - beta antibodies and call it a day , " said Carlson .
" There are multiple mechanisms involved in how our body functions .
We know that TGF - beta is involved in one aspect of aging , but we do n't know where it fits in the global scheme of aging . "
In addition to their work on adult stem cells , Carlson and Conboy have also discovered that human embryonic stem cells can actually neutralize the effects of aging .
Conboy received funding last year from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine ( CIRM ) to pursue this line of research .
Michael Hsu , a former UC Berkeley postdoctoral researcher in bioengineering , also co-authored this paper .
This study was primarily supported by the National Institutes of Health and The Ellison Medical Foundation , with additional funds from a pre-doctoral training grant from CIRM .
Now web programming is mainstream
Something like eight years ago I lost my job at Linuxcare since they simply closed the European operations .
I was a security / system programming / embedded guy there together with a few friends of mine that were ( and are ) very smart developers , but we all ended without a job .
Since I 'm from Sicily and I did n't liked the idea to live in the north of Italy I had to become a freelance developer ( that turned out being a very fortunate thing for me ) , and the only market where it was possible to make money was web programming in my area : this was very sad for me since I had a background in system programming , very high level programming languages and algorithms and most of my work was with C , Scheme and Tcl at the time ( now I use C and Ruby instead ) : to switch to web programming and PHP was like shooting my technical - self , but the bills were there so I did it : back then web programming was regarded as awkward from the skilled programming community .
It was mostly a boring task about constructing web interfaces with a DB as back end , and the actual data processing ( that 's the computer science part of algorithms and great code ) was minimal .... and fortunately it 's better than it was ten years ago : now web applications are much more an art involving the ability to design nice user interfaces and about picking the right features .
Still what happens under the hood of web applications is many times not interesting enough : take reddit or even a much more complex application like ebay , if you take away scalability I bet it is very hard to discover some very cool algorithm inside .
The most interesting thing remains to write a framework :) ( this is why there are so many frameworks around , people like to write them more than actual applications ) unless you are lucky enough to deal with an application where thepart is just the interface to the user , take Google for example , but this is of course a very little percentage of all web applications , including the ones having success .
Fifteen / Twenty years ago to approach programming meant to start hacking with C , writing some cool demo accessing directly with VGA registers , learning algorithms and data structures .
This isgrown , now that everything is an hash table , some nice looking XHTML and few ugly but optimized SQL queries I wonder what the level of developers will be in ten years , and I 've no reasons to be optimist .
Not everything is bad of course , lately a lot of developers switched to Ruby , Python and other elegant and much more abstract programming languages so at least developers of today are exposed to things like functional programming a lot more than in the early days and this is a great thing , still algorithms , data structures , and low level programming are marginal and it's hard to become a good developer without being exposed to this concepts .

The information commissioner today expressed concern at a proposed government database recording the entire country 's telephone and internet use , calling it " a step too far for the British way of life " .
Richard Thomas , who heads the government 's privacy watchdog , the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) , said there was a grave danger of the police and security services prying into " more and more aspects of our private lives " .
There had been too many recent examples of personal data being gathered and collated by officials without proper parliamentary scrutiny or public debate , Thomas said today at the launch of his office 's annual report .
At the same time , the ICO announced it was serving enforcement notices against Revenue & Customs and the MoD following recent cases of data mismanagement , obliging them to explain what improvements have been made .
It emerged in November that Revenue & Customs had lost 25 m child benefit records on unencrypted discs sent by courier .
Early this year the MoD said 600,000 people 's personal details had been lost when a laptop was stolen .
Today , Thomas argued that every time a new database was launched the government must consider " the impact on individuals ' liberties and on society as a whole " .
He added : " Sadly , there have been too many [ privacy ] developments where there has not been sufficient openness , transparency or public debate . "
Thomas – whose office warned last year that Britain was " sleepwalking " into a fully fledged surveillance society – said he had grave doubts about the mooted communications database .
Under the proposals , which could become part of the new data communications bill , telecoms companies and internet service providers would be compelled to hand over details of every phone call made , email sent and minute spent on the internet by the public .
The information would be stored for at least 12 months and police , security services and other agencies across Europe would have access to the database with court permission .
" I am absolutely clear that the targeted , and duly authorised , interception of the communications of suspects can be invaluable in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime , " Thomas said .
" But there needs to be the fullest public debate about the justification for , and implications of , a specially created database – potentially accessible to a wide range of law enforcement authorities – holding details of everyone 's telephone and internet communications .
" Do we really want the police , security services and other organs of the state to have access to more and more aspects of our private lives ? "
Other recent examples of new information sources being collected without proper debate were the expansion of the DNA database and the centralised collection of data from number plate recognition cameras , he added .
Three out of four Americans , including large numbers of Republicans , blame President Bush ’s economic policies for making the country worse off during the last eight years , according to a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll released Wednesday , reflecting a sharp increase in public pessimism during the last year .
Nine percent of respondents said the country ’s economic condition had improved since Bush became president , compared with 75 % who said conditions had worsened .
Among Republicans , 42 % said the country was worse off , while 26 % said it was about the same , and 22 % thought economic conditions had improved .
Phillip
Thies , a registered Republican and clothing - store owner in Cedar , Mich. , who was one of those polled , said the president was doing an able job through the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks but “ right after that , it was steadily , steadily downhill . ”
“ There has been a lack of leadership and a lack of timeliness of leadership , of not being conscious of the magnitude of the problems , ” Thies said of Bush in a follow - up interview .
“ He ’s always a day late and a dollar short . ”

Said Lois Coleman , 84 , of Floyds Knobs , Ind. , who described herself as an independent , “ I ’m not as well off as I was before he was president and that pertains to all my friends , too , everyone I know . ”
Economic pessimism has deepened sharply in the last year , intensified by higher fuel prices , the poll found .
When the question was asked in March 2007 , 24 % of respondents said Bush ’s policies had improved the nation ’s economy and 46 % said they had made it worse .
The increased unhappiness is reflected in an all - time low in Bush ’s approval rating -- just 23 % now , compared with 34 % in February .
“ It is no surprise that Americans are feeling very pessimistic about the economy -- with rising gas and oil prices and food prices affecting their pocketbooks , ” said Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus .

“ They do n’t see an end to the rise in prices .
. . .
Americans blame the president , along with the oil companies , for not having done enough to stem the tide of rising gas prices . ”
Seventy percent of respondents said the rising cost of fuel had caused hardship for their families , and the pain appeared to be spread across all income groups : 79 % of people with incomes of less than $ 40,000 a year said the higher prices were a hardship , but so did 55 % of respondents with incomes above $ 100,000 .
Scott White , 47 , a registered Republican from Saco , Maine , said he had to get public assistance twice last year to pay for home heating oil .
He says he expects things to get worse before they get better .
“ I ’m what I call middle - class poor , ” said White , who has muscular dystrophy and recently had to stop working because of his disability .
“ It seems like [ President Bush ] is not in touch with the American people .
. . .
I voted for him both elections , but I would n’t vote for him again . ”

Asked for their view of the cause of the higher prices , respondents blamed the Bush administration and oil company profits in roughly equal measure -- 29 % holding the administration responsible and 25 % blaming the oil companies , a spread within the poll ’s margin of error .
Thirteen percent of those polled said commodities speculators were responsible for the increases ; 14 % said they were not sure who was at fault .
Amber Guckenberg , a 28 - year - old stay - at - home mother in Kalispell , Mont. , said she was n’t sure Bush deserved all the blame for rising energy prices , but she wished he had found a way to rein them in .
“ We ’ve had to scale back on a lot of things -- not going on camping trips , watching what we buy at the grocery store , ” Guckenberg said , noting that her monthly heating bills now top $ 300 .
“ This year my kids probably wo n’t be able to take swimming lessons because I ca n’t afford it . ”

The poll also suggested that public support for a foreclosure rescue bill had weakened a bit while opposition had strengthened .
Only 25 % of respondents in a May Times / Bloomberg poll said they opposed government assistance for homeowners , while 36 % oppose it now .
Just 55 % of respondents said they favored such government assistance now , compared with 60 % in the May poll .
“ I ’m totally opposed to government coming to the aid of individuals who made poor decisions , ” said Thies , the clothing - store owner from Michigan .
“ It ’s tough cheese , Charlie . ”
Though respondents had strong opinions about the economy , they were not sure how to make it better .
Asked what the top priority for improving the economy should be , 27 % said cutting taxes , 20 % said reducing the federal deficit , 13 % said funding public programs and 13 % said addressing the price of energy .
All together , 82 % of respondents said the economy was doing badly , compared with 71 % who felt that way when the question was asked in February .
And the pessimism has intensified : Fifty percent of respondents said the economy was doing “ very badly , ” compared with 38 % in February .

A teenager who was facing legal action for calling the Church of Scientology a cult has today been told he will not be taken to court .
The Crown Prosecution Service ruled the word was neither " abusive or insulting " to the church and no further action would be taken against the boy .
The unnamed 16 - year - old was handed a court summons by City of London police for refusing to put down a placard saying " Scientology is not a religion , it is a dangerous cult " during a peaceful protest outside the church 's headquarters near St Paul 's Cathedral earlier this month .
Police said they had " strongly advised " him to stop displaying the sign but he refused , citing a high court judgment from 1984 in which the organisation was described as a cult .
The summons was issued under the Public Order Act on the grounds that the sign incited religious hatred .
A file was passed to the CPS , which today told City of London police it would not be pursuing the boy through the courts .
A spokeswoman for the force said : " The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behaviour at a demonstration might be considered to be threatening , abusive or insulting .
" The force 's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice . "
A CPS spokesman said : " In consultation with the City of London police , we were asked whether the sign , which read ' Scientology is not a religion it is a dangerous cult ' , was abusive or insulting .
" Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness , as opposed to criticism , neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression .
No action will be taken against the individual . "
The teenager 's mother said the decision was " a victory for free speech " .
" We 're all incredibly proud of him .
We advised him to take the placard down when we realised what was happening but he said ' No , it 's my opinion and I have a right to express it ' , " she said .
Human rights activists were outraged when news of the police action against the teenager broke earlier this week .
A simultaneous demonstration on May 10 outside a Scientology office in London 's West End featured protesters waving similar placards but the Metropolitan police did not confiscate them or issue any summonses .
Two years ago , the City of London police attracted criticism when it emerged more than 20 officers , ranging from constable to chief superintendent , had accepted gifts worth thousands of pounds from the Church of Scientology .
The City of London chief superintendent , Kevin Hurley , praised Scientology for " raising the spiritual wealth of society " during the opening of its headquarters in 2006 .
Last year , a video praising Scientology emerged featuring Ken Stewart , another of the City of London 's chief superintendents , although he is not a member of the group .
Scientology was founded by the science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard in 1952 and espouses the idea that humans are descended from an exiled race of aliens called Thetans .
The church continues to attract controversy over claims that it separates members from their families and indoctrinates followers .
After the end of World War II , German scientists were being held in a variety of detainment camps by the allies and Russians .
In 1946 , President Truman authorized Project Paperclip to exploit German scientists for American research , and to deny these intellectual resources to the Soviet Union .
Some reports bluntly pointed out that they were “ ardent Nazis . ”
They were considered so vital to the “ Cold War ” effort , that they would be brought into the US and Canada .
Some of these experts were accused of participating in murderous medical experiments on human subjects at concentration camps .
A 1999 report to the Senate and the House said that “ between 1945 and 1955 , 765 scientists , engineers , and technicians were brought to the US under Paperclip and similar programs . ”
According to the Central Intelligence Agency ’s Fact Book , the NSC ( National Security Council ) and the CIA were established under the provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 .
In December 1947 , the NSC held its first meeting .
James Forrestal , the Secretary of Defense , pushed for the CIA to begin a ‘ secret war ’ against the Soviets .
Forrestal ’s initiative led to the execution of psychological warfare operations ( psy - ops ) in Europe .
CIA personnel were not opposed to working with Nazi doctors who had proven to be proficient in breaking the mind and rebuilding it .
In some cases military bases were used to hide these covert activities .
It was decided that the communist threat was an issue that took priority over constitutional rights .
The concept of running a secret ‘ black ’ project was no longer novel .
In 1941 , Roosevelt had decided , without consulting Congress , that the US should proceed with the utmost secrecy to develop an atomic bomb .
Secrecy shrouded the Manhattan Project ( the atomic bomb program ) to the extent that Vice President Harry Truman knew nothing about it .
The project meant that by 1947 , the US Government had already gained vast experience in the initiation of secret operations .
The existence of ‘ black projects ’ funded by ‘ black budgets ’ was withheld not only from the public , but also from Congress for reasons of national security .
A declassified CIA document “ Hypnotic Experimentation and Research , 10 February 1954 ” describes a simulation of relevance to the creation of unsuspecting assassins : “ Miss [ whited out ] was instructed ( having previously expressed a fear of firearms in any fashion ) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken Miss [ whited out ] ( now in a deep hypnotic sleep ) .
Failing this , she would pick up a pistol nearby and fire it at Miss [ whited out ] .
She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to “ kill ” [ whited out ] for failing to awaken .
Miss [ whited out ] carried out these suggestions to the letter including firing the ( unloaded ) gun at [ whited out ] and then proceeded to fall into a deep sleep .
Both were awakened and expressed complete amnesia for the entire sequence .
Miss [ whited out ] was again handed the gun , which she refused ( in an awakened state ) to pick up or accept from the operator .
She expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened . ”
One of the areas to be investigated by the CIA was mind control .
The CIA ’s human behavior control program was chiefly motivated by perceived Soviet , Chinese , and North Korean use of mind control techniques .
Under the protection of ‘ national security , ’ many other branches of the government also took part in the study of this area .
The CIA originated its first program in 1950 under the name BLUEBIRD , which in 1951 , after Canada and Britain had been included , was changed to ARTICHOKE .
MKULTRA officially began in 1953 .
Technically it was closed in 1964 , but some of its programs remained active under MKSEARCH well into the 1970s .
In 1973 , tipped off about forthcoming investigations , CIA Director Richard Helms ordered the destruction of any MKULTRA records .
Diligent use of the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) helps to cast light on the advances that have been made in controlling the way people think and act .
In 1977 , through an FOIA request , 16,000 pages of documents were found , held as part of the Agency ’s financial history .
That is how much of this information has been pieced together .
The FOIA allows the most humble citizen to demand the disclosure of documents , although inevitably some will be heavily censored or not released at all .
Inevitably , however , it is an incomplete picture .
Most of the important details were conveniently destroyed under orders of CIA Director Helms to conceal wrongdoing .
What the mind controllers were and are doing may be only hinted at in a memo footnote or in the memoirs of a retired researcher .
Nevertheless , there is more than enough here to show that secret new techniques are being exploited that are no longer in the realm of science fiction .
We must all be aware of this threat , so that those who wish to take liberties with democracy , and with our freedom to think , are deterred .
The CIA Mind Control Projects
Project BLUEBIRD was approved by the director of the CIA on April 20 , 1950 .
In a 1951 memo , Bluebird states that practical research was to be conducted to include these specific problems :
* Can we create by post - H [ hypnotic ] control an action contrary to an individual ’s basic moral principles ?
* Can we in a matter of an hour , two hours , one day , etc. , induce an H condition in an unwilling subject to such an extent that he will perform an act for our benefit ?
* Could we seize a subject and in the space of an hour or two by post - H control have him crash an airplane , wreck a train , etc . ?
* Can we by H and SI [ sleep inducing ] techniques force a subject to travel long distances , commit specified acts and return to us or bring documents or materials ?
* Can we guarantee total amnesia under any and all conditions ?
* Can we “ alter ” a person ’s personality ?
* Can we devise a system for making unwilling subjects into willing agents and then transfer that control to untrained agency agents in the field by use of codes or identifying signs ?
* How can sodium A or P or any other sleep inducing agent be best concealed in a normal or commonplace item , such as candy , cigarettes , coffee , tea , beer , medicines ?
Officially , MKULTRA was established on 13 April 1953 , at Richard Helms ’ suggestion as “ ultra sensitive work . ”
The operational wing of MKULTRA , known as MKDELTA , had as its mission to find out how to use chemical and biological weapon ingredients to alter the human mind .
Originally established as a supplementary funding mechanism to the ARTICHOKE project , MKULTRA quickly grew into a mammoth undertaking that outflanked earlier mind control initiatives .
memorandum from Richard Helms , Acting Deputy Director to CIA Director Allen Dulles dated 3 April 1953 and entitled “ Two Extremely Sensitive Research Programs ” ( MKULTRA and MKDELTA ) includes the statement , “ Even internally in CIA , as few individuals as possible should be aware of our interest in these fields and of the identity of those who are working for us .
At present this results in ridiculous contracts which do not spell out the scope or intent of the work . ”
The memorandum below was written 10 years later to Helms , who by then had become CIA Director
26 July 1963 , MEMORANDUM FOR : Director of Central Intelligence
SUBJECT : Report of Inspection , MKULTRA
It was deemed advisable to prepare the report of the MKULTRA program in one copy only , in view of its unusual sensitivity .
Normal procedures for project approval , funding , and accounting were waived .
The program requires the services of highly specialized authorities in many fields of natural science .
The concepts involved in manipulating human behavior are found by many people both within and outside the Agency to be distasteful and unethical .
Nevertheless , there have been major accomplishments both in research and operational employment .
Over the ten - year life of the program many additional avenues to the control of human behavior have been designated under the MKULTRA charter , including radiation , electro - shock , harassment substances , and paramilitary devices .
Some MKULTRA activities raise questions of legality implicit in the original charter .
A final phase of the testing of MKULTRA products places the rights and interests of US citizens in jeopardy .
Public disclosure of some aspects of MKULTRA activity could induce serious adverse reaction in US public opinion .
TSD [ Technical Services Division of CIA ] initiated a program for covert testing of materials on unwitting US citizens in 1955 .
TSD has pursued a philosophy of minimum documentation in keeping with the high sensitivity of some of the projects .
Some files contained little or no data at all .
There are just two individuals in TSD who have full substantive knowledge of the program and most of that knowledge is unrecorded .
In protecting the sensitive nature of the American intelligence capability to manipulate human behavior , they apply “ need to know ” doctrine to their professional associates to a maximum degree .
J.S. Earman , Inspector General
The Senate Intelligence Committee did find some records during its investigation in 1976 . [ 16 ]
However it noted that the practice of MKULTRA was “ to maintain no records of the planning and approval of test programs . ”
Miles Copeland , a former CIA officer , said , “ The congressional sub - committee which went into this got only the barest glimpse . ” [ 17 ]
Senator Frank Church , who led the congressional investigations of the CIA ’s unlawful actions , said that the agency was “ a rogue elephant ” operating above the law as it plotted assassinations , illegally spied on thousands of Americans , and even drugged our own citizens in its effort to develop new weapons for its covert arsenal . ”
MC 13 , 18 , NB 38
The focal point of MKULTRA was the use of humans as unwitting subjects [ without their knowledge or consent ] .
The CIA sponsored numerous experiments of this kind .
Regardless of a report by the CIA ’s Inspector General in 1963 recommending the termination of testing on unwitting subjects , future CIA Director Richard Helms continued to advocate covert testing on the grounds that “ we are less capable of staying up with the Soviet advances in this field . ”
On the subject of moral issues , Helms commented , “ we have no answer to the moral issue . ”
The Experience of CIA Mind Control Victim Carol Rutz
The CIA bought my services from my grandfather in 1952 starting at the tender age of four .
Over the next 12 years , I was tested , trained , and used in various ways .
Electroshock , drugs , hypnosis , sensory deprivation , and other types of trauma were used to make me compliant and split my personality [ create multiple personalities for specific tasks ] .
Each alter or personality was created to respond to a post - hypnotic trigger , then perform an act and not remember it later .
This “ Manchurian Candidate ” program was just one of the operational uses of the mind control scenario by the CIA .
Your hard - earned tax dollars supported this .
As a survivor of CIA programs Bluebird / Artichoke and MKULTRA , I began my intense search to document some of the mind control experiments that I was made part of .
Through a series of FOIA requests to various departments of the government , 48 years after I was first experimented on , I found solid proof of my memories — proof that was in the government vaults of the nearly 18,000 pages of declassified documents from the Bluebird / Artichoke and MKULTRA programs .
One of the declassified documents states , “ Learning studies will be instituted in which the subject will be rewarded or punished for overall performance and reinforced in various ways — with electric shock , etc .
In other cases , drugs and psychological tricks will be used to modify attitudes .
The experimenters will be particularly interested in dissociative states [ multiple personality ] .
An attempt will be made to induce a number of states of this kind , using hypnosis . ”
The government had finally handed me the validation I had been searching for
The basic premise of the book The Manchurian Candidate is that a group of American POWs in the Korean War is brainwashed while crossing through Manchuria to freedom .
They arrive back in the US amnesic for the period of brainwashing .
One of them is programmed to be an assassin .
His target is a candidate for president of the US .
His handlers control him with a hypnotically implanted trigger .
In an experiment described in a document entitled “ SI and H experimentation ( 25 September 1951 ) , ” two female subjects took part in an exercise involving the planting of a bomb .
Both subjects performed perfectly and were fully amnesic for the exercise : “ [ Whited out ] was instructed that upon awakening , she would proceed to [ whited out ] room where she would wait at the desk for a telephone call .
Upon receiving the call , a person known as “ Jim ” would engage her in normal conversation .
During the course of the conversation , this individual would mention a code word .
When she heard this code word , she would pass into a SI trance state , but would not close her eyes and remain perfectly normal and continue the telephone conversation .
She was told that upon conclusion of the telephone conversation , she would carry out instructions : [ Whited out ] was shown an electric timing device .
She was informed that this device was a bomb , and was then instructed how to attach and set the device .
After [ whited out ] learned how to set and attach the device , she was told to take the timing device which was in a briefcase , and proceed to the ladies room .
In the ladies room , she would be met by a girl whom she had never seen who would identify herself by the code word “ New York . ” [ whited out ] was then to show this individual how to attach and set the timing device and further instructions would be given that the timing device was to be carried in the briefcase to [ whited out ] room , placed in the nearest empty electric - light plug and concealed in the bottom , left - hand drawer of [ whited out ] desk , with the device set for 82 seconds and turned on . ”
The Mind Control Doctors
In the second half of the 20th century , mind control projects resulted in extensive political abuse of psychiatry in North America .
Many thousands of prisoners and mental patients were subjected to unethical mind control experiments by leading psychiatrists and medical schools .
Organized academic psychiatry has never acknowledged this history .
The network of mind control doctors involved has done a great deal of harm to the field of psychiatry and to psychiatric patients .
The work of the mind control doctors did not occur in a vacuum .
The importation of Nazi doctors to the US through secret programs like PAPERCLIP is part of the context .
Mind control experimentation was not only tolerated by medical professionals , but published in psychiatric and medical journals .
The climate was permissive , supportive , and approving of mind control experimentation .
Dr. William Sweet participated in both brain electrode implant experiments and the injection of uranium into medical patients at Harvard University .
The 925 - page Final Report .
Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments tells the story of radiation experiments , and their linkage to mind control .
Martin
Orne is one of the leading experts on hypnosis of the 20th century .
For about 30 years , he was the editor of The International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis .
Dr. Orne is one of two psychiatrists professionally still active into the late 1990 ’s who is a documented CIA mind control contractor ( along with Dr. Louis Jolyon West ) .
P. Janet asked a “ deeply hypnotized female to commit several murders before a distinguished group of judges , stabbing some victims with rubber daggers and poisoning others with sugar tablets . ”
The hypnotized subject did all these things without hesitation .
Army doctors were actively involved in LSD testing at least until the late 1970’s .
Subjects of LSD experiments included children as young as five years old , and brain electrodes were implanted in children as young as 11 years of age .
Four of the CIA ’s MKULTRA Subprojects were on children .
The mind control doctors included presidents of the American Psychiatric Association and psychiatrists who received full - page obituaries in the American Journal of Psychiatry .
Responsibility for the unethical experimentation lies first with the individual doctors , but also collectively with the medical profession , and with academia as a whole .
The MKULTRA contractor about whom the most has been written is Dr. Ewen Cameron .
At various times , Dr. Cameron was President of the American , Canadian , and World Psychiatric Associations .
He was one of four co-founders of the World Psychiatric Association .
Dr. Cameron began conducting unethical , unscientific , and inhumane brainwashing experiments in the 1930’s .
Schizophrenic patients were forced to lie naked in red light for eight hours a day for periods as long as eight months .
Another experiment involved overheating patients in an electric cage until their body temperatures reached 102 degrees .
From January 1957 until September 1960 , Dr. Cameron ’s project received $ 64,242.44 in CIA funds .
When the CIA stopped funding him , Cameron received $ 57,750 from the Canadian government to continue his research from 1961 to 1964 .
The actual number of patients on whom Cameron tried varieties of his experimental techniques is reported as 332 .
Linda MacDonald was a victim of Dr. Ewen Cameron ’s unethical , destructive mind control experiments in 1963 .
Dr. Cameron used a “ treatment ” which involved intensive application of three brainwashing techniques ; drug disinhibition , prolonged sleep , and prolonged psychological isolation .
These were combined with ECT [ Electro Convulsive Therapy ] treatments .
The amount of electricity introduced into Linda ’s brain exceeded by 76.5 times the maximum amount recommended in the ECT Guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association .
Dr. Cameron ’s “ depatterning ” technique resulted in permanent and complete amnesia .
Dr. Cameron proved that doctors skilled in the right procedures can erase a subject ’s memory .
To this day , Linda MacDonald is unable to remember anything from her birth to 1963 .
As recorded by nurses in her chart , Linda was completely disoriented .
She did n’t know her name , age or where she was .
She did n’t recognize her children .
She could n’t read , drive , cook , or use a toilet .
Not only did she not know her husband , she did n’t even know what a husband was .
Life changed for Linda when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program , The Fifth Estate , aired a segment on Dr. Cameron on January 17 , 1984 .
A Vancouver newspaper ran a full - page story on Robert Loggie , a Vancouver man who had been experimented on by Dr. Cameron .
Loggie was a plaintiff in the class action suit against the CIA for Dr. Cameron ’s MKULTRA experiments , which was settled out of court for $ 750,000 , divided among the eight plaintiffs in 1988 .
Eventually Linda got $ 100,000 plus legal fees from the Canadian government .
J.G. Watkins “ induced a soldier to strike an officer by suggesting that the officer was a Japanese soldier . ”
In another experiment , two subjects who were told to throw sulphuric acid at a laboratory assistant ( protected by glass ) complied with the hypnotist ’s commands .
MC 158
G.H. Estabrooks is the only mind control doctor who has publicly acknowledged the building of Manchurian Candidates .
In his book Spiritism , Dr. Estabrooks describes experiments done to create multiple personality .
In his book Hypnotism , Dr. Estabrooks states that the creation of experimental multiple personality for operational use in military subjects , whom he refers to as super spies , is ethical because of the demands of war .
In a 1971 article in Science Digest , Dr. Estabrooks claimed to have created hypnotic couriers and counterintelligence agents for operational use .
“ By the 1920 ’s not only had [ clinical hypnotists ] learned to apply posthypnotic suggestion , but also to split certain complex individuals into multiple personalities like Jeckyl - Hydes .
During World War II , I worked this technique with a vulnerable Marine lieutenant I ’ll call Jones .
I split his personality into Jones A and Jones B. Jones A , once a ‘ normal ’ working Marine , became entirely different .
He talked communist doctrine and meant it .
He was welcomed enthusiastically by communist cells , and was deliberately given a dishonorable discharge by the Corps and became a card - carrying party member .
Jones B was the deeper personality , knew all the thoughts of Jones A , was a loyal American and was ‘ imprinted ’ to say nothing during conscious phases .
All I had to do was hypnotize the whole man , get in touch with Jones B , the loyal American , and I had a pipeline straight into the Communist camp .
It worked beautifully . ”
Dr. Estabrooks did experiments on children .
He corresponded with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover about using hypnosis to interrogate juvenile delinquents .
His experimentation raises the possibility that he or other investigators might have attempted to create Manchurian Candidates in children .
Such a possibility might seem far - fetched until one considers the LSD , biological and radiation experiments conducted on children , and the fact that four MKULTRA Subprojects were on children .
The deliberate creation of multiple personality in children is an explicitly stated plan in the MKULTRA Subproject Proposal submitted for funding on May 30 , 1961 .
LSD Tests
From 1950 until the 1970s , the CIA collaborated closely with the US Army while conducting LSD and other chemical tests on humans .
Experiments were conducted where none of the volunteers gave their ‘ informed consent ’ prior to receiving LSD .
There was a deliberate attempt to deny the volunteers any information that would have permitted them to evaluate the dangers involved .
Most of the related records have been destroyed .
A field test plan called for use of LSD on foreign nationals overseas .
The Surgeon General “ offered no medical objections to the field experimental plan . ” [ 54 ]
Subjects for the proposed field test were to be non-volunteer , foreign nationals .
It is clear that from the start to finish the project violated Department of Defense policies , as well as specific procedures set for chemical or medical research .
Frank Olson was a biological warfare expert .
He committed suicide after being given LSD hidden in liqueur by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb , Director of MKULTRA .
Olson ’s family determined that he committed suicide subsequent to a bad LSD trip only after reading Nelson Rockefeller ’s 1975 report on the CIA , finally published 22 years after Olsen ’s death .
They were given $ 750,000 in compensation by Congress .
Electronic Implants
Jose Delgado ’s development of the Stimoceiver in the 1950s brought intelligence agencies ’ ultimate dream of controlling human behavior one step closer to reality .
The Stimoceiver — a miniature electrode capable of receiving and transmitting electronic signals by FM radio — could be placed within an individual ’s cranium .
And once in place , an outside operator could manipulate the subject ’s responses .
Delgado demonstrated the potential of his Stimoceivers by wiring a fully - grown bull .
With the device in place , Delgado stepped into the ring with the bull .
The animal charged towards the experimenter – and then suddenly stopped , just before it reached him .
The powerful beast had been stopped with the simple action of pushing a button on a small box held in Delgado ’s hand .
Dr. Delgado , a neurosurgeon and professor at Yale , received funding for brain electrode research on children and adults .
He did research in monkeys and cats , and in one paper describes the cats as “ mechanical toys . ”
He was able to control the movements of his animal and human subjects by pushing buttons on a remote transmitter box .
In 1966 , Delgado asserted that his experiments “ support the distasteful conclusion that motion , emotion and behavior can be directed by electrical forces , and that humans can be controlled like robots by push buttons . ”
An 11 - year old boy underwent a partial change of identity upon remote stimulation of his brain electrode : “ Electrical stimulation of the superior temporal convolution induced confusion about his sexual identity .
These effects were specific , reliable , and statistically significant .
For example , the patient said , ' I was thinking whether I was a boy or a girl , ' and ' I ’d like to be a girl . ' "
After one of the stimulations the patient suddenly began to discuss his desire to marry the male interviewer .
Temporal - lobe stimulation produced in another patient open manifestations and declarations of pleasure , accompanied by giggles and joking with the therapist .
In two adult female patients stimulation of the same region was followed by discussion of marriage and expression of a wish to marry the therapist .
BB 88 , 89
Brain electrode research was also conducted independently at Harvard by Dr. Delgado ’s coauthors , Drs. Vernon Mark , Frank Ervin , and William Sweet .
Mark and Ervin describe implanting brain electrodes in a large number of patients at Harvard hospitals .
A patient named Jennie was 14 years old when they put electrodes in her brain .
In their book Violence and the Brain , [ 65 ] photographs show 18 - year old Julia smiling , angry , or pounding the wall depending on which button is being pushed on the transmitter box sending signals to her brain electrodes .
The mind control doctors saw their patients as biological machines , a view which made them sub-human , and therefore easier to abuse in mind control experiments .
Dr. Robert G. Heath , Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at Tulane University , placed brain electrodes in a young homosexual man and fitted him with a box .
A button on the box could be used to electrically stimulate an electrode implanted in a pleasure center .
During one three - our period , the patient , referred to as B - 19 , stimulated himself 1,500 times .
“ During these sessions , B - 19 stimulated himself to a point that he was experiencing an almost overwhelming euphoria and elation , and had to be disconnected , despite his vigorous protests . "
Dr. John Lilly describes the technique of electrode implantation .
“ Electrodes could be implanted in the brain without using anesthesia .
Short lengths of hypodermic needle tubing equal in length to the thickness of the skull were quickly pounded through the scalp into the skull .
These stainless steel guides furnished passageways for the insertion of electrodes into the brain to any desired distance and at any desired location .
Because of the small size of the sleeve guides , the scalp quickly recovered from the small hole made in it , and the sleeve guide remained imbedded in the bone for months to years .
At any time he desired , the investigator could palpate [ rub ] the scalp and find the location of each of the sleeve guides .
Once one was found , he inserted a needle down through the bone .
After withdrawing the needle , the investigator placed a small sharp electrode in the track made by the needle and pressed the electrode through the skull and down into the substance of the brain to any desired depth . ”
Non-Lethal Weapons
Non-lethal weapons is a broad category which includes devices for beaming various kinds of energy at human targets in order to temporarily incapacitate them , or to control or affect their behavior .
Non-lethal weapons research has been conducted at universities on contract to the CIA , and has overlapped with research on hallucinogens and brain electrode implants .
In 1991 , Janet Morris , one of the main proponents of non-lethal weapons , issued a number of papers .
According one paper , US Special Operations Command already had a portable microwave weapon .
“ US Special Forces can cook internal organs . ”
Another concept was ‘ Infrasound ’ using acoustic beams .
Laboratories were developing a high power , very low frequency acoustic beam weapon projecting non-penetrating acoustic bullets .
Already , some governments have used infrasound as a means of crowd control .
Very low frequency ( VLF ) sound , or low frequency RF modulations can cause nausea , vomiting and abdominal pains .
“ Some very low frequency sound generators can cause the disruption of human organs and , at high power levels , can crumble masonry . ”
Funding of these experiments began in MKULTRA .
Subproject 62 documents “ certain kinds of radio frequency energy have been found to effect reversible neurological changes in chimpanzees . ”
Subproject 54 was studying how to produce concussions from a distance using mechanical blast waves propagated through the air .
Such a concussion “ is always followed by amnesia for the actual moment of the accident . ”
It also states : “ The blast duration would be in the order of a tenth of a second .
Masking of a noise of this duration should not be difficult .
It would be advantageous to establish the effectiveness of both of the above methods as a tool in brain - wash therapy . ”
A confidential report prepared by the US Army as early as 1969 detailed the effect an infra-sonic system would have on humans .
These effects range from disruption of nervous systems to death .
That such weapons have been used can be in little doubt .
When the deployment of Cruise missiles at American bases in the UK was at its height , women peace campaigners staged a series of highly publicized peaceful protests outside the perimeter wires .
In late 1985 , the women in the peace camps at Greenham Common began to experience unusual patterns of illness , ranging from severe headaches , drowsiness , menstrual bleeding at abnormal times or after the onset of menopause , to bouts of temporary paralysis and faulty speech coordination .
Electronics Today [ 76 ] magazine carried out a number of measurements , and in December 1985 published their report which concluded : “ Readings taken with a wide range of signal strength meters showed marked increases in the background signal level near one of the women ’s camps at a time when they claimed to be experiencing ill effects . ”
They noted that if the women created noise or a disturbance near the fence , the signals rose sharply .
The evidence in hand suggests that the technology to produce ‘ voices in the head ’ does exist .
The Department of Defense has already acquired the technology to alter consciousness through various projects and programs .
A patent discusses methods and system for altering consciousness .
The abstract from once such program states : “ Researchers have devised a variety of systems for stimulating the brain to exhibit specific brain wave rhythms and thereby alter the state of consciousness of the individual subject . ”
Silent subliminal messages [ were ] “ used throughout Operation Desert Storm ( Iraq ) quite successfully . ”
A US State Department report suggested it was possible to induce a heart attack in a person from a distance with radar .
By 1974 , Stanford Research Institute had developed a computer system capable of reading a person ’s mind by correlating the brain waves of subjects on an electroencephalograph with specific commands .
The concept of mind - reading computers is no longer science fiction .
Neither is their use by Big Brotherly governments .
Major Edward Dames of Psi-Tech said in April 1995 on NBC’s The Other Side program : “ The US government has an electronic device which could implant thoughts in people . ”
Dames would not comment any further .
The latest development in the technology of induced fear and mind control is the cloning of the human EEG or brain waves of any targeted victim , or indeed groups .
With the use of powerful computers , segments of human emotions which include anger , anxiety , sadness , fear , embarrassment , jealousy , resentment , shame , and terror , have been identified and isolated within the EEG signals as ‘ emotion signature clusters . ’
Their relevant frequencies and amplitudes have been measured .
Then the very frequency / amplitude cluster is synthesized and stored on another computer .
Each one of these negative emotions is separately tagged .
They are then placed on the Silent Sound carrier frequencies and could silently trigger the occurrence of the same basic emotion in another human being .

God may work in mysterious ways , but a simple computer program may explain how religion evolved
By distilling religious belief into a genetic predisposition to pass along unverifiable information , the program predicts that religion will flourish .
However , religion only takes hold if non-believers help believers out – perhaps because they are impressed by their devotion .
“ If a person is willing to sacrifice for an abstract god then people feel like they are willing to sacrifice for the community , ” says James Dow , an evolutionary anthropologist at Oakland University in Rochester , Michigan , US , who wrote the program – called Evogod ( download the code here ) .
Dow is by no means the first scientist to take a stab at explaining how religion emerged .
Theories on the evolution of religion tend toward two camps .
One argues that religion is a mental artefact , co-opted from brain functions that evolved for other tasks .
Advertisement
Aiding the people
Another contends that religion benefited our ancestors .
Rather than being a by - product of other brain functions , it is an adaptation in its own right .
In this explanation , natural selection slowly purged human populations of the non-religious .
“ Sometime between 100,000 years ago to the point where writing was invented , maybe about 7000 BC , we begin to have records of people ’s supernatural beliefs , ” Dow says .
To determine if it was possible for religion to emerge as an adaptation , Dow wrote a simple computer program that focuses on the evolutionary benefits people receive from their interactions with one another .
“ What people are adapting to is other people , ” he says .
Religious attraction
To simplify matters , Dow picked a defining trait of religion : the desire to proclaim religious information to others , such as a belief in the afterlife .
He assumed that this trait was genetic .
The model assumes , in other words , that a small number of people have a genetic predisposition to communicate unverifiable information to others .
They passed on that trait to their children , but they also interacted with people who did n’t spread unreal information .
The model looks at the reproductive success of the two sorts of people – those who pass on real information , and those who pass on unreal information .
Under most scenarios , “ believers in the unreal ” went extinct .
But when Dow included the assumption that non-believers would be attracted to religious people because of some clear , but arbitrary , signal , religion flourished .
“ Somehow the communicators of unreal information are attracting others to communicate real information to them , ” Dow says , speculating that perhaps the non-believers are touched by the faith of the religious .
Ancient needs
Richard Sosis , an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs , US , says the model adds a new dimension to the debate over how religion could have evolved , which has previously relied on verbal arguments and speculation .
But “ these are baby steps ” , he cautions .
Sosis previously found that in some populations – kibbutzim in Israel , for instance – more religious people receive more assistance from others than the less faithful .
But he notes that the forces that maintain religion in modern humans could be very different from those that promoted its emergence , thousands of years ago .
Palaeolithic humans were probably far more reliant than modern humans on the community they were born into , Sosis says .
“ [ Now ] you can be a Lutheran one week and decide the following week you are going to become a Buddhist . ”

Pictured : The moment George Bush ' chest bumps ' an airman
There are still eight months to go until George Bush hands over his presidency but it seems he already feels like celebrating .
After greeting US Air Force Academy cadets at a graduation ceremony in Colorado , he started horsing about with one graduate .
The president shocked onlookers when he decided to give one soldier , Theodore Shiveley from Plano , Texas , the most bizarre salute - a ' chest bump ' .
Bizarre : President Bush and graduate Theodore Shiveley get ready to bump chests at the United States Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in Colorado Springs
Bump :
The president embraces the strapping young graduate
Silver - haired Bush stretched out his arms and bounded into the strapping , uniformed soldier .

Rep. Robert Wexler , a darling of liberal blogs for his call to hold impeachment hearings for vice president Dick Cheney , has added his name to Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's push to impeach President Bush .
According to Wexler , Kucinich has outlined " numerous allegations against President Bush , including his creation of a massive propaganda campaign to mislead the nation into war with Iraq , the illegal use of torture during interrogation , the authorization of a warrantless wiretapping program on American citizens , and the repetitive use of signing statements to negate legislation passed by Congress . "
WARREN , Mich . -- Stan Sheyn , a white student who attends community college in this working - class Detroit suburb , supports Barack Obama for president .
But he has no time for what he calls " double standards and propagation of victim mentality . "
" The fact that a black man can run for the position of the President of the United States of America only corroborates that there is enough opportunity and equality for great things like that to happen , " he says .
" And that there is no need to create special advantages for any demographic ...
For most people , messages from heaven are usually accompanied by choirs of angels , spectacular miracles or at least the odd burning bush .
But one website says it will offer devout Christians a more prosaic mode of communication from the beyond - by letting them email unbelievers when the second coming takes place .
YouveBeenLeftBehind.com promises subscribers " one last opportunity to reach your lost family and friends for Christ " by automatically sending them a series of emails and documents if the rapture should occur .
For an annual fee of $ 40 ( £ 20 ) , customers are offered the chance to send these messages to their loved ones to convince them to believe in God .
The site suggests preparing messages which could prove useful to those who remain on earth , which are then fired off if the second coming of Jesus happens .
According to the website , such a biblical event would mean that " there will be a small window of time where they [ non- believers ] might be reached for the kingdom of God " .
The website , which is based in Massachusetts , is run by a small team of Christians who must log on every day to indicate that the rapture has not yet taken place .
If enough of them fail to log in , however , the system assumes that the second coming is nigh and sends out messages from all its subscribers .
" The people on my team are Christians who expect to be raptured , " Mark Heard , the site 's creator , told the Guardian .
" They must continually log in to the system .
The team is spread out as far apart in the US as is possible to prevent against more than one member being taken out by , attack , natural disaster , or epidemic . "
Heard told the Guardian the subscription fee was only intended to cover his initial investment but he hoped he would be able to cut the price - or even provide it for free - as more people signed up .
Also known as " Wizard Staff " this is a fairly new drinking game that always results in the mass consumption of canned beverages .
Requirements :
At least two participants ( you can play by yourself but then you are an alcoholic ) but the more the better , as much canned beer / beverages as you think all participants will drink ( trust me , you do n't want to have to get more later ) , at least one roll of duct tape , at least one ( but preferably multiple ) type of hard alcohol , one shot glass for each player .
Bonus points if wizardesque clothing is worn !
Rules :
At the beginning of the game , players decide on any special rules , including at which point a boss must be fought .
Boss fighting will be discussed later but generally it happens every 3rd or 5th level .
See the " Special Rules " section for further explanation .
As well , if a prize is to be played for , it should be presented or decided on before play begins .
After rules are decided and agreed upon ( might be a good idea to write them down in case any late comers come in ) , all players open their first beverage .
When a player has finished his or her first beverage they are now a " Level 1 Wizard " .
This is important since you can only call yourself a " Level X Wizard " when you have finished X number of beers .
They must then " Level Up " by retrieving a full beverage , placing it on top of the now empty can , and securely taping the two together .
FYI one or two good wraps of duct tape where the cans meet is usually sufficient , you do n't want to over do it or you 'll run out .
Game play continues in this manner , leveling up after finishing each beverage until the pre-determined " boss fighting " level has been reached .
Boss Fighting :
This occurs once you are have finished your 5th beer , assuming you chose to fight a boss every 5th level ( 3rd beer for every 3rd , etc . .. ) .
You cannot " Level Up " to a " Level 5 Wizard " ( or whatever you chose ) until you have fought a boss .
This is done by choosing a hard liquor to take a shot of .
Your choice is now called " Boss ' name of liquor ' " i.e. : Jose Cuervo becomes either " Boss Jose " or " Boss Cuervo " .
Ideally , at least one other player will need to fight the boss with you , and it is considered acceptable to wait for them to finish a level to " fight " with you .
As well , other players are encouraged to assist you in your " battle " with the boss , however doing so will not exempt them from fighting another boss when they reach the " boss fighting level " .
All players involved in the " battle " must pour a full shot of chosen liquor and then cheers and take it together .
Once all shots are gone , the boss in considered defeated and all players needing to level up may now do so .
Again , it 's important to note that the boss comes at the end of the level ; players " Leveling up " to Level 5 ( or 3 ) will be getting their 6th ( or 4th ) beverage , and will retain " Level 5 Wizard " ( or 3 ) status until they have finished it .
No boss should be repeated until players have done battle with all available bosses .
Mini-Games : Players may choose to play other drinking games while playing Wisest Wizard .
This is acceptable and encouraged !
However , the rules as to how many levels can be obtained by winning a game should be decided on in advance to avoid confrontations later on .
Our favorite is " Wizard Chess " better know to the layman as Beirut or Beer Pong .
No changes to the game are made , however the winners of each game are awarded two levels ( in the form of empty cans ) each to add to their staffs .
Losers get nothing as they lost the match .
Any other game may be played as long as the levels to be awarded at the end are pre-determined .
Simple games such as Jacks and Fives do not need any additional levels to be awarded as drinking will commence in a usual manner .
Special Rules :
As stated above , additional rules can be submitted at the beginning of the game to further enhance game play .
All special rules and subsequent penalties for breaking the rule must be agreed upon by all players who are present at the beginning in order to be official .
Any players arriving later in the game are automatically subjected to them .
Examples of special rules are :- Appropriate Wizard Lingo must be used whenever possible :- " I 'm feeling drunk " = " I 'm feeling wise " - " I need another beer " = " I need to Level Up " - " Let 's play Beirut " =
" Let 's play some Wizard Chess " and so and so forth . - Current " Wisest Wizard " gets to create a rule upon " Leveling up " .
These rules are similar to rules from King 's Cup and can either be permanent or last until he ( or the new wisest wizard ) levels up .
Generally it 's a good idea to set a starting point for this rule to come into effect , such as level 10 or 12 , to avoid too many rules being created .
Winning :
In the end , everyone wins thanks to the copious amount of beverages that end up being consumed .
However , the person who achieves the highest level is eligible to win a prize that was determined at the beginning of the game .
This can either be by the end of the night / next morning or at a pre-determined time , depending on what works better for the game .
On June 2 , the National Aeronautical and Space Administration ( NASA ) Office of the Inspector General released the results of an investigation into allegations that James Hansen , Columbia University climatologist and NASA scientist with the Goddard Institute for Space Sciences ( GISS ) , had been censored by the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs .
The results were a vindication of Hansen and his various supporters who ’d claimed that he ’d been censored in his access to the media by NASA political appointees .
But the report ( “ Investigative Summary Regarding Allegations that NASA Suppressed Climate Change Science and Denied Media Access to Dr. James E. Hansen , a NASA Scientist ” ) did not find any evidence that the censorship extended beyond the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs or that the censorship had included Hansen ’s research in any way .
According to the Space Act of 1958 , NASA has a legal requirement that information about its activities and research be made public :
Of particular relevance to our investigation is section 203 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the Space Act , which directs NASA “ to provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof . ” ( original emphasis )
And the Inspector General found that in this particular case , this statutory requirement was n’t met according to the preponderance of evidence :
[ W]e cannot envision a circumstance in which the Space Actâ€™s language or intent would permit , as “ appropriate , ” circumstances where Agency Public Affairs officials purposely deny , delay , tone down , or subordinate to lesser media the presentation of federally funded scientific research to the public , and in which the public clearly has a substantial interest , because they believed it to be inconsistent with Administration policies or priorities , which is what is reasonably reflected by the evidence … .
We do not believe , however , that the Agencyâ€™s statutory mandate or regulatory commitments , with specific reference to its public affairs functions , allow for the intentional distortion of information or science in press releases the Agencyâ€ ” in its exercise of discretionâ € ” has elected to issue .
Likewise , purposefully withholding or delaying meritorious releases to ostensibly meet political objectives would also appear to stretch the mandate to provide “ the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and results thereof . ”
The report found that the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs standard operating procedure during the period that the censorship occurred went basically like this : the scientist submits his press release to his local NASA PR offfice who work with the scientist to make it ’s accurate and easily understood by the general public , a draft is sent to a subject expert in the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs who then reverifies the accuracy of the information and , if it ’s not accurate , works via the local NASA PR office to clear up any problems , and once any issues are cleared up , the press release is scrubbed for style and released .
However , the report found that it did n’t always work this way :
Public Affairs Officers and scientists employed in the fields of Earth science and astrophysics told our investigators that the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs did not , on a consistent basis , apply the same Standard Operating Procedure for news releases , media advisories , news features , Internet postings , and media interviewsâ€ ” especially when it came to information that might be politically sensitive , such as climate change .
Further , many of themâ € ” to include career Public Affairs Officersâ€ ” characterized the news release approval process as “ arbitrary ” and questioned whether the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs was choosing to ignore its own Standard Operating Procedure .
Some NASA scientists said that they even questioned the existence of an Office of Public Affairs Standard Operating Procedure , based on their ignored requests ( to Public Affairs ) for documentation of their internal policies … .
According to present and former career Public Affairs Officers at NASA Headquarters and Field Centers that we interviewed ,31 the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs processed all media products that discussed “ climate change ” ( or a variant thereof ) in a unique manner during the pre-election period of the fall of 2004 through the spring of 2006 .
Describing the review process for climate change media products as extremely onerous , stressful , and heavy handed , it was their collective belief that there was an “ air of political interference ” and a desire by the political appointees in the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs to support the Administration by reducing the amount or toning down the impact of climate change research disseminated to the public .
Career employees described to us a Headquarters Office of Public Affairs environment where “ looking good ” was the preeminent motivator of their political appointee superiors and coworkers ( rather than following a process with regard to their statutorily required research dissemination ) .
According to the report , the political appointee most responsible for blocking Hansen ’s access to the press was former Deputy Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs and Emmy award - winning journalist Dean Acosta .
Almost all the career NASA Headquarters Public Affairs Officers told us that during 2004 through early 2006 , it was “ generally understood ” that all “ climate change ” media text products were to be personally hand - carried to Mr. Acosta for review … .
One witness , a former Headquarters Public Affairs Officer , informed our investigators that in October 2004 , Mr. Acosta told him / her about his ( Mr. Acostaâ€™s ) concern that there were â€œtoo manyâ€ climate - related news releases being submitted for approval and that the Earth Science Mission Directorate Public Affairs
Office needed to do a better job of â€œpreventingâ€  the development of climate - related and especially climate change news releases .
Again , we found no direct evidence of affirmative actions by NASA personnel that were in furtherance of Mr. Acostaâ€™s remarks .
We did , however , discover records that were gathered in support of NASAâ€™s management review of alleged scientific suppression in 2006,33 that reflected a subsequent reduction in climate - related news releases , from 48 in 2004 to 12 in 2005 … .
The scientists we interviewed claimed these delays and conversions were “ politically motivated ” as they lessened the impact of the story because the lack of timeliness and the forums chosen for dissemination resulted in the media outlets being less likely to pick up the stories .
Mr. Acosta denies all this , stating that any delays were necessary due to the extensive editing required to create a product that the general public could understand .
The NASA Field Center Public Affairs Officers and scientists that we interviewed deny the assertion that the releases needed extensive editing ….
As a writer and journalist , I take great personal pride in the compliments I get from people about my ability to distill complex scientific and technological subjects down to language that non-specialists can understand .
It takes effort and practice , but it ’s not terribly difficult for me , and I ’m not even trained in the art of writing or editing specifically for a non-scientific audience , as Mr. Acosta or his various subordinates almost certainly are .
As such , the claims of the career NASA Field Center Public Affairs Officers that releases did not need extensive editing are , in my opinion and that of the NASA Inspector General , far more credible than Mr. Acosta’s .
But while the report finds that Mr. Acosta , and to a lesser extent his former boss and current Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs , David R. Mould , were responsible for suppressing global warming science and Hansen ’s contact with the press , James Hansen himself is n’t entirely off the hook either .
The report found that , following his speech before the 2005 American Geophysical Union Conference , Hansen failed to follow official NASA procedures by alerting the Office of Public Affairs about some of his press contacts , and several articles were printed or interviews aired before Acosta could be notified .
This led , according to the report , to Mould and Acosta contacting the GISS and demanding that all GISS employee interviews had to be approved by the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs .
As someone who has worked for private industry for my entire career to date , I can reasonably confidently state that , if Hansen had worked for any one of the companies I ’ve worked for , he ’d have been severely disciplined or fired instead of being merely reined in by the PR people for going around them .
Hansen ’s behavior may have been tolerated by the GISS because he ’s an academic , a respected scientist , and a government employee , but no corporation would have done so .
That being said , however , the greatest interference ( arguably ) that occurred was this :
During the teleconference , according to the Public Affairs Coordinator , Messrs .
Mould and Acosta verbally directed the Coordinator that , unlike previous practice , all Goddard Institute for Space Studiesâ€™ postings to its
Web site must be approved by senior Science Mission Directorate officials and the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs .
This was a departure from previous policy insomuch as this level of approval included the Web posting of scientific journals , data releases , science briefs , and news features … .
The Headquarters Office of Public Affairs has authority only over press contacts – it has no authority over access to scientific publications or Web content intended for a scientific audience .
And so this new policy instituted on verbal order was unprecedented , and almost definitionally an attempt to censor the data released from Hansen and the GISS .
And that ’s when things got really messy .
On December 16 , 2005 , the Chief of the Goddard Space Flight Center Office of Public Affairs , was telephonically contacted by Messrs .
Mould and Acosta .
The Chief advised us that Mr. Acosta told him / her that the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs ’ policy concerning a “ heads - up ” on media inquiries had changed and that the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs now wanted to know everything that Dr. Hansen was doing ….
As a result , the Chief felt Dr. Hansen was being “ singled out ” by the Headquarters Office of Public Affairs , which prompted him to send an e-mail to Dr. Hansenâ€™s supervisors notifying them of the Headquarters Office of Public Affairsâ€™ desire that the Goddard Space Flight Center Office of Public Affairs monitor Dr. Hansenâ € ” and that the Chief did not think that was their job .
On December 20 , 2005 , the Chief of the Goddard Space Flight Center Office of Public Affairs sent an e-mail to Messrs .
Acosta and Mould memorializing the directions given during the teleconference in an attempt to get written confirmation of these directives .
Neither Mr. Acosta nor Mr. Mould replied to the e-mail .
Both later claimed to NASA leadership and congressional staff that they never received it .
Congressional staff informed our investigators that Messrs .
Mould and Acosta denied that the contents of the e-mail accurately reflected what was discussed and that the teleconference with the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Public Affairs Coordinator was not an initiation of a monitoring effort but was only a reiteration of the “ heads - up ” policy already in place .
In contradiction to this denial , the three Headquarters Office of Public Affairs officials who were party to the December 15 , 2005 , teleconference all concurred that the contents of the e-mail message both accurately summarized the directions given during the teleconference and the way that the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs worked .
Our investigation confirmed that that e-mail from the Chief of the Goddard Space Flight Center Office of Public Affairs was , in fact , drafted , sent , and received by others who were on the same distribution list as Messrs .
Acosta and Mould .
Further , a forensic examination of electronic data obtained from Mr. Acostaâ€™s NASA - issued computer revealed that the e-mail had been successfully delivered to Mr. Acostaâ€™s e-mail address and it had been saved to his hard drive as a normal function of e-mail retrieval from the server .
The examination of available data further showed that he ( or someone operating his equipment ) had received and reviewed the e-mail on his Blackberry device , and then forwarded it to another Headquarters Office of Public Affairs staff member for advice , who , in turn , responded to him via e-mail correspondence .
Note that this means Acosta lied under oath to Congress .
And so , while this report was not a criminal investigation , it may still have uncovered evidence of perjury .
And in case that ’s not enough evidence for you , here ’s yet more , in this case evidence that Mould and Acosta threw an underling under the bus to save themselves :
Of interest , the Agencyâ€™s position is that Mr. Deutsch was the Headquarters Office of Public Affairsâ€™ representative who denied National Public Radioâ€™s request to interview Dr. Hansen .
To a degree , that is true .
According to Mr. Deutsch , however , this denial was based on the direction given to him by his supervisor , Mr. Acosta , which we believe is credible .
Mr. Acosta denies giving such direction and , indeed , NASA appears to have adopted the position that Mr. Deutsch ( as a 24 - year - old GS - 9 in his first job in Government ) acted independently when making the decision to deny National Public Radioâ€™s request … .
Particularly troublesome to us is that when the denial of the National Public Radio interview became controversial , Mr. Deutschâ€™s leadership distanced themselves from him on this issue by not taking responsibility for any actions taken in connection with the interview denial .
Instead , Messrs .
Mould and Acosta intimated that Mr. Deutsch had acted alone in denying the request from National Public Radio , when , in fact , Mr. Deutsch was simply carrying out their orders or intent .
While the report found that there had been manipulations of Hansen ’s access to the press , it did not find that there had been any such manipulations of his access to scientific journals , nor was there any such pattern within NASA at all :
In the course of our investigation , we neither received nor discovered any complaints or concerns regarding the operating procedures or implementation of those procedures used for NASAâ€™s release of scientific and technical reports .
Further , the NASA Office of Inspector Generalâ€™s Office of Audits corroborated our observations in a recent audit , noted earlier , which found no evidence that the STI review process was used to inappropriately suppress the release of scientific data .
Again , of the 287 authors surveyed at the four Field Centers reviewed , none indicated that they had personally experienced or knew of anyone else who had experienced actual or perceived suppression of their research .
Further , a published review conducted by the Government Accountability Office estimated that 91 percent of NASA researchers believe that the Agency supports dissemination of research results through publications .
( original emphasis )
And the report also found no evidence that there had been an attempt to suppress Hansen ’s research via budget cuts :
We found no credible evidence that the Agency had used the budget as form of scientific suppression .
While the overall budget for the Science Mission Directorateâ€™s Earth Science Division declined , the decline was associated with the Agencyâ€™s decision to retire the Space Shuttle by 2010 , complete the International Space Station , and transition to the next - generation space vehicle in furtherance of the Presidentâ€™s Vision for Space Exploration .
In addition , the Inspector General found no evidence that , although reports were provided to the White House Press Office in advance of publication , there was any White House “ approval ” of the press releases :
[ O ] ur investigation found no direct evidence that non-NASA officials serving within the Administration were editing / approving the release of climate change media products .
We did , however , find evidence that the NASA Office of Public Affairs routinely notified Administration officials of newsworthy events and , in one case , appeared to be coordinating with Administration officials with respect to the timing of a climate - related press conference and news release … .
[ O ] ur investigation found that at least one climate change news release , â€ œAura Sheds New Light on Pollution , â€ was intentionally delayed by NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs until after the election .
We could not , however , substantiate other allegations of over â€œmonth long delaysâ€ in getting releases approved or released during the pre-election period .
So , where does this go now ?
The report is not intended to be the results of a criminal investigation , even though the investigation discovered possible criminal activity in at least one case ( perjury before Congress ) and possibly others .
But the fact that Acosta is so pointedly identified as the primary player ( with Mould as secondary ) ca n’t do his two recent employers , first DC - based PR firm Qorvis Communications and now Chicago - based Boeing , any favors .
There is still a stink of ego - driven “ he said , he said ” conflict here , but the preponderance of evidence points to the conclusion that the NASA Headquarters Office of Press Affairs did interfere with climate scientists , and especially James Hansen ’s , access to teh press for a period of time .
According to federal law , that ’s certainly against regulations and may , or may not , be criminal .
Regardless , though , NASA ’s Office of the Inspector General found that there was undue interference by political appointees on the public ’s access to scientific information , and that alone will give yet more ammunition to those who continue to claim such interference has been widespread during the Presidency of Bush II .
There is one piece of good news , though – the research and reporting of results in scientific journals was not distorted , largely because the NASA Headquarters Office of Press Affairs lacked the organizational authority to do so .
But we should make sure that , in other instances and organizations where the press office has authority over the science reporting , distortions have not occurred .

Everyone is born with one , but no one knows what it ’s for .
The human appendix is a small dead - end tube connected to the cecum , or ascending colon , one section of the large intestine .
Everyone lives happily with it until it becomes painfully inflamed , when the only treatment is to remove it surgically .
Then everyone lives happily without it .
So why is it there in the first place ?
Some experts have guessed that it is a vestige of the evolutionary development of some other organ , but there is little evidence for an appendix in our evolutionary ancestors .
Few mammals have any appendix at all , and the appendices of those that do bears little resemblance to the human one .
Last December , researchers published a novel explanation in The Journal of Theoretical Biology .
The appendix , they suggest , is a “ safe house ” for commensal bacteria , the symbiotic germs that aid digestion and help protect against disease - causing germs .
Structurally , the appendix is isolated from the rest of the gut , with an opening smaller than a pencil lead , protected from the fecal stream that might be carrying pathogens .
In times of trouble like a diarrheal infection that flushes the system , these commensal bacteria could hide out there , ready to repopulate the gut when the coast is clear .
It 's no secret the Recording Industry Association of America has sued more than 20,000 people on accusations of unlawfully sharing copyrighted music on peer - to - peer networks .
The lawsuits are generally the same .
Investigators for the RIAA usually go onto Kazaa , take screenshots and download some files of music .
The RIAA sues .
But then there 's the case of a New York family accused of copyright infringement .
The case , defended by Ray Beckerman , an outspoken critic of the RIAA and the publisher of the blog – Recording Industry v. The People – was awaiting a decision for about a year from a federal judge on whether the case should be dismissed .
Beckerman argued that merely making copyrighted music available on peer - to - peer networks was not infringement , an argument bolstered by recent opinions in other jurisdictions – but a viewpoint shared by only a handful of judges .
Beckerman 's argument was that if the RIAA can't prove anybody downloaded the music from an open share folder , then the case would have to be dismissed .
The RIAA takes the opposite angle , and even claims the downloads from its investigators count against the defendant , a viewpoint shared by an Arizona judge .
A hearing in Beckerman 's case was set for next week .
Yet out of the blue , Beckerman was notified Wednesday that the RIAA voluntarily dismissed the case weeks before – with the " making available " motion - to - dismiss still pending .
For the moment , it seemed like one of the few defense victories in the RIAA 's war on file sharing .
But Beckerman got a call Thursday from the RIAA , informing him the case was refiled .
The RIAA had n't mentioned to the federal court it was the same lawsuit .
So it was assigned to another judge .
The RIAA demanded immediate discovery , such as depositions and hard drives , in a bid to get to the bottom of who pilfered its music .
The original judge in the case blocked discovery , pending a ruling on the " making available " dismissal motion .
" These people are psychos , " Beckerman said in an interview .
Also , the case was captioned under the name Does , meaning the RIAA was somehow pretending it did n't know the family 's name allegedly behind the IP address in question .
" This case , it 's the exact same internet access account , " he said .
" It ’s the very same act of copyright infringement charged .
It 's no different . "
The RIAA did not immediately respond for comment .
Beckerman has penned letters to both judges alerting them to the switcheroo .
" They 're trying to force a settlement and frightening people , " Beckerman said in the interview .
" That 's the only point of this . "

Valerie Jarrett , a senior adviser to Obama 's presidential campaign and a member of his finance committee .
Jarrett is the chief executive of Habitat Co. , which managed Grove Parc Plaza from 2001 until this winter and co-managed an even larger subsidized complex in Chicago that was seized by the federal government in 2006 , after city inspectors found widespread problems .
The campaign did not respond to questions about whether Obama was aware of the problems with buildings in his district during his time as a state senator , nor did it comment on the roles played by people connected to the senator .
Obama 's campaign , in a written response to Globe questions , affirmed the candidate 's support of public - private partnerships as an alternative to public housing , saying that Obama has " consistently fought to make livable , affordable housing in mixed - income neighborhoods available to all . "
" No one should have to live like this , and no one did anything about it , " said Cynthia Ashley , who has lived at Grove Parc since 1994 .
Some of the residents of Grove Parc say they are angry that Obama did not notice their plight .
The development straddles the boundary of Obama 's state Senate district .
Many of the tenants have been his constituents for more than a decade .
Grove Parc and several other prominent failures were developed and managed by Obama 's close friends and political supporters .
Those people profited from the subsidies even as many of Obama 's constituents suffered .
Tenants lost their homes ; surrounding neighborhoods were blighted .
But a Globe review found that thousands of apartments across Chicago that had been built with local , state , and federal subsidies - including several hundred in Obama 's former district - deteriorated so completely that they were no longer habitable .
As a state senator , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee coauthored an Illinois law creating a new pool of tax credits for developers .
As a US senator , he pressed for increased federal subsidies .
And as a presidential candidate , he has campaigned on a promise to create an Affordable Housing Trust Fund that could give developers an estimated $ 500 million a year .
Grove Parc has become a symbol for some in Chicago of the broader failures of giving public subsidies to private companies to build and manage affordable housing - an approach strongly backed by Obama as the best replacement for public housing .
About 99 of the units are vacant , many rendered uninhabitable by unfixed problems , such as collapsed roofs and fire damage .
Mice scamper through the halls .
Battered mailboxes hang open .
Sewage backs up into kitchen sinks .
In 2006 , federal inspectors graded the condition of the complex an 11 on a 100 - point scale - a score so bad the buildings now face demolition .
CHICAGO - The squat brick buildings of Grove Parc Plaza , in a dense neighborhood that Barack Obama represented for eight years as a state senator , hold 504 apartments subsidized by the federal government for people who can't afford to live anywhere else .
Similar problems plagued public housing in other cities , leading the federal government to greatly increase funding to address the problems .
Many cities , including Boston , mostly used that money to rehabilitate their projects , maintaining public control .
In Stateway Gardens , a large complex just north of Robert Taylor , a study of 1990 census data found the per-capita annual income was $ 1,650 .
And the projects were falling apart after decades of epic , sometimes criminal , mismanagement .
By the late 1980s , however , Robert Taylor Homes and the rest of the Chicago developments had become American bywords for urban misery .
The roughly 30 developments operated for poor families by the Chicago Housing Authority were plagued by crime and mired in poverty .
In the middle of the 20th century , Chicago built some of the nation 's largest public housing developments , culminating in Robert Taylor Homes : 4,415 apartments in 28 high - rise buildings stretching for 2 miles along an interstate highway .
" Government is just not as good at owning and managing as the private sector because the incentives are not there , " said Jarrett , whose company manages more than 23,000 apartments .
" I would argue that someone living in a poor neighborhood that is n't 100 percent public housing is by definition better off . "
Jarrett , a powerful figure in the Chicago development community , agreed to be interviewed but declined to answer questions about Grove Parc , citing what she called a continuing duty to Habitat 's former business partners .
She did , however , defend Obama 's position that public - private partnerships are superior to public housing .
Butler and Davis did not respond to messages .
Rezko is in prison ; his lawyer did not respond to inquiries .
One of those contributors , Cecil Butler , controlled Lawndale Restoration , the largest subsidized complex in Chicago , which was seized by the government in 2006 after city inspectors found more than 1,800 code violations .
Campaign finance records show that six prominent developers - including Jarrett , Davis , and Rezko - collectively contributed more than $ 175,000 to Obama 's campaigns over the last decade and raised hundreds of thousands more from other donors .
Rezko alone raised at least $ 200,000 , by Obama 's own accounting .
Antoin " Tony " Rezko , perhaps the most important fund - raiser for Obama 's early political campaigns and a friend who helped the Obamas buy a home in 2005 .
Rezko 's company used subsidies to rehabilitate more than 1,000 apartments , mostly in and around Obama 's district , then refused to manage the units , leaving the buildings to decay to the point where many no longer were habitable .
Allison Davis , a major fund - raiser for Obama 's US Senate campaign and a former lead partner at Obama 's former law firm .
Davis , a developer , was involved in the creation of Grove Parc and has used government subsidies to rehabilitate more than 1,500 units in Chicago , including a North Side building cited by city inspectors last year after chronic plumbing failures resulted in raw sewage spilling into several apartments .
Shortly after becoming a state senator in 1997 , Obama told the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin that his experience working with the development industry had reinforced his belief in subsidizing private developers of affordable housing .
Obama sometimes worked on their cases .
In at least one instance , he represented the nonprofit company that owned Grove Parc , Woodlawn Preservation and Investment Corp. , when it was sued by the city for failing to adequately heat one of its apartment complexes .
The firm represented a number of nonprofit companies that were partnering with private developers to build affordable housing with government subsidies .
He once told the Chicago Tribune that he had briefly considered becoming a developer of affordable housing .
But after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1991 , he turned down a job with Tony Rezko 's development company , Rezmar , choosing instead to work at the civil rights law firm Davis , Miner , Barnhill & Galland , then led by Allison Davis .
He had seen the failure of the public projects in the mid-1980s as a community organizer at Altgeld Gardens , a large public housing complex on the far South Side .
Barack Obama was among the many Chicago residents who shared Daley 's conviction that private companies would make better landlords than the Chicago Housing Authority .
" The same exact people who ran these places into the ground , " the private companies paid to build and manage the city 's affordable housing , " now are profiting by redeveloping them . "
" They are rapidly displacing poor people , and these companies are profiting from this displacement , " said Matt Ginsberg - Jaeckle of Southside Together Organizing for Power , a community group that seeks to help tenants stay in the same neighborhoods .
Most of all , they alleged that Chicago was interested primarily in redeveloping projects close to the Loop , the downtown area that was seeing a surge of private development activity , shunting poor families to neighborhoods farther from the city center .
Only about one in three residents was able to return to the redeveloped projects .
Chicago 's plans drew critics from the start .
They asked why the government should pay developers to perform a basic public service - one successfully performed by governments in other cities .
And they noted that privately managed projects had a history of deteriorating because guaranteed government rent subsidies left companies with little incentive to spend money on maintenance .
The city also hired private companies to manage the remaining public housing .
And it subsidized private companies to create and manage new affordable housing , some of which was used to accommodate tenants displaced from public housing .
Chicago chose a more dramatic approach .
Under Mayor Richard M. Daley , who was elected in 1989 , the city launched a massive plan to let private companies tear down the projects and build mixed - income communities on the same land .
The owner , a local nonprofit company called Woodlawn Preservation and Investment Corp. , was led by two of the neighborhood 's most powerful ministers , Arthur Brazier and Leon Finney .
Obama had relationships with both men .
In 1999 , he donated $ 500 of his campaign funds to another of their community groups , The Woodlawn Organization .
Grove Parc Plaza opened there in 1990 as a redevelopment of an older housing complex .
The buildings had a new owner and a major renovation funded by the federal government .
Even the name Grove Parc Plaza was new .
One of the earliest public - private partnerships of the type supported by Daley and Obama took place in the Woodlawn neighborhood , a checkerboard of battered apartment buildings and vacant lots just south of the University of Chicago .
" I will restore the federal government 's commitment to low - income housing , " Obama wrote last September in a letter to the Granite State Organizing Project , an umbrella group for several dozen New Hampshire religious , community , and political organizations .
He added , " Our nation 's low - income families are facing an affordable housing crisis , and it is our responsibility to ensure this crisis does not get worse by ineffective replacement of existing public - housing units . "
Obama has continued to support increased subsidies as a presidential candidate , calling for the creation of an Affordable Housing Trust Fund , which could distribute an estimated $ 500 million a year to developers .
The money would be siphoned from the profits of two mortgage companies created and supervised by the federal government , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The developers gave Obama their financial support .
Jarrett , Davis , and Rezko all served on Obama 's campaign finance committee when he won a seat in the US Senate in 2004 .
" He was very passionate about the issues , " said Julie Dworkin of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless , who worked with Obama on affordable housing issues .
" He was someone we could go to and count on him to be there . "
Obama also cosponsored the original version of a bill creating an annual fund to subsidize rents for extremely low - income tenants , although it did not pass until 2005 , after he had left the state Senate .
Obama translated that belief into legislative action as a state senator .
In 2001 , Obama and a Republican colleague , William Peterson , sponsored a successful bill that increased state subsidies for private developers .
The law let developers designated by the state raise up to $ 26 million a year by selling tax credits to Illinois residents .
For each $ 1 in credits purchased , the buyer was allowed to decrease his taxable income by 50 cents .
" That 's an example of a smart policy , " the paper quoted Obama as saying .
" The developers were thinking in market terms and operating under the rules of the marketplace ; but at the same time , we had government supporting and subsidizing those efforts . "
One of the largest recipients of the subsidies was Rezmar Corp. , founded in 1989 by Tony Rezko , who ran a company that sold snacks at city beaches , and Daniel Mahru , who ran a company that sold ice to Rezko .
Neither man had development experience .
Similar problems also plagued the next generation of affordable housing de velopment in Obama 's district , created as part of the Daley administration 's efforts to subsidize smaller apartment buildings scattered throughout neighborhoods .
" Grove Parc is quite an exception to what we 've normally done because it's in such bad shape , " said the nonprofit 's chief executive , Amy Anthony .
" These complexes are often tired , they 're always denser than today 's philosophy , but they 're not usually anywhere near as deteriorated . "
But other Chicago developers and housing activists say federal subsidies can be adequate if managed properly .
They say Grove Parc stands apart for how badly it fell into disrepair .
Officials at Woodlawn Preservation say the government did n't give them enough money to properly maintain Grove Parc .
Habitat 's Jarrett declined to comment on Grove Parc in particular but said it is hard to manage something you do n't own .
After negotiations with tenants , the government agreed to allow a new company , Preservation of Affordable Housing , a Boston - based firm , to replace Habitat as the manager of Grove Parc .
The company is negotiating to buy the development , which would then be demolished and replaced with new housing .
When inspectors returned in 2005 , they found conditions were significantly worse .
Inspectors gave the complex a score of 56 and warned that improvements were necessary .
They returned the following year and found things had reached a new low .
Grove Parc got a score of 11 and a final warning .
Three months later , inspectors found there had been insufficient improvements and moved to seize the complex from Woodlawn Preservation .
Residents say the complex deteriorated under Moorehead 's management and continued to decline after Habitat took over .
A maintenance worker at the complex says money often was n't even available for steel wool to plug rat holes .
But as late as 2003 , a routine federal inspection still gave conditions at Grove Parc a score of 82 on a 100 - point scale .
Woodlawn Preservation hired a new property manager , Habitat Co .
At the time , the company was headed by its founder , Daniel Levin , also a major contributor to Obama 's campaigns .
Valerie Jarrett was executive vice president .
Woodlawn Preservation hired a private management firm , William Moorehead and Associates , to oversee the complex .
In 2001 , the company lost that contract and a contract to manage several public housing projects for allegedly failing to do its job .
The company 's head , William Moorehead , was subsequently convicted of embezzling almost $ 1 million in management fees .
The fund found the buildings in terrible condition .
In a 2001 plea to the state to temporarily suspend payments on its mortgages , a fund executive wrote that heating problems , lapsed maintenance , and uncollected rent made the buildings almost impossible to manage .
Responsibility for several buildings fell to the Chicago Equity Fund , which had purchased government tax credits from Rezmar to help finance the projects .
After Rezko walked away , the fund was obliged to maintain the buildings as affordable housing .
If it did not , it would have to repay the government for the tax credits .
" Affordable housing run by private companies just does n't work , " Mahru , who no longer works with Rezko , said in an interview with the Globe .
" It 's difficult , if not impossible , for a private company to maintain affordable housing for low - income tenants . "
Shortly thereafter , Rezmar switched from subsidized housing to high - end development , fueled by the money it had made in subsidized work .
Rezko 's companies also stopped managing the subsidized complexes .
By the time Rezmar asked Chicago 's city government for a loan on its final subsidized development , in 1998 , the city 's housing commissioner was describing the company in a memo as being in " bad shape . "
The Daley administration still made the $ 3.1 million loan .
" You could hear them under the floor and in the walls , and they did n't do nothing about it , " Jones said .
Sharee Jones , who lives in another former Rezko building one block away , said her apartment was rat - infested for years .
" In the winter I can feel the cold air coming through the walls and the sockets , " said Anthony Frizzell , 57 , who has lived for almost two decades in a Rezmar building on South Greenwood Avenue .
" They did n't insulate it or nothing . "
People who lived in some of the Rezmar buildings say trash was not picked up and maintenance problems were ignored .
Roofs leaked , windows whistled , insects moved in .
By the time Obama entered the state Senate in 1997 , the buildings were beginning to deteriorate .
In January 1997 , the city sued Rezmar for failing to provide adequate heat in a South Side building in the middle of an unusually cold winter .
It was one of more than two dozen housing - complaint suits filed by the city against Rezmar for violations at its properties .
Rezmar collected millions in development fees but fell behind on mortgage payments almost immediately .
On its first project , the city government agreed to reduce the company 's monthly payments from almost $ 3,000 to less than $ 500 .
Over the next nine years , Rezmar used more than $ 87 million in government grants , loans , and tax credits to renovate about 1,000 apartments in 30 Chicago buildings .
Companies run by the partners also managed many of the buildings , collecting government rent subsidies .
Over roughly the past decade , Davis 's companies have received more than $ 100 million in subsidies to renovate and build more than 1,500 apartments in Chicago , according to a Chicago Sun - Times tally .
In several cases , Davis partnered with Tony Rezko .
In 1998 the two men created a limited partnership to build an apartment building for seniors on Chicago 's South Side .
Obama wrote letters on state Senate stationery supporting city and state loans for the project .
Allison Davis , Obama 's former law firm boss , dabbled in development for years while he worked primarily as a lawyer .
He participated in the development of Grove Parc Plaza .
And in 1996 , Davis left his law firm to pursue a full - time career as an affordable housing developer , fueled by the subsidies from the Daley administration and aided , on occasion , by Obama himself .
Preckwinkle , who will be an Obama delegate at the Democratic National Convention , said she would not answer any questions about Obama 's role in her district , nor his relationship with Rezko .
" I did n't see him nor have anything to do with him after that , " she said .
But in the early 2000s , she called Rezko to ask for an explanation for the declining conditions .
He told her Rezmar was " getting out of the business , " she said - walking away from its responsibility for managing the developments .
She had previously received campaign contributions from Rezmar and said she had regarded the company as a model , one of the city 's best affordable housing developers .
" I started getting complaints from police officers about particular properties that turned out to be Rezko properties , " said Toni Preckwinkle , a Chicago alderman .
After Rezko's assistance in Obama 's home purchase became a campaign issue , at a time when the developer was awaiting trial in an unrelated bribery case , Obama told the Chicago Sun-Times that the deterioration of Rezmar 's buildings never came to his attention .
He said he would have distanced himself from Rezko if he had known .
But Obama has contended that he knew nothing about any problems in Rezmar 's buildings .
Eleven of Rezmar 's buildings were located in the district represented by Obama , containing 258 apartments .
The building without heat in January 1997 , the month Obama entered the state Senate , was in his district .
So was Jones 's building with rats in the walls and Frizzell 's building that lacked insulation .
And a redistricting after the 2000 Census added another 350 Rezmar apartments to the area represented by Obama .
As Obama ascended , Rezko became one of his largest fund - raisers .
And in 2005 , Rezko and his wife helped the Obamas purchase the house where they now live .
All the while , Tony Rezko was forging a close friendship with Barack Obama .
When Obama opened his campaign for state Senate in 1995 , Rezko 's companies gave Obama $ 2,000 on the first day of fund - raising .
Save for a $ 500 contribution from another lawyer , Obama did n't raise another penny for six weeks .
Rezko had essentially seeded the start of Obama 's political career .
Most of the buildings have since been foreclosed upon , forcing the tenants to find new housing .
Nonetheless , the buildings deteriorated badly .
The problems came to public attention in a dramatic way in 2004 , after a sport utility vehicle driven by a suburban woman trying to buy drugs struck one of the buildings , causing it to collapse .
City inspectors arrived in the ensuing glare , finding a long list of code violations , leading city officials to urge the federal government to seize the complex .
Lawndale Restoration was created in the early 1980s , when the federal government helped Butler take control of a group of old buildings , including lending $ 22 million to his company to redevelop the buildings and agreeing to subsidize tenant rents .
In 1995 , Butler 's company got a $ 51 million loan from the state to fund additional renovations at Lawndale Restoration .
In 2000 Butler 's company brought in Habitat Co. to help manage the complex .
Lawndale Restoration was a collection of more than 1,200 apartments in 97 buildings spread across 300 blocks of west Chicago .
It was owned by a company controlled by Cecil Butler , a former civil rights activist who came to be reviled as a slumlord by a younger generation of activists .
Chicago 's struggles with the deterioration of its subsidized private developments seemed to reach a new height in 2006 , when the federal government foreclosed on Lawndale Restoration , the city 's largest subsidized - housing complex .
City inspectors found more than 1,800 code violations , including roof leaks , exposed wiring , and pools of sewage .
" All these deals are set up as islands , " Cullen Davis acknowledged .
In this case , " The margin of error at Sedgwick was a little too close to begin with . "
New Evergreen / Sedgwick is managed by a company run by Cullen Davis , Allison Davis 's son and also a contributor to Obama 's campaigns .
Cullen Davis said the problems were rooted in the way New Evergreen / Sedgwick was financed .
Like most new projects , it is owned by a company created to own one building .
That company determined how much to spend on renovations , how much to set aside for maintenance - and how much to keep as profit .
When the maintenance funds ran out , there was no other source of money .
Conditions deteriorated quickly .
Chronic plumbing failures consumed the project 's financial reserves while leaving undrained sewage in some of the apartments .
In October , after repeated complaints from building residents , the city government sued the owners , and a judge imposed a $ 5,500 fine .
The following year , Davis assembled another partnership to create New Evergreen / Sedgwick , a $ 10.7 million renovation of five walk - up buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood .
The project , a model of small - scale , mixed - income development , was subsidized by almost $ 6 million in state loans and federal tax credits .
In 2000 Davis asked the nonprofit Woods Fund of Chicago for a $ 1 million investment in a new development partnership , Neighborhood Rejuvenation Partners .
Obama , a member of the board , voted in favor , helping Davis secure the investment .
In the midst of the uproar , a small group of Lawndale residents gathered to rally against the Democratic candidate for the US Senate , Barack Obama .
Obama 's Republican opponent , Alan Keyes , trailed badly in the polls and was not seen as a serious challenger .
But the organizers had a simple message : Cecil Butler had donated $ 3,000 to Obama 's campaign .
Habitat had close ties to Obama .
And Obama had remained silent about Lawndale 's plight .
Paul Johnson , who helped to organize the protest , said Obama must have known about the problems .
" How did n't he know ? " said Johnson .
" Of course he knew .
He just did n't care . "
Butler did not return messages but in the past has said the government did not give him enough money to maintain the project .
Habitat emphasized in a statement that its role at Lawndale was restricted to tasks that included financial oversight and management .
In 2006 , following the foreclosure , the federal government sold the buildings to the city for $ 10 .
The city has since parceled out the buildings among two dozen developers , who are rebuilding Lawndale for the fourth time with yet another round of government loans and subsidies .
Even as Lawndale Restoration and Rezmar 's buildings were foreclosed upon , and Grove Parc and other subsidized developments fell deeper into disrepair , Obama has remained a steadfast supporter of subsidizing private development .
And although he has distanced himself from Rezko , Obama has remained close to others in the development community .
Jarrett participates in the campaign 's senior staff meetings .
And Obama chose another close friend , Martin Nesbitt , as his campaign treasurer .
Nesbitt is chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority , one of the key overseers of the shift toward private management and development .
" Throughout his career in public service , Barack Obama has advocated for the development of mixed - income housing and public - private partnerships to create affordable housing as an alternative to publicly subsidized , concentrated , low - income housing , " the Obama campaign said in a statement provided to the Globe .
As a result , some people in Chicago 's poorest neighborhoods are torn between a natural inclination to support Obama and a concern about his relationships with the developers they hold responsible for Chicago 's affordable housing failures .
Some housing advocates worry that Obama has not learned from those failures .
" I 'm not against Barack Obama , " said Willie J.R. Fleming , an organizer with the Coalition to Protect Public Housing and a former public housing resident .
" What I am against is some of the people around him . "
Jamie Kalven , a longtime Chicago housing activist , put it this way : " I hope there is not much predictive value in his history and in his involvement with that community . "

1956年、コンピュータ科学者のグループがダートマス大学に集まり、当時としては新しいトピックについて議論をかわした。そのトピックとは「人工知能」である。
ニューハンプシャー州ハノーバーで開催されたこのカンファレンスは、コンピュータで人間の認知能力をシミュレートする方法に関する、その後の議論の出発点となった。カンファレンスでは、「コンピュータは言語を使用できるか」「コンピュータは学習できるか」「創造的な思索と非創造的だが有効な思索を分ける要因はランダムさ（偶発性）なのか」といったさまざまな議論が行われた。
議論は、学習能力をはじめとする人間の知能が、原則として、コンピュータのプログラムでシミュレートできるくらい詳細に記述することができるというの大前提のもとで行われた。
出席者には、当時ハーバード大学に籍を置いていたMarvin Minsky氏、ベル研究所 のClaude Shannon氏、IBM のNathaniel Rochester氏、ダートマス大学のJohn McCarthy氏などの有名な学者が名を連ねていた。
この研究分野 は 「
人工知能」と呼ばれているが、この名前は、実はMcCarthy氏がこのカンファレンスの直前に考え出したものだ。今月、ダートマス大学で開催された50回目の同カンファレンスで、現在スタンフォード大学名誉教授のMcCarthy氏に、初期のAI、50年間の研究成果、今後の課題について聞いた。
--「人工知能 （Artificial Intelligence）」という言葉は、1956年のカンファレンスの直前に、あなたが考え出したものとされていますね。この言葉は既存のアイデアに名前を付けただけだったのですか。それとも、当時、構想中の何か新しいアイデアがあったのですか。
ロックフェラー財団からカンファレンスを開くための研究資金を得るために提案書を書く必要があったのですが、そのときに思いついたのが人工知能という呼び名だったのです。実をいうと、こういう名前にしたのは、資金提供者ではなくカンファレンスの参加者のことを考えていたからなのですが。Claude Shannonと私で『オートマトン研究（原題：Automata Studies）』という本を書いたのですが、カンファレンスに提出された論文の中で人工知能をテーマにしているものが少ないと感じたので、何のカンファレンスなのか明確に打ち出すためにインパクトのある名前を考えてみようと思ったのです。
--これまでを振り返ってみて、人工知能という名前は正しい選択だったと思いますか。分かりやすい自明の名前だと思いますが、この分野の研究を表現するもっとうまい言葉はあると思いますか。
「 計算知能 （Computational Intelligence）」という名前に変更したがっている人もいますね。しかし、1955年当時に、この名前を使うことはできなかっただろうと思います。というのは、コンピュータがAIを実現する主な道具になるという考え方は、当時はまだ、ごく一部でしか受け入れられていませんでしたから。ですから、計算知能という呼び名を受け入れる人も少数派だったでしょうね。
--当時、あなたは提案書の中で、コンピュータを使用して脳の高度な機能をシミュレートするというアイデアに関して、「大きな障害となっているのは、マシンの能力不足ではなく、人間の側がマシンの能力をフルに活かすプログラムを書けないことだ」と書いておられますね。これは、ハードウェアは揃っていたが、プログラミングのスキルがなかったとということですか。
スキルという問題ではなく、ハードウェアを活かすための基本的なアイデアがなかったということです。その点は今でも変わっていません。そのことは、コンピュータにチェスと囲碁を同じくらい学習をさせると、チェスはかなり巧くなるけれど、囲碁は全然巧くならないという事実によく現れています。囲碁では、局面、陣地を考慮しなければなりませんし、何より、囲碁の " 手" を識別する必要があります。こうしたことは、コンピュータ上でどのように表現すればよいのか未だに分かっていないのです。
--1956年のカンファレンスの参加者たちは、あなたも含めてだと思いますが、コンピュータに何ができるかという点に関して楽観的だったようですね。つまり、1970年くらいまでには、チェスをするとか、クラシック音楽を作曲するとか、人の話を理解するとか、そうしたことくらいはコンピュータにもできるようになるだろうと思っていた。あれから50年経って、どのくらい進歩したのでしょうか。50年前の予想はあまりに楽観的過ぎたのでしょうか。
私の場合はそう、楽観的過ぎました。しかし、当時、かなり悲観的な考えの人たちもいたと記憶しています。
--悲観すべき理由が何かがあったのですか。
要するに、こういうことです。人間は自分の認識している障害しか考慮できない。昔より今のほうが認識している障害は多い。だから今のほうが悲観的な人が多くなってきたのでしょう。
--この50年間に学んだことで、人工知能の研究に役立った重大なことをいくつか挙げるとすると何ですか。
そうですね。1つは、（人工知能を実現するには）コンピュータに「非単調推論」を実行させる必要があるということを認識したことでしょうか。
--その「非単調推論」について詳しく説明していただけませんか。
いいですよ。例えば、あるステートメントPがあり、これが複数のステートメントの集合Aから推論可能であるとします。また、別のステートメントの集合Bがあり、BにはAに含まれるすべてのステートメントが含まれているとします。通常の論理的な推論では、ステートメントPはBからも推論可能です。なぜなら、同じ証明が成り立つからです。ところが、人間はそうならないような推論をするのです。たとえば、私が、「ああ、11時には家にいるけれど、君の電話には出られないよ」と言ったとします。最初の「11時には家にいる」という部分から、あなたは「家にいるなら電話に出ることができるはずだ」と結論づけるでしょう。しかし、その後の文を付け加えると、そういう結論を引き出すことができなくなる。つまり、「非単調推論」というのは、ある結論を引き出したとき、それが正しい結論に思えても、何か別の事実が追加されたために、その正しさが保証されなくなる、そういう推論を指します。非単調推論が定式化され始めたのは1980年か、もう少し前くらいからですが、今では非常に大きな研究分野になっています。
--この50年間の研究で達成した最も大きな成果は何だと思われますか。当初の目標の何割くらいが達成されましたか。
われわれはまだ、人間と同レベルの知能を実現していません。でも、自動車を128マイル運転できるまでになったことは大変な進歩だと思います（編集者注：2005年秋のDARPA
Grand Challenge で優勝したスタンフォード大学のロボットカー" Stanley " は、モハーベ砂漠で131.6マイルの自動走行に成功した）。
--次に目指す大きな目標は何ですか。
コンテクストを考慮した常識と推論の定式化をさらに進歩させていきたいですね。これは私が長年に渡って取り組んできたテーマであり、私以外にも取り組んでいる人が何人かいます。この研究はDARPAも支援しているのですが、アイデアが不足していて人間の知能に到達するレベルには至っていません。
-- AIの目標はマシンに人間の知能を持たせて人間に近づけることではなく、人間の知能に相当するものをマシンで実現することだと理解していますが、正しいでしょうか。つまり、人間を再発明することが目標ではなく、人間に似た考えをするけれど人間の思考に勝る何かを創ることを目指していると。
そうです。それが私の考え方です。もちろん、人間の知能をシミュレートすることに興味を持っている人もいます。この考え方はいろいろな面で最善とは言えないのですが、Allen Newell やHerbert Simonなどが、そのような考え方をしていましたね。
