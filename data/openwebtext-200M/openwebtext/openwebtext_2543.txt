Is Sleeping Good for the Heart ?
New research suggests that the heart may benefit from a good night 's sleep .
Dec. 25 , 2008  --
Ah , the holidays .
Time to enjoy decorations and presents .
Time to relax around the Christmas dinner table with family and friends .
Time to catch up on sleep ?
For those who are always looking for an excuse to sleep in , or sleep more , your search is not in vain : According to new research , hours spent sleeping protects against calcium deposits in the coronary arteries -- the deposits responsible for heart attacks .
A study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Christopher King and colleagues from the University of Chicago has found a relationship between sleep quantity ( hours spent asleep ) and calcium build up -- or calcification -- in the arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood .
For each additional hour of sleep , the risk of calcification of the coronary arteries decreased by 33 percent -- an outcome equal to reducing blood pressure by 16 point elevations .
Moreover , the sleep relationship did not change even when the researchers controlled for certain traditional risk factors for heart disease , such as cholesterol , weight and diabetes .
The results were part of the ongoing Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ( CARDIA ) , which is being carried out at four cities nationally .
This report focused on nearly 500 patients at the Chicago CARDIA site .
Participants were black and white men and women aged 35 - 47 years , measured initially in 2000 - 2001 and followed up in 2005 - 2006 .
Sleep was measured by a wrist band recording wrist movement on an initial Wednesday through Saturday night period .
This wrist recorder is a very good measurement of time spent asleep -- nearly as good as sleep measured in a sophisticated sleep laboratory .
However , the wrist band is less disruptive to normal sleep than sleeping in a sleep lab , because there is no " first - night " effect -- the disruption of the normal sleep structure of a subject that is often seen with more intrusive testing .
The amount of calcium in the coronary arteries was measured by CT scanning of the heart .
Linking Zzz's and Heart Disease
The authors do not know why sleep seems to be associated with less calcification ; however , they propose three possible explanations .
First , there may be unknown factors common to both sleep and heart disease -- factors the researchers did not know to measure .
Second , inflammation elsewhere in the body increases the risk of calcification , and this effect can be influenced by the body 's natural anti-inflammatory hormone , cortisol .
This hormone is released in sync with a person 's sleep patterns .
Increased time asleep might increase the release of cortisol -- which , in turn , might reduce inflammation and , therefore , calcium deposits .
Third , blood pressure declines during sleep .
Thus , it might be the case that the longer people sleep , the less their heart is exposed to elevated blood pressure .
The authors note that this is the first study to find a relationship between sleep and coronary artery calcium deposits .
Other studies have looked at sleep apnea -- periods during sleep when an individual stops breathing .
Sleep apnea is associated with high blood pressure and heart attacks , but the authors did not measure this sleep phenomenon .
The authors conclude that " this study demonstrates that objectively measured sleep is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification .
This study further demonstrates the utility of a simple objective measure of sleep that can be used at home .
Future studies will be needed for crucial extensions to these results . "
So , happy holidays .
And get some sleep !

The report says children 's lives are " more difficult than in the past "
The aggressive pursuit of personal success by adults is now the greatest threat to British children , a major independent report on childhood says .
It calls for a sea- change in social attitudes and policies to counter the damage done to children by society .
Family break - up , unprincipled advertising , too much competition in education and income inequality are mentioned as big contributing factors .
A panel of independent experts carried out the study over three years .
The report , called The Good Childhood Inquiry and commissioned by the Children 's Society , concludes that children 's lives in Britain have become " more difficult than in the past " , adding that " more young people are anxious and troubled " .
According to the panel , " excessive individualism " is to blame for many of the problems children face and needs to be replaced by a value system where people seek satisfaction more from helping others rather than pursuing private advantage .
What makes a good childhood ?
A spokesman for the Department for Children Schools and Families said : " We know there are still risks and challenges ahead for children and parents and that there is more for us all to do " .
' Tone deaf '
The inquiry has a long list of recommendations including : • abolishing Sats tests and league tables in English schools • a ban on all advertising aimed at the under 12s and no TV commercials for alcohol or unhealthy food before the 9 pm watershed • stopping building on any open space where children play • a high - quality youth centre for every 5,000 young people " Individual freedom and self - determination bring many blessings , " writes the report 's principal author , Labour peer Lord Richard Layard .
" But in Britain ... the balance has tilted too far , " he says .
This is a starting point for a debate as to why a million and a half British children are unhappy and why young people 's emotional health appears to be worsening .
Mark Easton 's blog Another contributor , the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams , suggests society has become " tone - deaf to the real requirements of children in a climate where the mixture of sentimentalism and panic makes discussion of children 's issues so difficult " .
The panel , made up of 11 experts including eight university professors , says its conclusions are evidence based .
But some of its findings on family life in Britain are bound to be controversial .
Working mothers
It cites research suggesting that three times as many three year olds living with lone parents or a step - parent have behavioural problems compared with those living with married parents .

More from Today programme " Children with separate , single or step parents are 50 % more likely to fail at school , have low esteem , be unpopular with other children and have behavioural difficulties , anxiety or depression , " it argues .
" Child - rearing is one of the most challenging tasks in life and ideally it requires two people , " the report concludes .
It also suggests that having many more working mothers has contributed to the damage done to children .
" Most women now work and their new economic independence contributes to levels of family break - up which are higher in the UK than in any other Western European country . "
The panel has a series of recommendations aimed at improving the quality of family life experienced by children : • a civil birth ceremony conducted by a registrar in which parents publicly accept the responsibilities of parenthood • free parenting classes available around the time of birth • free psychological and family support if relationships struggle • rules making it easier for parents to stay at home to rear their children Chief Executive of the Children 's Society , Bob Reitemeyer , commissioned the research which included more than 30,000 submissions from organisations and children .
" Essentially the report brings a taboo into the open which is that we have to confront our selfish and individualistic culture , " he said .
" We need to realise that we are collectively responsible for the welfare of all children and that together we can make childhood better . "
The Secretary of State for Children , Schools and Families , Ed Balls , is studying the report .
The report says parents should have free parenting classes
Although government may be sympathetic to some of the inquiry 's conclusions , it is unlikely it will implement its radical proposals in the near future .
The government statement said : " The report mirrors the ambitious plan for improving children 's lives and outcomes we set out in our Children 's Plan , which aims to give every child the best chance in life , and we are pleased that the review acknowledges the positive impact that the Children 's Plan is already having on children 's lives .
" We know there are still risks and challenges ahead for children and parents and that there is more for us all to do .
" But as the report points out , in many ways our children have never lived so well - children are more educated , less sick , and more tolerant , and the government is working hard to invest , help and support children and their families to make Britain the best place in the world to grow up . "

British Supermarket Bans Little Girl's Balloon
Erik DeckersLaughing Stalk SyndicateCopyright 2009
British supermarket chain , Tesco , is in the news for not allowing a helium balloon into their store .
Again .
Alex Pearson , a nine - year - old girl , had been given a helium balloon while she was eating lunch at a local restaurant .
She walked with her mother to the Tesco store afterward , enjoying her balloon , and looking forward to spending some of her own money there .
I remember when I was that age , spending my own money was a huge deal .
It made me feel special , so I can imagine how she felt .
But little Alex – sweet , cute widdle Alex who onwy wanted to spend her vewwy own money to buy a nice pwesent – was told by a big , mean security guard that she was n't allowed to bring her balloon into the store .
It 's a health and safety risk , the security guard said .
" Health and safety risk " is a term British bureaucrats like to trot out when they can't think of a good explanation for their idiocy .
It 's like when American bureaucrats ( and my fourth grade teacher ) say " if we let you do it , then we have to let everyone else do it . "
It 's a slogan for the drones who do n't like to use the remaining 98 percent of their brain .
It 's how the Tesco drones justify not letting balloons into the store , even though they sell bags of them .
Alex 's mother , Marion , had tied the balloon to Alex 's wrist to keep it secure .
Not good enough , said the guard .
It 's " company policy . "
" Some idiotic reason about security , " said Marion .
Alex did n't understand why she could n't bring her balloon .
So Marion told the security guard to explain it to Alex .
" He could n't even look her in the eye , " she told the London Daily Mail .
" I think he was too embarrassed .
" Since Alex did n't want to let her balloon go , the Pearsons left .
Marion has promised to never shop at Tesco again .
It turns out , balloons can be used as weapons and instruments of torture .
They have been used to hold up stores and banks , kidnap entire families , and cause political unrest .
Back in 1914 , Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed by a helium balloon , which ultimately led to World War I.
No , seriously , it 's because Tesco thinks they 're a fire hazard .
A
Tesco spokesman peeked out from behind the skirts of bureaucratic logic long enough to offer this poorly reasoned explanation .
" Unfortunately ( balloons ) were getting trapped on the ceiling and blocking the sprinkler system , and they are pretty difficult to retrieve , " said the unnamed Bureaucratic Spokes Unit .
" The managers decided to use their discretion .
There is not a set policy on helium balloons at the store .
It 's just common sense really .
" No , this is the exact opposite of common sense .
It 's 540 degrees from common sense – it's not just 180 degrees from it ; this one is so far from common sense , it actually went around one - and - a - half times from it .
Common sense is understanding that restaurant helium balloons deflate by the next morning , and you can pick them up off the floor when the store opens .
Common sense is understanding that if the water pressure from the sprinkler system is strong enough to put out a fire , it 's strong enough to push a four gram balloon out of the way .
Common sense is understanding that if a security guard can't explain a policy to a 9 - year - old girl without feeling embarrassed , there 's something wrong with the policy .
Of course , this is n't the first time Tesco has taken issue with helium balloons .
Back in August 2007 , I wrote about Barney Baloney , a children 's clown whose five hour gig at a Tesco supermarket was ruined when they said he could n't use balloons in his act .
Back then , a Tesco Bureaucratic Spokes Unit said , " We have banned balloons because latex is used in the manufacture of them and this can trigger an allergic reaction in some children .
" That 's different than what the other Spokes Unit just said .
A lot different .
Back in 2007 , Tesco was worried about children having allergic reactions to latex , which is asinine , since anyone with an allergy would have to rub themselves with balloons for hours to get anything more than mild skin irritation .
Now , Tesco is telling us they have a poorly - pressurized sprinkler system that can't push a balloon out of the way during a fire .
I suppose the bureaucrats are only doing their jobs , remaining ever - vigilant , knowing they are all that stand between its customers and horrible , fiery death .
Or a bunch of itchy kids .
I can't be sure .---
" A Pedophile 's Paradise "
This morning , 43 Alaskan Natives filed a lawsuit against the Society of Jesus ( the Jesuits ) , claiming a widespread conspiracy to dump pedophile priests in small Alaskan towns and shelter them from exposure .
The suit was filed in the Bethel , Alaska Superior Court .
Reverend Father Stephen Sundborg — current president of Seattle University and head of the Northwest Jesuits from 1990 to 1996 — is named as a co-conspirator .
Attorney Ken Roosa announced the lawsuit at a chilly press conference outside Seattle University this morning and said , as of today , he knows of 345 cases of molestation , only two of them against non-natives .
The Jesuits , he said , sent known pedophiles to isolated Alaskan villages — many of them only accessible by boat or plane — to let them abuse children with impunity .
" It was a pedophile 's paradise , " Roosa said .
" We are going to shine some light on a dark and dirty corner of the Jesuit order . "
Today , Roosa said , there are 17,000 Catholics in the diocese of Fairbanks — which filed for chapter 11 last year — and were even fewer during the peak of the abuse , from 1960 to 1975 .
The rate of child molestation by priests in Alaska , he said , " is several orders of magnitude larger " than anywhere else in the United States .
( Roosa compared this lawsuit to one in Los Angeles , with 550 cases of abuse and a Catholic population of 3.5 million . )
The diocese filed for bankruptcy protection in order to pay off settlements with Native Alaskans who were molested as children .
( Roosa led that effort was well .
This suit — against the Society of Jesus as a whole — is the latest battle in a long campaign Roosa has been waging against the opaque , secretive way the church responds to accusations of sexual abuse . )
Some members of the lawsuit spoke at the press conference , including Flo Kenny , a short woman with a steely gray ponytail and sunglasses .
" I am Flo Kenny , " she said slowly .
" I am 74 years old .
And I 've kept silent for 60 years .
I am here for all the ones who cannot speak — who are dead , who committed suicide , who are homeless , are drug addicts .
There 's always been a time , an end of secrets .
This is the time . "
She said her abuse started when she was 13 and depressed by the treatment she and other village children suffered from the nuns .
" They managed us like wild ponies and beat us every day , " she said .
" They said it was good for our character . "
She sought comfort from the village priest who began an abusive relationship that lasted several y ears .
" The priest at that time took the role of the shaman and the tribal council , making the decisions , " she said .
The priests held all the power in these remote towns and , according to the lawsuit , many of them were known sexual predators .
Another native , Rena Abouchuk , cried while she read a letter to her village priest : " You did so many evil things to young children ...
God will never forgive you . "
Abouchuk said the priest raped and molested her and her cousins , often together in the same room , and offered to let them ring the church bell as a prize for complicity .
" You took a lot of lives , " she read aloud , crying and holding an eagle feather she 'd been given at a " sobriety powwow " on New Year 's Eve .
Six of her cousins , she said , have committed suicide because of that priest .
Abouchuk 's brother , wearing a black leather jacket and a blue bandanna , said the priest who abused him gave him a few quarters each time .
" My family was very , very poor at the time , " he said .
" I tried to kill myself several times over this . "
He became homeless , an alcoholic and drug addict , but has since become sober and lives with his sister in Spokane .
A former Benedictine monk , Patrick Wall , said 28 pedophiles from four countries were specifically sent to Alaska " to get them off the grid , where they could do the least amount of damage " to the church 's public image .
" The Catholic church has the largest body of documentation of non-incarcerated pedophiles in the world , " he said .
" These guys should be sent to the Mayo clinic and studied to find out what makes them tick ... they 're some of the weirdest characters you will ever meet . "
Three years ago , Roosa said , a former head of the Northwest Jesuits testified about the " hell files " — personnel files with information about priests that was " special , " " not public , " and " not good . "
Sundborg allegedly would 've had those files in his office when he was the head of the Northwest Jesuits .
When Roosa tried to acquire those files from the Northwest Jesuits , he was told they did n't exist .
Father Sundborg 's office has not yet returned requests for comment .
But let 's revisit this story from 2006 :
The president of Seattle University said Thursday he has no doubt that a Jesuit priest who taught at the school from about 1950 to 1976 sexually molested young boys .
But the Rev. Stephen Sundborg also said he believed that Seattle University bears no legal responsibility for the actions of Michael Toulouse , because any acts of sexual abuse he carried out occurred outside the scope of his official duties as a teacher at the school .
UPDATE
A statement from Rev. Father Sundborg :
The allegations brought against me are false .
I firmly deny them .
I want the victims and the entire community to know that .
The complaint filed by the plaintiffs ' lawyers represents an unprincipled and irresponsible attack on my reputation .
Let me be clear — my commitment to justice and reconciliation for all victims remains steadfast .
The sexual abuse by Catholic priests is one of the most shameful episodes in the history of our church .
I will continue to work toward the goal of bringing healing to all victims .
Updated Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio announced Monday that he would not seek re-election in 2010 .
Mr. Voinovich , whose more than four decades in public life included stints as the governor of Ohio and mayor of Cleveland , said in a statement that his final two years in office would be “ the most important years that I have served in my entire political career . ”
“ I must devote my full time , energy and focus , ” he said , “ to the job I was elected to do , the job in front of me , which seeking a third term – with the money - raising and campaigning that it would require – would not allow me to do . ”
Mr. Voinovich follows three other Republican senators — Christopher S. Bond of Missouri , Mel Martinez of Florida and Sam Brownback of Kansas — who have also said they will not seek another term in two years .
Another Republican , Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas , has signaled that she may cut her term short to run for governor in 2010 .
Mr. Voinovich ’s retirement will leave another seat vulnerable to poaching by Democrats .
Ohio , a critical battleground state in recent presidential elections , voted for Barack Obama in 2008 .
And in 2006 , a Democrat , Sherrod Brown , unseated a Republican incumbent , Mike DeWine , who served two terms in the Senate .
In announcing that he would not seek another term , Mr. Voinovich avoids what could have been a difficult re-election fight .
As recently as December a Quinnipiac University poll found that fewer than half of all voters in the state — 44 percent — said he deserved to be elected to a third term .
And voters were nearly evenly split on the question of whether they would vote for him or an unnamed Democrat .
Among those who are reportedly angling to replace Mr. Voinovich is a former Ohio congressman , Rob Portman , a Republican who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget and United States Trade Representative during the Bush administration .
Mr. Portman has not yet announced his candidacy , but Matt Miller , a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , sought to pre-empt him on Monday .
“ It ’s jaw - dropping , ” Mr. Miller said , “ that Republicans would seem to turn to a Washington insider like Rob Portman who was one of the architects of the Bush economic policies that have run up trillions in deficits and shipped jobs overseas . ”
Mr. Voinovich , who will be 74 in 2010 , said that although “ I still have the fire in my belly to do the work of our nation , ” he and his wife , Janet , decided they also wanted to spend more time with their children and grandchildren .
On Monday , Mr. Voinovich also laid out his priorities for the remainder of his term .
“ I will continue to focus on the areas that matter most , ” he said , “ providing the nation a responsible stimulus package ; jump - starting our credit markets ; re-establishing confidence in the housing market and stemming the tide on mortgage foreclosures ; harmonizing our nation ’s economic , energy and environmental policies ; ensuring safe and stable highways ; and continuing to improve the personnel and management of the federal government . ”

Are you feeling like life is n’t exciting enough ?
That maybe you ’re missing out on something because you just ca n’t get motivated for anything ?
Turns out you ’re not alone .
Recently , reader Rachel asked :
“ In a population of 6 billion + people globally , it is hard not to feel like another number .
I find life so disenchanting the more I pursue things I though were my dreams .
I am at possibly the top university in the world getting my masters to make the world a better place … yet I lack the joy and excitement that I should have .
If this were just my problem , I would figure this out , but I think so many of us deal with this .
We can have so much to be grateful for , and we very well might be grateful … however , when the achievement of a dream fails to make us as satisfied as we thought it would , it calls the very credibility of dreaming into question .
I appreciate the process of life , one might say … Nothing seems to be that exciting though … nothing could surprise me anymore .
I was wondering if you had any insight on this issue … i.e. what I call the “ I ca n’t get no satisfaction ” syndrome . ”
What a tough question !
How do you get excited about life ?
I have to admit that this is not only a common problem , but one of the toughest .
I ’ve gone through times in my life when nothing seemed exciting .
Dreams seemed utterly hopeless and useless .
Motivation was a hard currency to come by .
So what changed ?
What got me excited by life ?
There ’s no one answer .
What follows is a series of things that worked for me , in no particular order … I should note that some of these may sound trite , but they actually do work , for me and for countless others :
1 . Make small , positive changes .
This is a bit of a paradox .
Making small , positive changes — eating a little healthier , exercising a little , creating some small productive habits , for example — are an amazing way to get excited about life … but does n’t it take some excitement and motivation to even get started with these small changes ?
Yes , a little … but not a lot .
If you start small , you do n’t need a lot of motivation .
Just get going .
You ’ll soon find that just the act of getting started and doing something will give you some momentum , and soon you ’ll be in a positive spiral of changes — one building on the other .
When I started doing this in my life , I was so excited I had to start Zen Habits to share it with the world .
2. Banish negative thinking .
Negative thoughts are the bane of an exciting existence .
You ca n’t have all these negative thoughts , and hope to really enjoy life .
It ’s one or the other — and it ’s your choice .
Do you want to think negative — I ca n’t do it , this sucks — or do you want to love life and do amazing things and get excited about everything ?
It really is a choice .
And it takes awareness — be aware of your thoughts and when you catch yourself thinking negative , squash the thought like a bug , and replace it with a positive thought .
Seriously , it works .
I did this with running and smoking when I first started , and I was able to successfully start running and quit smoking .
That was more than three years ago , and I have n’t smoked since and I ’ve run three marathons since then .
All because I banished negative thoughts .
3 . Look at the wonderful side of things .
This is kinda the flip side of No. 2 above , but I do n’t care — it ’s so important I need to give it its own list item .
Yes , that ’s right — it matters that much : everything around you has a wonderful side , and you just need to look at that to realize how lucky you are .
Seriously .
My internet went down ?
That ’s a wonderful thing : I was more productive than ever before , plus I spent more time with my kids rather than surfing the web .
My daughter is throwing a tantrum because she wants a toy her brother is playing with ?
It ’s a wonderful opportunity for me to teach her about sharing , to invent some fun new activity we can do together , to spend some time with my kids .
My grandfather died ?
It ’s a wonderful chance for me to celebrate the great life he led , the influence he had on me and those around me , to learn more about him , to spend time with friends and family , to reflect on the preciousness of life .
4. Exercise .
Not everyone is a fan of exercise , but I can tell you firsthand that it can work miracles .
While many people do it to improve their appearance , there ’s so much more to exercise — it can be incredibly fun while you ’re doing it ( if you do it right ) , you feel healthy and energetic , you can get a fresh insight into your life and life in general .
When I exercise , I feel so much better than those days when I do n’t .
It gives me new ideas , time to contemplate , time to spend with my sister ( who is my friend and running partner ) .
Start with just 10 minutes a day and you ’ll see how much it can energize your life .
5. Appreciate loved ones .
It ’s not a secret that I ’m a big fan of spending time with my family .
It ’s my No. 1 favorite pastime .
And for good reason : when I do so , I love life so much more .
Even just laying on the couch reading together , or renting a movie and eating take - out food , or walking along the beach together , or cracking jokes with each other — it really makes life so much better .
Take the time to appreciate your loved ones , and if you have n’t spent time with them lately , do so today if you can !
At the very least , give your loved ones a call or send a nice email .
6. Pursue a passion .
This was a life - changer for me .
For many years , I was too afraid or too pessimistic to pursue my passion ( writing ) seriously .
In January 2007 , I started Zen Habits as a way to pursue that passion , and it was one of the best decisions of my life ( my wife and children being the others ) .
Even if I did n’t make money from blogging , I ’d love it and it would be worth doing just for the energy it infuses into my life .
Whatever your passion , pursue it with energy .
If you do n’t know what that passion is , you need to start exploring and trying new things — it could take awhile , but it ’s worth the effort .
7 . Talk and work with other excited people .
Boy , this is really a great one .
I wish someone had told me about this a decade ago .
I ’ve worked with competent people before , but looking back on it , often they were jaded or cynical or negative in some way .
And these negative , bored people would have an effect on my attitude .
But the times when I ’ve worked with people who are excited about what they do … well , I ’d get excited too .
Even today , when I basically work alone , I collaborate with other great bloggers , with others on some cool projects … and I seek out people who get excited about what they do .
It ’s fun to work with them , and it makes things much more exciting .
8 . Take time to recharge .
Sometimes you just feel drained , and you ca n’t get excited about anything .
This is a good time to take a break if you can , to get out of your usual setting and your usual routine .
You do n’t have to go to the Caribbean or Guam ( although if you can , that ’s great ) … just get out into nature , reflect on life , realize how wonderful it is , do some journaling or sketching , create , have fun , relax , do nothing .
When you ’re done , you ’ll feel much better about everything , and come at things with a fresh perspective .
9 . Get great feedback .
One of the things I love about blogging here at Zen Habits is the amazing feedback and encouragement I get from my readers .
It has made blogging a joy , and the feedback I get has helped me to improve every step of the way .
I get excited about what I do because I love the feedback — both the praise and the constructive criticism .
I do n’t love the hateful comments , but those are rare .
While not everyone will become a blogger , it ’s great if you can get some great feedback from people — coworkers , peers , friends and family , clients and customers .
The more , the better .
When you get negative feedback , use it to get better .
When you get praise , bask in it and be grateful .
10 . Help others .
I do n’t pretend that I ’m the world ’s greatest philanthropist , but often I get emails and comments from people who have improved their lives from what I ’ve done .
And the feeling I get from comments like this is unbelievable .
I am incredibly grateful to be able to help others , even in a small way , and I highly recommend it to everyone .
Even if your main job is n’t dedicated to helping others , find spare time to do volunteer charity work or find ways to do nice things to help your loved ones .
It ’ll make life so much better .

The prospects of Kaká making a world - record January transfer from Milan to Manchester City appeared to be over last night after a highly placed source close to City 's owner claimed widespread reports of a £ 100 m bid were " absolutely ridiculous " .
Kaká himself is also understood to be deeply reluctant to join City – whatever the fee and salary package – unless there is a change of manager .
The adviser to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan , City 's billionaire owner , told Observer Sport from Abu Dhabi last night that media coverage of City 's offer for the Milan player , plus reported £ 500,000 - a- week wages , was wildly unrealistic – giving credence to growing rumours in Italy that the story has been hyped up by Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi , in an attempt to earn good publicity when no move materialises and Kaká stays at the San Siro .
First reports of the " £ 100 m " bid appeared on a website owned by Berlusconi .
" The reports are absolutely ridiculous and so far wide of the mark it 's unreal , " said the source , who claimed that while contact had been made with Milan , any deal for the former Fifa World Player of the Year would involve an offer nearer to £ 50 m than the reported £ 100 m .
" Kaká would command a price around that of previous world - best players .
But at the moment it is difficult to pick an exact number . "
Luís Figo and Zinedine Zidane , who also won the Fifa award , were bought for £ 38 m and £ 46 m respectively , with the latter figure representing the current world record for a transfer , which was paid by Real Madrid to Juventus for the French midfielder in 2001 .
The adviser also claimed that , contrary to reports , negotiations have still to reach an advanced stage for Kaká , that no formal contact has been with the player , and that a defining element of financing any deal would have to include intellectual property rights to make it commercially realistic .
" A hundred million , in pounds or euros , is ridiculous , " he said .
" It doubles the previous record for a transfer and , in the current economic climate , how could there possibly be a return on that or a salary of £ 500,000 a - week ?
You could do so much else with that amount of money .
And , whatever happens , there would be no lump sum payment : payments would be over time .
" You have to remember also that the player has not even been spoken to by us – he is simply one of a list that interests Mark Hughes .
We merely said , ' Ok , this might be nice . '
It 's a process like viewing a house .
If you like what you see , then you take it on a stage .
It should be remembered that Manchester City 's owner is an intelligent man .
He will not just throw money at anything .
And Gary Cook [ City chief executive ] was formerly at Nike so knows all about intellectual property rights . "
David Beckham 's lucrative remuneration packages at Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy – he is thought to earn £ 25 m a year at the US club – were financed by earnings from his intellectual property including image rights .
Kaká , a devoutly religious man whose highly respectable image has already attracted blockbuster deals with Armani and Adidas , would be sure to generate millions in off - field earnings , which would be a complex part of any proposed deal .
But regardless of the financial obstacles , Kaká 's reluctance to join a club of City 's stature also appears to have hardened .
The Brazilian was shown plenty of support by the 65,000 crowd at the San Siro last night , when he played impressively in Milan 's 1 - 0 win over Fiorentina , a game in which Beckham lasted 81 minutes before being substituted .
Fans ' banners ranged from the supportive ( " Kaká , grow old with us " ) to the dismissive ( " I belong to money , " a play on his T - shirt slogan " I belong to Jesus " ) .
His car was mobbed as he left the ground by fans imploring him to stay .
Berlusconi appeared to play up the chances of Kaká leaving when he said : " It is very difficult to make someone stay after they 've seen such wages . "
But " such wages " might be on offer only in reports generated by Berlusconi 's own website .
Beckham , asked if he had talked to Kaká about the possible move , said : " Ricardo does n't need my advice .
He 's a man , he 's a great player and one of the nicest people you will meet .
He will decide what he wants to do .
But he does love Milan .
It is not all about money . "
While City still expect to meet Kaká 's father Bosco Leite this week , sources close to the player suggested last night that Kaká would want City to appoint José Mourinho " or a manager of close calibre " to convince him he would be moving to an " appropriate platform " , and that City would be capable of rapidly establishing themselves as " one of the best eight teams in the world " .
Kaká is in regular contact with Brazil team - mates Robinho and Elano , who have found Hughes hard to work with at Eastlands , the latter complaining publicly about a lack of communication from the manager .
Kaká has also told advisers he would not consent to a move from Milan unless the club had a coherent strategy to challenge for the Champions League trophy .
The 26 - year - old would further seek assurances that Sheikh Mansour will neither lose interest in City and walk away nor significantly reduce his investment in the club , as Roman Abramovich has done at Chelsea .
Kaká 's long - term adviser Diogo Kotscho told Observer Sport : " We have to see a good project , a winning project , for any club to be eligible to have a player like Kaká .
We have to be convinced that Manchester City can turn themselves – in the short term – into one of the best eight teams in the world . "
Bringing Mourinho to Manchester would help , and City are understood to have made moves in that direction .
According to one of the former Chelsea manager 's closest advisers , the sheikh 's representatives contacted Mourinho 's camp shortly after their September takeover to offer him the City job with immediate effect .
Mourinho swiftly rejected a proposal that would have doubled his already lucrative salary at Internazionale .
He has , however , monitored City 's progress since and such is his desire to return to English football has not ruled out the possibility of joining them next season .
Mourinho 's conditions would be similar to Kaká 's – the promise of a front - seat role in a " very great project " coupled with a financial offer that would be extremely difficult to resist .
Even the combination of both , however , are not guaranteed to bring City success in the pursuit of the pair with the political turmoil at Real Madrid another significant complication .
Ramon Calderon 's resignation as Real president over allegations of vote rigging has opened the path for candidates for the post to base their election campaign around the pursuit of Kaká .
The player himself would prefer a move to Madrid , Manchester United or Chelsea –should Abramovich resolve his financial difficulties .
At the heart of every great building project in which HHH has been involved in , is the way it improves the way people occupying the space interact with the built environment and its surrounds on the Gold Coast .
To deliver on the promise of value for money , the team needs to get it right the first time and avoid costly revisions and rework .
Success depends essentially on effective communication between the client and the HHH team .
So the bulk of the submissions are either how to get a prostitute , Windows on the iPhone , how to blow up the world , or how to molest kids .
And I 'm trying to figure out which of those is the most disturbing .
Thanks all !
For the record , OMG !
Ponies wins again .
ALBANY – Gov. Paterson has secretly granted raises of as much as 46 percent to more than a dozen staffers at a time when he has asked 130,000 state workers to give up 3 percent pay hikes because of the state ’s fiscal crisis , The Post has learned .
Cuomo Creaming Paterson in Gov Race : Poll
All Sides Raise Hell Over Gov’s Pay Hikes
The startling pay hikes , costing about $ 250,000 annually , were granted after the governor ’s “ emergency ” declaration in August of a looming fiscal crisis that required the state to cut spending and impose a “ hard ” hiring freeze .
One raise was approved as recently as last month – when Paterson claimed the budget deficit had reached an unprecedented $ 15.5 billion .
The raises , which have stunned the few state workers who know about them , are outlined in data obtained from the office of state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli , prepared at The Post ’s request .
Two of the raises were tied to publicly proclaimed promotions – granted despite the supposed hiring freeze – of some of Paterson ’s most important appointees , although the announcements did n’t include disclosure of the pay hikes .
The remaining 14 raises appear to have gone to individuals who remained in their same positions , despite claims by a spokesman for Paterson that they had been promoted .
“ These are not raises for old positions , rather new salaries for new positions , ” Paterson spokesman Errol Cockfield insisted .
But a DiNapoli spokesman , Dennis Thompkins , said flatly , “ These are individuals who stayed in their same position and received a salary increase . ”
Paterson ’s top aide , William Cunningham , a one - time law partner of the governor ’s father , Basil , saw his pay jump 5 percent to $ 178,500 – just $ 500 less than Paterson himself – from $ 170,000 on Nov. 7 , after he was promoted from a temporary “ acting ” secretary to permanent .
Charlotte Hitchcock , one of Cunningham ’s deputies and a personal friend of the governor ’s , received an $ 18,000 , or 11.25 percent , raise on Dec. 22 .
While a press release said she was promoted from deputy secretary to “ chief of staff ” and “ director of financial regulation , ” it made no mention of a higher salary .
Cassie Prugh , a confidential assistant , was given a 46 percent pay hike in late November , raising her annual salary to $ 125,000 from $ 85,721 , while Gaurav Vasisht , an assistant counsel , received a 6 percent , $ 7,427 increase in December , bringing his salary to $ 130,279 .
Brendan Fitzgerald , a special office assistant , received a 21 percent , or $ 15,737 , pay hike only last month , bringing his salary to $ 90,000 , while Michael Deloach , another confidential assistant , saw his pay leap 29 percent , or $ 18,200 , to $ 80,000 in August .
Lauren Passalacqua , a confidential secretary , saw her salary jump $ 12,000 , or 31.5 percent , to $ 50,000 , while the salary of another confidential aide , Chardee Mendoza , was hiked $ 10,000 , or 28.5 percent , to $ 45,000 .
Disclosure of the secret pay hikes comes as Paterson is under attack for spending well over $ 20,000 in state funds on a four - day stay for himself and several aides during President Obama ’s inaugural last month , and for planning a state - funded junket to Davos , Switzerland , which he canceled only after his plans became public .
Paterson , in his budget proposal outlined in December , demanded that state workers who belong to the Civil Service Employees Association and the Public Employee Federation forgo negotiated , 3 percent pay hikes that would kick in April 1 or face massive layoffs .

The World as Wittgenstein Found It
The Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus as a Model of Autistic Cognition
Autistics think differently than non-autistics dramatically so .
Autistics do not form their fundamental cognitive framework around innate recognition of their human surroundings , as non-autistics generally do , but instead develop a cognition informed primarily by the patterns and structure to be found in the broader environment .
This form of cognition presents daunting challenges : autistics experience developmental delays relative to their neurotypical peers , and autistics mostly struggle with lifelong difficulties managing the social aspects of human behavior and culture .
But autistic cognition offers a significant compensation .
With thought processes less grooved by remnant channels of age - old species need , autistics gain potential to grasp the world in a unique manner .
Some autistics can see features of their environment previously hidden to others , many can examine underlying laws and structure with a laser - like focus , and a few manage to cast their surroundings into entirely new and creative paradigms .
Social scientists and biographers have begun to note that many of historys most innovative individuals Da Vinci , Michelangelo , Newton , Beethoven , Yeats , Einstein and Turing , to name just a few could be described as exhibiting autistic - like characteristics and behaviors , traits that may have played a critical role in their immense contributions .
Not all autistics are able to conquer the challenges of their condition well enough to receive in good measure its compensatory benefits , but for those who can , their built - in proclivity to lateral thinking serves the human population well .
The influence of autistic cognitive traits has been a major catalyst in mans dramatic leap from savannah - bound primate to questing knight of a massive universe .
In attempting to bring the features of autistic cognition into sharper focus , I can think of three different approaches to take .
The first approach would be to turn to first - person accounts from autistics themselves .
The autistic autobiographical literature has expanded greatly in recent years , with informative self - descriptions put forth by writers such as Temple Grandin and Donna Williams .
These accounts serve as enlightening introductions to the autistic experience from within .
The major drawback to relying upon first - person accounts is they come almost exclusively from functioning autistics that is , those who have come to understand elements of neurotypical cognition well enough to incorporate such elements into their own thinking and lives , using these as the means to help bridge the gap to non-autistic acquaintances and audiences .
Such incorporation of neurotypical thinking is crucial for allowing an autistic individual to gain meaningful traction in the human world , but it also leaves the functioning autistic less capable of rendering autistic cognition in its purest form .
Pure autistic cognition would in theory be more accurately described by a person with a more classic version of the condition , but alas , the characteristics of classic autism are such that the individual often faces a tremendous challenge conveying that experience to the rest of us .
The second approach to depicting autistic cognition would be to propose an unusual thought experiment .
Imagine the entire world as a form of cognition , the broad surroundingsanimate and inanimate elements both as a living , developing thought process , then condense this representation down to the workings of one mind .
This no doubt seems a strange notion , but in many ways it is this very strangeness that is the major advantage to the technique , for its unusual nature provides a sense of how vastly different is the quality of the autistic cognitive process from what we typically take for human thought .
Autistics are the closest thing we have to true tabula rasas .
Their early sensory experiences , less grounded by human - specific influences , are guided in large degree by the pattern and structure that stands out from the surrounding environment .
These characteristics are evident in the rapt attention given by autistics to symmetries , repetition and literalness , and it might be as meaningful to say the world cognates through the autistic as it would be to say the autistic thinks about his world .
The trouble with taking the world as a form of cognition is that the model is too overwhelming no one mind , autistic or not , can reflect upon the entire surroundings , but instead absorb only limited portions of it .
The worlds immensity leaves inadequate foothold to condense the representation down to a detailed and applicable form .
What is needed finally is a technique that incorporates elements of both autistic autobiography and the world as a form of cognition , while at the same time avoiding the shortcomings of the above - mentioned approaches .
What is needed is a model that can crystallize the essence of autistic cognition , in a relatively pure form , abstracting the complexities down to a framework recognizable within the confines of human language .
This task at first glance would appear to be an overwhelming challenge , so it is with no small sense of awe and admiration I offer the suggestion the job has already been accomplished , accomplished with such literary bravura the result could pass as the twentieth centurys most ambitious poem .
The autistic cognitive model par excellence is Ludwig Wittgensteins Tractatus Logico - Philosophicus .
Ludwig Wittgenstein was almost certainly autistic .
Several notable psychiatrists , such as Christopher Gillberg in A Guide to Asperger Syndrome , have written extensively about the evidence backing this assertion .
We can content ourselves here with just the highlights :
Wittgenstein did not begin to talk until he was four years old .
He continued to display language difficulties and peculiarities a slight stammer , odd prosody , persistent trouble with spelling that eased slowly only as Wittgenstein gained adulthood .
His childhood is described as one with essentially no close friendships .
Away at school , he regarded his classmates as crude and alien , and they in turn thought him odd , in part because of his insistence on addressing them with formal speech .
He took frequent pains to maintain a level of social isolation , both in the large - scale manner of long habitations in barren settings , and also in the day - to - day routines that served as miniature getaways , such as taking his meals almost exclusively in his rooms at Cambridge , avoiding the small talk at high table .
The relationships of his adult years were often tense and fragile .
Sudden breaks occasioned by perceived slights or by Wittgensteins brusque manner were a frequent theme .
Although Wittgenstein maintained some contact with his family members , he never seemed particularly close to any of them and was often annoyed at their occasional intrusions .
He required sameness in routine a repetitive style of dress , the same meal served again and again , insistence on a particular form of American detective story or Western film genre for entertainment .
His approach to work was compulsively focused .
Over his lifetime , he displayed deep knowledge and ability in a series of narrowly defined interests in engineering , mathematics , logic , music and architecture .
He would return again and again to a favorite passage of literature or to a musical work that inspired him , but showed little interest in gaining a broad knowledge in any particular field , including philosophy .
Those who knew Wittgenstein personally , admirers and critics alike , almost unanimously describe him as atypical in manner and character .
Much of Wittgensteins biography 1 reads like the zigzagging journey of a man who both required and feared solitude , and his was certainly one of the more curious and uncommon lives from the annals of the twentieth century .
His restless philosophizing , as much irritation as resulting pearl , comes across as an obsessive attempt to unearth the very root of mankinds connection to its universe a challenge , it would seem , particularly irresistible to this driven autistic .
A brief history of the development of the Tractatus shows it to be the work of an intensely focused , brutally naïve and mostly isolated young man .
Following an adolescent academic career that was undistinguished at best , and in the midst of a three - year stint of mostly unsuccessful aeronautical engineering research , Wittgenstein stumbled upon Bertrand Russells Principles of Mathematics .
The obsessive pull of the books subject matter and its unresolved questions culminated finally in Wittgenstein , at the age of twenty - two , showing up suddenly and unannounced at the door of Russells Trinity College rooms at Cambridge University .
Russell recognized almost immediately Wittgensteins immense eccentricity , overwhelming self - absorption and unrelenting drive in tackling what Russell considered to be logics , and therefore philosophys , most vexing problems .
In less than two years time at Cambridge , Wittgenstein sketched out the core of his theory on symbolic logic , and then over the following three years first in a self - imposed , spur - of - the - moment exile along a Norway fjord , and then as an enigmatic - to - his - comrades soldier in the World War I Austrian army he wrote down most of the remaining remarks and ideas that would find eventual entry into the Tractatus .
Upon pulling together the final manuscript in the summer of 1918 , Wittgenstein dropped philosophy all together , relinquished his recently inherited and enormous wealth , became a generally unpopular elementary school teacher , and did not return to formal philosophizing for more than a decade .
The Tractatus , defying considerable odds and hurdles , was published in both German and English versions in the early 1920s , and the work quickly attained its enduring aura of befuddlement , curiosity and vague admiration .
In one of the stranger incidents from the Tractatus history , the work was accepted for Wittgensteins Ph.D. thesis upon his return to Cambridge in 1929 , and at its perfunctory defense , Wittgenstein is described as having ended the session by clapping both Russell and G. E. Moore on the back , saying ,  Dont worry , I know youll never understand it ,  betraying both Wittgensteins extreme tactlessness and his unerring perception .
The Tractatus reads unlike any book before or since .
You begin to suspect this simply thumbing through its pages once or twice , and you might easily confirm the suspicion reading only the first and last sentences :
1 The world is all that is the case .
7 What we can not speak about we must pass over in silence .
2
The Tractatus is a short book by philosophy standardsless than a hundred pages in length yet the immense compression of its ideas means that a careful reading ( and re-reading ) is going to take at least several days , not just a few hours .
Herein lies the first hint that the Tractatus is making its presentation from an autistic point of view .
Nearly all its statements are put forth as declarative assertions , in a tone that leaves an impression of having walked in upon a reciting of the harmony of the spheres .
There is scarcely any attempt at defense , development , argument or persuasion .
Persuasion is a social activity ; it is a means by which two or more members of a community can bring their ideas into alignment , in a spirit of respectful cooperation .
Wittgenstein in the Tractatus not only eschews persuasion entirely , he treats it as something that cannot be meaningfully attempted .
The truth of the books assertions , as is suggested in its preface , is unassailable and determined by inspection take it or leave it as you wish and at your own peril , the author would appear to say .
We can assume Wittgenstein would not have been very helpful on a book tour .
The Tractatus is more revealing as a work of abstract autobiography than it is as a treatise on symbolic logic or language .
Such a statement goes against the grain of the usual scholarly approach , which more typically regards the book as concerned primarily with the foundations of logic and mathematics , an extension of the treatments given those subjects by Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege near the turn of the century .
The remarks in the Tractatus on topics such as psychology , ethics , aesthetics , death , God , solipsism and the mystical are often treated by reviewers with a kind of awkward embarrassment , as though the statements had wandered in by accident and were conspicuously out of place ( although not without a certain charm of their own ) .
It is indeed true that a good portion of the Tractatus is devoted to Wittgensteins radically unique development of propositional logic , but he himself leaves numerous clues that this technical material serves only as a foundational support for a much higher purpose .
The preface , for instance , hardly mentions the topic of logic , and is completely silent on the subject of mathematics .
In a letter to a potential publisher , Wittgenstein describes the Tractatus as consisting of two halves the written half containing that which can be meaningfully said , and an unwritten second half , consisting of those topics which are the most important but which cannot be meaningfully put into words , only shown through delineation .
It seems reasonably certain that this unspoken second half has little to do with propositional logic .
In the Tractatus itself , as the book nears its climax , Wittgensteins remarks on logic increasingly take a back seat to ideas that come across more forcefully , almost to the point of sounding emotional .
In one of the books more personally revealing moments , Wittgenstein notes :
5.631 If I wrote a book called The World as I found it , I should have to include a report on my body , and should have to say which parts were subordinate to my will , and which were not , etc. , this being a method of isolating the subject , or rather of showing that in an important sense there is no subject ; for it alone could not be mentioned in that book .
For me , the Tractatus is exactly the type of book Wittgenstein hints at in this passage , differing only in that Wittgensteins reports on his physical and environmental surroundings are transformed into broad abstractions , so that the resulting framework becomes universally representative .
From nearly every page , Wittgenstein speaks in a manner that suggests this is how the world looks to him , this is how he has found it , how it reflects through him , with some of the world capable of being meaningfully described with thoughts and language , and some of it , perhaps its most important elements , not .
Unable with precise sense to describe himself and his worldview , Wittgenstein attempts to show it by building a structured representation a model with logic as the foundation and propositions as the scaffolding .
If the resulting depiction does not appear to the typical reader to be in any way a familiar form of self - description , it is because Wittgensteins cognitive perception of his world is in fact in no way typical it is nearly purely autistic .
The Tractatus maintains complete silence on the subject of human relationships .
Humans scarcely get mentioned in the book other than when Wittgenstein briefly invokes a name ( Russell , Frege , Hertz , etc. ) to attribute an idea to someone .
In truth , there is only one character in the Tractatus the world .
Autistic cognition is like that .
Whereas most human beings are born with an innate ability to recognize human features in their surrounding environment and will form a cognitive framework containing a strong social element , autistics generally lack this ability , and as a consequence end up constructing a cognitive paradigm in which the human and social components mostly go missing but for which the broader environment plays a vital role .
When a neurotypical newborn opens her eyes , she sees first and foremost mom and dad and the other humans in the surroundings ; she picks out human voices from the auditory background , and has a natural affinity for the smell of people and the touch of their skin against her skin .
Thus begins a lifelong process whereby her familiarity with her own species and its members becomes the primary shaper of her thoughts and being .
By contrast , when the autistic newborn first opens her eyes , ears and other senses , she experiences an undifferentiated world , with nearly all sensory input placed on an equal footing .
Other humans are of course part of that world , but do not hold a place of priority .
Nothing holds a place of priority .
The Tractatus itself asserts this characteristic by stating that all propositions have equal value .
Every feature in the environment has equivalent potential to be an informative , shaping component of autistic cognition , and thus for autistics , right from the start , the world indeed is all that is the case .
The autistics cognitive world is not only egalitarian in the broadest possible sense , it is also highly structured .
Completely undifferentiated sensory experience would be too chaotic to navigate meaningfully .
Autistic cognition , to make developmental progress in this world , must begin to focus attention on the environmental features that stand out from the remainder .
From the initial sensory background of mostly random noise , the foreground that begins to emerge is one heavily weighted with elements that contain inherent structure and formsymmetries , repetitions , elementary patterns .
The autistic childs early stereotyped activities , such as lining up toys , spinning wheels , twirling , repetitive humming , etc. these reveal an almost overwhelming need to hone in on environmental experience that contains simple form .
From this beginning , the autistic individual will go on to assimilate environmental features displaying more complexity .
By school age , the need to find pattern in the world reveals itself most frequently as an obsessive subject of study categorization of all the dinosaurs , memorization of world capitals , complete baseball card collections organized by career statistics , and so on .
In adulthood , a functioning autistics highly structured view of his world will lead most frequently to careers notable for their organizational characteristics , such as computer programming , tax accounting or library science , although by this time , some autistics have become so adept at incorporating nearly any level of structural complexity that in truth all forms of human activity are now open for mastery thus we see autistics making marks even in such fields as literature and philosophy .
The important thing to note in observing this progression from perseveration on simple elements of symmetry and repetition in early childhood to a proficiency with the more complex , rule - oriented activities of adulthood , is that at each point along the way , the autistics cognitive framework is shaped and advanced most fundamentally by the underlying structure it uncovers from the surrounding world .
The Tractatus , in composition and content , is themed through and through with structure .
This is made evident first in the numbering scheme applied to all the remarks in the book ; each remarks number ties it structurally to the rest .
Remarks 5.121 and 5.122 , for instance , elaborate on 5.12 , which in turn comments on 5.1 , and so forth , the result being a tree structure of remarks , with the main topics at the trunk and the most detailed elaborations at the farmost leaves .
Most readers ignore this numbering scheme and read the remarks straight through , but if the remarks were organized and linked as Wittgenstein has suggested , say on a gigantic wall poster , then at just one glance the works insistence on the importance of form would be obvious .
I might suggest that looked at in this manner , the Tractatus would remind more than a few observers of the synaptic connections in a human brain .
What makes Wittgensteins contribution to the philosophy of logic so innovative is his relentless insistence on the fundamental essence of form .
The initial statement of this subject comes right at the books beginning , in the assertions that the worlds structureits facts and states of affairs is more basic than the worlds substanceits objects and things :
1.1
The world is the totality of facts , not of things .
2.011
It is essential to things that they should be possible constituents of states of affairs .
2.0141
The possibility of its occurring in states of affairs is the form of an object .
2.0231
The substance of the world can only determine a form , and not any material properties .
This argument is repeated in a different key in remarks outlining the characteristics of thought and language , where objects can only be named and that only for the purpose of being simple elements within structured propositions , where the true sense lies :
3.3
Only propositions have sense ; only in the nexus of a proposition does a name have meaning .
3.1431
The essence of a propositional sign is very clearly seen if we imagine one composed of spatial objects ( such as tables , chairs , and books ) instead of written signs .
Then the spatial arrangement of these things will express the sense of the proposition .
This last remark , along with all these assertions outlining the relative importance of structural relationships over that of substance , brings to mind a common problem that occurs with young autistics .
When confronted with a familiar room in which the furniture has been rearranged , they often react in a strong and negative fashion , in some cases melting down emotionally while demanding the room be returned to its prior arrangement .
The objects themselves have not been altered all the same sofas , chairs , lamps and tables are still in view but the objects are not what is important to the autistic mind , it is their arrangement , their structure , that makes all the difference .
For an autistic , a change in structure is a dramatic change to the world .
The remaining Tractatus development of propositional logic is not the usual dry rendering of a technical topic it plays more like a set of variations on these themes of structure and form .
There comes first the picture theory of meaning , Wittgensteins exposition of how thoughts and language gain sense by sharing pictorial form with what they represent , propositions reaching out to reality like a ruler laid against it .
Later on , there is the invention of truth tables and truth polarity diagramsvisual representations designed to highlight the forms of tautologies and contradictions .
Generally in the Tractatus , Wittgenstein remains abstract and is not forthcoming with concrete examples , but he does provide a scintillating one when highlighting not only the ubiquitous nature of underlying form but also the way in which that form ties together seemingly different elements of the world :
4.014 A gramophone record , the musical idea , the written notes , and the sound - waves , all stand to one another in the same internal relation of depicting that holds between language and the world .
They are all constructed according to a common logical pattern .
4.0141
There is a general rule by means of which the musician can obtain the symphony from the score , and which makes it possible to derive the symphony from the groove on the gramophone record , and , using the first rule , to derive the score again .
That is what constitutes the inner similarity between these things which seem to be constructed in such entirely different ways .
The employment of a music metaphor seems almost overabundant here , music being the art form demonstrating at its purest the power of taking something of the worlds substanceits sound that would be meaningless in chaotic arrangement , but when linked into organized form , not only gains meaning , it often takes flight .
The same could be said of Wittgensteins development of his theory of logic within the Tractatus .
The overwhelming need to arrange the worlds randomness into predictable and organized form is the very beginning and the very essence of meaningful life for the autistic mind .
Logic in the Tractatus is given its final statement when Wittgenstein outlines the general form of propositions and operations in remarks 6 and 6.01 .
Although the symbolism might at first appear to be terse and cryptic , the idea being expressed is actually quite simple : using these general forms , all complex propositions can be constructed , precisely and organically , out of the simple propositions .
Such an approach mirrors that of the autistic developmental process , from its uncovering of elementary pattern in childhood to its ever - building complexity of fact formulated in maturity .
More importantly , this constructed rendering of the world both determines its range and sets the limit on that which can be meaningfully said and thought .
Unlike non-autistics , who can be described as having access from birth to well - established templates of human and social convention , and who therefore can be seen as more open to concepts assumed to be given or self - evident , autistics tend to take the world only as it literally comes to them and as it can be constructed from its elementary facts .
This distinction between what can be assumed and what can only be experienced was often the subject of some amusing , yet intense debates between Russell and Wittgenstein , an argument that spills over at times into the Tractatus and Russells introduction to it .
Russell in his later years would often tell the story of how he would put on a great show of looking under all his chairs and opening all his desk drawers , trying to get Wittgenstein to accept the proposition that there was not a rhinoceros in the room , or at other times making three ink splashes on a piece of paper and asking Wittgenstein to agree that there were now at least three objects existing in the world , that at least that much was self - evident .
Wittgenstein would never budge .
It was not the absent rhinoceros or the three marks on the page he was objecting to , it was the notion that things could so easily be described as self - evident or that the world might be rolled up into a nice , neat package and talked about as though it were a non-constructed , given thing .
Such a stance might appear to some as overly obstinate , but Wittgensteins earnestness can be assumed from the fact he went to such great lengths to formalize his position .
With the self - evident and non-constructed propositions placed out of bounds , the Tractatus assigns many of philosophys traditional routes of inquiry to the waste bin of nonsense .
Wittgenstein describes philosophy not as a body of doctrine , but as an activity , a practice of elucidation .
6.53
The correct method in philosophy would really be whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical , to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions .
Included among these signs that Wittgenstein proclaims are seldom , if ever , given proper meaning are those related to talk of a subject , soul and human mind .
The Tractatus elucidation on these topics comes complete with metaphor and picture :
5.641 What brings the self into philosophy is the fact that  the world is my world .
5.632 The subject does not belong to the world : rather , it is a limit of the world .
5.633
Where in the world is a metaphysical subject to be found ?
You will say that this is exactly like the case of the eye and the visual field .
But really you do not see the eye .
And nothing in the visual field allows you to infer that it is seen by an eye .
5.6331 For the form of the visual field is surely not like this
That simple picture , with its eye removed , by analogy represents the entire world , with no subject contained within it but defined instead by its boundary an image of the world as a form of cognition .
Wittgensteins analysis denying the simple subject appears both to anticipate and to demonstrate todays most frequently cited explanation for the autism pathology theory of mind deficit .
This hypothesis was first put forth by researchers Simon Baron - Cohen , Alan M. Leslie and Uta Frith in a landmark 1985 paper in which its authors describe , complete with compelling experimental evidence , how most autistics are fundamentally delayed or impaired in their ability to ascribe various forms of thought and belief a mind , in other words to other humans and even to themselves .
Theory of mind deficit remains one of the more highly influential descriptions of autism in todays medical and research practice .
In the only section of the Tractatus that gives consideration to what we might regard as typical human thought , Wittgenstein sharply dismisses the prevailing view of his day , in a manner setting off a forward echo to the present day theory of mind studies :
5.541 At first sight it looks as if it were also possible for one proposition to occur in another in a different way .
Particularly with certain forms of proposition in psychology , such as  A believes that p is the case  and  A has the thought p , etc .
For if these are considered superficially , it looks as if the proposition p stood in some kind of relation to an object A . ( And in modern theory of knowledge ( Russell , Moore , etc. ) these propositions have actually been construed in this way . )
5.542
It is clear , however , that  A believes that p ,  A has the thought p , and  A says p are of the form p says p : and this does not involve a correlation of a fact with an object , but rather the correlation of facts by means of the correlation of their objects .
5.5421 This shows too that there is no such thing as the soul the subject , etc.as it is conceived in the superficial psychology of the present day .
5.631 There is no such thing as the subject that thinks or entertains ideas .
Wittgensteins argument is so compact it has been the subject of debate as to how best to interpret it , one candidate being that the entity A simply drops out in the logical analysis of the proposition .
An alternative view is that the analysis of A thinking the proposition p is just as complex as ( and sharing pictorial form with ) the analysis linking the proposition p to what it depicts in the world thus rendering A far too complex to be captured with simple words like mind or soul .
Either way , the Tractatus language is clear in that the judgment of A is not relevant in the determination of what is and what is not the case .
If the Tractatus can be understood as a model of cognition , it is a cognition that does not possess a theory of mind .
Perhaps beguiled by assertions that traditional analysis on topics such as soul , mind , good and evil is doomed to fail as nonsense , the schools of philosophy that have most frequently embraced the Tractatus have included those , such as the Logical Positivists , who have felt that language and philosophy should be restricted to explorations wandering no farther than the realm of the natural sciences , no farther than that which can be dispassionately verified through sense experience or experiment .
But Wittgenstein never showed much agreement or tolerance with this position , and for anyone who has read the closing pages of the Tractatus with seriousness , this will come as no surprise .
Although the Tractatus does formally outline a world limited by that which can be meaningfully represented in language , Wittgenstein proclaims with near religious fervor that there is nothing cold , lifeless or merely scientific about this limited world far from it :
6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world .
6.52
We feel that even when all possible scientific questions have been answered , the problems of life remain completely untouched .
6.522
There are , indeed , things that can not be put into words .
They make themselves manifest .
They are what is mystical .
6.43
The world of the happy man is a different one from that of the unhappy man .
For autistics , the external world forms the locus of their mode of perception , and thus carries the load of all the tension , emotion , drama , charm and mystery of a complex life form .
Or to turn the picture around , because of the way in which environmental experience so fundamentally shapes and informs autistic cognition , autistics tend to have a heightened sense of the worlds immanence calming and meditative at times , but godlike and thundering at others , and mystical always .
This experience of the world as self is , by Wittgensteins logic , impossible to analyze and a tremendous challenge to represent .
That the Tractatus makes the attempt to capture the experience in its entirety is remarkable , and that it nearly succeeds is nothing short of miraculous .
The story of the Tractatus ends in a long coda , notable for being perhaps still more brilliant than the exposition .
Wittgenstein was not yet thirty when he finished the work , and had lived until that age in a series of circumstances not socially typical , settings that in many ways had helped preserve the intensity of his autism .
This would change over the following decade .
Wittgenstein found himself more frequently interacting with his human surroundings trying to persuade publishers to take on the Tractatus , working as a schoolteacher in rural Austria , consulting for various Cambridge and Viennese philosophers , and even making the acquaintance of a potential mate .
As happens so often with functioning autistics who are attempting a deeper foray onto the customary paths of human society , Wittgenstein found himself more often than not uneasily failing in these efforts , and was being forced to face in all its immediacy the fundamental friction that existed between his own nature and that of the average man .
For some autistics , such moments of revelation can be paralyzing and debilitating , while for others , they can be the source of further growth and inspiration .
In a most impressive way , Wittgenstein fell into the latter category .
Upon being persuaded to return to Cambridge near the age of forty , Wittgenstein began reassessing portions of the Tractatus that now seemed increasingly unsatisfactory to him .
After a few initial attempts to patch things up in a small way , Wittgenstein embarked on a radically new approach .
To him , those portions of his philosophy now most in need of renovation were those related to the absolute insistence on the use of logic and formal structure as the basis for an ideal language , one that could reflect the essence of the entire world a world that was now less stridently his world .
In his posthumously published masterpiece , the Philosophical Investigations , Wittgenstein devotes the early part of the work to a critique of his use of symbolic logic and picture theory of meaning in the Tractatus , in many ways faulting his earlier model as being not so much incorrect as being too precise , too pure and too limited for the purpose at hand .
The critique builds to a crescendo at remark 107 of the Investigations , a passage that serves not only as the call ushering in all of Wittgensteins later philosophy , but also can be read as the heartfelt cry of a man shedding enough of his autistic armor to make contact with a mostly uncertain human world :
The more narrowly we examine actual language , the sharper becomes the conflict between it and our requirement .
( For the crystalline purity of logic was , of course , not a result of investigation : it was a requirement . )
The conflict becomes intolerable ; the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty .
We have got on to slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal , but also , just because of that , we are unable to walk .
We want to walk : so we need friction .
Back to the rough ground !
3
Wittgensteins rough ground turned into twenty plus years of further philosophical inquiry .
Although he would touch on technical topics such as the foundations of mathematics , more and more frequently Wittgensteins attention turned to psychology , human language and human understanding .
How strange and how revealing that the philosopher who in his youth had developed a formally precise cognitive model devoid of a theory of mind , would in his maturity deliver some of philosophys most potent insights into the concepts of knowledge , language , meaning , belief , certainty and doubt .
Many scholars are quick to assume that Wittgensteins later philosophy stands as a repudiation of the Tractatus ; but looked at through the lens of Wittgensteins history and his autism , the later philosophy would be more meaningfully described as an enhancement to the Tractatus , a fleshing out as it were , the placing of a more substantive human form onto what had been a bone - clean , but not fully functioning frame .
The result is a complete lifetime of philosophical work that is transcendent transcendent of all typical forms of human thought , and transcendent of pure autistic cognition , as well .
Despite deep respect for the Tractatus , I would remain hesitant to recommend it as reading to most people I think the majority would still find it more bewildering than enlightening .
No one need feel too bad about this , it is after all an unusual and challenging read .
But for those who , like me and not just a few others , have found the book at one time or another to be irresistibly fascinating without being able to quite say why , I might offer this essay as an alternative approach to its pages , one that places the reader more squarely behind Wittgensteins own eyes the eyes of an autistic .
Viewed from this perspective , one can almost hear Wittgensteins inner voice in his rooms at Cambridge , in the Norwegian isolation , and amidst the insanity at the Eastern Front demanding into his notebooks , here I am , myself as my constructed , structured world , no matter how strange that may seem .
His is a vision that in one sense is exceedingly unfamiliar , and in another is as common as the accumulated knowledge of all mankind .
Autistic cognition is an open window onto a very expansive world , and thus serves , along with the Tractatus , as a source of light for all humanity .
1. Ray Monks 1990 work
The Duty of Genius is the most informative Wittgenstein biography written to date , and has an added advantage in that Monk was apparently unaware when he wrote it of the possibility for Wittgensteins autism , so the book does not say Wittgenstein was autistic , but succeeds brilliantly in showing it on nearly every page .

This is the Oscar presentation speech , a task which is often assigned to a weirdly matched pair of stars , often in the newsreader coupling of older man and younger woman .
But with no obvious rapport , minimal rehearsal time , and with each presenter apparently yearning to prefigure their awards with their very own Hallmark - greeting - style thoughts on the nature of cinematic art , these presentations can be stilted and bizarre .
Settle down now and enjoy this extravaganza of the 10 most remarkable Oscar night presenter clips .
If you are watching this in the office , then inform your boss you will be unavailable for work for the next half hour or so .
But be warned : inhaling so much Oscar night euphoria at once can induce dizziness and hysteria .
Here it is ... the Oscar for Most Startling Performance by an Academy Award Presenter .
And the nominees are ... ( click on the blue titles to watch the clips )
1. Liv Ullmann and Roger Moore for the Best Actor award in 1973
Liv and Rog are a gloriously surreal combination .
In her speech , Liv reverently mentions the name of her great mentor Ingmar Bergman , and leaves a gap for the audience to applaud .
A chilling silence from the crowd leaves Liv no choice but to carry on with her speech , which , ironically , concerns the aesthetic importance of silence .
Rog 's smirkingly smoothie line to her : " You 're quite right … " makes him sound like 007 responding to some babe 's opinion that Martinis are better shaken than stirred .
Famously the award went to Marlon Brando , and Liv and Rog had the difficult job of responding to Native American campaigner Sacheen Littlefeather who came on to turn it down on Brando 's behalf .
2. Robert Mitchum and Sigourney Weaver for the Best Supporting Actress award in 1983
This is a classic presenter combo and Mitchum 's performance is pure gold , giving the impression that he does n't quite see what the big deal is , or indeed who Sigourney Weaver is .
But his " Winds of War " line is a killer , and when Weaver does a quintessential presenter comment —
" They are all brilliant ; I stand in awe of talent " — she gets a genial comeback from the great man .
3. Jack Black and Will Ferrell for the Best Song award in 2003
This was an interesting and potentially funny idea : taking the tune that the band strikes up when a speech goes on too long , and setting lyrics to it .
Jack and Will get reasonable laughs for this , but it's all a bit subdued , and the audience prefers quick - fire gags .
And note how , despite the comedy , Jack Black feels he has to begin the proceedings with his views on cinematic art in the time - honoured presenter style : " Songs have a magical power to transport us to a different time and place … "
He does this quite straight , though Will , taking the next line , seems to make an on - the - hoof decision to send it up a bit .
4. Walter Matthau for the Best Actress award in 1972
This is an oddity .
Walter Matthau , a great 70s Hollywood figure who has slipped from the collective memory somewhat , grinds drolly through his speech , never making much of a meal of it , never bothering to fake much of an interest in the outcome and in the end cheerfully confessing to a cock - up .
And then … oh my God !
Who is that very scary looking guy creeping up behind him ?
Is he going to hit Walter Matthau over the head ?
No , he 's just going to give Walter the envelope — perhaps the only example of a presenter not actually bringing the envelope on with him .
5. Clint Eastwood for the Best Director award in 1994
Magnificently un-awed by the whole business , Clint sounds faintly tired and bored by the task , waiting with the merest glimmer of irritation for the teleprompter to work properly and then resignedly giving up .
You can hear him sighing as the directors - in - action - clip montage is played in .
6. Frank Sinatra for the Honorary Oscar award in 1970
This goes to Cary Grant , and Sinatra begins with a smart little speech , introduces a Cary Grant clip montage but then , once he 's brought Grant on , seems utterly unable to leave him alone .
Cary Grant is ready and willing to begin his speech , but to his obvious bemusement , Frank is mad keen to do some Rat Pack - style badinage about getting slapped by dames .
For a long , long moment , Frank appears deeply reluctant to step out of the spotlight , and there is no easy way to tell him to get off .
7. Gary Cooper and Donald O'Connor for the Best Actress award in 1954
For sheer wackiness , this is hard to beat .
Donald O'Connor does the first bit of the presentation , and then introduces a filmed clip of Gary Cooper on location in Mexico ( apparently making the picture Vera Cruz ) .
Cooper does a strange long walk away from a massed rank of extras up to the camera to read out the nominees and then hands back to O'Connor for the big announcement .
O'Connor then does some clowning around on the theme of the song from Cooper 's great movie High Noon and zanily pretends to walk off without opening the envelope .
It looks like a more innocent , less solemn age for the Oscars .
8. Gene Hackman and Raquel Welch for the Best Actress award in 1973
This from a bit of a vintage year for presentations .
Raquel Welch has a rich Venusian tan so buttery and smooth she looks like she is being viewed through a pair of Foster Grants .
Her breathy speech concludes with the assertion that she is " friends " with all the nominees .
After a tiny moment to check that she is finished , Hackman , sporting some outrageous brillo - pad hair , launches into his own thoughts on the nature of talent .
As they open the envelope , Welch says : " I hope they have n't got a cause ! " — apparently a reference to the Sacheen Littlefeather moment .
To judge from the icy silence , Raquel 's gag is a little misjudged , but actually is n't bad .
9. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro for the Honorary Oscar award in 1999
This was given , controversially , to Elia Kazan .
Check out Scorsese and De Niro 's clenched body language .
They , as much as anyone , knew how unpopular Kazan was with many in the audience : the guy who snitched to the McCarthy hearings .
So the presenters are nervous , unsmiling and unrelaxed , standing bolt upright , as if facing a firing squad , hands clasped uneasily in front of them .
De Niro fluffs his lines and Scorsese is uncharacteristically stern .
When Kazan gives his speech and invites Martin Scorsese to stand next to him , Scorsese appears not to respond at first , standing directly behind him — masked .
Ed Harris , Holly Hunter and Nick Nolte are shown not applauding .
10 . Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland for the Best Actress award in 1974
Charles and Jill were married at the time , but it did n't stop them looking like two full - scale toy robots with the batteries removed , and Bronson sounds like he's on some sort of super - strength Mogadon .
The glassy - eyed teleprompter gaze is a default position for many .
The award goes to 11 - year - old Tatum O'Neal who steals the show very thoroughly with a miraculously relaxed and admirably short speech which a grownup then feels honour - bound to come on and pointlessly extend .
There you have it , then , 10 fabulous nominees .
So the Oscar for Most Startling Performance by an Academy Award Presenter goes to ... if I can just ... get this open ... Liv and Rog !!!
But then again perhaps you feel I 've missed some great presenters out ?
If you can post the relevant YouTube clip , then we can perhaps consider it for next year 's award ...
Bush administration standards for pollutants like soot are “ contrary to law and unsupported by adequately reasoned decisionmaking , ” a federal appeals court said Tuesday .
The court ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its standards for the pollutants , fine particulates , which are linked to premature death from lung cancer and heart disease and to other health problems including asthma .
When the agency embraced the standards in 2006 , its own scientific staff rejected them as too lax .
In Tuesday ’s ruling , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the agency “ did not adequately explain ” why the standards were adequate .
The decision is “ a victory for the breathing public , ” said Paul Cort , a lawyer with Earthjustice , who argued the case for environmental groups .
The legal effort was joined by health organizations and more than a dozen states , including Connecticut , New Jersey and New York .
A leading human rights organization charges that , contrary to recent U.S. government reports that found prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , being treated humanely , they are in fact “ deteriorating at a rapid rate ” due to “ harsh conditions that continue to this day , despite a few cosmetic changes to their routines . ”
The Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) released a report [ .pdf ] on the current conditions in Camps 5 , 6 , and Echo following a press conference convened late last week by Adm.
Patrick M. Walsh , the vice chief of naval operations .
In his own report on conditions at Guantanamo , delivered to the White House , Walsh determined that conditions at the base meet the standards of the Geneva Conventions .
CCR ’s report , “ Conditions of Confinement at Guantanamo : Still in Violation of the Law , ” disputes that conclusion .
It covers conditions at Guantánamo in January and February 2009 and includes new eyewitness accounts from attorneys and detainees .
The authors address what they call the continuing abusive conditions at the prison camp , including conditions of confinement that they say violate U.S. obligations under the Geneva Conventions , the U.S. Constitution , and international human rights law .
CCR Staff Attorney Pardiss Kebriaei said the Gitmo detainees “ are caught in a vicious cycle where their isolation causes psychological damage , which causes them to act out , which brings more abuse and keeps them in isolation .
If they are going to be there another year , or even another day , this has to end . ”
“ Detainees at Guantanamo have continued to suffer from solitary confinement , psychological abuse , abusive force - feeding of hunger strikers , religious abuse , and physical abuse and threats of violence from guards and Immediate Reaction Force ( IRF ) teams , ” the report charged .
It claimed the majority of the men being detained “ are in isolation .
They go weeks without seeing the sun .
Fluorescent lights , however , remain on 24 hours a day in Camp 5 . ” According to the report , “ improvements ” cited by the military are , by and large , public relations activities rather than meaningful improvements in detainees ’ conditions .
The CCR report takes issue with two recent U.S. government pronouncements .
On Feb. 13 , Colonel Bruce Vargo , commander of the Joint Detention Group at Guantánamo , stated that “ There are no solitary confinement detention areas ” at Gitmo , and “ Detainees typically are able to communicate with other detainees either face - to - face or by spoken word from their cells throughout the day . ”
CCR attorneys say this means that the men can yell through the metal food slot in the solid steel doors of their cells when it is left open and through the crack between the door and the floor .
The organization also challenged Walsh ’s conclusion that “ all detainees are well protected from violence . ”
Walsh said guards or others who engaged in abuse were reprimanded or immediately relieved of their jobs , depending on the nature of the offense .
But Walsh ’s report acknowledged that the continued detention of prisoners who have been approved for release has spawned widespread frustration and anxiety , which has led to protests and friction with guards .
Fifty - nine detainees have already been cleared for release but remain at the prison because the U.S. says it cannot find countries to accept them .
“ We conclude that certainty regarding the detainees ’ future has a direct correlation to detainee behavior and , therefore , conditions inside the camp population . ”
Walsh led a 13 - day investigation at the military prison , interviewing staff and detainees and conducting announced and unannounced inspections round the clock .
He said he substantiated allegations of abuse that included insults and the preemptive use of pepper spray .
Walsh ’s report focused on current conditions at Guantanamo and was not an attempt to review its seven - year history .
But CCR and other human rights and civil liberties groups said that solitary confinement has led to the deterioration of the physical and psychological health of detainees , some of whom are force - fed because they are on hunger strikes .
A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross , the only organization with unfettered access to the prisoners , said the group supports the recommendations for increased socialization for all detainees but disagreed with Walsh ’s conclusion that force - feeding is in compliance with the Geneva Conventions .
“ For ICRC it is an issue of human dignity , ” said Bernard Barrett , a spokesman for the agency .
“ Freely made choices and the preservation of human dignity are critical . ”
Their report details multiple cases of abuse occurring in the last month and a half .
One detainee in Camp 6 wrote to his attorney in January 2009 , “ As I told you , we are in very bad condition , suffering from aggression , beating and IRF teams , as well as the inability to sleep except for a few hours .
Soldiers here are on a high alert state and if one of us dares to leave his cell and comes back without any harm , he is considered as a man who survived an inevitable danger . ”
The CCR report said hunger strikes continue among a large number of men at Guantanamo .
“ Hunger strikers are brutally force - fed using a restraint chair and often unsanitary feeding tubes , and are beaten for refusing food , a practice that continued within the last month and a half . ”
Force - feeding hunger strikers is considered by the World Medical Association to be a violation of medical ethics and has continued unabated since President Barack Obama ’s executive order to close the prison .
“ Detainees are still denied access to communal prayer , ” the CCR report said .
“ Military officials continue to classify hearing a call to prayer through a food slot as communal prayer , which does not comport with the requirements of Islam . ”
It adds , “ There has been no Muslim chaplain at Guantanamo since 2003 , despite repeated requests . ”
The report also charged that detainees are “ subject to body search procedures that require the men to subject themselves to a scanner that visually strips the men naked each time they leave their cells for attorney meetings or recreation .
This humiliating and degrading experience , particularly given the men ’s strong religious background , has led them to stay in their cells all day , refusing attorney meetings and recreation entirely . ”
The CCR report recommends closing Camps 5 , 6 , and Echo immediately , ending solitary confinement and the religious abuse of detainees , stopping the use of IRF teams and all other physical abuse of detainees , ending the feeding of individuals against their will or under coercive circumstances , allowing detainees immediate access to independent medical and psychological professionals , and ceasing the practice of forcible medication .
CCR Executive Director Vincent Warren called on President Obama to “ quickly remedy and end the Guantánamo created by his predecessor [ former President George W. Bush ] , not embrace a whitewash of it . ”
During his first week in office , President Obama ordered the Guantanamo prison camp to be closed within a year and named Attorney General Eric Holder to head a task force to review the case file of each of the 245 detainees to determine what to do with them .
About 20 prisoners were scheduled to face trials by military commission , but Obama suspended these proceedings while his administration reviews its judicial options .
CCR has been responsible for organizing and coordinating more than 500 lawyers across the country in order to represent the men at Guantanamo .

The current global recession is " the most serious for over 100 years " , cabinet minister Ed Balls has said .
Mr Balls , a former economic adviser to Gordon Brown , said it was " more extreme and more serious than that of the 1930s " , the Yorkshire Post reported .
He told a Labour conference that these were " seismic events that are going to change the political landscape " .
Shadow Treasury minister Phillip Hammond said the remarks were " staggering and very worrying " .
Mr Balls , the schools secretary , made the comments at Labour 's Yorkshire conference at the weekend , the newspaper reported .
The BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Balls and Downing Street have attempted to play down the significance of his remarks , insisting he had been pointing out the unique nature of the global financial crisis and was not predicting that the impact on ordinary people would be worse than that experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s .
According to the Yorkshire Post , he said : " The economy is going to define our politics in this region and in Britain in the next year , the next five years , the next 10 and even the next 15 years .
" These are seismic events that are going to change the political landscape .
" I think that this is a financial crisis more extreme and more serious than that of the 1930s and we all remember how the politics of that era were shaped by the economy . "
Mr Balls , MP for Normanton , added : " We now are seeing the realities of globalisation , though at a speed , pace and ferocity which none of us have seen before .
" The reality is that this is becoming the most serious global recession for , I 'm sure , over 100 years as it will turn out . "
' Unprecedented '
For the Conservatives , shadow Treasury minister Phillip Hammond said : " This is a staggering and very worrying admission from a cabinet minister and Gordon Brown 's closest ally in the Treasury over the past 10 years .
" We are being told that not only we are facing the worst recession in 100 years , but that it will last for over a decade - far longer than Treasury forecasts predict . "
He added : " Is Ed Balls spilling the beans here and telling us that the government sees the situation as slightly more serious than they have tried to portray ? "
Government ministers are oscillating between complacent optimism and this doom - laden picture of Armageddon
Vince Cable , Lib Dems
Nick Robinson 's blog Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable contrasted Mr Balls ' assessment with comments from fellow minister Baroness Vadera , who recently said she could see " green shoots " of economic recovery .
He said : " Instead of giving clear and consistent leadership , government ministers are oscillating between complacent optimism and this doom - laden picture of Armageddon .
Surely the truth lies between the two ? "
A spokesman for Mr Balls insisted that the prime minister and Chancellor Alistair Darling had highlighted the " unprecedented speed and ferocity " of the crisis " time and time again " .
He said : " The unprecedented global nature of this crisis and its impact on the global financial sector is affecting every single economy in the world .
" The Bank of England agrees with this analysis .
As the deputy governor of the Bank of England , Charlie Bean , said in October : ' This is a once in a lifetime crisis , and possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history . "
'
He added the minister had been referring in his speech to the differences between Labour and the Conservatives on the economy .
Last week , Mr Brown used the word " depression " during prime minister 's questions , but his spokesman later said this had been a slip of the tongue .
The Conservatives urged him to clarify his comments and be careful with language .
The Commons Treasury Select Committee is due to question the bosses and former bosses of the UK 's biggest banks on Tuesday and Wednesday over the causes of the financial crisis .

ESPN recently conducted a poll of NHL Players in which they asked , “ Which player complains the most on the ice ? ”
The verdict by an overwhelming margin , Sidney Crosby .
They also asked a question , “ If you could change lives with another player , who would it be ? ”
The answer on that one ?
You guessed it , Alex Ovechkin .
The two squared off on Sunday in a nationally televised game , and Ovechkin and the Caps got the upper hand with the 5 - 2 victory .
However the goals were n’t the most entertaining part of the game .
That came towards the end of the second period , when this happened :
Apparently Sid “ the Kid ” was upset about what he called a cheap shot by Ovechkin in their last game in January .
Need we remind Cindy of his groin punching incident against Atlanta , or his Face - Off attack of an opposing player against Florida ?
Per usual , Ovechkin provided some great quotes after the game .
Read the story over at Capitals Insider for more :
“ What I can say about him ?
He is a good player , but he talks too much . ”
“ What , I ca n’t play hard against him ?
What is he going to do , cry ? ”
Going into the game , I made a bet with Pittsburgh Sports Blogger Tecmo of PSAMP ( Pittsburgh Sports and Mini Ponies ) .
The winning side would get to create a post on the other person ’s site .
Since the Capitals thoroughly demolished the Penguins 5 - 2 and chased Fleury from the pipes , we won the bet .
So my post should be up on PSAMP later today .
I thought they would enjoy some video highlights .
Childhood , says a report out this week , is in crisis – and it is , of course , the adults ' fault .
We 're too selfish , we pursue our own success at the expense of everything else , and we do n't care enough about the messages we pass on to young people .
The report – published by the Children 's Society , a charity – does n't specifically point the finger of blame at the country 's parents ... but since we 're clearly adults , and clearly the adults who most influence our children , it 's also pretty clear we 're in the dock .
And heaven help us if we 're trying to bring up kids on our own , or if we 're women who are trying to do it alongside doing paid work .
It 's all bad , bad , bad , says the report ( as are too many ads on the telly when little people are watching , too much sugar in their food , and too much teenage sex ) .
But why are n't Britain 's parents marching on the Children 's Society 's HQ ?
( Incidentally , the organisation has close links to the Church of England , which may explain its conservative and , frankly , fairly joyless tone . )
And what was the society thinking ?
We all know about sugar and sex and too much telly .
The report bashes us over the head with a quaint message about the good old days of family life that never really were .

But I know why there 's no mass protest at the Children 's Society .
It 's because – like the selfish schemers we are – we 're all too busy .
Busy feathering our nests , planning our next career move , organising our next solo jolly ?
Not exactly – we 're busy doing the weekly shop , sorting out emergency childcare when the school phones to say snow has stopped lessons , and getting through the mountains of washing .
The truth is that organisations like the Children 's Society can say what they want about parents – we 're all too up to our eyes in the reality of bringing up our kids to defend ourselves .
So the pillorying goes on , the misguided portrayal of single parents ( who are far too busy to tell it like it is ) continues ; the stereotyping of working mothers goes unchecked .
Meanwhile , a great opportunity is lost .
Because , while parents are working selflessly out here to raise our children , we are open – very open – to ideas about how to do it better .
I have four children , all daughters , aged seven , 10 , 14 and 16 .
Raising them , as a full - time ( home - based ) working mother , with a husband who 's a full - time ( office - based ) working father , is n't a 24/7 bowl of cherries .
What I 'd like to hear is n't more about what 's going wrong ; it 's an acknowledgement that an awful lot is going right , and ideas on how to do our parenting even better .
So , in the absence of much direction at all from the Children 's Society about the nitty - gritty of raising kids , and in the spirit of a mother who 's been around the block a few times with her brood but whose own parenting technique is still very much a work in progress , here are 10 suggestions for what we can , and should , do better .
Get help when you need it
There is help out there – but we 're not always very quick off the mark to ask for it .
Parenting classes , for example – some of which are run by professional therapists , though some are DIY groups with tips from a guidebook or DVD – can be a godsend .
And plenty of other services ( child psychologists , other therapists , counsellors ... ) can be accessed through voluntary organisations or through your GP 's surgery .
Too many parents believe we ought to be able to work out on our own how to do it – that because raising children is work that 's home - based , it 's not something the majority of parents feel they should need professional help with , or should have to go on a course to learn .
But that 's nonsense : we do n't need to be taught how to love our kids , but we could all benefit from a few tips on how to manage difficult situations , or a few ideas for tactics that work .
Other parents are a great source of ideas and moral support , so go online and take a look at the local support available to you on sites like www.mumsnet.com.
Communicate more with your kids
When my eldest daughter turned 13 and became a teenager , someone said to me that what she 'd need most in the years ahead was time to talk .
Not , by the way , time to listen : time to talk .
This person ( who was a psychotherapist ) suggested that I should think about how much time I could comfortably give her for talking in a day or a week , and then double it : because she would need more communication time than I bargained for .
It 's not always easy to make yourself available to communicate with your children : it 's not easy for me , with four of them , and I 'm often alone with them all evening as my husband works long hours .
But I can honestly say that – in the same way that you know you 'll never regret getting out for a walk , however much you 're up against it with deadlines – you 'll never , as a parent , regret time spent talking ( or listening ) to your children .
Engaging with them , being aware of their realities , reflecting back to them what you hear , to help them make sense of the world they 're in – these are the most important things we give our children .
And listening to your child can be truly joyful : kids are funny , they 're wise , they 're smart , and they 're interesting .
Tone down the consumerism
At last there 's something good to be said for the credit crunch !
It 's not easy raising children through tough economic times , and it may be going to get a lot more gruelling before it gets any easier .
But for families , there is a silver lining : because the truth is that the gold in families is n't having the latest iPhone or the newest games for the Wii .
The gold in families – whether they 're single - parent families , or families where grandparents are raising their grandchildren , or families with two working parents – lies in the relationships and the love they contain , and maybe a credit crunch is as good a moment as any to remind ourselves of that .
What 's more , for many of us , there 's no option : the other day we sat down with our girls and explained that , exciting though it would be to go to a Mediterranean beach in August , the truth is that we can't afford it this year .
Scotland , to be honest , did n't exactly get the thumbs - up as a substitute , especially from my two older daughters who were looking forward to adorning the sand in Abercrombie & Fitch bikinis , something that would n't quite fit in near Loch Long .
But , hey , here 's a great opportunity to find out that spending a fortune on flights and a villa with a pool is n't the only passport to a happy week 's holiday .
Fingers crossed , anyway .
Say what you mean and mean what you say
If being a parent has taught me one thing , it 's this : consistency is crucial .
In fact , in so many ways , consistency underpins being not only an effective parent , but an effective person .
No one wants to have a friend or a colleague who says one thing and does another ; no one wants to be surrounded by people who say they 'll do one thing , and then do another .
So it is with raising kids , because children need boundaries , they respect boundaries , and they feel safe within boundaries .
It 's not always easy to stick to our boundaries as parents , but it does pay off in the end .
Boundaries are a reminder , too , of another important thing about parenting ( something I often forget ) which is that they 're the kids , and we 're the adults .
Toddler tantrums are n't , I can confidently report , confined to two - year - olds : there are still plenty of them in our house , and that 's just among the fortysomethings .
Do n't forget to laugh !
Which brings me to yet another golden rule about parenting , and it's this : even when times are tough , try not to lose sight of your sense of humour .
Raising children is deeply rewarding , hugely fulfilling ... and if there 's another occupation in life that gives you as many unscripted hilarious moments , I can't think of it .
We do n't wallow enough in the sheer joy of it , and the fun , and definitely the laughter .
Do n't preach - be a role model
What we do as parents is so much more important than what we say .
From their earliest moments , our children are observing how we , their parents , behave in the world : and as they grow older , you become all too painfully aware of how much they 're modelling themselves on the behaviour you 've pioneered for them .
That 's not to say , of course , that kids are mere clones of their parents : they add plenty of elements of their own into the mix .
But remember that the way you behave now could very easily be the way they go on to behave tomorrow .
" Stop shouting from one room to another , " I said to one of my teenagers the other day , fed up with the bellowing from upstairs .
" But mum , " she said , " you do it all the time ! "
Touché .
Do n't feel bad about being a working parent
There are plenty of mentions of working mothers in the Children 's Society report , and the general tenor is that families are the worse off because of them .
The truth is , though , that working mothers are n't even an issue in the real world ( or at least , they should n't be ) .
What we do need to address is working parents ; and the reality we need to be a lot more upbeat about is how much kids can benefit from growing up in a family in which their parents work hard , and are better people because of it .
Being a working parent is n't new : mothers as well as fathers have worked since the dawn of time .
What matters is balance in all our lives : and in many families , the balance is jeopardised far more by a father who is too work - obsessed than by a mother who is spending too much time in her office .
Being a working parent means saying to your children : I 'm a person as well as a parent , and it 's important to me to be fulfilled and happy in myself as well as in parenting you .
Do n't neglect others ( especially your partner )
There 's no question about it : being a parent puts a huge strain on your relationship .
Everything , after all , changes when a baby comes on the scene : it 's all too easy for a partnership that was easy - going , fun and sexually exciting to become hard work , weighed down with domestic detritis , and sexually stale .
As your children get older and their needs become more complicated , many couples fall into the trap of concentrating all their efforts on these needs , and spend less and less time on their needs as a couple .
But you owe it not only to your children , but also to yourself , not to neglect the relationship that led to your family happening in the first place .
No child wants to see his or her parents split up , it 's true : but more than that , no relationship can flourish without a bit of attention .
So book granny to look after the kids , and book yourselves into a hotel for the weekend .
Now .
Keep a memory box
If this was a job – and let 's face it , we all know it 's a lot harder than anything anyone gets paid to do – then you 'd have regular sessions with your line manager about your progress .
You'd have the opportunity for accolades – an award here , a mention in the company report there perhaps .
You'd have certificates for how well you 'd done on the course ; you 'd have your annual bonus ( in the good times , anyway ) .
With parenting , there 's no one but you to give yourself a pat on the back , to reassure you it 's all going in the right direction , and to remind you that you 've come a long way .
So do it for yourself : and the easiest way is to keep a memory box to dip into every so often so you get a sense of the totality of the job in hand , and a sense too of how well it 's going .
My memory box is actually a collection of box files on my office shelf .
I have one for each daughter ( they 're going to get them to keep when they 're 18 ) , and I have one for my husband and me to keep , because it 's struck me that once they 're all 18 we 'll still want some momentos just for us .
Into the files I put everything from ultrasound scan photographs to labour reports , certificates , pieces of schoolwork that are particularly well done or funny or poignant , photographs of significant and happy times .
Going through my memory boxes is one of the biggest treats life has to offer , for me : it 's like delving into a celebration of all that parenthood has been about .
When I need a lift , or a reminder that this is a long journey , or when I simply need to see the wood for the trees , I reach for my memory box ...
Remember you do n't have to be a perfect parent , just a good one
My father died last week , and his funeral is tomorrow .
But , maybe strangely , this week has n't been soaked in tears or steeped in mourning for me : in fact , it 's been pretty much business as usual .
It was n't that I did n't love my father – I loved him very much indeed – and it certainly was n't that I 'm not going to miss him , because I know I 'll miss him for the rest of my life .
But what I 've realised , these last few days , is that he has managed to leave me with the greatest final gift a parent can leave to his or her child : he 's left me with no emotional baggage .
It is n't that he and I had a perfect relationship – we did n't .
It is n't that he was a perfect father , and it certainly is n't that I was a perfect daughter .
( And now I come to think of it , I would n't have wanted a perfect father anyway .
Like all loveable and interesting people , it was his faults as much as his strengths that made him the person he was . )
What my father absolutely was , and this is what we 'll celebrate tomorrow when we raise a glass of champagne to his life after his funeral , was the hardest thing anyone can ever hope to be .
He was a good enough parent : good enough for me and good enough for my siblings .
And if I have any ambition in my life , it 's to follow in his footsteps .
What I most hope is that I can be a good enough parent , too .
FLINT , Michigan --
A federal magistrate judge told Flint 's interim police chief Tuesday to keep his guns at home .
Chief David Dicks , appearing in U.S. District Court to plead not guilty to a fraud charge Tuesday , was also ordered not to carry weapons while he is free on bond .
" He is on administrative leave ( from his job and ) not required to carry a firearm , " said Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Abraham , who argued for the restriction .
" I see no reason Mr. Dicks should be any different than any other defendant before the court . "
Judges typically restrict the right to carry a firearm as a condition of bond , federal officials said , and in the case of Dicks , the interim Flint chief is no longer acting as a police officer and does not have a concealed weapons permit .
Other conditions of Dicks ' bond remained unchanged Tuesday during his arraignment on the charge of obtaining federal work force development funds by fraud .
He faces up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 if found guilty .
Dicks ' attorney Frank Manley argued Tuesday against stripping his client of the right to carry a weapon , saying Dicks has been threatened in the past and lives in a violent city .
The chief 's own son was killed in a 2008 shooting .
" It just boils down to personal safety , " Manley said .
Dicks is allowed to keep guns in his own home , Magistrate Judge Michael Hluchaniuk said .
A grand jury indicted Dicks on the federal charge he is facing last month , and he has been on administrative leave from his job as interim police chief since federal prosecutors filed a related criminal complaint against him a week earlier .
Prosecutors allege Dicks collected federal funds for security work for City Security , a private company headed by his father , while he was on the clock for the Flint Police Department or attending college classes .
City Security was a long - term contractor for Career Alliance Inc. , which has been the subject of a grand jury probe .
The company is overseen by Dicks ' father , Richard , who also oversees the city 's police and fire departments as super chief .
What Is the Best Way to Organize Files on My Mac ?
Is your Mac always cluttered with unnecessary folders and files ?
Well , you ’re not the first , and certainly not the last .
Luckily , organization is simply learned and integrated within the Mac world .
So it truly boils down to you using or not using the methods outlined within this article .
Speaking of this article , keep reading to learn how to get your mac right , and organize files .
Less Media = Less Clutter
This is a given , but many disregards it completely .
Any sort of media makes up the majority of weight and clutter on a Mac .
Mac users are notoriously known for having lots of images , movies , and other types of media – all of which easily mess up the integrity of your computer .
Keep it lean and mean .
Here ’s what media you should n’t keep locally :
Your iTunes library .
Now that wi -fi syncing , and iCloud is a thing – you no longer have to use your computer to sync your devices .
Store your music on an external Drobo , listen to podcasts on Rdio and listen to music simultaneously .
Spotify , Soundcloud , Youtube Music – are all options that can save you lots of space , and the hassle of a traditional iTunes library .
Do people even use iTunes anymore ?
Movies .
Movies take up a lot of space and quickly get lost on your mac .
Once again , you can outsource all of your needs to Netflix , Krunch , etc .
Storing files is a waste of space nowadays , everything can be streamed in better and faster quality .
Your iPhoto library .
Photos take up all of the space .
Most people have hundreds of gigs of images on their phones , and laptops .
Get an external drive , specifically for images .
Dedicate a drive to images , and have access to them – unrestricted from other distractions of a laptop .
+ most of the photos you need to show are on your phone anyway , so what ’s the point ?
Clean Up Your Dock
You can choose to hide your dock in the settings , making it appear only when dragged over with a mouse .
Limit the number of applications , accessible from it .
Do n’t have every single app there .
Only the most essential – there is no need for non-sensical apps that you never use to be on the dock .
And modify the dock to fit your current needs , and project requirements .
Let it be your toolset , not your storage facility .
Working on a book – have a notes app , writing apps , etc .
Working on design – photoshop , illustrator , etc .
Tailor to your needs .
Automate When Possible
Automation is the most blissful thing about computer usage .
You can meditate , and deplete yourself of activities that take your time and provide not much value .
For example , an app like Hazel can do all of the organization for you .
You can list , and filter folders by words – knowing what ’s in them .
You can append certain letters in front of a file name , and Hazel will know where to put the documents on your computer .
Modify Your Finder
The stock finder is bad .
It ’s like looking for a needle in a haystack .
You can go into the settings , and change the file / folder modification time so that it shows you when something has been modified or moves .
Change the viewport , add colors , and organize by specific criteria .
Folders
Try not to stack folders within each other , unless you have top - level filtering .
Do n’t have a folder called “ Web Writing ” , and then stack it with various folders of your contributions from all over the web .
Make a general folder , add a specialized folder , and organize files in the order of relevance .
When you have filtered folders , the finder has an easier time looking for files .
It ’s easier to find a letter P in an alphabet , then it is in a haystack of Ps .
Color
As mentioned earlier , Hazel can do a lot .
For example , you can set the color to files , and folders .
For example , a file that has not been opened for months can turn a certain color , so you can know to store them on a drive , instead of your computer .
Mac has 7 folder colors , so you can use those to assign to various time stamps .
For example , red – files of a year or more .
Blue – files of 1 week or less .
Yellow – apps of 3 months or less .
You can tailor to your own needs , making the visual reference work for you .
Cleanse Your Desktop and Trash
The desktop - like a gluey surface is known to attract the bulk of non-sensical file allocation .
Have a single top - level folder on your desktop , which leads to your drive , and then you can create other folders , as mentioned earlier .
Your desktop should have nothing , but that what you are currently working on .
A blank desktop is of many appeals over a cluttered one .
Now that you ’ve probably deleted a whole lot of files , cleanse your trash and keep it that way .
Files in your trash bin are files on your computer .
They still take up space .
Click the cog , and set a cleaning routine – make it cleanse it ’s vessels every 15 days .
Or whatever period you prefer .
Also , if you ’re running slow – check out this article on how to clear cache on Mac .
Organize Files Regularly
Now that you have the basics covered on Mac organization – you are well on your way to achieving a serene , and cleansed workspace .
Your Mac will thank you for its improved performance , clean aesthetic , and divine spirit .
Now it is your job to remain to the discipline , schedule organization , and cleansing regularly .
And perform it once a week .
By doing so , you will save yourself the hassle of stressing over lost files , and a cluttered mind .
Good luck !
Why would Shepard Fairey , or any other artist , want to copy an image that is already out there and claim it as his own ?
Why would he think he could get away with it ?
Forget , for the moment , the legalities :
The laws governing intellectual property rights are , after all , devilishly complex .
And put aside , if you will , the unrelated issue of whether Fairey deserves to be arrested for vandalism .
We can leave that to the defenders of private property - self - appointed and otherwise .
It 's a serious issue ; speaking as a disinterested aesthete , I would only say that , for the most part , I 'd rather look at Fairey 's attractively designed posters than the brain - pounding ads for fast - food outlets and failing banks that currently dominate the urban environment .
Indeed , being in a room filled with Shepard Fairey 's images - as is possible during his current Institute of Contemporary
Art show - makes you immediately aware that he does more to transform the images he appropriates than many are prepared to acknowledge .
The famed Obama poster may well be based on a crisp but generic - looking image by an Associated Press photographer ; but Fairey has done so much to it - from its underlay of newsprint and decorative patterning to the coloring and its distillation into a simplified graphic lan guage based on sharp tonal divisions - that the resemblance is barely relevant .
Artists have copied other artists , of course , since time immemorial .
Rubens copied Titian , Manet copied Velázquez , Cézanne copied Manet .
In most cases , they were motivated by the desire to learn , or to pay homage .
In the modern age - what the philosopher Walter Benjamin famously called the " age of mechanical reproduction " - images flooded the public sphere as never before .
If , in the past , artists had looked out the window and seen a rural or urban landscape and been inspired to represent it , they now saw - yelping for attention and crowding out trees , bricks , and mortar - advertisements , typography , banners , flags , and a vast array of other signs .
All this artists treated as subject matter .
How could they not ?
Just like landscapes in nature , these urban , signposted landscapes were internalized , so that the exhortations to commercial exchange or political engagement they carried became part of artists ' mental landscapes - nourishing memory , longing , hope , obedience , rejection , irony , and every other kind of human response .
Throughout the 20th century , the world of signs continued to proliferate .
When , in 1954 - 55 , Jasper Johns painted an American flag in encaustic over newspaper - just the flag as a graphic arrangement , nothing else - and presented it as his own work of art , he was not the first to treat flags as visually appealing subject matter : Manet , Monet , and Childe Hassam had all been there before him .
But , by taking the flag out of any " natural " context and treating it as a sign - a sign , and also , confusingly , a thing - Johns was taking the next logical step .
At once mute and full of mystery , Johns 's flag had something arbitrary about it .
Like his paintings of targets and numerals , it seemed to have been plucked at random from a network of signs so charged and confusing that one 's ability to pin it down to any particular meaning teetered on the verge of collapse .
Johns 's flag chimed with people 's experience of living in a world saturated in signs , but also longing for authenticity .
Along came Pop artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein - both of whom routinely crop up in discussions of Fairey .
Both treated preexisting images ( comic strips in Lichtenstein 's case ; advertisements in Warhol's ) as objects of wit and ironic play in ways that many found enormously appealing .
Their work reflected an increasing savviness about visual signs on the part of the public - an ability to read them with skepticism and detachment even as one was seduced by them .
Many accused the Pop artists - and especially Warhol - of nihilism , and understandably so .
He favored highly charged subject matter ( celebrity portraits , race riots , electric chairs ) but his attitude was frustratingly amoral .
Crucially , though , Warhol had perceived something fundamental about imagery in the contemporary world - something that distinguished it , at least in degree , from language : that despite its great impact , it was slippery , and infinitely exploitable .
In the '70s and ' 80s , a group of artists known as " The Pictures Generation " ( an exhibition about them is opening at New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art in April ) began appropriating imagery found in advertising , film , and the art world in a more wholesale fashion .
Looking around her , one of them , Sherrie Levine , found the world " filled to suffocating .
. . .
Every word , every image , is leased and mortgaged . "
These artists were putting the very possibility of being original in doubt .
Levine is best known for re-photographing Walker Evans 's photographs from a catalog and presenting them as her own work ( Evans himself , let 's not forget , became one of America 's most celebrated photographers in part by photographing preexisting signs ) .
Another member of the Pictures Generation , Richard Prince , re-photographed images from Marlboro ad campaigns , blew them up , edited out the advertising copy and the surgeon general 's health warning , and presented them as his own work .
Given the current local brouhaha over Fairey 's appropriations at the ICA , it 's interesting to recall that the first serious overview of the Pictures artists was at the ICA in a 1986 show called " Endgame : Reference and Simulation in Recent Painting and Sculpture . "
All of the Pictures artists were hyper-alert to the ideological implications inherent in imagery .
In this , they were deeply influenced by Continental thinkers such as Benjamin , Roland Barthes , Guy Debord , and Jean Baudrillard .
With irony and parody as their tools , they believed they could " hijack " certain kinds of ideologically loaded imagery to create messages of insubordination or resistance .
Many chose to display their protest art in public spaces rather than art galleries , which they saw as compromised or cut off from the broader public .
An insight into Israeli identity
By Gilad Atzmon
9 January 2009
On 8 January , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) accused the Israeli armed forces of failing to fulfil their duty to help wounded civilians in an incident in Gaza City that it described as “ shocking ” .
The ICRC said that its staff had found four weak and scared children beside their mothers ’ bodies in houses hit by Israeli shelling in Zeitoun , just a few metres from Israeli army positions .
“ The ICRC believes that in this instance the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded , ” it said .
On the same day , the United Nations aid agency in the Gaza Strip suspended its operations following a series of Israeli attacks on its personnel and buildings .
The move came after Israeli tanks shelled a UN convoy earlier in the day , killing a UN worker and injuring two others , as lorries were travelling to the Erez crossing to pick up humanitarian supplies meant to have been allowed in during a three - hour ceasefire .
Two days earlier , on 6 January , at least 40 Palestinian civilians , including a number of children , were killed and 55 others injured when an Israeli tank attacked a United Nations - run school in Gaza in which the civilians had been sheltering .
At least 763 Palestinians , including more than 200 children , had been killed and 3,121 others wounded since the start of Israel ’s latest aggression against Gaza on 27 December 2008 .
Below , Israeli - born musician and writer Gilad Atzmon , who has renounced his Jewishness and Israeli nationality , examines the deep religious and cultural foundations of genocide , violence and hatred in the Israeli identity .
You will chase your enemies , and they shall fall by the sword before you .
Five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight ; your enemies shall fall by the sword before you .
( Leviticus , Chapter 26 , verses 7 - 9 ) When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations … then you must destroy them totally .
Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy .
( Deuteronomy 7:1 - 2 ) … do not leave alive anything that breathes .
Completely destroy them … as the Lord your God has commanded you …
( Deuteronomy 20:16 )
There is not much doubt among biblical scholars that the Hebrew Bible contains some highly charged , non-ethical suggestions , some of which are no less than a call for genocide .
Biblical scholar Raymund Schwager has found in the Old Testament 600 passages of explicit violence , 1000 descriptive verses of God ’s own violent actions of punishment and 100 passages where God expressly commands others to kill people .
Apparently , violence is the most often mentioned activity in the Hebrew Bible .
The Hebrew Bible ’s saturation with violence and extermination of others may throw some light on the horrifying genocide conducted momentarily in Gaza by the Jewish state .
In broad daylight , the Israeli armed forces are using the most lethal methods against civilians , as if their main objective is to “ destroy ” the Gazans while showing “ no mercy ” whatsoever .
Interestingly enough , Israel regards itself as a secular state .
Ehud Barak is not exactly a qualified rabbi and Tzipi Livni is not a rabbi’s wife .
Accordingly , we are entitled to assume that it is n’t actually Judaism per se that directly transforms Israeli politicians and military leaders into war criminals .
Moreover , early Zionists believed that , within a national home , Jews would become “ a people like any other people ” , i.e. civilized and ethical .
In that very respect , Israeli reality is pretty peculiar .
The Hebraic secular Jews may have managed to drop their God — most of them do not follow Judaic law and are largely secular — yet they collectively interpret their Jewish identity as a genocidal mission .
They have successfully managed to transform the Bible from being a spiritual text into a blood - soaked land registry .
They are there , in Zion , i.e. , Palestine , to invade the land and to lock up , starve and destroy its indigenous habitants .
Accordingly , it seems as if the artillery commanders and Israeli air force pilots that erased northern Gaza two nights ago were following Deuteronomy 20:16 — they indeed did “ … not leave alive anything that breathes ” .
But one question is left open : why should a secular commander follow Deuteronomy verses or any other Biblical text ?
Some very few Jewish voices within the left are insisting upon telling us that Jewishness is not necessarily inherently murderous .
I tend to believe that they themselves consider their words as genuine and truthful .
But then one may wonder : what is it that makes the Jewish state ’s brutality without parallel ?
The truth of the matter is actually pretty sad .
As far as we can see , Zionism is the only secular ideological and political Jewish collective around and , as it happens , it has proved once again this week that it is genocidal to the bone .
As far as genocide is concerned , the difference between Judaism and Zionism can be illustrated as follows : while the Judaic Biblical context is soaked with genocidal references , usually in the name of God , within the Zionist context Jews are killing Palestinians in the name of themselves i.e. the “ Jewish people ” .
This is indeed the ultimate success of the Zionist revolution .
It taught the Jews to believe in themselves .
To believe in the Jewish state .
“ The Israeli ” is Israel ’s God .
Accordingly , the Israeli kills in the name of “ his or her security ” , in the name of “ his or her democracy ” .
The Israelis destroy in the name of “ their war against terror ” and in the name the of “ their ” America .
Seemingly , in the Jewish state , the Hebraic subject reverts to mass killing as soon as he finds a “ name ” to associate with .
This does n’t really leave us with too much room for speculation .
The Jewish state is the ultimate threat to humanity and our notion of humanism .
Christianity , Islam and humanism came along with an attempt to amend Jewish tribal fundamentalism and to replace it with universal ethics .
Enlightenment , liberalism and emancipation allowed Jews to redeem themselves from their ancient tribal supremacist traits .
Since the mid-19th century , many Jews had been breaking out of their cultural and tribal chain .
Tragically enough , Zionism managed to pull many Jews back in .
Currently , Israel and Zionism are the only collective voice available for Jews .
The past 12 days of merciless offensive against the Palestinian civilian population does not leave any room for doubt .
Israel is the gravest danger to world peace .
Clearly , the United Nations made a tragic mistake in 1947 by giving a volatile , racially - orientated identity an opportunity to transform itself into a national state .
However , the United Nation ’s duty now is to peacefully dismantle that state before it is too late .
We must do it before the Jewish state and its forceful lobbies around the world manage to pull us all into a global war in the “ name ” of one banal populist ideology or another ( democracy , war against terror , cultural clash and so on ) .
We have to wake up now before our one and only planet is transformed into a bursting boil of hatred .

Nutrient supplements are widely used today but we often miss finding the key nutrients we really need and waste our money in the process .
As a health conscious consumer we need to know how important it is to take a personal approach to your overall health and well - being .
As a former Professional Athlete I tried everything under the sun .
The newest or best nutrient supplements to hit the market were in my locker .
I found out over time I was simply guessing on what my body needed .
Sure having 5 - 10 bottles on the shelf and taking something was better than nothing but I was choosing products that were not specific to my own needs .
I was taking too much of some ingredients and not enough of others .
In most cases I was relying on other people telling me what work for them or what the people at the local nutritional store thought was their best supplement .
Even worse , the teams over the years that I played for , were giving out nutrient supplements and had no idea if it was good or not .
Teams were simply buying them because they were economical .
I wanted the piece of mind knowing I was feeding my body the ultimate formula to help me maintain optimal health .
There are so many variables to your health
The food we eat today is different from lets say , just 50 years ago .
The water we drink is much different .
The environment is not like it used to be .
All these factors break down the Human body .
Through research , scientists recently confirmed that each of us has unique body chemistry .
Our health is a result of Interactions between our genes and lifestyle factors .
It is our genetic make - up that determines which nutrients are used and how they are used .
By taking nutrient supplements , science has proven you can have positive impact on how your genes work and compensate for areas in which your genes are not functioning .
My name is Trace Coquillette and I am a retired Professional Athlete .
It is now possible through science and technology to personalize a complete supplement system based on your own DNA .
We can send you a DNA assessment right to the privacy of your own home .

I love zombies .
I love the slow , unthinking masses from hell that swarm unsuspecting folk holed up in malls or farmhouses .
While I enjoy movies like 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead ( 2004 ) , I am a bit of a purist .
So when I heard that Max Brooks , author of “ The Zombie Survival Guide , ” had written a book about a worldwide zombie outbreak , I was excited .
And when I found out it was being turned into a movie , I got jazzed and bought the book .
Just as I suspected , the novel is filled with old - school zombies and their never ending quest for flesh .
These zombies lumber , and they groan , and they wo n’t stop until their body is 100 % incapacitated or their brains are destroyed .
A few pages in to this immense horror epic , though , concern began to wash over me .
How will they ever pull this off in a major motion picture ?
The setup of the novel is simple .
We follow a journalist as he interviews survivors from the now 10 - year - finished zombie war .
Using this device , we get first - hand accounts of every major event and a great window into how this kind of a conflict would probably play out .
Realism is the name of the game , and the detail Brooks gives about human response to such an outbreak is where 95 % of the book ’s chills come from .
The interviews start with the first outbreak and end with the final cleanup of the last remnants of zombie - dom .
The novel goes all out , introducing us to all the events and players from the United States President to the captain of a Chinese submarine to a kid in Japan on his computer .
The greatest thing about the novel , though , is the way it introduces us to the organic evolution of the new warfare geared toward zombies .
There are explanations of why standard warfare failed and the invention of new weapons , new procedures , new thoughts and ideas and phenomena that have never been explored within a zombie universe .
This kind of shit excites be because it is new and fresh within a very stale genre .
But I do n’t know how these , my favorite elements of the novel , will translate to film .
Brooks seems so interested in his “ what if ” premises that he actually takes us into the behind - the - scenes politics of the time .
He shows us the evolution of a wartime society , all with characters waxing philosophical and historical about the events of the past twenty years .
It reads like a fascinating history book with tons and tons of ( interesting ) exposition .
My big concern , then , is that a filmic adaptation of this would end up being just another zombie movie with lots of battles , jettisoning the nuance of the books in favor of a Night of the Living Dead remake taking place on seven continents .
The other huge challenge with the book is this : there are dozens of narrators , and none of their stories are fully developed and resolved .
In the novel , this works great .
You are allowed , as a reader , to be exposed to a number of different aspects of wartime society without dwelling on any one character .
The “ story ” is a history and an analysis of social patterns and phenomena .
We never follow one character too long as each one exists to illuminate a specific set of zombie - war - phenomena .
In a movie , though , I get the feeling we are going to get parallel storylines with a number of key players in the book .
I suspect their story arcs will get fleshed out with backstories , build up , and conclusions .
Within this framework , though , I ’m afraid all the great details and academic exploration will be lost .
The third and final “ unfilmable ” element to the novel is this : it never follows a three - act structure .
Instead , it follows the honest arc of a real conflict .
Yes , there is the outbreak moving slowly across the globe .
There are the survival stories , and there is even a key moment in which the world decides to “ fight back . ”
But the last half of the novel recounts how the worlds ’ armies systematically reclaim land and set up livable conditions .
It ’s more an exercise in careful extermination and city planning … not terribly filmic , but unique and great on the page .
What are they going to do with this one ?
My guess is they will excise the last section of the book and cram the entire “ retaking the world ” into the last ten minutes .
For forty - five minutes before that , we will get a huge action scene as soldiers fight the first major reclamation battle against the legions of dead and find hope to continue on the long journey ahead .
That is n’t what the book is , though .
So , in the end , I think this is probably going to be a really good zombie movie on an epic scale .
I think I will love it , it will be unique , and it will be more thoughtful than most all zombie movies out there .
But I wo n’t love it like I love the book , regardless .
Based on the budget they are throwing at this thing ( allegedly ) , it will have to be very cinematic with lots of action scenes , character arcs , and predictable horror cliches .
Which is exactly what the novel avoids .
The screenplay is being written by J. Michael Straczynski , the writer of Changeling … and not too much else , feature film wise .
From what I have heard on the internets , though , the first draft of the script was exceptionally adult and dark .
Very encouraging , but there are a lot of rewrites between now and the film ’s shoot .
Marc Forester is attached to direct , and this makes me breathe a sigh of relief .
We will have a talented , A - list filmmaker at the helm ( and not Marcus Nispel ) .
IMDB says World War Z will be released in 2010 , but I have a feeling that might get pushed back .
Because to be honest , this one feels like it ’s going to always be centimeters away from falling into development hell .
Fingers crossed it gets done … and with the care and intelligence the novel deserves .
Amazon is running a 53 % off sale on “ must have ” Blu-ray titles from Paramount Home Entertainment .
The online shopping site frequently runs Blu-ray promotions , and this is the latest effort to move some hi-def discs .
It is the perfect time to pick up The Godfather Coppola Giftset , a 4 - disc collection that usually retails for a whopping $ 124.99 , but is now available for $ 58.99 .
Titles included in the Paramount promotion include Iron Man ( Ultimate 2 - Disc Edition ) , Transformers ( 2 - Disc Special Edition ) , Tropic Thunder ( Unrated Director ’s Cut ) , Eagle Eye , Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , and The Godfather – The Coppola Restoration Giftset .
Here is a link to the Paramount Blu-ray sale .
Amazon is also running a “ Buy More , Save More ” sale where you can buy 3 Blu-ray discs and get 30 % off , buy 6 discs and get 40 % off , or buy 10 discs and get 50 % off .
There are about 70 titles to choose from , but hurry though because that sale ends Friday .
At Massachusetts General Hospital , patients whose blood pressure was in check just weeks ago now find it rocketing out of control .
They blame the economy .
At Boston Medical Center , obese patients who had been shedding weight are packing on pounds again as they resort to cheaper , high - calorie food and abandon gym memberships .
They blame the economy .
At a Framingham doctor 's office , patients forgo screening tests such as colonoscopies because they do n't want to spend scarce dollars on copayments .
They blame the economy .
In hospital wards and medical clinics across Massachusetts , doctors see growing evidence that the ill economy is making patients sick , spawning headaches and churning stomachs , and even causing bouts of anxiety and depression among people who never before sought psychiatric help .
The chief of outpatient medicine at Boston Medical estimates that financial turmoil figures into at least half of all patient visits , and at one of the nation 's premier psychiatric hospitals , McLean in Belmont , 31 percent more patients were admitted last month than in December 2007 .
" I 've been stunned by how pervasive the impact of the current economic downturn is on the health of my brood , " said Dr. Stephen Hoffmann , whose medical practice in Framingham has nearly 3,000 patients .
The economic crisis is far too fresh for any government agency or professional organization to have quantified the health consequences .
But during previous recessions , researchers linked spikes in unemployment in the United States and Europe to increases in deaths from heart disease , cancer , and psychiatric disorders .
In interviews this month with a dozen doctors , family physicians as well as specialists , nearly all said they had encountered patients suffering ailments tied to the financial collapse , with the damage wrought in sore arms , troubled minds , and neglected prescriptions .
At a Somerville clinic run by the Cambridge Health Alliance , the flagging economy , " touches us every day , " said Dr. Laura Obbard .
She sees it in the weary faces of her patients , such as Jorge Cardoza , a 52 - year - old diabetic who lost his construction job in late October .
" That was like a knockout for me , " Cardoza said .
While he was working , his blood sugar level , a key indicator of how well diabetics are faring , remained safely low .
" Now , " he said , " I see my sugar level is very high .
That never happened before .
That worries me a lot . "
In part , that could be because he 's not getting as much physical activity .
His job was strenuous , and he used to exercise at a gym , until financial pressures forced him to cancel his membership .
Research has shown that regular exercise can dramatically improve diabetes symptoms .
And stress can make them worse .
During the past few months , Dr. Randall Zusman has noticed something disturbing in his practice at Mass .
General , where he tends to adults with recalcitrant high blood pressure .
About a dozen patients who had been doing well suddenly had elevated readings .
According to Wikipedia , revision of the 常用漢字 ( Jōyō kanji ) was first proposed in February 2005 and work began in September of the same year .
Three years later , there was news as recently as last month of a tentative list to be released in February of 2009 .
The new list is currently said to have removed 5 kanji and added 188 new ones , bringing the new total from 1945 to 2128 characters .
The new additions apparently also include the “ controversial ” character 「 俺 」 .
Personally , it seems crazy to not include it based on how often it ’s used .
And what is so controversial about 「 俺 」 anyway especially considering the fact that they ’re adding kanji like 「 勃 」 and 「 淫 」 ?
That ’s just my opinion in any case and I think the difficulty they are having in determining the criteria for what goes in the list is indicative of fundamental problems with the whole idea behind the list in the first place .
Never let the 常用漢字表 tell you which kanji to learn or not learn
What is the purpose of the 常用漢字表 anyway ?
To tell you which kanji to learn ?
So I ’m supposed to learn 「 斤 」 , some obscure unit of measurement but not the kanji for the word “ who ” （誰） ?
That makes perfect sense , right ?!
Also , why did they even have the removed characters （銑・錘・勺・匁・脹） in the first place ?
Was “ pig iron ” commonly used at some point in time ?
I mean , the list came out the year I was born and I do n’t think I ’m THAT old .
And why have n’t they removed stuff like 畝 or 逓 yet ?
I do n’t think they come even close to falling in the category of “ common usage ” no matter how you define it .
And now , almost 30 years later they ’re finally going to add kanji for words like “ smell ” （匂い） , “ loose ” （緩い） , “ nail ” （爪） , and “ butt ” （お尻） in 2010 ?
What kind of crap list were we using all these years ?
The list burned me personally when I bought my first kanji dictionary .
It only had the 常用漢字 because after all , that ’s all we need to know , right ?
Well , one of the FIRST words I encountered in my self - study was 「 瞳 」 and guess what , it ’s not in the list !
If I had known better , I would have never wasted money on anything that only covered the 常用漢字 .
Thankfully , I later found an online dictionary that did n’t use the 常用漢字表 as an excuse to be lazy and saved me from quitting Japanese in frustration .
For comparison , the 漢字源 in my Canon G90 has 13,112 characters , almost 16 x what my first crap dictionary had .
Do n’t fall into the trap of learning from a list
In my opinion , the worst problem with the list is that it fools innocent learners such as you and I into thinking we should use it somehow in our studies .
The thinking goes , “ Hey here ’s a list of ( supposedly ) common kanji .
I should make up some index cards and memorize them one by one . ”
However , what many beginners do n’t realize is that you have to be some kind of super - genius to memorize 1945 characters with absolutely no context .
Even if you DID somehow manage to memorize them all , you ’re not learning any real words , you have no idea which readings are used and when , and you have no sense of when and how it ’s used .
Where ’s the reading material , vocabulary , and conversation practice ?
It ’s like putting the cart before the horse AND sitting in the seat backwards .
The first character on the list is 「 亜 」 for crying out loud !
For all you know , that ’s the most useful character in the world when in fact I have never used it in all my years of study .
Do YOU write 「 アジア 」 and 「 アメリカ 」 as 「 亜細亜 」 and 「 亜米利加 」 ?
I sure hope not !
I thought for a second that maybe it ’s used in the word 「 唖然 」 but no , not even !
If anything , 「 唖 」 belongs in the list much more than 「 亜 」 if you ask me .
Obviously , they never consulted me ( I was - 2 months old at the time ) and no , it ’s not in the list .
Conclusion
I do n’t know , maybe the list has some good uses for educators , policy makers , publishers , and whatnot .
It ’s certainly better to have an improved version over the crappy one we have now .
But I ca n’t help but think it was overused throughout the years and caused more harm than good for people learning Japanese .
Personally , I think we would have been better off without the damn list in the first place .
The bottom line is whatever new list they come up with and no matter how “ good ” it is ( whatever that means ) , we should always think of it as a guide and never forget to use good ol ’ common sense .
With the possible exceptions of love , sex , and slaying mythical beasts , no topic has commanded the attention of song - writers throughout history more than death .
From Metallica's " Enter Sandman " to The Shangri - La 's " Leader of the Pack " and even as far back as Beethoven 's " Deathstomp 9 in D minor " , the great beyond has been the inspiration for some of the most compelling songs ever written .
If you think I 'm making up the title of that Beethoven number , by all means , go ahead and Google it , I 'll wait .
Did you do it ?
Wow , you are a gullible one , are n't you ?
Anyway , while songs about death come in all styles and genres , there is one thing most of them have in common ... listening to them will bum you right the hell out .
And why not ?
The songs are about dying .
That 's rarely cause for celebration .
But there are exceptions .
Today , we celebrate seven songs about death that are guaranteed to liven up any party .
Even if they do n't mean to .
7. Elton John - " I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself "
This Elton John classic from 1972's Honky Chateau album certainly does n't go to any great lengths to hide its dark subject matter .
The title pretty much tells you everything you need to know .
But give the song a listen and you 're sure to be asking yourself one question .
What the hell is he so happy about ?
It 's not just that it's one of the Rocket Man 's happier tunes .
It 's more that it 's quite possibly the most chipper he 's ever sounded on record .
The song is so breezy and lighthearted it makes " Philadelphia Freedom " sound like a Slayer tune .
The major key chord sequence and catchy - as - all - hell melody would be more than enough to qualify the song for inclusion on this list , but right about the time that you think things can't possibly get any more sunshiny sounding , you find yourself staring down the business end of a tap dancing interlude .
Tap dancing .
On a song about suicide .
Because it was released in 1972 , an actual music video for the song was n't available .
While there were better quality video clips out there , I settled on the one below because of the overwhelming enthusiasm displayed by the tambourine player accompanying Elton on stage .
While most people treat playing the tambourine like an afterthought , this guy treats it like a mission from God .
It adds a nice extra bit of " what the hell ?!?! " to the performance .
Unfortunately , the tap dancing solo is n't included , but fret not , Mr. Tambourine Man brought along a xylophone .
6. Bright Eyes - " Four Winds "
Nothing says " hoedown " quite like an opening fiddle riff .
And the fiddle solo that opens Bright Eyes ' " Four Winds " is a doozy .
This is the type of swinging tune that rednecks have been line dancing to for decades .
But it 's highly unlikely that any Texas two stepping has ever gone down to a song that can't even make it a full five lines before breaking out the lyrics about " people always dying " and " bodies decomposing in containers . "
And it just gets better from there .
" Four Winds " is n't so much just about death as it is full - on apocalypse .
Later verses feature happy - go - lucky lines like " the Bible 's blind , the Torah 's deaf , the Koran is mute .
If you burn them all together you 'd get close to the truth . "
Note to Muslim extremists : he said it , not me .
By the time the lines about genocide in South Dakota roll around , most people would probably find themselves a little down in the dumps if not for the fact that they 're probably too busy whistling along to notice .
If you 've never heard this song , make sure to give it a listen .
I can all but guarantee that it will be a long time before you hear " when great Satan 's gone , the whore of Babylon " sung with such funtastic enthusiasm .
The video for " Four Winds " raises a number of questions itself , not the least of which is " why did the audience bring so much garbage to the show ? "
Pay special attention around the 2:34 mark when someone hurls a pair of fuzzy dice on stage .
Awwww .
5. Smashing Pumpkins - " Today "
Today ?
It 's the greatest day you 've ever known ?
Wow , that 's great Billy !
How come ?
Oh ?
Oh .
Oh my .
To call anything by the Smashing Pumpkins " upbeat " may seem like a stretch , but on " Today " Billy Corgan 's half singing , half caterwauling whine sounded deceptively positive .
As promising as " the greatest day I 've ever known " may sound , it 's really anything but .
You see , the reason today is such a great day is because tomorrow ain't coming .
Things have gotten so bad that the song 's protagonist is planning to kill himself .
Today is the greatest day ever , because he knows things will never be as bad as they have been ever again .
Cheers , everybody !
The video for " Today " does n't give a whole lot of insight as to why the subject of the song wants to kill himself , unless it 's distress over what has become of his beloved ice - cream truck .
It does feature Pumpkins guitarist James Iha in a dress though .
If that 's not enough to make a person want to kill themselves , I do n't know what is .
4. Norman Greenbaum - " Spirit In the Sky "
How happy sounding is this tune ?
There 's a version of it on YouTube that features the cast of The Lion King .
And I do n't mean the play .
It , literally , features Simba and all those other animated jungle beasts frolicking around while singing the line " when I die " as much as lionly possible .
It 's rumored that Greenbaum wrote this song not because he 's overly religious and can't wait to die , but instead because he was looking to appeal to a wider audience and thought a song about going to see Jesus was the way to go .
Judging from the lyrics , I 'm going to have to assume that is true .
For someone so fired up about Jesus , he 's a little bit light on religious philosophy .
What this song boils down to is a guy telling you that when he dies , he 's going to see Jesus .
This is after he dies .
And did I mention this is going to happen after he dies ?
Because , that 's when he 's going , after he dies .
Seriously , he says so right in the song ... about seventy five times .
He 's going to see Jesus .
Just as soon as he can die .
Which should happen right around the time someone finds him .
Dead .
Against all odds , there is an actual video for this song , even though it was released sometime in the late 1940's ( give or take a few decades ) .
So how is Norman Greenbaum going to die when he goes to see Jesus ?
If the camera work in this video is any indication , probably from ingesting far too many psychedelic drugs .
3. Warren Zevon - Excitable Boy
It 's doubtful that the dude responsible for " Werewolves of London " really ever wrote a song that sounded anything but joyous .
Keeping things relatively positive sounding while tackling even the most serious of subjects was part of Warren Zevon 's charm .
" Excitable Boy " takes that juxtaposition of dark subject matter and upbeat melodies to dizzying new heights .
The song couples " ooooh wahhh ooooh " background vocals and 150 % of the USDA recommended amount of saxophone with lyrics about a kid whose disturbing behavior is shrugged off with eventual disastrous results .
When he 's rubbing pot roast on his chest at dinner , he 's just an excitable boy .
When he bites the usher 's leg at a movie theater , he 's just an excitable boy .
When he rapes and murders his prom date , well , that 's just pretty messed up .
When he's let out of the mental institution ten years later , digs up the the prom date and makes a cage out of her bones , you start to wonder just what the hell is going on in Zevon 's head .
Songs like this are supposed to be sung either while strumming an acoustic guitar all melancholy like or in a cookie monster voice while playing an electric guitar tuned to drop C. But Warren Z. could never be bothered with bumming people out .
The world is a much lesser place without him .
An actual video for " Excitable Boy " was nowhere to be found .
But trust me when I say that this video , which appears to have been made using nothing other than ' The Sims 2 ' turns the overall creepiness of this song to well past eleven .
2. Celine Dion - " My Heart Will Go On ( Club Mix ) "
In its original ballad version , this song makes perfect sense .
The lyrics , while depressing as all hell , are mildly hopeful and probably provided loads of comfort to plenty of people who lost loved ones and had terrible taste in music .
But , inexplicably , Celine went the extra mile and commissioned a club remix of the song .
Because , when you 're mourning lost love , what better to do than hit the club ?
How much better would Titanic have been if , upon learning Leonardo DiCaprio had died , Kate Winslet 's character opted not to swim off and find a whistle , but instead stuck a glow stick in her mouth and stood on that wood door and started vogueing ?
How much more awesome could it get than that ?
The answer is none .
None more awesome .
I could n't find a video of Celine partying it up to her ode to lost love , but really , it 's for the best .
What I found instead is far more touching .
And by " touching " I mean totally gay .
If you 're a dude anyway .
Otherwise , it 's just kind of gay .
Apparently , someone with video editing software , too much time on their hands and , presumably , a plethora of emotional problems , decided it would be a good idea to splice together various images from the Disney movie " Spirit " and set them to the clubtacular sounds of " My Heart Will Go On . "
You know what 's more unsettling than the thought of someone making a homemade video for " My Heart Will Go On " using nothing more than clips from a Disney movie ?
Not a damn thing .
1. Kiss - " Detroit Rock City "
Has Kiss ever cranked out a song that did n't sound like its entire purpose was to get them amped up to head to a party ?
OK , except " Beth . "
The fact that " Detroit Rock City " is actually about death borders on unbelievable .
Something about that " get up , everybody 's gonna move their feet " chorus just does n't really give one an impending sense of doom .
And even if it did , the drummer is wearing kitty cat makeup .
What could go wrong ?
For the unfortunate fan that this song was written about , the answer is " a whole hell of a lot . "
The song begins with a news report that talks about , among other things , a fatal car accident .
As it turns out , Paul Stanley wrote " Detroit Rock City " about a fan who was killed while traveling to a Kiss concert .
Hell , he even found some time to mention the car accident somewhere near the end of the song , ending with the line " I know I 'm gonna die , why ? " .
But by that time , who the hell is listening to what Paul has to say ?
Anyone with a shred of metal in them should have been rocking out on the air guitar and swinging their mullet in circles well before that point .

Today the highest - price good that people buy besides their houses is their car , and this reality leads people to believe that we can't possibly let the American car industry die .
We could n't possibly be a real country and a powerful nation without our beloved auto industry , which is so essential to our national well - being .
In any case , this is what spokesmen for the big three say .
What about the time before the car ?
Look at the years between 1870 and 1930 .
As surprising as this may sound today , the biggest - ticket item on every household budget besides the house itself was its piano .
Everyone had to have one .
Those who did n't have one aspired to have one .
It was a prize , an essential part of life , and they sold by the millions and millions .
That too was new .
Americans before 1850 mostly imported their pianos .
American manufacturing was nearly nonexistent .
After 1850 , that changed dramatically with the flowering of what would become a gigantic US piano industry .
The Gilded Age saw a vast increase in its popularity .
By 1890 , Americans fed half the world market for pianos .
Between 1890 and 1928 , sales ranged from 172,000 to 364,000 per year .
It was a case of relentless and astounding growth .
They were used in classrooms everywhere in times when music education was considered to be the foundation of a good education .
They were the concert instruments in homes before recorded music and iPods .
They were essential for all entertainment .
American buyers could n't get enough , and private enterprise responded .
New York , Boston , and Chicago were the homes of these companies .
There was the great Chickering piano made by a company founded in 1823 and which later led the world in beauty and sound .
There was Hallet and Davis in Boston , J. and C. Fischer in New York , as well as Strich and Ziedler , Hazelton , William Knabe , Baldwin , Weber , Mason and Hamlin , Decker and Sons , Wurlizer , Steck , Kimball in Chicago , and , finally , Steinway .
The American piano industry was the greatest in the world , not because the Americans came up with any new and great manufacturing techniques , though there were some innovations , but because the economic conditions made it most favorable to be manufactured here .
With the rise of this industry came a vast marketing apparatus .
Piano ads were everywhere , as a tour of old magazines shows .
It was widely believed that spending money on a piano was n't really spending .
It was an investment .
The money you paid would be embedded right there in this beautiful and useful item .
You can always sell it for more than you paid for it , and this was generally true .
So people would make great sacrifices for these instruments .
With the growth of this manufacturing came an explosion of shops that served the piano market all up and down the industry .
Piano tuning was a big - time profession .
Retail shops with pianos opened everywhere , and the sheet - music business exploded with them .
Ever notice how in big cities the music stores are typically family owned and established 40 , 50 , and even 100 years ago ?
This is a surviving remnant of our industrial past .
All of this changed again in 1930 , which was the last great year of the American piano .
Sales fell and continued to fall when times were tough .
The companies that were beloved by all Americans fell on hard times and began to go belly up one by one .
After World War II the trend continued , as ever more pianos began to be made overseas .
In 1960 , we began to see the first major international challenge to what was left of the US market position .
Japan was already manufacturing half as many pianos as the United States .
By 1970 , a revolution occurred as Japan 's production outstripped the United States , and it has been straight down ever since .
By 1980 , Japan made twice as many as the United States .
Then production shifted to Korea .
Today China is the center of world piano production .
You probably see them in your local hotel bar .
And what happened to the once - beloved and irreplaceable American piano industry ?
Steinway survives to make luxury instruments that few can afford ( a reader notes that Baldwin is still around today too ) .
Mason & Hamilin has made a great comeback in the high - end market .
The rest moved overseas under new ownership or were completely wiped out .
Does anyone care that much ?
Not too many .
Have we been devastated as a nation and a people because of it ?
Not at all .
It was just a matter of the economic facts .
The demand went down and production costs for the pianos that were wanted were much cheaper elsewhere .
Now , a piano aficionado reading this will say , buddy , you are crass .
Listen to the sound of an older model Chickering and you can tell the difference .
It was warm and wonderful , nearly symphonic .
It is mellow and perfect for the best repertoire .
By comparison , this new Chinese piano is sharp and angular and pointed .
It sounds like a marimba .
You can't play Schubert or Brahms on such junk .
No one wants to hear that thing .
Bring back the old days when pianos made sounds that sounded like real music !
Well , you can still get that old Chickering sound , even from a piano made in New York .
You can buy a Steinway .
Of course you have to pay $ 50,000 plus and even as much as $ 120,000 , but they are there .
You say that is unaffordable ?
Says you .
It is all a matter of priorities .
You can forego your house and live in a tiny apartment and still own the most gorgeous instrument money can buy .
In any case , it makes no economic sense for you to demand a magnificent piano at a very low price when reality does not make that possible .
In the same way , many people will bemoan the loss of the US car industry and wax eloquent on the glory days of the 1957 Chevy or what have you .
But we need to deal with the reality that all that is in the past .
Economics demands forward motion , a conforming to the facts on the ground and a relentless and realistic assessment of the relationship between cost and price , supply and demand .
We must learn to love these forces in society because they are the only things that keep rationality alive in the way we use resources .
Without them , there would be nothing but waste and chaos , and eventual starvation and death .
We simply cannot live outside economic reality .
Let 's say that FDR had initiated a bailout of the piano industry and then even taken it over and nationalized it .
The same firms would have made the same pianos for decades and decades .
But that would n't have stopped the Japanese industry from taking off in the 1960s and ' 70s .
Americans would have far preferred them because they would have been cheaper .
American pianos , because they would be state owned , would fall in quality , lower and lower to the point that they would become like a Soviet car in the 1960s .
Of course you could set up tariff barriers .
That would have forced American pianos on us .
Except for one thing : demand would still have collapsed .
The pianos still have to have a market .
But let 's say you find a workaround for that problem by requiring everyone to own a piano .
You still can't make people play them and value them .
No one , but no one , tells the story of the Ford Motor Company like Garet Garrett .
In the end you have to ask , is it really worth trillions in subsidies , vast tariffs , impositions all around , just to keep what you declare to be an essential industry alive ?
Well , eventually , as we have learned in the case of pianos , this is not essential .
Things come and things go .
Such is the world .
Such is the course of events .
Such is the forward motion of history in a world of relentless progress generated by the free market .
Thank goodness that FDR did n't bother saving the US piano industry !
As a result , Americans can get a huge range of instruments from all countries in the world at any price they are willing to pay .
Today government is even more arrogant and absurd , and it actually believes that by passing legislation it can save the US car industry .
It can subsidize and pay for uneconomic activities , and pay ever more every year .
The government can also pay millions of people to make mud pies because mud pies are deemed to be an essential industry .
You can do this , but at what cost and what would possibly be the point ?
Eventually , even the government will have to accord itself to the reality that economics reminds us of on a daily basis .
Rumsfeld Knew His Guys Were Torturing People to Death , Which Is a Serious Crime
By Stephen Pizzo , News for Real
71 % of Americans want to see Bush investigated , and it ’s about time Obama ’s team hightailed their way over to court to start doing it .
During the Bush years Americans the boogeyman used to keep Americans cowed was the real or imagined threat of imminent terrorist attack .
Now we have a new president – and we have a new boogeyman – the economic meltdown .
Now do n’t get me wrong .
Anyone who ’s read this column over the past few years knows I ’ve been Chicken Littling about the financial house of cards for a long time .
And , now that it ’s finally collapsed , it ’s even worse than I predicted , and getting worse by the day .
Which is why Obama and his team are on the tube night and day talking about nothing else — as if Americans are concerned about nothing , which is n’t true .
71 % of Americans want to see Bush administration investigated
71 % of Americans are in favor of an investigation into the possible misuse of the Department of Justice by the Bush administration according to a Gallup poll released yesterday .
( Full Story )
That ’s a pretty startling number , even for those of us who ’ve been arguing for investigations for some time now .
After all , Obama did n’t get 71 % of the vote , which means that a lot of folks who voted for McCain also want equal justice applied equally .
One reason for this surprisingly robust groundswell for investigations may be that each day , formerly secret Bush - era documents surface that truly shock the conscience .
Just yesterday the ACLU got it ’s hands on a truly smoking gun memo written for then Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld .
This document informed Rumsfeld that those he ’d tasked with beating information out of suspected terrorists had not just tortured them , but tortured some of them , to death .
In other words , they murdered them .
No , I ’m not kidding .
Here read the original document yourself .
If Rumsfeld had been , say , some local police captain in charge of these guys , this document would make him “ “ at very least “ “ accessory - after - the - fact to murder .
He not only conspired to keep this evidence secret , but did not report this as the crime it is , nor order the perpetrators arrested , charged and put on trial .
There ’s a legal name for this crime : “ Misprison of a Felony . ” 
Defined here as :
“ The failure to perform a public duty … Misprision is a versatile word that can denote a number of offenses .
It can refer to the improper performance of an official duty …
The most familiar and popular use of the term misprision describes the failure to report a crime … .
The first Congress passed a misprision of felony statute in 1789 .
The statute holds , “ Whoever , having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony “ ¦ conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States ” is guilty of misprision of felony and can be punished with up to three years in prison .
Under the federal statute , the prosecution must prove the following elements to obtain a misprision of felony conviction :
( 1 ) another person actually committed a felony ;
( 2) the defendant knew that the felony was committed ;
( 3) the defendant did not notify any law enforcement or judicial officer ; and
( 4 ) the defendant took affirmative steps to conceal the felony . ” 
As for Rumsfeld , this document , the crimes it describes , and the available evidence indicate that , were he charged for misprison of a felony , he would be found ; guilty on each count .
toon
( An aside : Chances are very good that other high - placed officials in the Bush administration saw this document as well .
A prosecutor and grand jury can find out just who else ’s chestnuts are in this particular fire . )
I am completely sympathetic to the extraordinary economic burden Obama and his team shouldered on January 21 .
But during the campaign it was Obama himself who posited the notion that a president had to be capable of do “ more than one important thing at a time . ” 
The economic meltdown “ “ likely the worst since the Great Depression “ “ demands immediate and intense attention .
But the economy is not the only thing that melted down during the Bush years .
Core American values melted down as well , and require equally urgent attention from this new administration .
Because America ’s strength and moral authority in the world do n’t flow solely from a robust US economy , but also by an unswerving adherence to a unique and lofty set of moral values .
Both the economy and our moral authority need urgent and immediate repair .
Obama needs to work night and day to return health and stability to our economy .
He also needs to work night and day to restore our moral authority .
And that can only be accomplished by holding those who so despoiled our national soul accountable for their ( well - documented ) crimes .
But so far I ’ve not seen a glimmer that Obama or his Attorney General , Eric Holder , have the stomach for real investigations that could lead to real crimes and real prosecutions .
For example , even though Obama has repeatedly promised to lift the many lids of secrecy the Bush administration slammed down on the public ’s right to know , he has n’t .
It ’s currently just as hard to get information and documents about the Bush years out of the Obama administration as it was to get the same out of the Bush folks themselves .
Obama administration goes to bat for secrecy
sfgate.com —
For the second time this week , the Obama administration has gone to court in San Francisco to argue for secrecy in defending a terrorism policy crafted under George W. Bush – in this case , wiretapping that President Obama denounced as a candidate .
( Full Story )
They need to be told to keep their promise and loosen up , to release the kind of hard evidence we need to fully know what crimes were committed , by whom , where , when and how many .
To help get this message through to them please sign this petition .
The must .
Who says so ?
Just 71 % of the people they represent .
That ’s who .
One more thing .
Now that the Obama folks have those documents , they also have constructive knowledge of felonies committed .
Which means if they do n’t investigate and prosecute , they may be the next ones found guilty of misprision of a felony .
Ya know ?

Calculus at San Francisco State University ( SFSU , professor Dr. Goetz )
Course description :
The central object of the study in calculus is the concept of a function .
Functions are used to describe the real world around us .
Calculus introduces two fundamental concepts which enable us to describe and investigate functions .
These are the derivative and the integral .
The derivative describes how a function changes at a particular time .
The integral carries information about the history of a function .
Both , the derivative and the integral are defined using limits .
Calculus 1 covers : Limits , Continuity , Asymptotes ,

As a bonus I have included some on fuzzy logic and really basic math such as trigonometry , algebra and geometry .
Have fun with these math lectures !
I know , I know , dyslexia is not just about reading and writing , it 's an overused and blunt term to cover all kinds of processing difficulties .
But some sort of description is needed to make children who have difficulty feel it is not entirely their fault that they find some aspects of learning harder than their classmates .
Labels can be exploited ( part of Stringer 's point is that millions are wasted on doling out free laptops ) but when I had one of my children assessed by an educational psychologist , who identified a huge disparity in his ability on certain tests , it made a vast difference .
He no longer felt that he was lazy ( the school 's diagnosis ) or stupid ( his own ) .
Afterwards , he actually tried harder .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) 
Watchdogs monitoring the government ’s bank bailout called for an overhaul Thursday , with one accusing those running it of misleading the public , while senators slammed the program as chaotic and poorly managed .
Under the $ 700 billion program meant to stabilize the financial system , the Treasury Department has so far spent nearly $ 300 billion to bolster financial institutions and automakers in exchange for preferred shares and warrants .
But in buying those securities , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , then the Treasury secretary , misled the public about how it was going to price them , said Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard law professor and head of an oversight panel for the bailout , known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
“ Treasury simply did not do what it said it was doing , ” Ms. Warren said at a hearing before the Senate banking committee .
Many members of the panel condemned management of the program , which is barely four months old .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Those lazy days of summer may become a thing of the past if the new secretary of education has his way .
Education Secretary Arne Duncan suggests giving incentives to teachers whose students perform well .
Arne Duncan , the Cabinet secretary charged with overhauling America 's educational system , is studying programs that keep kids in school longer to boost their academic achievements .
" When I go out and talk about that , that does n't always make me popular with students .
They like the long summers , " Duncan said in an interview Wednesday with CNN conducted in the Education Department 's library .
But Duncan said American students are " at a competitive disadvantage " because the United States has shorter school years than other countries such as India and China .
iReport.com : Longer year a good idea ?
" It does n't matter how poor , how tough the family background , socioeconomic challenges , " Duncan said .
" Where students have longer days , longer weeks , longer years -- that 's making a difference . "
More time in school is one of several ideas under consideration as Duncan settles into his new role .
Watch as the secretary discusses his strategy to improve U.S. education »
The lanky former college basketball player and father of two speaks quickly , with remarkable energy in the face of daunting challenges .
Thirty percent of high school students drop out before graduation , and another 50 percent wo n't finish college , according to Education Sector , a nonprofit think tank .
For Latino and African - American students , the numbers are more dramatic .
About half of them will graduate from high school , the Washington - based group said .
As school administrators struggle with dropout rates , they also are confronting drastic budget cuts amid national economic uncertainty .
Districts are slashing jobs and putting off plans to repair crumbling school buildings .
" What 's going on , state after state , due to this tough economy , is devastating educationally .
And we can't afford to get worse now .
We have to get dramatically better , " said Duncan , former chief of Chicago Public Schools .
President Obama and lawmakers have directed billions of dollars to the Department of Education through the stimulus package , and they propose to send more in the 2010 budget Obama announced Thursday .
Duncan said some of that money will provide schools with immediate relief to keep teachers .
" Thanks to the stimulus package , we have the chance to save literally hundreds of thousands of teacher positions .
This is a huge , huge deal , " he said , citing a University of Washington study that suggests 600,000 teachers could be lost this year without drastic intervention .
" We 're going to be able to avert maybe not all of those cuts but a huge percentage of those , and that 's very very important , " he said .
But the new funds may be only enough to keep a crisis at bay , said Kevin Carey of Education Sector .
State and local shortages are forcing schools to make do with much less .
" The economic situation is hurting school budgets , " Carey said .
" The stimulus package that just passed will help that somewhat , but there still is n't a whole lot of new money to pay teachers more , reduce class sizes , reduce high school dropout rates . "
Duncan also suggested giving incentives to teachers whose students perform well , an unpopular idea with teachers ' unions .
And he said school systems may need to make tough decisions about teachers who do n't perform at par .
" If teachers are n't making it , we want to support them and help them develop , but ultimately if it's not working , our children deserve the best , " Duncan said .
" They probably need to find something else to do . "
Duncan also is pushing for new benchmarks that would use international standards to compare American students with those overseas .
He faults No Child Left Behind for standards that he said do n't accurately monitor some children 's progress .
" When you 're told you 're meeting those standards , you think you 're doing OK .
You 're really not , " Duncan said .
" Our children are not competing for jobs down the block or in the district or in the state -- they 're competing against children in India or China , and they need to know how they stack up . "
Carey said Duncan 's efforts to meet Obama 's education goals are an immensely complicated task .
" There are 50 states , there are 14,000 school districts , 90,000 schools , and Secretary Duncan is responsible for every one of them .
But they all have their own ideas , their own funding sources , their own local leadership , " Carey said .
Duncan said he feels " a real sense of urgency " to implement national education reform .
" Our children in this country have one chance at education .
One chance .
We can't wait .
We can't wait seven or eight years .
We 'll lose a generation of kids , " Duncan said .
" And so we have to get better ; we have to get better now . "

It is the moment of truth .
Tax revenues have collapsed , creating a catastrophe for this Government and a disaster for the next one .
They will have to get used to the idea that tax revenues will go down , maybe sharply down , not just this year and next , but probably for longer .
If they do n't take this into account and adjust spending , the markets will force them to do so .
The UK will almost certainly lose its AAA credit rating this summer as the deterioration in public finances become evident , and while it is unrealistic to talk of the country defaulting on its debts – it can and will print the money to pay them – it will face a decade of retrenchment , rather as it did in the 1980s , as it strives to get borrowing back under control .
There are two problems and it is important to separate them .
One is the increase in the national debt brought about by including the balance sheets of the Government - owned and part - owned banks in the national accounts .
The other is this collapse in revenue .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The first is principally a balance - sheet issue .
It has already pushed the ratio of debt to GDP towards the 50 per cent point , way above the 40 per cent ceiling set by Gordon Brown , and depending on how you should account for banking losses maybe much higher .
However , even without these additional liabilities , the debt / GDP ratio would have been above the ceiling anyway , as the first graph shows .
That is the result partly of higher spending but more of the cut in revenues .
Consequently , borrowing this fiscal year will inevitably rise above the £ 78bn forecast in the pre-Budget report , and I have seen a forecast of £ 140bn from Global Insight for the coming fiscal year .
The Item Club estimates it will be £ 130bn .
If that proves the case , it would be by far the largest deficit , relative to GDP , ever run by a British government in peace - time .
January is a key month in the fiscal calendar , for it is one when a lot of the big taxes come in .
As reported elsewhere , this year they have n't come in on anything like the scale of previous years .
Income tax is down .
corporation tax is down .
VAT is of course down following that cut in the rate , from 17.5 to 15 per cent .
You can see the pattern in the next graph : at the beginning of the present fiscal year , receipts were running above the level of the previous year .
Now they are running way below and are set to fall further .
Already the dire forecasts of the pre-Budget report have been overtaken by events .
To catch a feeling for the scale of this deterioration , have a look at the third graph , which shows the estimates of the tax take relative to GDP made in the Budget last year and in the PBR .
Instead of the line going up , it goes down .
But as I say , that is already too optimistic .
We will have to see whether the Budget on 22 April comes up with more realistic numbers , but in a way it does n't matter what our poor Chancellor says ; what matters is what happens in the months ahead .
So what will happen ?
It is very hard to be optimistic about revenues .
The problem is not just the recession , for that has barely begun .
The problem is structural .
Too much of the revenue comes from high - earners in London and the home counties .
The top 1 per cent of income - tax payers contributes more than 20 per cent of income - tax revenue .

People reasonably bleat about bonuses , but those bonuses make a huge contribution to tax revenues .
Banking contributes 20 per cent of corporation tax , and it will not make significant profits for several years , as the swaths of bad debts are written off .
It gets worse .
The housing slump has knocked a hole in the stamp - duty take , and the stock - market slump has reduced the contribution made by capital gains tax .
As employment declines , so too will national insurance contributions .
Until consumption recovers , VAT cannot recover whatever rate it is charged at .
It is hard too to be optimistic about spending because so much of the Government 's spending is fixed .
Even if you clamp down on spending , as Gordon Brown did in the first period of his office as Chancellor , it takes a while for that to have an effect .
So even if it were desirable , and there are good reasons not to cut public spending in a slump , there is not much that can be done for the fiscal year that starts in six weeks ' time .
Everything will happen after the next election , which my colleague Steve Richards tells me will probably be in May 2010 .
And then ?
I do n't think this can be fixed in the life of one parliament .
So the aim during the next parliament , assuming it runs to 2014 , will be to stabilise the situation .
The first thing to do will be to keep the deficit at a level where it can be financed and then to chart some credible path towards a sustainable level .
Until a few months ago , you could have a debate as to whether the burden should be borne mainly by cutting spending or mainly by increasing taxation .
Now it is clear it will have to be both .
It would be nice to say that this is a political choice , but actually this has gone beyond politics .
The harsh arithmetic makes radical measures inevitable , and the difficult task for the next government will be to sustain support for these measures .
This leads to a bigger issue , which is that we are getting a taste now of the sort of fiscal constraints that will govern political choice for a generation .
The UK 's present plight is partly a result of recession but much more one of structural imbalance .
We do n't pay enough tax for the level of spending we have sought to maintain .
Unfortunately that imbalance will grow , largely for demographic reasons .
An ageing population will require more spending on health care and pensions .
A stable , maybe falling , working population will have to fund those services .
So it is not a question of paying more tax for better services .
It is paying more tax for the same level of services – and maybe even for worse or at least cheaper services .
That is a very difficult proposition to sell to an electorate .
Until now it has not been necessary to confront this prospect , for three main reasons .
One has been the relative strength of tax revenues , for the reasons noted above .
The second has been the general buoyancy of the economy , itself a result of excessive borrowing , public and private alike .
And the third has been a rise in the size of the workforce , partly from inward migration and partly because people above retirement age have remained in the workforce .
Now the first two engines have been put into reverse thrust .
We have to fly on the third alone .
It is a different world , one of fiscal constraint , and if you want to take a symbolic moment when we moved into it , last month was not a bad time to pick .

New president , same bullshit

Scott Ritter is the courageous ex-Marine captain and UN weapons inspector who reported the truth about Iraq ... they had no weapons of mass destruction .
Following the " success " of their Iraq fraud , Bush and Cheney made similar wild claims about Iran .
Now the Obama administration is picking up the claim that Iran is just " one year " away from developing a successful nuclear weapon .
The CIA has stated that Iran is TEN years away which Ritter points out can be said about ANY country on earth .
A South Korean intelligence paper says North Korea has deployed new missiles to hit more parts of Asia and increased its special warfare troops .
The defence White Paper says the North has deployed a new mid-range missile that can travel up to 3,000 kilometres and hit all of Japan .
Recently American and South Korean intelligence agencies warned that the communist North is preparing to test its longest - range missile , which is capable of reaching US territory .
The biannual paper says the North has increased the number of its special warfare soldiers by 60,000 while modernising its infantry forces to better attack the south .
It said the overall size of the military had grown by 20,000 to 1.19 million since 2006 , but the number of lightly equipped special forces trained swiftly to infiltrate South Korea had increased 50 per cent to 180,000 .
" After examining the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , North Korea appears to have developed new strategies that can complement its shortfalls while reinforcing its strengths , " said Shin Won -Sik , deputy for policy planning at the defence ministry .
" Their aim appears to blur the line between friend and foe once a conflict erupts , " Yonhap news agency quoted him as saying , suggesting the North would wage guerrilla warfare to compensate for a lack of advanced weaponry .
" North Korea deems it very important to be able to quickly cause disarray among its enemies , " Mr Shin told a briefing .
Brink of war
But North Korea today accused South Korean President Lee Myung - Bak of bringing the peninsula " to the brink of war " .
" The Lee group has pushed the inter -Korean relations to the phase of total collapse and driven the situation to the brink of a war during the first year of its office , " said Rodong Sinmun .
Mr Lee , 67 , who was sworn in on February 25 , 2008 , promised massive economic aid to the north - but only if it fully denuclearised .
Pyongyang has since halted all talks with Seoul , calling Mr Lee a " traitor " and " despicable human scum " .
Last week the North 's military announced that it was " fully ready " for war with the south .
South Korean unification minister Hyun In - Taek has denied that Seoul is to blame for strained cross - border relations .
" The south 's policy on North Korea is not the cause of the chill in relations , " he said in a report to the ruling Grand National Party .
" The cause is the North 's hardline position towards the South . "
A substantial threat
US and South Korean officials have also said the North is preparing to test - fire its longest - range missile , the Taepodong - 2 , which has an estimated range of 6,700km .
" North Korea is a substantial , not symbolic , threat to us ( South Korea ) , " said Baek Seung - Joo of the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses .
" The special warfare forces , if combined with North Korea 's chemical weapons , could not only inflict substantial damage on us but also drive South Korea into panic quickly , " he said .
US secretary of state Hillary Clinton warned the North to stop provocation and said its war of words with the South would not help it forge a new relationship with Washington .
She said any missile test would breach a United Nations resolution and urged Pyongyang to comply with a six -nation nuclear disarmament pact .

Dick Book Resurrected by Dick Widow
Images of " Tessa Dick " are difficult to search for on the internet in a crowded coffee shop .
Philip K . Dick 's last wife has self - published his last novel , taking the plot and ideas and writing it in the manner that he would have written it himself , if he were still alive , or were -- perhaps -- an android infused with the exact memories and personality of the dead writer , downloaded into a computer , and given a thousand - word - a - day imperative , lest his spectral intelligence be annihilated , dragged kicking and screaming into a desktop " recycle bin .
" Tessa Dick began her restoration project after posting on a PKD blog that it would be easy to write a new PKD book , because she knew the story he wanted to tell and knew how he would have told it .
The new novel is called " The Owl in Daylight .
" Philip
Dick died of a massive stroke in 1982 , several years after his famous visionary experience that caused him to believe that the world was trapped in a time illusion manifested by Satan to keep us all trapped in 50 A.D. in order to prevent the Kingdom of God from dawning on Earth .
Dick married Tessa ( his fifth wife ) in 1974 , after being introduced to her at a beach party by his second - to - last ladyfriend , a woman named " Ginger .
" Tessa was PKD 's helpmeet and exegete until they divorced in 1977 , helping him through some of his most famous works , including the VALIS trilogy and " A Scanner Darkly , " which was recently made into a peculiarly shitty movie in spite of being animated by exceptional artists .
Dick material is difficult to work with : it is hard to strike the right balance between humor and paranoia , while still giving top billing to Dick 's feverish ideas .
Movies are about characters and setting , and these are always secondary in a Dick story .
According to an interview with " The Self - Publishing Review , " Tessa was side - by - side with PKD during " A Scanner Darkly , " adding input , serving as ideal reader , and helping the writing process along :
" My primary contribution was making coffee and sandwiches , but I read each page of Scanner as it came out of the typewriter and I did a lot of copy editing .
Also , one scene is mine : I came up with the idea of having him see nothing but dog feces when he opened the hood of his car .
" Tessa 's new novel is based more on speculation than on actual notes or conversations .
Dick 's idea was to tell a story about a person who builds a computer with artificial intelligence in order to run an amusement park , and then gets trapped inside his own creation .
" Westworld " meets " I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream . " From the same interview " The Owl in Daylight is my concept of what Phil 's novel should be .
I relied heavily on Mozart 's opera The Magic Flute .
The plot is loosely based on Phil 's life , which will become more apparent in the sequel , The Owl in Twilight .
" Sometimes I do feel that Phil is communicating with me from beyond the grave , but that concept is too spooky for me to accept completely .
It 's probably just that I knew him so well that I can think the way he did .
" Later this year , a film will be released about PKD 's life , starring Paul Giamatti , and will be titled the same thing : " The Owl in Daylight . "
Tessa is not happy about the impending film and worries that it will reduce the author to a caricature , minimizing his complexity and getting the facts wrong .
" This biopic promises to present another fantasy of drug - induced paranoia sprinkled with peppery females who drag the great author down into the gutter , " she said .
" Someone reminded me that I was interviewed for this film about a year ago , but that conversation was so brief and so directed that they learned very little .
The interviewer simply wanted to confirm his own theories , not to gather facts .
I shudder at the thought of such a complex personality , as Phil really was , being condensed and portrayed as a caricature of himself .
"
The new novel is available from Amazon here , although you can read more about Tessa 's project at her blog , " It 's a Philip K Dick World . "
Being in love with a writer is difficult .
In their lifetimes , great writers are often insecure , unloved , and disregarded , and when they die , obsession in their work surges .
The pressure is on those who knew them best to explain them , defend them , and sustain people 's hunger for more by giving them revealing anecdotes and trivial banalities .
I 'm not sure that you should write novels in their name , however .
Perhaps that is crossing the line ?
But where is the line anyway ?
Are you the line ?
Am I ? What if we are all the line ?
What if there is no line ?
WHAT IF THE LINE IS REALLY A CIRCLE ?
When the bailout bill failed in the House Monday , lawmakers said no to one big idea .
Senate leaders have taken a different tack , attaching the bailout to other bills with the clear intention of wooing lawmakers with countless little ideas .
Even an incomplete survey of the 450 - page billâs contents quickly sets the head spinning :
Taxbreaksgalore .
Thereâs a one - year measure to protect middle - income households from paying the alternative minimum tax .
Tax breaks for victims of recent natural disasters .
Tax credits for investing in solar energy and producing wind energy .
Tax credits for businesses investing in research and development .
A two - year extension of â the popular deduction for states that rely on sales tax .â 
Tax breaks for manufacturers of toy wooden arrows , along with âtax breaks benefiting Hollywood producers , stock - car racetrack owners and Virgin Islands rum- makers.â 
$ 3.3 billion in federal aid for the âsecure rural schoolsâ program , â which compensates counties for the loss of revenues they had been receiving from the sale of timber on federal lands.â 
A requirement that health insurance companies provide more equitable coverage to people with mental illnesses .
And then , thereâs a measure which could actually be said to be related to the bailout itself : a mandate to increase the amount of deposit insurance from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
Itâs a bill with something for everybody .
Rep. Jim Ramstad ( R - MN ) voted nay on Monday .
But if he still opposes the bailout tomorrow , heâll be forced to vote against his own mental illness legislation .
The Politicoreports that various House Republicans seem cheered by other provisions : Washington state lawmakers like the rural school aid , Southern lawmakers might like the state sales tax deduction , and another key nay vote is onboard due to the deposit insurance provision .
Meanwhile , Rep. Steve King ( R - IA ) still planned to vote nay even though the new version of the bill contains a biodiesel tax credit heâs supported , but he says " I think that they probably put enough sweeteners in it that they will be able to get the votes . "
If thereâs consensus that the bill failed to pass on Monday due to poor salesmanship – especially the widespread perception that this is a $ 700 billion bailout for Wall Street fat cats – Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) seemed determined to up - end that perception without changing the core of the bailout plan itself .
" This rescue package is not for the titans of Wall Street .
It 's not for those whose greed got us here , who chose greed over prudence , " Reid saidyesterday .
" It would be a blight on this Congress not to pass these tax extenders .
These are n't for the wealthy , but for the people who are working for a living . "
In ancient Athens , those who admired the Stoic philosophy of individualism took as their motto : " Abstain from Beans . "
The phrase had a precise reference .
It meant : do n’t vote .
Balloting in Athens occurred by dropping various colored beans into a receptacle .
To vote is to express a preference .
There is nothing implicitly evil in choosing .
All of us in the ordinary course of our daily lives vote for or against dozens of products and services .
When we vote for ( buy ) any good or service , it follows that by salutary neglect we vote against the goods or services we do not choose to buy .
The great merit of market place choosing is that no one is bound by any other person ’s selection .
I may choose Brand X .
But this cannot prevent you from choosing Brand Y .
When we place voting into the framework of politics , however , a major change occurs .
When we express a preference politically , we do so precisely because we intend to bind others to our will .
Political voting is the legal method we have adopted and extolled for obtaining monopolies of power .
Political voting is nothing more than the assumption that might makes right .
There is a presumption that any decision wanted by the majority of those expressing a preference must be desirable , and the inference even goes so far as to presume that anyone who differs from a majority view is wrong or possibly immoral .
But history shows repeatedly the madness of crowds and the irrationality of majorities .
The only conceivable merit relating to majority rule lies in the fact that if we obtain monopoly decisions by this process , we will coerce fewer persons than if we permit the minority to coerce the majority .
But implicit in all political voting is the necessity to coerce some so that all are controlled .
The direction taken by the control is academic .
Control as a monopoly in the hands of the state is basic .
In times such as these , it is incumbent upon free men to reexamine their most cherished , long - established beliefs .
There is only one truly moral position for an honest person to take .
He must refrain from coercing his fellows .
This means that he should refuse to participate in the process by means of which some men obtain power over others .
If you value your right to life , liberty , and property , then clearly there is every reason to refrain from participating in a process that is calculated to remove the life , liberty , or property from any other person .
Voting is the method for obtaining legal power to coerce others .

On February 3 , the Indian government will display a prototype of the Rs 500 , a $ 10 laptop that will hopefully give more young people the opportunity to learn and help increase the country 's school enrollment .
UPDATE ( February 4 , 2009 ) :
On Tuesday , February 3 , India 's national Mission on Education Program clarified that the $ 10 laptop is actually not a laptop , but a storage device .
The storage device contains megabytes of data that can be accessed by a user by connecting the device to a laptop .
The 5 - inch by 10 - inch Rs 500 storage device is now priced at $ 30 .
Joint Secretary N. K. Sinha , who made the announcement , did not explain why the device was being called a laptop when it was not .
via : Times of India
The $ 10 laptop project is the product of a collaboration among institutions including the Vellore Institute of Technology , the Indian Institute of Science , and IIT - Madras .
The project began about three years ago in response to the proposed $ 100 laptop ( the " One Laptop Per Child " project ) , an idea from MIT 's Nicholas Negroponte , which was going to cost $ 200 .
Currently , the $ 10 laptop is projected to cost $ 20 , but India 's secretary of higher education R. P. Agarwal hopes that price will come down with mass production .
The $ 10 laptop will be equipped with 2 GB of memory , WiFi , fixed Ethernet , expandable memory , and consume just 2 watts of power .
The unveiling of the laptop will occur at the government 's launch of the National Mission on Education through Information and Technology , held next Tuesday in Tirupati .
The Indian government is working with publishers to provide e-content on educational subjects which will be available free of cost .
The government is also considering a plan to subsidize internet connections for schools .
Currently , the government is consulting with different production agencies , and hopes to make the computers commercially available in the next six months .

Telehealth expansion eyed beyond pandemic
It does n’t ring like a Nick Haramis story , which would mean this story of unprovoked gay bashing true , and all the more upsetting .
Scene : Sunday night , the day after Valentine ’s , New York City ’s Union Square , Regal movie theatre .
There ’s glass shards , a box cutter , blood , and a hospital involved here .
On Sunday evening February 15th , my boyfriend and I attended the Regal Union Square theater on 13th Street and Broadway .
While inside , he had placed his head on my shoulder and four boys behind us began calling us ‘ faggots ’ and ‘ homos ’ and began forcefully kicking the back of our chairs .
We contacted the management twice and they did nothing , and the second time I was speaking of what happened and the manager rolled his eyes and walked off and ignored me while I was talking .
After the movie was finished , the homophobic remarks continued and the boys began to physically threaten us and surround us .
We looked for any security , of which none was available .
Once outside the theater , we were both assaulted by the four boys with glass bottles , shards of glass , and a box cutter , and taken to the hospital .
I had suffered a head contusion and my boyfriend suffered a wrist and head contusion and a facial laceration .
The case has been classified as a hate crime by NYPD and all parties concerned believe the movie theater was negligent in handling the situation twice and not providing ample security .
Also , it should be noted that the boys were related to an employee of the theatre , and were underaged , therefore they should not have been given tickets / admitted into a rated - R movie .
LONDON , Jan 5 ( Reuters ) - Champions Ferrari will be the first Formula
One team to reveal their 2009 car with an unveiling scheduled for their Maranello factory on Jan. 12 , the Italian team said on Monday .

5 Francis Ford Coppola
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
From 1972 - 1982 , Francis Ford Coppola was not only at the top of his game , he was at the top of anyone 's game .
Ever. Between The Godfather , The Godfather , Part II and Apocalypse Now , Coppola 's films had won so many Oscars that he could smelt them all down to make the most critically acclaimed suit of armor in all the land .
After the rigors of Apocalypse Now , one would think that Coppola would 've taken a break -- after all , this was the film that caused him to famously quip , " We had access to too much money , too much equipment and , little by little , we went insane . "
Instead , Coppola went to Vegas - - or at least a $ 26 million movie version of it -- and bet the farm on " Technicolor weird - ass musical . "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Coppola 's gamble was called One from the Heart , a surrealist Las Vegas love story fueled by the music of Tom Waits .
Instead of filming on location , Coppola built replicas of Vegas on sound stages .
The set shot One from the Heart 's original $ 2 million budget into the stratosphere , leaving Coppola to pick up a more than $ 20 million tab when the film earned only $ 600,000 .
And to add insult to injury , the film got terrible reviews .
One from the Heart left Coppola on the verge on bankruptcy from the late 80s to early 90s .
To keep ahead of his creditors , Coppola directed films he would 've otherwise passed up , including The Godfather , Part III and the " Robin Williams as a giant 10 - year old " flick , Jack .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
That 's right , One from the Heart was responsible for freaking Jack .
Motherfucker .
Now let 's make it extra clear :
Even if the man just filmed himself pooping on a glass coffee table every year after 1982 , Coppola would still go down as one of the most important filmmakers ever .
But still , you have to wonder what crucial part of himself he lost after Apocalypse Now .
In the last 27 years , the most memorable thing he 's directed was that Michael Jackson ride at Disney World .
And , hey , we 're not complaining .
Captain EO fucking ruled .
If The Godfather , Part III had been three hours of that , he'd have a few more gold statues on his mantle right now .
Leaving your mobile phone charger at home when you go for a two week long vacation may just be the norm one day as scientists from Nanyang Technological University ( NTU ) and Rice University , United States , have successfully created a microchip that uses 30 times less electricity while running seven times faster than today 's best technology .
The technology , dubbed PCMOS ( probabilistic complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ) was invented by Professor Krishna Palem of Rice University and Director of NTU 's Institute for Sustainable Nanoelectronics ( ISNE ) .
The U.S. - Singapore team making the announcement is led by Professor Palem and NTU's Associate Professor Yeo Kiat Seng , Head of Division of Circuits and Systems , School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering ( EEE ) , College of Engineering .
The team 's goal is green computing .
They are looking for applications where PCMOS can deliver as well as or better than existing technology but with a fraction of the energy required .
" Probabilistic design methodology , if used for consumer devices , would result in energy efficient devices , " says Professor Palem who conceived probabilistic design .
" For example , for consumers , it could mean the difference between charging a cell phone every few weeks instead of every few days .
In addition to the encryption application that we have demonstrated , among other applications , it is equally well - suited for computer graphics . "
Professor Palem explains that in streaming video application on a cell phone for example , it is unnecessary to conduct precise calculations .
The small screen , combined with the human brain 's ability to process less - than - perfect pictures , results in a case where the picture looks just as good with a calculation that is only approximately correct .
Dr Natalie Kong Zhi Hui , Teaching Fellow , in NTU 's EEE and a member of team , says " Our technology is a significant contributor towards environmental - friendliness - green computing , or probabilistic computing , with an extremely energy - aware attribute .
This is due to the fact that , unlike conventional designs that view noise as a nuisance , our design concept embraces noise as a " gem " - this novel technology recycles noise . "
The microchip is a successful proof - of - concept of the PCMOS technology which has demonstrated an improvement of 30 times in terms of energy consumption while running seven times faster than the contemporary CMOS design .
This is in contrast with today 's silicon transistors become increasingly ' noisy ' as they get smaller , thus engineers have historically dealt with this by boosting the operating voltage to overpower the noise to ensure accurate calculations , leading to higher energy consumption levels .
" With this PCMOS technology , noise / parameter variations are part of the overall design and are managed as a resource to achieve significant energy savings .
Our vision is to see a new generation of probabilistic - based nanoelectronics with diverse applications in media , biomedical , information technology ( IT ) and consumer electronics .
The success of this project would go a long way in promoting the advent of a new generation of ' green ' IT at lower costs to consumers , " says Professor Yeo .
Professor Yeo , Dr Kong , Professor Palem and his student , Dr Pinar Korkmaz , successfully ran the first real - world tests of the revolutionary prototype microchip .
This is a culmination of various chip designs and testing that started in 2005 .
According to Professor
Yeo , PCMOS is also ideally suited for encryption , a process that relies on generating random numbers .
Thus the microchip can be quickly incorporated in electronic devices such as in computer gaming , lotteries and cryptography ( internet security ) where random calculations are valuable .
" This is in addition to applications where there is a need to produce statistical simulation , such as in financial and economic forecast so that more accurate predictions can be made , " says Professor Yeo .
Equally important is that the implementation of PCMOS piggybacks on the current " complementary metal - oxide semiconductor " technology , or CMOS , that chipmakers already use .
This means that chipmakers can use existing equipment to support PCMOS , resulting in lower entry costs for the new technology .
The Rice - NTU team plans to follow its proof - of - concept work on encryption with proof - of - concept tests on microchips for cell phones , graphics cards and medical implants .
They look forward to taking this concept of probabilistic design , which is one key focus of NTU 's ISNE , to the next level .
" In Singapore , the next level is to create a larger activity with roots at NTU and which spans an increasingly vigorous international network based at Rice .
The vision for this will include next generation electronics , based on principles drawn from the mathematics of probability as it relates to areas such as risk analysis , perceptual neurobiology , nanoscale devices and computing with applications to exciting domains such as graphics and multimedia , education and global health , " says Professor Palem .
The team hopes PCMOS technology will enter the consumer computing market in as little as four years and may present itself as a parallel to mainstream CMOS technology in the near future .

With winter coming on and no roof over their heads this family learned how to improvise by living in their greenhouse makeshift home .
Living in a Greenhouse Makeshift Home
My wife and I are strong believers in the old saying , " Where there 's a will , there 's a way " . . . so once we decided that the time had come to adopt a simpler , more natural back - to - the - land lifestyle , we just plain up and did it .
We quit our jobs and moved — four children and all — to 40 acres of Ozarks complete with pasture , woods , hills , and running water ( a creek and a small river ) .
And true to our expectations , we soon found ourselves leading much more enjoyable , relaxed lives .
Now I do n't mean that ate worked less , mind you ( in fact , quite the opposite ! ) , but as we put the trivial concerns of our old existence behind us and focused our energies on the fundamental challenges of homesteading — such as putting a roof over our heads — our lives became simpler .
We learned to be patient , to be flexible in our thinking . . . and to approach problems creatively .
Therefore , when the construction of our earth - sheltered house was delayed ( leaving us unable to do more than complete the initial excavation before winter hit ) , we were n't particularly discouraged . . . we simply borrowed a tent and determined to live in that for a while .
However , as the season grew colder ( and the creek — our bath - tub — became icier ) , we recognized the need for a warmer and more substantial temporary home .
- Advertisement -
And our solution to the problem was , I must admit , anything but conventional :
We bought and erected a 20 foot by 45 foot Quonset - style greenhouse covered with a double layer of polyethylene !
Since I had built and worked in such structures for several years , I knew that the makeshift home would be sufficiently roomy , fairly easy to erect , sturdy enough to withstand our area 's weather , and relatively inexpensive .
[ EDITOR'S NOTE : Prices for models of similar size and design vary widely . . . from about $ 1,000 up . ]
Furthermore , my wife and I figured that if all of us could survive living together in a tent , we'd do just fine in our more spacious " plastic house " .
Well , as time has gone by , we 've become convinced that we made the right decision .
In fact , we 've lived in our greenhouse for more than a year now , and it has unfailingly provided us with warm , dry shelter .
We have 900 square feet of living , storage , and work space all in one long room . . . and because we 've simply used our furniture to separate the various areas ( the bedrooms , kitchen , etc. ) , we 've been able to avoid the uncomfortable cramped corners or heat traps that walls sometimes create .
Soon after President - elect Barack Obama ’s inauguration , Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos will fly to Washington to lobby for continuance of Plan Colombia , the largest U.S. foreign aid program outside the Middle East and Afghanistan .
Colombian leaders face a steep challenge : persuading the new administration to maintain $ 556 million a year in military and economic aid as it braces for an era of trillion - dollar deficits .
Santos will have to fend off critics who say Plan Colombia has fallen short of its coca eradication goals and that the military ’s battlefield gains against leftist rebels have been stained by human rights abuses , including “ false positives ” -- the killing of innocent civilians passed off as battle casualties .
But Santos , the Harvard - educated scion of a family that operates and partly owns his country ’s biggest newspaper , El Tiempo , argues that dramatic battlefield successes against the left - wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrillas , known as the FARC , and Colombia ’s importance as a U.S. ally in an often unfriendly region are reason for Obama to not “ pull the rug out from under us . ”
Santos was interviewed Thursday by The Times in Bogota .

This is not an ideal time to be going to Washington to look for money .
The way we see it , the cost of support for Colombia is small in relation to the $ 1 - trillion deficit , but that the usefulness of this help is huge and at minimal cost compared to Iraq , for example .
When it started in 2000 , Colombia was not in the hands of the state but in those of paramilitaries and the guerrillas .
I remember in 2000 , when President Clinton came to Cartagena just before Plan Colombia started , the country was on the verge of becoming a failed state .
Today , we are one of the most solid democracies , where institutions are working , where the scandals such as false positives have come to light because of those functioning institutions .
We are winning , but we have n’t won yet .
This could backfire very rapidly .
[ The end of Plan Colombia ] is what the rebels want .

How has Plan Colombia helped Colombia achieve this ?
Military training , intelligence , strengthening of institutions and , of course , the added military capacity that has resulted from things like [ Black Hawk ] helicopters that we have received through Plan Colombia .
It ’s the quality of the help we get that matters .
The quality of training , of the intelligence , for example , which does n’t cost the United States anything but which we can’t produce ourselves .
And 2008 was a good year ?
Last year was the best year for the Colombian armed forces in all its history .
First , there was political progress in that people mobilized as never before to demonstrate against the FARC .
Secondly , the number of demobilized rebels rose to 3,480 , the highest level in history .
Thirdly , after 44 years of our military not being able to touch the FARC leadership -- the seven - member secretariat -- three of them fell in 2008 .
Fourth , the spectacular rescue in July [ of three U.S. defense contractors , former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt and 11 others ] was so extraordinary that it created a euphoria and self - confidence in our military , and among all Colombians .

A General Accounting Office report said Plan Colombia has fallen short of its goal to reduce coca crops by 50 % .
After years of spraying and manual eradication , crops have n’t shrunk much .
I think the United Nations report [ on which the GAO based its findings ] contains an underlying error in the number of hectares it says are still cultivated with coca .
But look at the other links of our policy : how all the cartels are dismantled , all the capos who were on the FBI most - wanted list have been jailed , look at all the cocaine laboratories destroyed , how the tons of cocaine seized by the police almost doubled in 2008 .
Why ?
Because we are retaking control of our territory .
And there was the “ false positives ” scandal in which soldiers looking for promotions killed possibly hundreds of civilians who were then claimed as guerrillas killed in action .
We have taken action , with a set of policies to guarantee justice , and have told our soldiers that demobilizations , not killings , of rebels are what count .
We fired 45 officers and soldiers for sins of commission and omission .
I have no doubt that the Colombian army is receiving more human rights training than any on Earth .

President - elect Obama is not known as an aficionado of Latin America , and has never visited here .
Does that worry you ?
No , because Obama has a Cabinet that has many people who know Latin America .
Vice President - elect Joseph Biden was one of the fathers of Plan Colombia .
How will you persuade Obama that Colombia deserves the aid ?
I want to say : Listen , we ’re a success story here , asking for minimal financial commitment compared with your other problems , so do n’t sacrifice something that ’s much more important than the value of the dollars you have invested .
It ’s in the interest of the U.S. to maintain a strong democracy in Colombia .
And Plan Colombia is one of the determinants .

From the New York Times : Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles on Wednesday indicted a Jordanian businessman with connections to the Florida Republican Party on charges of funneling illegal contributions to three former presidential candidates and Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida .
The indictment of the businessman , Alaa al - Ali , 37 , shines a spotlight on the role of a business associate who the complaint asserts helped collect the donations .
The associate , Harry Sargeant III , is a major Republican fund - raiser who owns an oil company with government contracts in Iraq and who recently resigned as finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party .
Mr. Sargeant raised more than $ 500,000 for the 2008 Republican presidential campaign of Senator John McCain .
News organizations raised questions last summer about suspect donations to Mr. McCain from Arab - Americans that the campaign initially linked to Mr. Sargeants fund - raising before attributing them instead to another one of his Arab associates .
OTTAWA — Four minutes into the first working day of the new year , Canada 's best - paid CEOs had already pulled in what the average Canadian worker earns in a year , an economic and social policy think - tank said in a critical analysis of pay scales for the rich and powerful .
Or at least that 's what they pulled in during 2007 , the latest full year for which figures are available , and what may have been their " last hurrah " until this current recession ends , according to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives .
" The 100 highest paid CEOs of Canadian publicly traded corporations received an average of $ 10,408,054 in total compensation in 2007 , " the report by the left - of - centre research organization said , noting that was a record average 22.7 per cent increase from the year before and brought their combined pay packet to a record of more than $ 1 billion .
" At that rate of pay , Canada 's richest CEOs pocket the average Canadian wage of $ 40,237 by 9:04 a.m. Jan. 2 , before most Canadians have booted up their computer for another year of work , " said Hugh Mackenzie , association researcher and author of the report .
He noted that this included the CEOs of the big banks that recently received billions in federal government support , and energy CEOs who , until recently , were surfing the big wave of crude - oil price increases .
And it would have only taken those CEOs until the end of the lunch hour on Jan. 2 to bank the annual pay of someone earning a substantial salary of $ 100,000 a year , it said .
" In contrast , average Canadian earnings rose by only 3.2 per cent ( in 2007 ) , " the report noted , adding that was the best increase in five years .
The average CEO took home 259 times the pay of the average worker , it said , noting that the average pay for the top 50 CEOs was 398 times the average wage , up from 85 times the average wage in 1995 .
" Compared with ordinary Canadians , whose wages have been stagnant for 30 years . . . they have enjoyed a decade of record pay hikes and will land on a softer cushion if they stumble from their lofty heights in the new year , " Mackenzie said .
" Things have certainly changed since 1960 , when then - General - Motors - CEO George Romney . . . turned down a $ 100,000 bonus , kept his salary at $ 225,000 a year , and declared that no executive should be paid more than 25 times the factory wage , " the report commented .
Further , more than half of the top 100 CEOs ' total compensation came from cashing in stock options , which are taxed as a capital gain , or at half the regular income tax rates paid on wage and salary income , the report observed .
" Unfortunately for Canada 's CEOs , however , the party may be coming to an end , " the report said , noting that CEO pay and lucrative severance packages have , at least in the U.S. , become a target of public scrutiny as their companies fail .
" Congress threatened to prevent any of its bailout funds to be used for CEO bonuses , " the report said , noting the CEOs of the three big U.S. automakers got a rough ride on both of their visits to Washington seeking taxpayer financing to keep their companies from going under .
" On the substantive front , stock options are becoming a lot less interesting as a pay option for CEOs , as literally millions of dollars of tantalizingly close - at - hand windfalls have become essentially worthless in a few short months .
" It 's only a matter of time before this new reality takes root in Canada , " it warned .
No one from the Canadian Council of Chief Executive Officers , composed of the CEOs of Canada 's largest corporations , was available to comment on the report .
In September , the Canadian Securities Administrators , an umbrella organization for the country 's securities regulators , concluded a two - year overhaul of the way public companies disclose what , why and how executives are paid .
The new requirements , such as spelling out how specific elements of compensation encourage certain results or how much money executives are entitled to under various employment - termination scenarios , went into effect at the start of this year .
As I understand them , the Republicans ’ main reasons for opposing the stimulus bill ( 0 votes in the House , 3 in the Senate ) were : ( a ) the bill contains too much evil government spending , ( b ) it does n’t spend money fast enough to affect the economy , and ( c ) it ’s too big .
There are really no grounds for bipartisan agreement on ( c ) , especially since many Democratic economists believe the stimulus is too small given the yawning output gap .
But even conceding for a moment that ( a ) and ( b ) are valid concerns , I ’m still baffled by the reduction of state aid from $ 79 billion to $ 40 billion .
( See the New York Times comparison here . )
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , states are facing new budget shortfalls of $ 51 billion this fiscal year ( ends June 30 ) and at least $ 94 billion for next fiscal year .
Direct federal government aid to states will do no more than partially fill those budget gaps and enable state and local governments to keep people employed instead of firing them – teachers , firefighters , etc .
While one might have concerns about whether the government can spend money on new programs efficiently , in this case the money will go to basic services that the government is already providing .
This is only wasteful if you take the extreme view that all government spending in general is wasteful and any excuse to reduce it is a good one ( the old “ starve the beast ” argument ) .
The money can be spent quickly , because all the mechanisms needed to spend it already exist .
Even if it is spent over several months ( because people earn their salaries over the year ) , it will still have an immediate stimulative effect , because people who have jobs spend a lot more than people who do n’t have jobs .
It will have a high multiplier , because every dollar of government payrolls counts as one dollar of GDP , so the multiplier on government salaries is roughly the multiplier on tax cuts plus one .
And it will even save a little money in unemployment benefits .
There are a lot of things one can argue about in the Senate version of the stimulus , but this I just do n’t understand at all .

Are you tired of hearing of patents granted for obvious innovations ?
Are you weary of hearing about old patents that are purchased by so - called " patent trolls " ?
If you think that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office desperately needs help to clean the earwax out of its cerebral sulci , there 's an excellent example from the world of Linux that would bear watching and emulating in other fields .
In December , General Patent Corp. announced it was working on behalf of Worlds.com to enforce its patents on " Scalable Virtual World Chat Client - Server System " and " System and Method for Enabling Users to Interact in a Virtual Space , " which date back to 1995 .
Attorney Sean Kane , writing in his " Virtual Judgment " blog , commented :
" Therefore , it would seem that General Patent Corporation and Worlds.com are taking the position that the above - referenced patents cover the idea of the computer architecture for a three - dimensional graphical multi-user interactive virtual world system .
If so , this announcement is arguably a very thinly veiled notice to the virtual world industry that infringement suits are forthcoming for those companies who do not enter into a licensing deal with General Patent Corporation and Worlds.com . "
Are you tired of hearing of patents granted for obvious innovations ?
Are you weary of hearing about old patents that are purchased by firms like Niro , Scavone , Haller & Niro which " concentrates its practice in intellectual property law " and became notorious as a hugely successful " patent troll " ?
Do you think that the people suing Google , Apple and Microsoft for infringement of a patent ludicrously granted for " a system and method for iconic software environment management " that they claim covers thumbnail images should be granted their day in court ?
If you think that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) desperately needs help to clean the earwax out of its cerebral sulci , there ’s an excellent example from the world of Linux that would bear watching and emulating in other fields .
The Open Invention Network , the Software Freedom Law Center and The Linux Foundation are sponsoring an organization called the Linux Defenders , which has three key projects ( quoting from their Web page ) :
Peer to Patent
Peer - to - Patent is a historic initiative by the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) that opens the patent examination process to public participation for the first time .
Peer - to - Patent is an online system that aims to improve the quality of issued patents by enabling the public to supply the USPTO with information relevant to assessing the claims of pending patent applications .
Peer - to - Patent provides an opportunity to open up the closed patent review process to more information and enable better decision making and improve the patent system by avoiding the issuance of overly broad patents .
Linux Defenders is working in cooperation with the established Peer - to - Patent program to create a portal for the Linux and open source community to participate in the program and provide parallel initiatives with the same common goal of improving patent quality and enabling freedom of action / freedom to operate .
Post - Issue Peer to Patent
Post - Issue Peer - to - Patent takes a community - based approach to peer review for issued patents .
In recent years the USPTO has at times been overwhelmed by the number of patent applications being filed in areas of new technology , such as software and business methods .
Lacking access to comprehensive prior art in these subject matter areas , the USPTO had little choice but to grant patents that would otherwise have failed the test of patentability had relevant prior art been before the examiner .
The rigor is provided by the community of peer reviewers who elect to participate in the review of issued patents and support the invalidation of poor quality patents and the patent office ’s goal of improving the quality of future issued patents .
Defensive Publications
Defensive publications , which are endorsed by the USPTO as an IP rights management tool , are documents that provide descriptions and artwork of a product , device or method so that it enters the public domain and becomes prior art upon publication .
This powerful preemptive disclosure prevents other parties from obtaining a patent on a product , device or method that is known though not previously patented .
It enables the original inventor to ensure access to the invention across the community by preventing others from later making patent claims on it .
These efforts can serve as models for the entire high - technology industry to marshal our intellectual resources to stop abuse of the patent system .
It ’s time to organize to fight the trolls .

One of Gmail 's most popular add - on features , the Tasks list , has arrived on your web - enabled mobile device .
If you have an iPhone , an Android phone or any other mobile with a real web browser , just surf to and you 'll see the new mobile interface .
You can check off completed tasks , add new tasks or delete old ones .
You can assign notes to tasks .
You can also manage multiple task lists , so you can keep work and personal tasks separate .
Any changes you make in the mobile interface are synced to your Tasks list in Gmail .
Of course , you 'll have to enable the Tasks feature in Gmail first .
To do so , log in to Gmail and click on Settings , then go to the Labs tab and enable Tasks .
You can't prioritize tasks by dragging them up and down in the list the way you can with the Tasks feature inside Gmail .
You also can't access or update your tasks unless you have an active data or wi-fi connection .
The offline access problem is a big one , and it will only cease to be an issue when Google Gears for Mobile makes its way to the iPhone and Android phones .
Right now , Gears is only on Windows - powered mobiles , but other smartphones will follow in the future .
Google is slowly adding offline capability to its key webapp products on the desktop – Gmail got experimental offline access just last week .
There are several tasks list managers available for the iPhone through the App Store .
Most of them are free and all of them are pretty underwhelming .
But the ability to access the same list on your phone that you also use on your desktop – and keep them in sync – is sure to make this a must - have among Gmail devotees .
Google first launched the Tasks app in December through Gmail Labs , the company 's skunkworks for publicly testing experimental features in its webmail service .
It has proven to be extremely popular , mostly because it 's embedded directly into the Gmail interface .
What used to require a separate app , widget or browser tab is now an integrated part of the Gmail experience .
And now it 's part of the iPhone experience , too .
Bravo .

UFC 94 Notes : Penn Set to File Complaint With NSAC Over GSP Greasing
B.J. Penn . Photo property of the Ultimate Fighting Championship .
If you thought that the war between Georges St. Pierre and B.J. Penn was over , think again .
Penn ’s camp has informed Sherdog.com that they intend to file a formal complaint with the Nevada State Athletic Commission after officials spotted one of St. Pierre ’s cornermen allegedly rubbed Vaseline on his back in between the first and second and then the second and third rounds .
“ We are not trying to make excuses , but the NSAC needs to protect the fighters , ” Penn told Sherdog.com via text message .
“ They never notified us or completely wiped his back with water and towels . ”
Various reports are circulating that following the conclusion of the first round , Phil Nurse , who has been working St. Pierre ’s corner for a number of years , was caught by someone sitting at ringside rubbing Vaseline on St. Pierre ’s back and shoulders .
It has yet to be confirmed that this person was former UFC light heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell , but “ The Iceman ” was the first to inform UFC President Dana White of the incident after the conclusion of the fight , which St. Pierre won via fourth - round doctor ’s stoppage .
Members of the commission , including executive director Keith Kizer , entered the cage and asked Nurse to stop .
They then took a towel and rubbed St. Pierre ’s back down .
When Nurse was apparently seen doing the same thing again after the second round , NSAC officials once again gave Nurse a warning .
Greg Jackson , St. Pierre ’s head trainer for the past year and a half , told MMA Weekly that Nurse was only doing something that has been done during every fight that St. Pierre has participated in for the last handful of years - a drill invented by notable MMA “ witch doctor ” Steve Friend .
“ So in between rounds , ( Friend ) had this little drill that you do – and Phil Nurse is the one who knows how to do it – he showed Phil , and this is what Georges wanted , so we did that , ” Jackson told MMA Weekly .
“ But this is why we were doing it .
He rubbed your back and tapped your chest ; I do n’t know exactly how it works .
But anyways , what that ’s supposed to do is get your energy in line , or motivated or whatever .
So in between rounds , we had Phil Nurse do that . ”
“ The controversy came because Phil Nurse also was putting Vasoline on Georges ’ eyebrows .
So Phil Nurse put all the Vasoline on his face , so his hands might have had a miniscule amount left over from that , when he went around the side and rubbed a little point on his back , and tapped on his chest .
At that point , somebody in the audience thought we were greasing George down , and ran over and told the commission that we were greasing his body down .
They said ‘ you ’re putting Vasoline on his back , ’ and Phil ’s like , ‘oh , there might be a little on my fingers , but it was n’t intentional at all , and of course they wiped it right off and it was gone , so it was n’t a factor in the fight at all . ”
UFC President Dana
White indicated after the event that the accusations laid upon Nurse and company are very serious that he expects the state of Nevada to undergo a full investigation as well as hand out strict punishment to those involved .
Machida ’s Fate Depdendent on Quinton Jackson
After winning his first six fights in the UFC , which including dominating performances against Thiago Silva this past weekend and former UFC light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz last May , Lyoto Machida has made it known that he would like a shot at the UFC ’s 205 lb title in the near future .
Dana
White agrees , but made it known at the post - fight press conference for UFC 94 that Machida will have to wait until the result of former light heavyweight king Quinton “ Rampage ” Jackson ’s scheduled matchup against Keith Jardine in March before his future is decided .
“ He asked me if we were going to wait until Jardine and Rampage , and I said yes , ” White explained to a reporter early Sunday morning .
If Jackson is victorious against Jardine at UFC 96 in Columbus , Ohio , he would become the first challenger for newly - crowned light heavyweight champion Rashad Evans , who stole the belt from Forrest Griffin at the UFC ’s year - end event less than two months ago .
But if Jardine comes away the winner , it will likely be Machida that gets his long - awaited shot at championship gold .
St. Pierre Still Not Top Pound - for - Pound in White ’s Book
Despite his resounding win over Penn on Saturday night , St. Pierre still is n’t at the top of Dana White ’s pound - for - pound list .
It ’s Anderson Silva that remains there .
“ I would say right now Georges is second , ” White said concerning his pound - for - pound rankings .
“ Anderson Silva is still at the top .
He ’s been decimating guys for a while now .
Georges has Thiago Alves next and if he beats him , he ’s definitely on his way . ”
With St. Pierre and Silva both continuing to win and win in devastating fashion , a potential showdown between the two at 185 lbs remains on the UFC ’s docket .
It ’s a sure - fire win -win situation for the UFC in terms of PPV buys and public interest that they refuse to ignore .
“ What I think we should do is have guys stay in their weight classes for a while , but I ’m a fan of super - fights , ” White said asked about the possibility of the matchup .
“ If these guys continue to do what they are doing and keep on fighting , then yeah , we could see that . ”
White Set to Tap Into Japanese Market
Longtime Japanese pound - for - pound phenom Norifumi “ Kid ” Yamamoto was a surprise guest in White ’s popular video blogs early last week , leading many to speculate that Yamamoto could be headed to World Extreme Cagefighting ’s featherweight division in the near future .
White confirmed Zuffa ’s interest in Yamamoto as well as that of a few other notable Japanese fighters during Sunday morning ’s press conference with the media .
I ’ve been a Kid Yamamoto fan for a long time .
I ’d love to get him over here , ” White said .
“ He has two fights left on his K - 1 contract and he told me that his dream is to end his career over here with us , so I ’d like to see it happen . ”
“ Caol Uno … I love him .
He ’ll always be a part of the UFC and we ’re talking to him too , and the same goes for Ishii also .
The Japanese market has always been important to me .
It ’s always been a tough place to navigate , but we ’re going to do it anyway .
That will not stop me from going into Japan . ”
More UFC Primetime Shows Expected in Future
The UFC’s “ Primetime ” shows in the weeks leading up to the St. Pierre - Penn rematch were a huge success for both the organization and Spike TV , leaving no doubt as to more of them in the future .
According to White , the experience was great and will likely continue .
“ I thought it went well .
It was a good experience , ” White said concerning the taping of the show .
“ Obviously me and B.J. got into a fight , but other than that , yeah , it was good .
We ’ll do it again .
I think we would save “ Primetime ” for only a couple of the big fights of the year … maybe three at the most . ”
White though , was unsure about the prospects of a “ Primetime ” series for the upcoming UFC heavyweight title unification rematch between Brock Lesnar and Frank Mir in May .
“ I ’ll have to think about it , ” White said .
St. Pierre , Penn Already Given Opponents for Title Defenses
Dana
White confirmed at the post - fight press conference that as expected , Georges St. Pierre will defend his UFC welterweight title next against Thiago Alves , who came into the cage to congratulate him after his victory , and B.J. Penn will drop back down to 155 lbs to defend his lightweight belt against Kenny Florian .
White however , would not reveal a timetable concerning potential dates for the respective fights .
“ I have no idea right now , ” White said .
“ I have n’t talked to Georges yet .
I have no idea how he ’s feeling .
I ’m sure that after this B.J. is going to go back to Hawaii , rest up , think about what he did wrong in the fight , and then he ’ll be back to defend against Kenny . ”

Searching dumps for components to sell
A Greenpeace undercover operation has shown 23,000 tonnes of computers are being illegally exported to Africa every year .
When added to other forms of toxic e-waste , up to 500,000 tonnes of tech waste could be being dumped in countries like Nigeria every year .
Greenpeace has found the UK ’s tech waste is being dumped in developing countries instead of being recycled .
Around 500,000 tonnes of tech waste in the UK are unaccounted for every year .
By using GPS technology to track a TV intended for recycling , the charity has shown how waste from the UK is poisoning countries like Nigeria .
" Companies can stop this illegal toxic trade now by ensuring their goods are free from hazardous components .
It is critical they take full responsibility for the safe recycling of their products and put an end to the growing e-waste dumps that are poisoning people and the environment across the developing world , " said Martin Hojsík Greenpeace International Toxics Campaigner .
Some will be repaired and reused , but many are beyond repair meaning they will eventually be dumped in countries where no facilities exist for safe recycling .
Europe , the United States , Japan and South Korea are using developing countries , including Nigeria , Ghana , Pakistan , India and China , as toxic e-waste dumping grounds .

Will Breen , suffragist ?
It almost felt like the male version when the Brandon University student recently tried to form a campus advocacy group for men .
Breen made his motion at the Brandon University Students ' Union ( BUSU ) annual meeting last month .
One elected council member set the tone of debate , scoffing that Breen 's group would be nothing but a " pornography and cigar club . "
As a man , he huffed , he did n't require representation .
Other speakers were miffed and simply could n't see the need .
The motion was defeated .
At another forum , a female professor could barely tolerate hearing Breen 's reasons for starting a Men 's Collective .
" She was saying that men do not have need of representation , that we have historically been the oppressors , that we have no position of disadvantage , " the fourth - year geology student recalled .
But Breen is n't forming another group to compete for victim status .
He questions why everyone thinks a group should be " disadvantaged " to have an advocacy group .
" Men have issues just like everyone else , " he maintained .
Some are specific health issues , like testicular cancer , which strike men mostly at ages 20 - 34 , and prostate cancer .
His Men's Collective would also advocate on men's issues , like partnering with schools to campaign against bullying .
About 20 students have signed up so far , agreeing to a statement of principals and a code of ethics .
" It 's to be a public service organization that recognizes that , as men , we have a duty to contribute positively to society , " Breen said .
He described the group as " somewhat akin to the Rotarians and Lions Club , " but a freshened up version .
It would partner with women 's groups on matters like prevention of violence against women .
The collective , which would not ban women members , would also be a voice politically , especially since men now have minority status at BU .
Women make up 67 per cent of the student population , outnumbering men by two to one .
This is not a new trend at universities , but it 's more pronounced at BU .
Women now make up more than 50 per cent of students at most universities across North America .
Men are the majority on the Brandon University Student 's Union council , but it 's the special interest representatives that often initiate policy , says Breen , formerly a member .
After further review , council relented last Wednesday , but put the men on a short leash .
The men will receive $ 400 in funding for outreach work and will have to prove themselves to attain Men 's Collective status .
Breen says he 'll take the money , even though it 's not much more than the chemistry club receives .
The Women 's Collective gets $ 5,000 per year , and received a $ 2,000 startup grant .
The Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Trans - gender Commission gets $ 2,000 annually .
BUSU president Stephen Montague said he 's not opposed to a Men's Collective , but volunteered that " personally , as a male on campus , I 'm not a member nor will I be . "
" It comes down to the historical inequality that still exists , " Montague explained , citing the fact that men still hold most top positions in society , from world leaders to CEOs to university professors .
While that 's true , it does n't look at the whole picture , says social psychologist Roy Baumeister of Florida State University .
" If one were to look downward to the bottom of society instead , one finds mostly men there , too , " Baumeister said in a 2007 address to the American Psychological Association .
Men make up the majority of the homeless and imprisoned .
They fill riskier jobs .
In the U.S. , 93 per cent of people killed on the job are men .
It 's higher in the military .
Of 108 Canadian soldiers killed in the Afghanistan war , 107 were men .
Men also die earlier , and are nearly 10 times more likely than women to commit suicide .
The reason is motivation , Baumeister says .
New DNA analysis shows today 's population is descended from twice as many women as men .
That is , throughout all of history , about 80 per cent of women , and only 40 per cent of men , reproduced .
It 's that fierce , Darwinian competition for the female that leads to extreme and risky win- or - lose behaviour among men .
" The basic social insecurity of manhood is stressful for the men , and it is hardly surprising that so many men crack up or do evil or heroic things or die younger than women , " Baumeister said .
Funny how something you think you know for sure is a fact , can change .
Just a few years ago , we were virtuously tearing down the walls of men-only clubs , like the Rotarians , and now we 're finding need for them again .

Milan supporters have insisted that Kaka should be the next captain after Maldini retires .
Kaka has chosen to stay at Milan despite the fabulous offer received from Manchester City .
This wish was also accepted by Maldini with one condition : Kaka should not leave Milan for Real Madrid .
Even if he refused the money from Manchester City because he can’t leave his friends and the religion played an important role , Kaka could be tempted by Real Madrid .
At Real he would benefit from the best conditions and he should not have to worry about the performances at Real Madrid as it was the case with City .
With Kaka captain Milan would follow Arsenal model where Fabregas was rewarded with the captain armband thanks to the great evolutions on the ground .
Also the Brazilian express his desire to become someday Milan ’s captain in 2007 just after winning the Golden Ball Award “ I believe that I ’m already a leader inside the team , but I would like to become the captain , the flag of this team “ .
Kaka was considered until recently the young symbol of Milan and many could consider that he does not have the same leadership like Gattuso or Ambrosini .
Also Ancelotti declared that he thinks that is more important to feel like a leader than wearing the armband and that Kaka could be the captain if the whole team want him to be .

ANGRY residents last night accused local authorities of contributing to the bushfire toll by failing to let residents chop down trees and clear up bushland that posed a fire risk .
During question time at a packed community meeting in Arthurs Creek on Melbourne 's northern fringe , Warwick Spooner  whose mother Marilyn and brother Damien perished along with their home in the Strathewen blaze  criticised the Nillumbik council for the limitations it placed on residents wanting the council 's help or permission to clean up around their properties in preparation for the bushfire season .
" We 've lost two people in my family because you dickheads wo n't cut trees down , " he said .
Message board : Find missing friends and family .
" We wanted trees cut down on the side of the road and you can't even cut the grass for God 's sake . "
Later , the meeting was cut short when Mr Spooner 's father , Dennis , collapsed in his chair and an ambulance had to be called .
Despite losing his wife and son and everything he owned , a friend later said he had not stopped or slept since the weekend .
Rogue FBI agent who inspired ' The Departed ' jailed for 40 years for killing witness set to testify against the Mob
' The dark side ' : Former FBI agent John Connolly , shown here appearing in court , has been jailed for 40 years
A rogue FBI agent has been jailed for 40 years for killing a witness who was about to testify against the Mob .
A judge told FBI agent John Connolly he had ' crossed over to the dark side ' .
The former agent 's decision to switch sides was said to be the inspiration for the character played by Matt Damon in the hit film ' The Departed . '
Damon played a Massachusetts State Trooper detective who supplied his Mob connections with information .
During a two - month trial in Miami , Florida , a jury heard that Connolly , 68 , was on the Mafia payroll - receiving money from notorious Mob leader James ' Whitey ' Bulger who ran the Winter Hill gang in Boston in the 1980s .
Bulger is the FBI 's second - most wanted fugitive after Osama bin Laden and is being sought for involvement in 19 murders .
The court heard that Connolly would supply his Mob connections with tip - offs about police raids and leak the names of informants .
He was convicted of the 1982 murder of businessman John Callahan , whose bullet - riddled body was found in the boot of a car at Miami Airport .
Connolly told his mob connections that 45 - year - old Callaghan was preparing to give evidence against the notorious Winter Hill gang in Boston .
A 'hit ' was taken out on the father - of - two before he could implicate Bulger .
Connolly has denied being a corrupt agent .
He said : ' I never sold my badge .
I never took anybody 's money .
I never caused anybody to be hurt , at least not knowingly , and I never would . '

Connolly is understood to have inspired Matt Damon 's character in the film
Prosecutors had asked that Connolly be given a life sentence , saying the 30 - year minimum was not enough because Connolly abused his badge .
At the end of his trial in Miami , Florida , Judge Stanford Blake , said : ' Mr Connolly , the jury has found that you tarnished the badge that so many wear proudly .
For an FBI agent to go to the dark side is a sad , sad day for any judge or any society to see . '
Connolly , who retired from the FBI in 1990 , is already serving a 10 - year prison term for his 2002 federal racketeering conviction for protecting Bulger and his side kick Stephen Flemmi .
He warned them to flee just before the gangsters were indicted on federal charges in Boston in January 1995 .
Finland ’s Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) is looking at ways to upgrade its existing missile defence system , from the present arsenal of Russian Gadflies to something more compatible with NATO systems .
Finland has been using 16 Gadfly surface - to - air missile systems ( SAMs ) since 2006 , when it negotiated a trade for the package from Russia .
Finland ’s Gadfly system is now about halfway into its expected life cycle , so the MoD is considering switching to NATO - standard SAMs for the future .
Whether the move is designed to appease NATO allies or to distance Russian hardware from Finland ’s defences can only be speculated .
But Finland is apparently looking at the French - Italian SAMP/T system and the Norwegian - Kongsberg NASAMS as future SAMs .
If Finland replaces its SAM system , it will come at a cost of around USD 700 million .
According to Defense News , Finland Defence Minister Jyri Hakamies refused to comment on the actual SAMs candidates currently under consideration , since the project is still in its politically “ sensitive ” phase .
Finland ’s 2009 defence budget has not allocated any specific funding for a new SAM system , but Defence Forces Staff spokesman Lt. Col.
Sampo Eskelinen said : “ The Finnish Air Force hopes that new NATO - based SAMs could be in place by 2012 . ”
The Air Force has already stated that it does n’t feel modernising the existing Gadfly system is worth the effort , so a totally new SAMs system may likely be coming .

If Western politicians and media are to be believed , the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) is an anti-Semitic , religious fundamentalist , terrorist outfit that forms part of an al Qaeda - ( or , alternatively , Iranian - ) led movement which seeks to violently impose Islamic law on the world , and is dedicated to the annihilation of Jews .
However , what is Hamas ’s actual practice and the source of its strong popularity among Palestinians ?
Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) elections , which international observers described as the most democratic in the Arab world .
In government , it has attempted to eradicate corruption and gangsterism .
The demonisation of a democratically elected political leadership has become the justification for war crimes .
The entire infrastructure of Gaza — hospitals , mosques , government offices , schools , water and energy , food stores , emergency services , orphanages — can be defined as “ Hamas infrastructure ” because Hamas remains the civil authority .
“ Hamas infrastructure ” is equated with “ terrorist infrastructure ” , providing Israel and its Western backers with justification for deliberately targeting such civilian institutions , in flagrant violation of international law .
This equation of “ Hamas ” with “ terrorist ” is also used to legitimise the kidnapping and assassination of Palestinian parliamentarians and officials .
Such assassinations — often carried out in crowded places using missiles fired from war - planes or predator drones that maximises the killing of bystanders — have continued throughout every truce observed by Hamas .
As the Israeli army ’s Major Avital Leibovich explained on Janaury 2 , “ Hamas leaders [ are ] marked men .
We have defined legitimate targets as any Hamas - affiliated target . ”
The demonisation of Hamas stems not from its religious views or practice , but Western hostility to Palestinian self - determination .
In a February 2006 interview , newly elected Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh told the Washington Post ,
“ We do not have any feelings of animosity toward Jews .
We do not wish to throw them into the sea .
All we seek is to be given our land back , not to harm anybody …
We are oppressed people with rights . ”
The key to Hamas ’s popular support is not to do with Islam , but its role in resisting Israeli aggression .
It advocates equality between religions .
A March 2008 assessment of Hamas ’s current practice by the International Crisis Group reported that Hamas “ denies any intent of coercively imposing an Islamist entity ” .
The ICG reported “ no flagrant signs of Islamisation of the courts and schools .
The authorities did not alter the PA school curriculum , the PA ’s law code or its constitution . ”
Women have been appointed to high - profile positions , such as to the judiciary and appeals court .
According to the report , “ A Hamas official maintained : ‘ The people in Ramallah are trying to stigmatise Hamas as extremist .
But an Islamic emirate will not come about in Gaza ’ ” .
Rather , in the face of Israeli aggression , Hamas has advocated a united front of resistance involving all Palestinian factions .
The firing of homemade rockets into Israel has been cited as evidence of Hamas ’s aggression , yet any objective account of the conflict would present such actions for what they are — a response by representatives of an oppressed group to far greater aggression by one of the best - armed military powers in the world .
The latest six month - long ceasefire that preceded Israel ’s recent bout of slaughter ended only after Israel , which failed from the start to implement the terms of the agreement and ease the crippling siege on Gaza , murdered six Palestinians on November 4 .
Rather , the Western claim that Hamas is not an “ acceptable partner for peace ” reflects the real purpose of the endless “ peace processes ” that have followed the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993 : to preserve the existence of an exclusively Jewish state in a country where only half the population are Jewish .
While the Palestinians had historically striven for a “ democratic , secular state ” covering the whole Palestine in which all people within it could live in equality , under the leadership of Yasser Arafat ’s Fatah party , the Oslo Accords signed with Israel accepted the premise of a two - state solution , whereby an independent Palestine based on the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 ( the West Bank and the Gaza Strip ) would exist alongside Israel .
However , while Palestinian acceptance of the “ right ” of Israel to exist as an exclusively Jewish state was a precondition for talks , discussion of the geographic definition of the Palestinian state was deferred and Israel has refused to negotiate on crucial issues , such as the right of Palestinian refugees driven from territory claimed by Israel to return to their homelands .
In the West Bank and Gaza , the building of Jewish - only settlements and bypass roads were increased .
It became clear that the Palestinian “ state ” would have authority only in geographically seperated , walled ghettos .
With Palestinians denied a viable economy , the Palestinian Authority became dependant on financial support from Israel ’s Western allies who demanded it crack down on threats to Israel ’s security .
While there were limits to Arafat ’s willingness to surrender to Israeli diktats , under his successor , Mahmoud Abbas , the Fatah - led PA accepted the role of policing the ghettos created in the West Bank and Gaza .
In the 2006 elections , Palestinians rejected the collaborationist politics of Abbas , and the corruption and criminality that came with the Western financial backing .
Hamas ’s election victory was in coalition with secular and Christian parties and was on the basis of a nationalist agenda .
While remaining committed to the ideal of a united , democratic Palestine , the Hamas - led PA was willing to offer a long term truce on the basis of Israel returning to its 1967 borders .
However , Israel surrending 22 % of the territory it controls was never the intention of the “ peace processes ” .
The US and the European Union immediately placed economic sanctions on the PA to punish Palestinians for voting for a leadership that refused to collaborate in the annihilation of the Palestinian people .
In June 2007 , despite Hamas attempts at forming a government of national unity , Abbas carried out a coup against the elected PLC in the West Bank .
In Gaza , however , well - armed US - trained forces led by Mohamed Dahlan failed in an attempt to dislodge the Hamas - led PA .
Since then Gaza has been under a starvation siege as well as subject to constant military assaults of varying intensity .
Hamas has continually shown willingness to enter truces based on very partial demands , such as ceasing military attacks and lifting the Gaza siege most recently .
However , unlike Abbas ’s Fatah , Hamas refuses to make endless unreciprocated concessions .
Its popular legitimacy derives from this .
As Khalid Mish’al , head of the Hamas political bureau explained in the January 6 Guardian : “ No rockets have ever been fired from the West Bank .
But 50 died and hundreds more were injured there last year at Israel ’s hands , while its expansionism proceeded relentlessly .
“ We are meant to be content with shrinking scraps of territory , a handful of cantons at Israel ’s mercy , enclosed by it from all sides .
The truth is Israel seeks a one - sided ceasefire , observed by my people alone , in return for siege , starvation , bombardment , assassinations , incursions and colonial settlement … ”
“ The logic of those who demand that we stop our resistance is absurd .
They absolve the aggressor and occupier — armed with the deadliest weapons of death and destruction — of responsibility , while blaming the victim , prisoner and occupied .
“ Our modest , home - made rockets are our cry of protest to the world .
Israel and its American and European sponsors want us to be killed in silence .
“ But die in silence we will not . ”
The banking crisis has deepened in recent days on both sides of the Atlantic .
Barclays shares fell by 25 per cent yesterday on fears that the Government would force it to take part in the bad bank .
Citigroup said it was to split itself in two to ring - fence its failing assets after disclosing £ 20 billion of losses in the past 15 months .
Bank of America received a £ 14 billion cash injection from the US government .
In the last 6 months , the US economy has seen perhaps the largest shake - up since the great depression .
The real estate market severely receded after hitting new all time highs , unemployment is now over seven percent , the financials industry has seen a number of emergency mergers and acquisitions , it ’s much more difficult to get certain types of loans , and government debt is piling high as the eye can see .
We ’ve seen a number of banks either fail or nearly fail and be saved by the last minute by a fed - engineered buyout by another bank .
The first to go was Indymac back in September .
Other banks such as Wachovia and AIG soon followed suit .
There are still a number of banks , such as Citigroup , that are still teetering on the edge , despite large cash injections from the federal government .
What is it that all of the banks that have failed or have come close to failure have in common ?
They were lending people that simply could n’t afford to repay their loans .
There was simply a massive amount of available credit , so instead of letting that investment money sit idly by , they relaxed lending standards so that more people could get loans , even if there was no reasonable expectation that they could afford them .
These banks started offering sub - prime mortgages to consumers with histories of bankruptcy , large amounts of outstanding debt , relatively little income and generally bad credit .
The banks justified these loans using advanced calculations which took into the factor that some of the customers would fail to repay , but on balance the investments were still sound .
Unfortunately , the banks severely underestimated the percentage of people that would fail to repay their loans and the value that these banks had in those mortgages fell dramatically .
However , there were a group of banks , mostly small community banks and credit unions , that were largely unaffected by the major problems faced by the financials - industry .
These banks and credit unions were much more careful about who they lended money to , taking a much closer look at the person and their ability to repay before offering them a loan .
They offered fewer sub - prime mortgage options to customers , so they have had much fewer of the ‘ toxic ’ assets on their balance sheets which might otherwise cause a bank to go insolvent .
Ultimately we can learn that the answer to the nation ’s major bank problems is not injections of capital or new regulation , but rather a new commitment to only loan money to people that can actually afford to repay the loan .
It ’s time to move away from only looking at a number to determine someone ’s credit - worthiness and look at the person as a whole .
The political crisis that has suddenly erupted in Canada adds yet another dimension to the seemingly unending shockwaves set in motion by the global financial crisis .
The sheer political escapism that led all the leaders ( even the NDP's Jack Layton ) to solemnly pledge during the recent federal election not to run a deficit -- when it was already clear that the severity of this crisis is such that no government can avoid a deficit even if it wants to -- has now rebounded on us with a vengeance .
One shock effect of Finance Minister Jim Flaherty 's economic statement was that it so flatly contradicted Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's conversion to Keynesianism on the road to Lima .
What the statement showed was that while the government was going to talk the talk at international meetings , it was actually going to try to be a free rider on such stimulus as the Americans would undertake .
The other shock was that the statement 's proclamation of old - fashioned fiscal rectitude was tied to an opportunistic attack on free collective bargaining , pay equity and the public funding of political parties -- not only narrowly partisan , but also largely gratuitous .
Without this , the opposition parties may not even have tried to defeat the government .
But the ideological cover Barack Obama and Gordon Brown have given them in recent weeks must have helped steel their courage , even after Mr. Harper drew back , to unite behind the claim that their own reconversion to Keynesianism is more genuine -- and genuinely multilateralist .
And all constitutional precedents suggest that it will be very difficult for the Governor - General to deny them the chance to form and sustain a government so soon after a general election in which they together obtained a clear majority of the vote .
The question remains , however , whether the opposition parties themselves have taken on board , any more than Mr. Obama or Mr. Brown , just how much of a break is needed with the basic logic of capitalist markets in such a severe crisis .
Sauve qui peut , each firm lays off workers and tries to pay less to those kept on ; taken together , this has the effect of undercutting the overall demand in the economy .
It 's the classic case of micro-rational behaviour having the worst macro-rational outcome .
It was such illogic that initially led the Tories to use the statement to try to set an example for the private sector by restricting the collective bargaining rights of the secretaries and statisticians , cleaners and computer programmers who work for the government .
This was exactly what the federal Liberal government did in the recession of the early 1980s and Bob Rae 's Ontario NDP government did in the recession of the early 1990s .
But even without this , whatever either any government might now do by way of direct public spending or adjusting taxes to encourage consumption will likely not be enough to offset the private sector 's own tendencies to engage in the macro-illogic of cutting jobs and wages , and thus workers ' main sources of income .
The specific problem in this particular crisis is that all the massive drops of liquidity that governments everywhere have helicoptered onto the financial system in the past 15 months have not restored the banks ' capacity or willingness to lend at anything like previous rates -- even to each other , let alone to firms or to consumers .
The recent British and U.S. decisions to infuse their banks with public capital by buying some of their shares reflected the hope that this would overcome the banks ' mistrust of each other 's solvency .
Mr. Flaherty 's statement showed that the Tories are prepared , " if necessary , " to do the same thing .
But nor does this type of capital infusion work to unclog the financial system , as may be seen by the latest hundreds of billions the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury committed to buying or guaranteeing the banks ' bad debt , even after their capital infusions .
And it was also seen in the Bank of England 's lowering of interest rates by 1.5 per cent , only to find that the banks would n't lower their own rates accordingly .
Her Majesty 's
Treasury could only use moral suasion to try to get the banks to do so , while reassuring them that all the state wanted as a shareholder was that the banks would operate prudentially on commercial criteria .
But it may be that banks cannot lend sufficiently to lead us out of the crisis .
This is precisely because the whole system of securitized finance that has grown up over the past few decades -- whereby the risk on mortgages , consumer credit and business loans is sliced , diced , repackaged and traded around the world -- has imploded .
Even the Financial Times now warns in its editorials that it may not be possible to avoid much longer the issue of really taking the whole banking system into public ownership , given its current disfunctionality .
Indeed , there has long been a strong case for turning the banks into a public utility , given that they can't exist in complex modern society without states guaranteeing their deposits and central banks constantly acting as lenders of last resort .
In Canada , as the New Democrats prepare themselves for federal office for the first time in their history , the prospect of turning banking into a public utility might be seen as laying the groundwork for the democratization of the economy that the party was originally committed to when it was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation , four years into the Great Depression .
But there is no need for the bankers to set up barricades on Bay Street just yet .
As the Globe and Mail reported , the Liberals took pains last week " to reassure Canada 's banks ... that a Liberal - led coalition would not harm the economy or financial institutions . "
And even the NDP has taken it for granted for the past 50 years that all that democratic socialist public ownership stuff was more or less all behind us .
But as the current crisis goes to show , we are far indeed from the end of history .
Capitalism is full of surprises .
And , for that matter , so is socialism -- which is very likely to be soon heard from again as a serious democratic political force .
When the logic of capitalist markets goes haywire , people can see the point , and the possibility , of new systemic alternatives to it .

7 Using Airplane Seating As A Repelling Site Upon arriving at my assigned row , I found a woman on the brink of collapse as a curly - haired child -- let 's call her Mothra -- bounded from the floor up to the middle seat , then back to the floor , then up to the window seat using the magazine pockets for footholds .
As she attempted the maneuver again , I quickly slid by and took the window seat .
I offered Mothra a friendly smile .
She responded with the wide eyes of a mad scientist receiving an unexpected visit from a future test subject .

Before Xena and Hercules filled filled mid-90s television with humorous Sword and Sorcery , their was a TV show called “ Wizards and Warriors ” .
Are you asking yourself , “ Why have I never heard of this show ? ”
Well that ’s because it had a very short life .
It premiered and was canceled in 1983 and although it developed a fanbase , it was never large enough to save the show .
The show was created by Dan Reo of “ Blossom ” fame for Warner Bros .
and it had its full 8 1 - hour episode run on CBS .
Most of the 8 episodes were directed by Bill Bixby who , as always , did a great job .
Now I bet your next question is who was cast as the lead of this show ?
Your thinking a bodybuilder ?
Perhaps a Schwarzenegger or maybe even Marc Singer type ass - kicker ?
Not even close .
Try Jeff Conaway of “ Grease ” , “ Taxi ” and “ Celebrity Rehab ” fame .
He was joined by Walter Olkewicz , Duncan Regehr , Clive Revill , and the surprisingly well cast Julia Duffy .
It ’s hard to explain the show if you have never seen it , but I will give it a shot .
Conaway plays Erik Greystone who is engaged to princess Ariel .
She is the daughter of the King Baaldorf and Queen Lattinia who rule the virtuous land of Southern Aperand .
Erik and his pal , Marko , who is the strongest man in the kingdom are constantly foiling the plans of the neighboring kingdom ’s Prince Dirk Blackpool and his wizard adviser Vector .
Also from time to time Erik ’s brother fun-loving / cowardly brother Justin shows up to screw things up .
When you ask people who have seen this show what they thought of it , you will get mixed reactions .
The show IS silly .
Sometimes people seem to slip out of character and the lack of a consistent accent in this fantasy work is distracting .
That being said .
The show has moments of sophistication and quiet jokes that you really need to watch to appreciate .
For example in the first episode , there is a great bottomless pit joke .
It involves a tough castle guardian being thrown down said bottomless pit and we only hear the audio as he continues to plummet for what sounds like more than a minute .
A few moments later we hear the guardian ’s grunts .
How did he live ?
The special FX are passable for an 80s show .
Laughably , they use stock footage from the film Excalibur for battle scenes and the sword work is a step or two up from basic stage fighting .
The show was raw , but it showed potential .
It really is a shame they did n’t give it a chance , “ Wizards and Warriors ” really could have been an earlier version of “ Hercules : The Legendary Journeys ” .
Cast List
Jeff Conaway – Prince Erik Greystone
Walter Olkewicz – Marko
Duncan Regehr – Prince Dirk Blackpool
Julia Duffy – Princess Ariel
Clive Revill – Wizard Vector
Thomas Hill – King Baaldorf
Ian Wolfe – Wizard Tranquil
Tim Dunigan – Geoffrey Blackpool
Jay Kerr – Justin Greystone
Julie Payne – Queen Lattinia
Randi Brooks – Witch Bethel
I really need to talk about my two favorite people on the show .
New Jersey ( yeah NJ ! ) born Walter Olkewicz is great as strongman Marko .
He has an affable “ good buddy ” quality that is difficult to find on television .
You might recognize him from his work on dozens of shows including Seinfeld , Twin Peaks and Night Court .
His work on Seinfeld , where he played “ The Cable Guy ” is one the great moments of that show :
Great character actor – he is double - plus good .
Another stand out on the show is Julia Duffy who plays the spoiled princess Ariel with remarkable aplomb .
She brings a charisma to what could have been an unlikable character .
Upon re-watching I found myself looking forward to her scenes .
I can see why she was asked to revise a similar role on Newhart .
So you are interested and want to see the show for yourself ?
Well as far as I know the show is not in syndication .
I had to order my full copy of the series off eBay , but I will keep my eyes open and will post if the show is ever released on DVD .
Enough of me babbling .

It was n’t easy to silence the set of “ Saturday Night Live , ” which at Friday evening ’s rehearsal was a cacophony of banging hammers , buzzing saws and chattering crew members , but Steve Martin did it with a banjo .
On the main stage of NBC ’s Studio 8H in Manhattan , wielding a Gibson Florentine from the 1920s and accompanied by a quintet of bluegrass musicians , Mr. Martin was plucking , strumming and , yes , singing his way through an original song called “ Late for School , ” about a young delinquent racing to beat the tardy bell .
The hoedown brought the room to a halt , and when it was over even the surliest stagehands could n’t help but stand and applaud .
In his mercurial career Mr. Martin , 63 , has gone from manic , rabbit - eared stand - up comedian to introspective memoirist .
He has made movies for Carl Reiner ( “ The Jerk ” ) and David Mamet ( “ The Spanish Prisoner ” ) alike .
Through his many incarnations a banjo has never been far from his reach , whether the instrument was an integral part of his act or a tool to help him unwind in private .
Now Mr. Martin is once again in the musician ’s role as he releases an album called “ The Crow : New Songs for the Five - String Banjo . ”
The record ( which is being sold exclusively on Amazon.com , until April 26 , when it also will be released elsewhere ) is a token of his affection for bluegrass , with appearances by performers like Vince Gill and Dolly Parton .
But it is also an opportunity to show off one of his less celebrated , least commercial skills , and to reimmerse himself in a musical genre he never fully gave up .
For the Reps and potential - voting Senators , that is .
And , I suppose , anyone who supports this legislation So you ( the Reps ) have just passed something that says fetuses have personhood / legal rights .
When do these rights start ?
Conception , right ?
Perhaps one day when there will be a test for that .
I suppose that means they retroactive then , from a positive pregnancy test ?
When will an embryo get its social security number ?
How many more government officials will you be paying to deal with this ?
Speaking of giving embryos SSNs , what are you planning on doing for the ones that are frozen in the IVF clinics in your state ?
What , again , were you planning with regards to infertility treatments ?
Since a woman 's body is giving life to the embryo or fetus via the placenta / umbilical cord / blood / uterine environment and this embryo or fetus has full rights of personhood , how will the woman then be monitored ?
If she eats something like , oh , sushi ... will she be fined ?
After all , you are n't supposed to do that as it could be dangerous to the embryo / fetus and the embryo / fetus is a full legal person that one cannot submit to harm .
How much is too much Starbucks ?
Again , how will this be monitored ?
Also , how much more money will have to be put into Medicaid and the like to pay for all the women now legally forced -- yes , that 's what it is -- to give birth ?
How much are you going to raise taxes to pay for more hospitals , more doctors , and more clinics ?
Oh and I 'm sure the over - burdened and under - funded foster care system thanks you .
Speaking of harm , what about miscarriages ?
If an embryo / fetus has full legal standing as a genuine / individual person , the its ' death ' will need to be investigated via autopsy .
When I miscarried , I started bleeding on a Wednesday .
I went in for my ultrasound on Thursday where it was confirmed .
I could n't get into see my ob / gyn until very early Friday morning , which by then I had naturally passed everything ( into the toilet ) .
Should women who face the same situation straddle a bucket to bleed in ?
Keep her pads ?
Take the contents to the police ?
The contents of such will need to be investigated to make sure that there was no foul play involved , as again , an embryo / fetus is a full legal person whose death would warrant an investigation and , eventually , death certificate ( which , btw , are not given for miscarriages now ) .
How much more money will this cost ?
These ideas were submitted before the VA state legislature some time back , btw , if you recall .
But also necessary if declaring embryos full - fledged people which you are doing .
So .
An embryo is a person of legal standing and abortion is murder .
Ok then .
Murder is a very serious crime .
So , somehow or another , a woman is ' caught ' trying to abort ( or aborted ) .
Perhaps the tox screen of her miscarriage contents show black cohosh .
Maybe she showed up septic at the hospital with a partially done abortion like so many women in the mid-late 20th century .
Either way , she 's guilty of trying to or already committing murder under your new legislation .
Where are you going to put all these new prisons ?
How are you going to pay for them ?
If " abortion is murder " there must be criminal investigations , trials , more prisons , and it all has to be paid for .
So you have more social workers , more foster stipends , more hospitals , more clinics , more welfare needs for those who do n't relinquish , more police time in criminal investigations , more DA 's to prosecute , more prisons ... so what programs in ND are going to get the axe to pay for all of this ?
Let me know what you come up with .
I 'm sure it will be something of the same stunning caliber as the initial law you retrofuck , mysoginistic assholes just passed .
Many people with psychiatric disorders do n’t sleep well , for instance being plagued with insomnia ( Image : Christopher Bissell / Stone )
Read our related editorial : Restless or unrested ?
TAKE anyone with a psychiatric disorder and the chances are they do n’t sleep well .
The result of their illness , you might think .
Now this long - standing assumption is being turned on its head , with the radical suggestion that poor sleep might actually cause some psychiatric illnesses or lead people to behave in ways that doctors mistake for mental problems .
The good news is that sleep treatments could help or even cure some of these patients .
Shockingly , it also means that many people , including children , could be taking psychoactive drugs that cannot help them and might even be harmful .
No one knows how many people might fall into this category .
“ That is very frightening , ” says psychologist Matt Walker from the University of California , Berkeley .
“ Would n’t you think that it would be important for us as a society to understand whether 3 per cent , 5 per cent or 50 per cent of people diagnosed with psychiatric problems are simply suffering from sleep abnormalities ? ”
First , we ’d need to know how and to what extent sleep disorders could be responsible for psychiatric problems .
In the few years since sleep researchers identified the problem , they have made big strides in doing just that .
Doctors studying psychiatric disorders noticed long ago that erratic sleep was somehow connected .
Adults with depression , for instance , are five times as likely as the average person to have difficulty breathing when asleep , while between a quarter and a half of children with attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) …
" [ We ] dont know whether the PS3 lifespan will be eight , nine or ten years "
Though maintaining even as recently as a month ago the PlayStation 3 would have a ten - year lifespan , Sony Computer Entertainment Europe boss David Reeves has expressed uncertainty on that front in an upcoming interview with Play magazine .
" The competition will have new models on the market by the end of the PS3 , " he commented .
" I have no doubt and we ’ll have to be fast on our feet ..... I do n’t know whether the PS3 lifespan will be eight , nine or ten years . "
He noted PlayStation 4 is not as of now " on the horizon " .
Sony stated two weeks ago their current console is " inherently future - proof " , and would surely outlast the PS2 , which is now going eight years strong .
The Bank of England is ready to launch a policy of " quantitative easing " – printing money – in an effort to lift the economy out of what the Bank calls " a deep recession " .
The Bank 's central forecast , in its latest Inflation Report , suggests that annual growth in the UK economy will hit a nadir of - 4 per cent in the summer of this year .
The Bank warns that " the risks surrounding the central projection for growth are judged to be weighted heavily to the downside " , with an outside chance that the economy could , at its worst , contract by an annual rate of 6 per cent in the summer , a slump of historic proportions .
This represents a savage downgrade from the predictions the Bank was making only last November .
The report now suggests an overall contraction in 2009 of about 2.5 per cent , in line with recent forecasts from the IMF and others , leaving Britain at the bottom of the international growth " league table " .
If the growth forecast proves accurate , it will be the UK economy 's worst year since the Second World War .

In the Budget next month or in early April , the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , is almost certain to follow the Bank and radically revise the Government 's growth forecast for this year down from the current - 1 per cent , with chilling implications for the scale of public borrowing , already heading to record levels .
Sterling tumbled as the Bank published its views , falling as much as 1.5 per cent against the dollar .
As the scope for further cuts in interest rates diminishes – the Monetary Policy Committee has cut rates by 3.5 percentage points since the start of November , to 1 per cent – the Bank seems ready to go further , and as soon as the next MPC meeting on 4 and 5 March .
The Governor of the Bank , Mervyn King , declared : " Bank rate does n't have to go to zero .
...
We are now at the range where it does n't make a great deal of difference where the Bank rate is – we are at the point where we need to think about taking other sorts of action . "
At the end of this week , the Bank will launch its Asset Purchase Scheme , aimed initially at the narrower target of repairing the malfunctioning market for corporate debt .
A wider programme of " unfunded " asset purchases of gilts and other securities seems likely to be agreed by the MPC in March .
This will raise the commercial banks ' reserves and increase the money supply , inducing a modest burst of inflation to combat falling prices .
How far and how fast this will proceed has yet to be decided by the MPC , and must be formally approved by the Government .
However , the inflation forecast published by the Bank yesterday , showing the consumer price index as low as 0.5 per cent by 2010 and still well below the 2 per cent target by 2012 , suggests this quantitative easing may have to be very substantial .
Mr King commented : " The projections ... imply that further easing in monetary policy may well be required .
That is likely to include actions aimed at increasing the supply of money to stimulate nominal spending . "
Even so , there was doubt in the City as to whether even this approach will work .
Philip Shaw , at Investec Securities , said : " There are no indications over how successful quantitative easing would be in stimulating lending and activity .
The Japanese experiment earlier this decade is largely thought to have been ineffective .
There is no guarantee that banks ' excess liquidity would find its way to households or businesses , as banks could hoard the cash at the Bank of England or lend to non-bank financial corporations . "
Malcolm Barr , of JP Morgan , added : " Given that the relationship between broad money and central bank reserves is not very stable , we wonder whether calibrating how much to supply versus what money growth is doing will be workable in practice . "
Whatever the prospects for policy , the Bank was clear about the short - term pain from a combination of depressed global demand and trade , the continuing shortage of credit and de-stocking .
The most visible effect of the recession , or depression as it is being called in some quarters , is the steep rise in the dole queues .
Yesterday the Office for National Statistics reported unemployment had reached 1.97 million between October and December , a 12 - year high .
Mr King specifically mentioned the growing threat of protectionism , and the uncertainties about how quickly the various measures taken by the authorities around the world – banking rescues , fiscal stimulus packages , interest rate cuts and printing money – would work .
In an occasionally irascible performance , Mr King tried to assure reporters that " we have a policy framework which is capable of getting us out of this and these measures will work " .
The Bank forecasts a very strong recovery in the latter half of this year and in 2010 .
The 25 per cent decline in sterling since the summer of 2007 will , the Bank believes , foster a " re- balancing " of the British economy , towards investment and exports , and boost the economic recovery .

A suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber blew herself up in northern Sri Lanka on Monday at a processing center for displaced residents fleeing the war zone , killing 28 people and wounding dozens , the military said .
The attack in Vishwamadu comes as the rebel group -- which experts say pioneered the use of suicide vests as part of its three - decade fight for a Tamil homeland -- finds itself encircled and increasingly desperate .
The female bomber , who has not been identified , had been in line several hours when Sri Lankan soldiers approached to check her and other people ’s identity , at which point she detonated her vest , said Brig .
Udaya Nanayakkara , a Sri Lankan military spokesman .
He said 20 soldiers and eight civilians were killed .
“ This shows the LTTE is desperate , ” Nanayakkara said , using the abbreviation of the group ’s official name , the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam .

Because of the tight controls on journalists entering the war zone , the attack could not be independently confirmed .
Footage on state - run television showed the body of a girl in a purple dress , large pools of blood on the ground and the wounded being put in the back of a truck .
In recent weeks , the Sri Lankan government has come under pressure from the international community to halt its offensive so an estimated 250,000 civilians trapped by the fighting can move out of the crossfire .
The government has refused , saying that any cessation would allow the Tigers to escape along with the displaced , or give them time to regroup .
Tamils are a minority in Sri Lanka , which is composed primarily of Sinhalese .
The U.S. and the European Union have labeled the Tigers a terrorist group .

Colombo , the capital , had the feel of an armed camp Monday , a full - moon - festival holiday , with army checkpoints every couple of hundred yards and high - caliber guns positioned on rooftops and at strategic intersections behind green - sandbag barriers .
Traveling even a short distance by vehicle often meant stopping repeatedly to show identification and answer detailed questions on the purpose of the travel .
Rohan Gunaratna , head of the Singapore - based International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research , said the Tigers were mounting attacks such as the suicide bombing to show they are viable and to bolster their morale .
“ I believe they will do more such attacks , ” he said .
“ They do n’t mind inflicting fatalities among civilians to send the message that they ’re fighting back . ”

The Tigers have seen the territory under their control reduced to less than 100 square miles from more than 7,000 a year ago as the government offensive has surged .
Beate Arnestad , a Norwegian filmmaker who made a 2007 documentary on two female Tamil Tiger suicide bombers , said those she met had been part of the Tigers for most of their lives , having been kidnapped , handed over to the group or run away to the join the group at a young age .
The young women had known little but conflict for most of their lives , Arnestad said , and were highly obedient to their commanders , who strictly controlled the information they received .
She said she found them extremely fit , dedicated , intelligent and very proud of being part of the elite Black Tigers suicide squad .
Arnestad said they would have been overachievers in a more conventional environment .
“ They were brought up on the front lines and are children of war , ” she said .
“ They think the Tigers saved them , that the Tigers are the only way to have freedom , prosperity .
They ca n’t really think for themselves . ”

The Sri Lankan government recently said its quarter - century battle against the Tigers was all but over .
But Gunaratna said he did n’t think it would be that easy .
“ The fight with the LTTE is far from over , ” he said .
“ It has entered a different stage and they are cornered .
But over the next few months , the fighting will be in the jungle . ”

Emma Thompson and Alastair McGowan among those who have bought one - acre plot right at heart of proposed development
Land earmarked by Heathrow owner BAA to build a third runway has been bought by a group of celebrities , scientists , politicians and green campaigners in an attempt to severely delay the development .
The new runway would make Heathrow Britain 's biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions .
Oscar - winning actor Emma Thompson and comedian Alastair McGowan , along with Conservative party green adviser Zac Goldsmith , Greenpeace director John Sauven and others , have signed the deeds for a one acre field on the edge of the village of Sipson , which will have to be demolished to make way for the runway .
The plot lies right at the heart of the proposed runway development .
The new owners said that they intended to divide up the acre plot into small parcels and then sell them , without making a profit , to people concerned about climate change all around the world .
As many as 4,000 people could end up owning the scrubland , which lies behind the car park of the William IV pub and next to an old gravel quarry .
The government would use its powers to issue compulsory purchase orders for the plots but lawyers said yesterday that the existence of thousands of owners would make this process time - consuming and expensive .
Similar tactics have been used successfully to protect tropical forests .
Transport secretary Geoff
Hoon is expected to give the green light to a third runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow when the decision is announced .
Yesterday business and aviation groups called for the runway to go ahead in newspaper advertisements , arguing it was vital for jobs , economic growth , investment and the long - term competitiveness of the UK 's economy .
Colin Matthews , BAA chief executive , said : " A third runway will only go ahead if strict environmental limits are met . "
Emma Thompson said : " I do n't understand how any government remotely serious about committing to reversing climate change can even consider these ridiculous plans .
It 's laughably hypocritical .
That 's why we 've bought a plot on the runway .
We 'll stop this from happening even if we have to move in and plant vegetables . "
Others sharing the ownership of the plot were named yesterday as Labour MP John McDonnell , Conservative front bench transport spokeswoman Justine Greening , Lib Dem MP Susan Kramer and climate scientist Dr Simon Lewis .
" It 's a very good time to enter the property market .
If BAA want my patch they will have to negotiate with me – and why would I want to sell it to them ? " said Kramer .
McGowan said : " The government is sticking two fingers up to the environment and the people of this world .
By giving this runway the go - ahead Gordon Brown is effectively holding a giant blow torch to the polar ice - caps and saying ' Melt , Melt ! ' "
No details have been given of the price paid to the local landowner , or what individuals will be asked to pay .
" No profit will be made " , said Greenpeace director John Sauven .
" This is public activism .
We will resist all attempts at compulsory purchase and will represent millions of people from across the world at any planning inquiry . "
At full capacity , an expanded Heathrow would become the biggest single source of C02 emissions in the country .
It would emit nearly 27 m tonnes of CO2 every year – equivalent to the emissions of 57 of the least polluting countries in the world combined .
Yesterday , Greenpeace said that it took them nearly a year to identify the land and buy it from under the nose of BAA .
" We had to have a cover .
We pretended we wanted land to set up a donkey sanctuary . "
Linda McCutcheon , chair of No Third Runway Action Group and a Sipson resident said that she thought the new owners would not have paid much more than the cost of agricultural land – about £ 3,500 an acre .
However , similar land , also without planning permission , in Middlesex is on the market for more than £ 100,000 an acre .
Without much fanfare or self - congratulations , networking giant Cisco Systems has become one of the top contributors to the Linux kernel and an active contributor to the broader open source community .
It 's a message that Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) is n't boasting about yet , but was willing to discuss with InternetNews.com .
Cisco is the world 's largest networking vendor and a technology juggernaut that is seeing the value in using and contributing to open source .
For example , Cisco is one of the top contributors to Linux , according to a recent Linux Foundation study .
While Cisco uses and produces proprietary software and hardware , the firm is actively participating in open source development efforts on a number of fronts .
Cisco 's open source participation ramp up comes as it expands its product lines like the Nexus , which benefit from Cisco 's Linux efforts .
" The benefits of open source are really clear to all the executives I work with that report all the way up to [ CEO ] John Chambers , " Cisco engineer Roland Dreier told InternetNews.com .
" There is no question that open source is a key part of a modern engineering organization .
As budgets get tighter , I think that open source will be one of the last things we would retreat from , since we see such huge benefits from the participation that we have now . "

Excerpt :
'A MELBOURNE father of two young boys believed to have been abducted by their mother in Sweden claims a taxpayer - funded feminist group called Kobra is involved .
Swedish authorities are investigating members of Kobra amid allegations the group is using a vast network of " safe houses " and covert techniques to help the mother and children evade police .
George Pesor last saw his sons Frank , 11 , and Andre , 9 , in September 2008 after the Family Court in Australia ordered they be allowed to travel to Sweden to visit their estranged mother Ann -Louise Valette .
The boys were supposed to return to Melbourne on October 11 but they disappeared along with Ms Valette , who has a warrant out for her arrest after being charged with their kidnapping .
Mr Pesor said he now believes his sons are living with their mother in Sweden in one of 30 secret hiding places he alleges are operated by Kobra . '
I ’ve been dividing the continent again .
Back in the summer of 2000 , on a coast - to - coast car trip , I began wondering about the Great Divide , the line that traces the spine of North America , separating the Atlantic and Pacific watersheds .
How would you identify that line out on the landscape , or on a topographic map ?
Eventually I wrote some programs to explore the problem , and then an American Scientist column .
The column became a chapter in my book Group Theory in the Bedroom .
What brings me back to the problem now is a wonderfully generous review of that book by David Austin , published in the February issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society ( PDF ) .
Bill Casselman , the Graphics Editor of the Notices , suggested putting a montage of my continental - divide maps on the cover of the issue .
When I pulled out the old images to get them ready for republication , I also started reading through the code that generated them , and I checked back with the National Geophysical Data Center to make sure the base map was still available .
The topographic map I worked with in 2000 is called ETOPO5 ; it samples the elevation of the earth ’s surface with a grid spacing of 5 minutes of arc .
Roughly speaking , that works out to square pixels 10 kilometers on a side .
ETOPO5 is still there on the NGDC site , but it ’s listed as “ deprecated . ”
The Center now offers finer - grained data sets : ETOPO2 has 2 - arc - minute resolution and ETOPO1 has a pixel every 1 arc minute .
There is also something called the GLOBE Database , which gets down to 30 arc seconds , corresponding to pixels about 1 kilometer on a side .
I decided it might be fun to try to reproduce my old result with the higher - density data .
Would the algorithm put the divide along the same path ?
Here ’s the answer to that question :
The upper map is the original version from 2000 ; the lower one uses the 30 - arc - second elevation data .
The red line is the computed location of the Great Divide , separating the blue Atlantic from the green Pacific .
Over most of the length of the divide , the two maps coincide pretty closely , but there ’s a notable deviation in western Wyoming , just above the middle latitude of the region shown .
On the low - res map , the Atlantic bulges westward from the Wind River Range all the way to the Utah border .
In the high - res map , the Pacific has reclaimed that territory .
Which map is correct ?
I ’ll come back to that question , but first I want to point out that creating the higher - resolution image was not just a matter of dusting off the old program and running it on new data .
What fun would that be , anyway ?
When the project began in 2000 , I was working on a brand new Macintosh G4 running MacOS 9.0.4 , and my favorite programming environment was MacGambit , an implementation of the Scheme programming language created by Marc Feeley .
By now , my old G4 is probably leaching heavy metals into some Asian landfill , and the software of that era is equally inaccessible .
Nevertheless , the divide - drawing program was not beyond salvaging .
After an hour of fiddling and tweaking , I got it running on new hardware with a new operating system and a new Scheme implementation .
I was able to regenerate the same maps I produced nine years ago , using the same data as input .
But working with the higher - resolution terrain models was another matter .
A first try with the 30 - arc - second data ran for 12 hours without producing a result .
The ETOPO5 map , with its 100 - square - kilometer pixels , dices my slice of North America into a 720 - by - 300 array , for a total of 216,000 pixels .
When I downloaded a swath of the GLOBE Database covering the same territory , I had a 7,200 - by - 3,000 array , or 21.6 megapixels .
If we assume that the program ’s running time is proportional to the pixel count — that it ’s an O ( n ) program — then we should expect a 100 - fold increase .
That would be bad enough , but on reviewing the code I got worse news : I discovered that one step in the algorithm was likely to be quadratic in the number of pixels — O ( n2 ) rather than O( n ) .
That meant a 10,000 - fold increase in running time .
Here ’s the basic idea behind the divide - finding algorithm .
You start by putting a drop of blue dye somewhere in the Atlantic and a drop of green dye in the Pacific .
Then you gradually raise the water level , letting each ocean flood the adjacent shoreline pixel by pixel .
( I named the main procedure global - warming . )
Eventually , the blue and green waters have to meet ; where they do , erect a red wall to keep them from mixing .
As the waters continue to rise , extend the wall as needed .
The path of the red wall is the continental divide .
A simple invariant captures the essence of this process : A pixel p is on the divide if and only if , at some point in the process of raising the sea level , p is still unflooded but has neighboring pixels of different colors .
A crucial requirement of the algorithm is that the two oceans rise synchronously ; otherwise , one ocean would reach the site of the divide first and would spill over into the other basin .
In a physical model ( i.e. , real water ) you could count on the self - leveling property of liquids to enforce the rule of simultaneity ; but computational fluids are not so cooperative .
To avoid spillage , I raised the level of each ocean in small increments , equal to the difference in elevation between the current water level and the height of the next highest pixel anywhere in the terrain .
To implement this idea , I set up a baroquely complicated structure of stacks and queues , which kept track of all pixels currently at the land - water interface .
That ’s where the quadratic process intruded .
I was adding each neighbor of each coastline pixel to a linked list , and checking in each case that the neighbor was n’t already present in the list .
Checking for uniqueness in an unordered list of n items takes n steps , and performing the check for each of the n items therefore takes n2 steps .
( Actually , the n in this formula is not the total number of pixels in the map .
It ’s the number of pixels on the waterline .
How large could a list of waterline pixels grow ?
The length of the list is given by the fractal dimension of the coastline !
That dimension is likely to be somewhere near 1.5 .
For the 7,200 - by - 3,000 - pixel map , we can expect roughly 300,000 pixels in the list .
Thus the situation is n’t quite as bleak as 21,600,0002 , but the square of 300,000 is still a large number ; I do n’t want to have to do anything 300,0002 times . )
There are lots of remedies for this problem — a sorted list , a priority queue , a hash table .
I wound up taking a really easy way out : I just ignored the problem .
It ’s much quicker to store a pixel twice and then discard the duplicate than it is to check in advance for uniqueness .
No pixel can appear in the queue more than four times ( once for each neighbor ) , and so the cost in wasted space is tolerable .
The data structure I finally settled on is an array of stacks , with one stack for each elevation in the map .
( There are roughly 4,000 distinct elevations , measured in integer units of one meter . )
Pushing a pixel onto a stack is an O ( 1 ) operation .
Popping a pixel off the array of stacks is usually O( 1 ) as well , although there ’s an additional small cost when we take the last pixel at a given elevation and have to search for the next occupied level .
When Bill Casselman proposed the Notices cover , I set out merely to revise and tidy up my old program , but inevitably I succumbed to the urge to scrap it all and start fresh .
The new program is written in Common Lisp rather than Scheme — not for any deep reason , just because that ’s the flavor of the week .
The new version sifts through the 21 - megapixel map in a matter of seconds , although writing out Postscript images at various stages in the process ( 125 megabytes each ) takes somewhat longer .
So what about that Wyoming bulge ?
When I first noticed the discrepancy between the older and the newer maps , I thought I knew exactly what was going on .
Some diagrams of the continental divide show a “ bubble ” in Wyoming , where the divide itself divides , and then the two branches rejoin , enclosing a basin that does n’t drain into either ocean .
I immediately guessed that my program was following one edge of the bubble with the low - resolution data and taking the other path with the high - res data .
But that ’s not the answer .
The bulge is too large and in the wrong place .
Here are details extracted from the two maps ( one has been enlarged and the other reduced ) :
The bubble , if it exists , is roughly in the position of the yellow dot , southeast of the prominent white “ eyebrow ” formed by the Wind River Range .
In the low - res map , the divide takes an excursion 150 kilometers farther west , circling another major basin .
I ’ve seen no published sources that support this geography ; all maps show the divide following the Wind River Range , as in the high - res image at right above .
River drainage patterns on standard maps also make it clear : Streams on the western slopes of the Wind River Range flow into the Green River and then into the Colorado .
Thus if you make a rest stop at Marbleton , Wyoming , near the center of these images , what you leave behind will end up in the Pacific , not the Atlantic .
And so I have to conclude that my 2000 map of the divide , which has now been published three times ( in American Scientist , in Group Theory in the Bedroom and on the cover of the Notices ) , takes us down the wrong path in this region .
The cause of the error could be a bug in my program — it would n’t be the first time — but I do n’t think that ’s what ’s going on here .
I believe that both maps correctly describe drainage patterns on the landscapes they represent , but those landscapes are not the real North American continent ; they are checkerboard arrays of absolutely level , absolutely square tiles .
Smaller tiles capture more detail than large ones .
In particular , the 100 - square - kilometer tiles of the ETOPO5 map flatten out small topographic features that might form a barrier to the flow of water .
With closer scrutiny , perhaps I ’ll be able to identify the specific site of the leak .
Interestingly , the “ bubble ” explanation that I hoped would account for differences between the 5 - minute and the 30 - second maps does appear to work in the case of the 1 - minute and the 30 - second maps .
The image below superimposes the divides calculated by the algorithm for these two data sets , with the 1 - minute map in blue and the 30 - second map in red :
The paths diverge just southeast of the Wind River Range , forming a bubble very much like the one on standard topo maps .
There ’s another smaller bubble to the northwest , in the Yellowstone caldera .
Everywhere else , the two trajectories agree to within a pixel or two .
If the Wind River bubble is a real feature of the North American landscape , should n’t a divide - finding program detect it ?
In the global - warming algorithm , if you start out by dyeing one pixel blue and another green , you are guaranteed to get a two - coloring of the entire map .
The expansion of one color cannot stop until it butts up against the other color ; there ’s no way to leave an uncolored void .
The series of diagrams below shows what happens .
At the far left is the initial state : a ridge with a bubble in the middle .
In the second panel , the blue and green waters are lapping at the rim of the central basin .
The barrier is perfectly symmetrical , with all pixels on the rim at the same height .
Nevertheless , the symmetry is necessarily broken when the sea level is raised still further .
The basin is filled either with blue or with green , and the divide runs only on one side ; the result looks like either the third or the fourth panel .
The choice is essentially random , determined by the sequence in which the pixels are flooded .
The only way to create a bubble in the divide is to deliberately implant a seed for a third color in the interior of the basin , as shown at the far right .
The 2000 version of the program was hard - wired for two colors only .
It knew about the Atlantic and the Pacific but had no provisions for other bodies of water .
In the rewrite I allowed for additional basins .
Below is a detail of a high - resolution map seeded to create independent watersheds in the Wyoming bubble and also in two other basins that do n’t currently have significant natural drainage to an ocean .
Here ’s the computed outline of the bubble at 100 percent magnification :
It looks plausible enough , but I need to add a caveat : Just as the two - color version of the program is certain to produce a two - colored map , starting with three colors ensures that the map will show three watersheds , whether or not they exist on the landscape .
For that bubble to be a real feature , under the strictest definition of a divide , the two branches of the divide must have the same minimum elevation .
If two hikers walked along those paths , each carrying an instrument that records their minimum altitude , the readings would match when they reunited .
The fact that the flooding algorithm shows a bubble in the divide does not guarantee that this condition is satisfied .
Seeding a third color anywhere on the map will produce a basin of that color .
Quite apart from the whole question of continental divides and mathematical analysis of terrain , I have become enchanted by the ghostly view of landforms that emerges from a simple grayscale rendering of the high - resolution elevation maps .
Above is a region of southern Appalachia , where the feathery dendritic traces of drainage channels seem to be inscribed as positive images in some areas and negatives elsewhere .
On the west coast ( above ) , we see more dramatic drainage patterns ( the big river near the top is the Columbia ) and also a glorious string of volcanoes lit up like a constellation in the night sky , from Mount Shasta at the bottom to the diamond configuration of Mount Hood , Mount St. Helens , Mount Adams and Mount Rainier at the top .
Finally there ’s this disturbing image .
I do n’t think I would be able to identify the location if it were n’t for the telltale forms of Long Island and Cape Cod toward the bottom .
The deep north - to - south fissure at the left is the Hudson River Valley ; the even bigger diagonal gash at the top is the St. Lawrence .
Together they cut off the New England states and the Atlantic provinces of Canada , which seem not to belong to the same continent as the rest of us .
What we ’re seeing here looks for all the world like a great mass of bedrock scraped clean by glacial action , but remember that this is not a photographic image or anything like one ; it ’s an elevation map .
Most of what looks like polished bare rock is actually forested terrain .
Also intriguing is a line of white dots — they look like puffs of smoke — in the St. Lawrence valley .
I thought at first they must be some artifact in the data , but a glance at satellite photos shows they ’re quite real .
They are the Monteregian Hills , isolated outcroppings of igneous ( but not volcanic ) rock exposed as softer surrounding material has washed away .
One of the dots is Mont - Royal , the hill from which Montreal takes its name .
All these features are best appreciated in the full , high - resolution images .
Frustratingly , I ca n’t show those here .
I ’m sure I ’ve already transgressed on the bounds of blog politeness with this long and bulky post ; adding a 125 - megabyte image file would get me beaten up by the bandwidth bullies .
The best I can offer is a pair of images that are full size in terms of pixel count ( 7,200 by 3,000 ) but have been JPEG compressed to a more manageable size .

Almost forgot :
There ’s also an animated GIF that I did back in 2000 .
And if anyone wants it , I can post the Lisp source code .
There ’s still more that might be done on the theme of continental divides .
One project I have in mind is to add the rest of North America .
I hear there ’s a whole nother country up there beyond the 49th parallel , with drainage into the Arctic Ocean .
Update 2009 - 02 - 11 : Thanks to all those who asked about the source code .
I ’m grateful not only for the interest but also for the nudge to properly document the program , which I would not have done if left to my own devices .
Of course I found another bug .
( The very last one , surely ! )
Because of an off - by - one error , the program was ignoring the very highest pixels in the landscape .
Anyway , the source code is now online here .
Quick responses to some of the comments :
Thanks for the tip on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data .
It looks like a fabulous resource for some project focused on a smaller area , but I ’m not quite ready to bump up the data volume by another factor of 900 .
Graph cuts for image segmentation : New to me .
Evidently I need to do some reading .
Thanks for the pointer .
( I am aware of connections to other work on image segmentation ; this was discussed at the end of my 2000 article . )
The idea of inundating the landscape and then doing the analysis as the water drains away is intriguing , but I ca n’t see quite how to make it work .
At the instant when the first peak of land emerges , the waters extend continuously in every direction .
How do you deduce which area drains to which basin ?
Or am I missing something obvious ?
On the problem of demarcating boundaries between oceans :
The traditional definition of a topologist is someone who ca n’t tell a donut from a coffee cup .
Now we have a new definition : Someone who goes swimming in Asbury Park and expects to come out of the water in Malibu .
Yes , mathematically there ’s no clear boundary between the Atlantic and the Pacific ; all the waters communicate , and there ’s really just one world ocean .
But some of us can still tell the difference between New Jersey and California .
Norway :
The NGDC data covers the globe , so you should be able to do a Scandinavian map .
As for the lake that drains to both coasts , the weirdest geographic fact I know is something I learned from a reader of my American Scientist column : I ’m told that you can take a boat up the Orinoco River in Venezuela and without ever leaving the water cross over into the Amazon basin , continuing downstream back to the sea in Brazil .
The continental divide is underwater !
To Brooks Moses on the idea of automatically identifying basins :
There are some corner cases where you need to be cautious .
For example , what happens when the Atlantic and the Pacific both reach the rim of a basin at the same time ?
Nevertheless , I think you ’re right , and a careful implementation of your idea would work as you describe .
But is the output useful ?
In the low - resolution ( 5 minute ) map of the U.S. there are at least 10,000 independent watersheds that your algorithm would identify and color .
There would be even more in the high - res data .
The spiderweb of divides becomes so dense that you learn nothing about overall drainage patterns .
For other applications — especially in image analysis — finding segments without the need for manual seeding is what it ’s all about , but the situation is not so clear for the peculiar problem of geographic watersheds .
Physicists have worked on the quantum physics description of the tunnelling effect for 60 years .
The group led by Ursula Keller has now for the first time succeeded in measuring time intervals that enable the direct measurement of the tunnelling time of electrons in laser - induced ionisation .
No corresponding delay was measured in the experiment : something that astonished many physicists .
An established but perhaps over - simplified explanatory model begins to look shaky .
When new technologies allow theoretical models to be tested experimentally , scientists must be prepared to say goodbye to accepted thought patterns .
The current publication by Professor Ursula Keller and her team at the Institute of Quantum Electronics of ETH Zurich could bring about just such a break with accepted wisdom .
The group succeeded for the first time ever in measuring experimentally the tunnelling delay times of electrons ionized in strong laser fields .
The tunnelling effect is responsible for the ability of bound electrons in atoms to pass through an energy barrier even though the barrier ’s energy is higher than the electron ’s binding energy .
According to classical physics , overcoming this barrier is impossible , hence the assumption of a quantum - mechanical process .
A popular way of illustrating this is to imagine a ball that does not have enough momentum to surmount a hump , so simply “ tunnels through ” it instead .
Keller says “ Contrary to some accepted theories , our measurement has shown that this so - called tunnelling ionisation takes place with almost no delay .
The results of her most recent experiments appear in a recent issue of the scientific journal “ Science ” .
Calibration problems solved
Based on calculations by several theoreticians , it was assumed that an electron took between 500 and 600 attoseconds ( 10 - 18 sec. ) to tunnel through a laser - induced tunnelling barrier .
A time interval of this kind was not measurable until recently , even using the shortest laser pulses .
However , Keller ’s team presented a method in “ Nature Physics ” last June that enables measurements down to 25 attoseconds by using femtosecond laser pulses ( see the box and the ETH Life article A stopwatch for the tunnel effect ) .
Keller ’s results at that time gave hope that the tunnelling time would soon be measured .
However , calibration problems still stood in the way of this enterprise .

To make a measurement in the region of a few attoseconds it is essential to calibrate “ time zero ” , i.e. the absolute zero point of the time measurement .
In the end the calibration was easier than had been assumed last summer : if the original direction of the laser field used for the measurement is determined unequivocally , a clear reference point is obtained for the angle of the laser clock ’s “ hour hand ” .
Keller says , not without pride , “ We now have a clock with an average accuracy of six attoseconds , or twelve if the error tolerance is included .
This is , without doubt , the most precise clock in the world . ”
No tunnelling time in the classical sense
The team now set about using this instrument to check the tunnelling time in the laser - induced ionisation of helium atoms .
Keller explains that “ There are many theories about the tunnelling process , but the authors often use the expression “ tunnelling time ” to describe completely different things . ”
Her group agreed on the term “ tunnelling delay time ” , and , in their current publication , they refer to the tunnelling time according to Keldysh and the “ Büttiker - Landauer traversal time for tunnelling ” .
Physicists have hitherto assumed that the delay resulting from “ tunnelling through ” the energy barrier is measurable by using an attosecond clock .
However , Keller ’s group were unable to demonstrate any such “ tunnelling time ” in the experiment ( with an upper limit of 12 attoseconds averaged over different laser field strengths and limited by the measurement accuracy ) .
The measurement was recalculated by the quantum theorist Harm Geert Muller .
He concluded that the results are in agreement with numerically solving the time - dependent Schrödinger equation , one of the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics .
Nevertheless , Keller does not claim that the tunnelling times according to Keldysh are wrong , “ but they do not describe a “ real ” tunnelling time according to our classical understanding , rather something different . ”
The same is also true for the “ Büttiker - Landauer traversal time for tunnelling ” , which is entirely self - consistent , as Markus Büttiker from the University of Geneva , one of the authors of this theory and a co-author of the current Science publication , was able to explain to the ETH Zurich group .
Room for new ideas and theories
Physicists – including Ursula Keller – are greatly astonished that the concept of “ tunnelling through ” in the laser - induced ionisation of atoms , which was accepted for many years , may now prove to be inadmissible .
The physicist warns that , “ Science benefits from such easily understandable pictures to reduce complexity , but they often have a limited scope of application and may even lead people astray and towards wrong ideas . ”
For Ursula Keller , such breaks with accepted ideas are precisely what makes quantum physics so fascinating .
Keller hopes that , “ Perhaps our results will provoke a whole series of quantum physicists to re-think their theories , thus making room for new ideas . ”
She has been visiting universities for several weeks and has discussed her results with physicists at Columbia University in New York , Stanford in California , Southampton and Berlin .
The physicist calls this “ hawking ” and uses it to underline her claim not only to publish scientific results but also to take an active part in their discussion throughout the world .
The attosecond clock
The “ attoclock ” attosecond clock , which occupies the space of two laboratories , is based on an almost circularly polarised infrared laser pulse and a “ COLTRIMS ” ( Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy ) detector .
In this device , the laser pulses move in a circle in space rather than in the form of a wave as is normally the case with a light beam .
The electrical field of the infrared light rotates once through 360° in space over 2.4 femtoseconds ( fs ) .
This creates a kind of clock face with an attosecond pointer instead of a second hand .
The length of the infrared pulse is only about 5 fs , which means that the laser - induced tunnelling ionisation takes place in principle within one revolution of the pointer .
Proof of the functioning of the clock with a helium atom was first published in July 2008 .
The “ attoclock ” was used to make the most precise measurements of time carried out so far in the atomic physics of strong fields .
John McCain is back in the news , trying to rehabilitate his rep after his disastrous campaign , and was on Larry King last night bringing the funny :
MCCAIN : No .
I think the president and I established a relationship of respect both in the Senate and during the campaign .
There were rough times in the campaign .
You know , you ’ve observed so many of them .
But at the same time , I think underlying the whole campaign was an environment of respect , which then allows you to — to come together and work for the good of the country .
R-E-S-P-E-C-T :
I guess McCain thinks “ THAT ONE ” defines respect differently from the rest of us .
You know those celebrities .
The soon - to - be first lady uses her star power to encourage kids to serve their country
Who could upstage Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers ?
At Monday night ’s Kids Inaugural concert , that would be Michelle Obama .
Entering Washington , D.C. ’s Verizon Center on the eve of her husband ’s inauguration , the soon - to - be first lady – accompanying daughters Sasha and Malia – was greeted by a crowd of 14,000 going wild and screaming : “ We love you Michelle ! ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Before calling upon the nation ’s youth to serve their country , Mrs. Obama pumped up her audience , many of whom were military families invited to attend the concert for free .
“ Barack and I are so thankful for the military sacrifice that helps make our nation safe , ” she told them .
“ We join you all today and every day in praying for your loved ones and their safety . ”
As a beaming Sasha and Malia took photos of their mom on stage , Mrs. Obama said , “ You kids are the future of this great nation .
And at this extraordinary moment in our nation ’s history , we wanted you to be able to join in on this celebration and share this incredible journey with us . ”
Message to Youngsters
To her young audience both watching over TV and sitting in the Verizon Center , Mrs. Obama said , “ You do n’t need to wear a uniform to serve this country …
We all have something incredible to contribute to the life of this nation .
And kids , this means you , too .
“ We need every American to serve their community including young people .
Whether that is volunteering at a homeless shelter or visiting an elderly person , whether it is picking up trash , writing letters to our troops , we can all do something special .
“ We can all work to make this great nation one filled with hope and prosperity . ”
Sasha and Malia Star Gaze
After the concert , which aired on the Disney Channel , Mrs. Obama and Sasha and Malia met backstage with many of the girls ’ favorites , including Miley Cyrus , the Jonas Brothers , Demi Lovato and Keke Palmer .
Of seeing the Obamas and Bidens dancing in the front row of his and his brothers ’ concert , Joe Jonas said , “ It was awesome .
I had to get them up on stage and celebrate together . ”
Said sibling Nick Jonas : “ I ’d like to live at the White House one day . ”
While the great debate over the " stimulus " spending bill was the focus of President Obama ’s Monday sermon , some of the questions asked at a subsequent press conference dealt with foreign policy , including a pointed one by CNN ’s Ed Henry , and it was a double zinger :
" Thank you , Mr. President .
You ’ve promised to send more troops to Afghanistan .
And since you ’ve been very clear about a timetable to withdraw combat troops from Iraq within 16 months , I wonder , what ’s your timetable to withdraw troops eventually from Afghanistan ?
" And related to that , there ’s a Pentagon policy that bans media coverage of the flag - draped coffins from coming in to Dover Air Force Base .
And back in 2004 , then - Senator Joe Biden said that it was shameful for dead soldiers to be , quote , ‘ snuck back into the country under the cover of night . ’
" You ’ve promised unprecedented transparency , openness in your government .
Will you overturn that policy so the American people can see the full human cost of war ? "
Hey , who let that guy in here , anyway ?
Obama ’s answer is a study in obfuscation and chilling sanctimony eerily reminiscent of his predecessor : " Your question is timely , " the president averred .
" We got reports that four American service members have been killed in Iraq today .
And , you know , obviously , our thoughts and prayers go out to the families . "
Correct me if I ’m wrong , but has n’t the question been timely for quite some time ?
After all , U.S. soldiers have been fighting and dying for eight years now in a war with no clear goal  except , perhaps , perpetual conflict for its own sake  and no visible end .
Obama ’s fabled calmness is really an uncanny ability to utter nonsense with absolute equanimity .
His entire answer is a peroration consisting of clichés strung together like plastic baubles on a dime - store bracelet .
There ’s a riff about how you know you ’re president when you have to console the families of fallen soldiers .
Ye gods , how many times have we heard presidents say this ?
It sounds like a line cut from a West Wing script .
Richard Nixon might have said it .
This is the moment when he feels truly presidential  when he realizes what a heavy burden it is having absolute power over the conduct of American foreign policy .
Or , as Obama puts it : " It reminds you of the responsibilities that you carry in this office and  and the consequences of the decisions that you make . "
Not that there ’s a chance he’d be willing to cede some of that decision - making back to the people ’s representatives , where the Constitution says it belongs .
You may dimly recall that , under the strictures set down by the Founders , only Congress may declare war .
Yet that power , once usurped by a pint - sized haberdasher , was permanently surrendered by Congress .
Certainly the majority Obamacrats would never dream of reclaiming it .
Obama refused to say that he ’d reject the Bushian policy of keeping cameras away from those coffins , claiming he does n’t yet " understand all the implications involved . "
A truly oily evasion , that one , to which the only possible rejoinder is :
What are the implications of continuing the policy ?
Such a decision would underscore the essential continuity of American foreign policy and chip away at the myth of Obama the great change - maker .
This is made all to clear in the rest of his answer , in which he touts the recent Iraqi elections as if they were n’t fraught with fraud and carried out in an atmosphere of intimidation , with the whole country practically put into lockdown .
At any rate , elections are now the metric of military success and a sign that we can move on to fresh battlefields , where the battle for Democracy , Goodness , and the American Way is not yet won :
" You do not see that yet in Afghanistan .
They ’ve got elections coming up , but effectively the national government seems very detached from what ’s going on in the surrounding community . "
How this is different from any other central government in Afghan history the president does not venture to say .
Does he think he ’s dealing with , say , France ?
Afghanistan ’s very geography makes it ungovernable , despite what you may hear from those geniuses over at the Center for a New American Security or whatever neoconnish name they ’ve dreamed up for the latest incarnation of American supremacism .
It ’s amazing how quickly Obama started sounding just like Bush , because , when cornered by this question on the Afghan endgame , he reverted to waving the bloody flag of 9/11 , just as his predecessor did in the run-up to war with Iraq , and long after the alleged links between Saddam and 9/11 had been thoroughly debunked .
The president claims " you ’ve got the Taliban and al - Qaeda operating in the FATA and these border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan , " and he promises a " concerted effort to root out these safe havens . "
The Taliban in Pakistan are not the problem when the Taliban control a great hunk of Afghanistan proper and the domain of the central government is largely confined to Kabul .
Furthermore , we have heard much about the alleged presence of al - Qaeda ’s shadowy remnants in Pakistan , yet we have seen no evidence .
Nor have we been offered any specifics .
It seems to me that the president came pretty close to saying , definitively , that Osama bin Laden is in the tribal areas , without , of course , actually coming out and saying it .
If he does n’t know this to be true , then Obama is doing precisely what Bush and his gang did to gin up a war with Iraq  lying .
It always comes back to 9/11 :
" The bottom line though  and I just want to remember the American people , because this is going to be difficult  is this is a situation in which a region served as the base to launch an attack that killed 3,000 Americans . "
A whole region ?
By this same token , then , so did Germany serve as a base for al - Qaeda , since the plotters lived in Hamburg for quite some time , where , presumably , they did their share of plotting .
And the original conception of the 9/11 terrorist attacks can be traced back to a meeting held in the year 2000 in Malaysia .
Therefore , according to Obama ’s logic , these two countries are prime candidates for revenge attacks by the U.S.
But this makes about as much sense as invading Italy in order to deprive the Mafia of its " safe haven . "
Terrorists do n’t need " safe havens " to plan attacks on the U.S.
They can do it anywhere .
That ’s their great advantage : " al - Qaeda " is more of an idea than a real organization .
By running with this " safe haven " malarkey , Obama  far from being " tough "  underestimates the real source and deadly power of the terrorist threat .
" I do not yet have a timetable " for getting out , Obama declared  aside from which , you know how these " safe havens " tend to proliferate .
Why , no sooner will Afghanistan be pronounced relatively clean of al - Qaeda than those scoundrels will somehow wriggle their way into Tajikistan , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan , and in all likelihood Uzbekistan  giving the U.S. a pretext to intervene in a region of the world our oil companies and other economic interests have long coveted .
One hopeful sign , however , is that he said he does n’t yet have a timetable .
Perhaps a vocal and visible protest against his neo-Bushian foreign policy will help concentrate his mind and speed up the process of timetable - creation .
( Washington , DC , May 5 , 2008 ) – Ostensibly color - blind , the US “ war on drugs ” disproportionately targets urban minority neighborhoods , Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project said in two reports released today .
Although whites commit more drug offenses , African Americans are arrested and imprisoned on drug charges at much higher rates , the reports find .
In the 67 - page report , “ Targeting Blacks : Drug Law Enforcement and Race in the United States , ” Human Rights Watch documents with detailed new statistics persistent racial disparities among drug offenders sent to prison in 34 states .
All of these states send black drug offenders to prison at much higher rates than whites .
“ Most drug offenders are white , but most of the drug offenders sent to prison are black , ” said Jamie Fellner , senior counsel in the US program at Human Rights Watch and author of “ Targeting Blacks . ”
“ The solution is not to imprison more whites but to radically rethink how to deal with drug abuse and low - level drug offenders . ”
Key findings in the Human Rights Watch report include :
Across the 34 states , a black man is 11.8 times more likely than a white man to be sent to prison on drug charges , and a black woman is 4.8 times more likely than a white woman .
In 16 states , African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at rates between 10 and 42 times greater than the rate for whites .
The 10 states with the greatest racial disparities in prison admissions for drug offenders are : Wisconsin , Illinois , New Jersey , Maryland , West Virginia , Colorado , New York , Virginia , Pennsylvania , and Michigan .
The Sentencing Project ’s 45 - page study , " Disparity by Geography : The War on Drugs in America ’s Cities , " is the first city - level analysis of drug arrests , examining data from 43 of the nation ’s largest cities between 1980 and 2003 .
The study found that , since 1980 , the rate of drug arrests in American cities for African Americans increased by 225 percent , compared to 70 percent among whites .
Black arrest rates grew by more than 500 percent in 11 cities during this period ; and , in nearly half of the cities , the odds of arrest for a drug offense among African Americans relative to whites more than doubled .
“ The alarming increase in drug arrests since 1980 , concentrated among African Americans , raises fundamental questions about fairness and justice , ” said Ryan S. King , policy analyst for The Sentencing Project and author of “ Disparity by Geography . ”
“ But even more troubling is the fact that these trends come not as the result of higher rates of drug use among African Americans , but , instead , the decisions by local officials about where to pursue drug enforcement . ”
Among The Sentencing Project report ’s key findings :
African - American drug arrests increased at 3.4 times the rate of whites despite similar rates of drug use .
Extreme city variations in drug arrests point to local enforcement decisions as a prime contributor to racial disparity .
Six cities experienced more than a 500 - percent rise in overall drug arrests between 1980 and 2003 : Tucson ( 887 percent ) , Buffalo ( 809 percent ) , Kansas City ( 736 percent ) , Toledo ( 701 percent ) , Newark ( 663 percent ) , and Sacramento ( 597 percent ) .
The Sentencing Project and Human Rights
Watch urge public officials to restore fairness , racial justice , and credibility to drug - control efforts .
They recommend public officials take a number of concrete steps , including :
Eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and restoring judicial discretion to sentencing of drug offenders ;
Increasing public funding of substance abuse treatment and prevention outreach to make these readily available in communities of color in particular ;
Enhancing public health - based strategies to reduce harms associated with drug abuse and reallocating public resources accordingly .
Today ’s reports follow in the wake of the March 2008 recommendations of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination .
The committee urged that US criminal justice policies and practices address the unwarranted racial disparities that have been documented at all levels of the system .
At Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas , visitors can pay a $ 7 admission fee , grab a shovel and try their hand at diamond prospecting .
The rule is " finders keepers . "
Over the past three years , annual visitation has tripled to 170,000 , and in 2007 tourists pulled more than 1,000 precious stones from the ground .
Some visitors use a special screen known as a seruca to wash and separate the heavier diamonds from the lighter debris .
Others just get down on their hands and knees , squinting for jewels in the furrows .
The 800 - acre park holds out the hope , however slim , that just about anyone can strike it rich .
Unfortunately , the park may also hold out a temptation for mineralogical mischief .
Eric
Blake , a 33 - year - old carpenter , has been coming to Crater of Diamonds two or three times a year ever since his grandfather first took him there when he was a teenager .
In October 2007 , his hard work finally paid off with the discovery of a whopping 3.9 - carat stone — nearly the size of the site 's Kahn Canary diamond that Hillary Clinton borrowed for her Arkansas - born husband 's presidential inaugural galas .
It 's the kind of rare find that 's spectacular enough to attract national attention .
Blake reportedly spotted the elongate , white diamond along a trail just as he was plunking down a 70 - pound bucket of mud and gravel he planned to sort through .
His lucky stone could be worth as much as $ 8,000 — if he can prove it came from Arkansas soil .
In the year since his discovery , fellow collectors , park officials and law enforcement officers have started wondering how Blake and his family uncovered an unprecedented 32 diamonds in less than a week .
" We have a concern of maintaining the integrity of not only the park , but the state of Arkansas , " says park superintendent Tom Stolarz , who caught a glimpse of the diamond as Blake was packing to leave the park .
Although Stolarz is not a geologist , he has been at the park for 26 years and has handled more than 10,000 diamonds , paying special attention to large stones .
Blake 's rough - hewn gem was certainly a diamond to Stolarz 's eyes , but was it an American diamond ?
The answer is more important than one might think .
Diamonds are merely crystallized carbon and today they can be created economically in a lab .
But the stones fascinate people ; the National Museum of Natural History 's diamond exhibit , featuring the Hope Diamond , is one of the most popular destinations in the Smithsonian Institution .
For many diamond buyers , history buffs and a quirky subculture of dedicated diamond hunters , provenance is everything .
Diamonds were discovered in Arkansas in August 1906 , when a farmer named John Wesley Huddleston found a " glittering pebble " on his property .
The next year the New York Times described " Diamond John 's " treasure in epic terms :
" The story of the discovery of diamond fields in one of the poorest counties of the not over - rich State of Arkansas reads like a chapter of Sinbad 's adventures . "
More than 10,000 dreamers flocked to nearby Murfreesboro , filling up the ramshackle Conway Hotel and striking up a tent city between town and the diamond field .
It was not an easy life , says Mike Howard of the Arkansas Geological Survey .
" Many people came , few people found , " he says .
" Most were gone within a couple of years . "
The majority of Arkansas diamonds , then as now , come in at under ten points , or about 1/10th of a carat .
But in 1924 , one lucky miner pulled a 40 - carat monster out of the ground .
Christened Uncle Sam , it remains the largest diamond ever discovered in the United States and a twinkle in every miner 's eye .
A lot of funny business has gone on around the diamond field over the past century .
After failing to gain full control of the area in 1910 , the London - based Diamond Syndicate allegedly set up a sham operation to downplay the mine 's potential and sabotage production , according to a Justice Department investigation .
In 1919 , two rival processing plants burned to the ground on the same January night , fueling rumors that someone was out to destroy the mine 's profitability .
In the late 1920s , Henry Ford was set to buy Arkansas industrial diamonds for his assembly lines , but the Diamond Syndicate and De Beers bribed the mine 's owner to keep it out of commission .
Shenanigans continued into the 1950s , when , for instance , an entrepreneur trucked some gravel from the diamond field to his own five acres north of town and plunked down a sign claiming he had a diamond mine .
Locals found him beaten up in a ditch the next morning , according to a story one Arkansas geologist has told over the years .
The state of Arkansas purchased Huddleston 's former property in 1972 and established Crater of Diamonds State Park , but that was n't enough to ensure the site 's integrity .
According to the book Glitter & Greed by Janine Roberts , mining companies tried , and failed , to get legislation passed to open the park up for commercial exploration .
By the mid-1980s , several companies were running aerial magnetic surveys to hunt for undiscovered pipes of diamond - rich rock outside the park 's boundaries .
" It was something else , " says Howard , who recalls seeing their helicopters in motel parking lots .
They identified one new pipe , but it was far too small to be worth exploiting .
In 1987 , then - governor Bill Clinton put together a controversial task force to explore the Crater 's commercial mining prospects .
One diamond executive estimated it could hold diamonds worth $ 5 billion .
The Sierra Club , the Arkansas Wildlife Federation and Friends of Crater of Diamonds State Park fought unsuccessfully in federal court to halt the plans .
By 1992 , exploratory drilling was approved — with environmental caveats — and geologist Howard was assigned to keep abreast of the work being conducted by four mining companies .
If the drilling had been successful , tourists would have been barred from the main pipe itself , although rock and debris would have been set aside for them to root through , and they could have toured the processing plant .
Some locals were miffed ; others looked forward to the estimated 800 jobs mining could bring to the economically depressed region .
But after they processed 8,000 tons of rock , diamonds proved too rare to make the scheme profitable .
The miners packed up their processing plant and shipped it to Canada .
Their drilling cores , however , provided geologists with the first extensive maps of the diamond - bearing cone of lamproite rock .
" Being a scientist , I wanted to have that information , " says Howard .
The surface area of the diamond field is 83 acres , and the cone funnels to a point some 700 feet below , making it the tenth - largest cone known in the world .
Howard says it 's shaped like a martini glass .
Arkansas diamonds originally formed more than three billion years ago under intense heat and pressure some 60 to 100 miles below the earth 's surface .
Then , about 100 million years ago , a giant gas bubble formed in the earth 's roiling magma and shot up to the surface at 60 to 80 miles per hour , pulling diamonds and other material with it before launching into the air and raining debris back down .
Some 60 to 80 percent of the diamonds forced to the surface were probably destroyed during this violent process .
The park contains the largest cone , but five others — covering just a few acres each — are also in the area .
Though the diamonds could not support a commercial operation , there is still room for profit .
Arkansas diamonds fetch about ten times more per carat than comparable stones , largely because collectors value the diamonds '
American provenance and unique character .
Many of the stones are smooth and rounded like a drop of glass , and they are among the hardest in the world .
They come in three colors : white , yellow and brown .
There 's practically no other major mine in the world with stones that could pass for Arkansas natives , except maybe the Panna mines in India .
( The similarity among the two sites ' stones is likely to be skin - deep , says Howard , although no one has documented the trace elements that could be used to fingerprint Arkansas diamonds . )
If Blake 's 3.9 - carat stone were an import , it would n't net more than several hundred dollars .
The rest of his stones would fetch far less .
When park superintendent Stolarz saw Blake 's diamond , he suggested Blake show it to Howard at the Arkansas Geological Survey .
Howard was on vacation but made a special trip to his Little Rock office when he got the call about the big diamond .
But Blake , who was driving back to Wisconsin with his fiancée and her daughter and sister , never showed up .
Howard called Blake 's cell phone again and again to no avail .
He reached Blake a few days later , and Blake explained that he " had a flat tire and did n't have time to come by , " Howard recalls .
A few weeks later , photographs of Blake 's stones popped up on eBay and Blake 's own Web site , Arkansas Diamond Jewelry .
When word of Blake 's finds reached the Murfreesboro Miner 's Camp , a trailer park and campground that hosts a population of good - natured diamond hunters , people were a tinge jealous .
And suspicious .
" I was like ' Jeez ! ' " says Denis Tyrell , 49 - year - old licensed handyman who says he has made a living digging diamonds for the last 18 months .
" You do n't just come here , pick a spot , find 40 diamonds , and say ' I 'll see you next year ! ' "
It took Tyrell ten days to find his first diamond when he arrived at the park in June 2006 .
His personal best rate has been 38 diamonds in 31 days , a record he achieved in October 2008 .
For all their suspicions , there was no evidence of wrongdoing .
Then a fossil and mineral dealer named Yinan Wang noticed something strange .
In September 2007 , he had purchased one of Blake 's smaller diamonds for $ 200 .
That December , Wang was interested in doing business with an Indian dealer named Malay Hirani .
Wang asked Hirani to share a copy of a recent Kimberley Process Certificate , which would ensure that his rough diamonds were not the so - called blood diamonds traded by warlords in Africa and would verify that Hirani had previously done business in the United States .
By chance , the certificate Hirani copied for Wang had come from an order Hirani had sent to Blake .
Wang — simply sizing up his potential business partner — decided to ask Blake if Hirani was trustworthy .
To his surprise , Blake denied the connection :
All our diamonds are from the U.S. , he said , according to Wang .
Wang did n't think much about the incident until March 2008 .
He was chatting with Hirani about sources for rough diamonds , and Wang mentioned Blake 's Web site .
The dealer looked at it and immediately thought he recognized some of Blake 's jewels as his own .
" I realized I had stumbled on something relatively big , " Wang says .
Hirani shared his receipts , shipping confirmation numbers , and photographs with Wang , and the duo later tracked the 3.9 - carat diamond to another source , they say : a Belgian dealer named Philippe Klapholz .
Tipped off by Wang , who was operating under the alias " Hal Guyot , " the Web site Fakeminerals.com spelled out the alleged fraud .
If Blake really did plant foreign diamonds in Arkansas soil , was it a crime ?
Pike County Sheriff Preston Glenn is investigating Blake and expects to complete his work in early 2009 , but says it would be up to the prosecuting attorney to determine what charges , if any , to pursue .
In the meantime , officials say that Blake has agreed not to return to Crater of Diamonds State Park .
Blake says he has done nothing wrong and simply posted the wrong photos on his site .
" A couple of diamonds were in question , but nobody has proven anything , " he says .
One Friday afternoon this past August , the diamond hunter Tyrell finally had his own lucky strike — he pulled a 4.42 - carat stone out of the ground .
For a while , it seemed , Blake 's alleged chicanery was no longer the talk of Murfreesboro .
It was Tyrell 's big day , and no one around there doubts that Tyrell 's stone is legitimate .
Stolarz sees him out in the park nearly every day , sorting through pebbles and taking samples home to examine come nightfall .

Harvard may be the nation ’s wealthiest university , but it is short on cash .
The school relies on its endowment to generate a third of the money for its operations , and the endowment is on the verge of posting its biggest loss in 40 years .
With much of its money tied up for the long term , it is scrambling to meet some obligations .
Harvard has frozen salaries for faculty and nonunion staff members , and offered early retirement to 1,600 employees .
The divinity school has warned it may not be able to cover tuition for all its students with need , the school of arts and sciences is cutting its billion - dollar budget roughly 10 percent , and the university president said this week than the unprecedented drop in the endowment was causing it to delay its planned expansion , starting with a $ 1 billion science center , into the Allston neighborhood of Boston .
The school has even added to its debt by issuing $ 1.5 billion in new bonds , its largest such offering ever .
Turning the ship around turns heavily on Jane Mendillo , who took over the Harvard endowment on July 1  which in hindsight looks like the worst possible moment to step into a job once held by some legendary investors .
The endowment , the largest of any university in the nation , has shrunk by at least $ 8 billion , to $ 29 billion , since she arrived .
( Adds name of traditional ruler , delegate comment )
ADDIS ABABA , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was elected chairman of the African Union on Monday and made clear he would pursue his vision of a United States of Africa despite reluctance from many members .
Resplendent in golden robes and cap and hailed as " king of kings " by traditional African leaders who accompanied him , Gaddafi accepted a gavel from the outgoing chairman , Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete , at a summit in Ethiopia .
He told fellow summit leaders that his project to create a united continental government would be approved at the next meeting in July unless there was a majority against it .
The AU normally relies on consensus in reaching decisions .
" If we do n't have a quorum for rejection , that means we have accepted it , " Gaddafi said .
" There is a rule in Islam .
It is that silence is approval .
If you say something to somebody and he is silent then it means that he has accepted . "
Gaddafi 's election was treated almost like a coronation by a group of customary African leaders dressed in colourful robes and headgear who accompanied him to the conference hall .
" On behalf of the traditional kings , on behalf of all the sultans , on behalf of all the princes , on behalf of all the customary rulers , I want to say thank you to the King of Kings who we have now crowned , " declared one of them , King Tossoh Gbaguidi of Benin .
The group , said to represent all Africa 's customary rulers , attended a conference sponsored by Gaddafi in Libya last September and he flew them to Addis Ababa for the summit .
Gaddafi , supported by some AU members like Senegal 's Abdoulaye Wade , has been pushing for a unity government for years , saying it is the only way to meet the challenges of globalisation , fighting poverty and resolving conflicts without Western interference .
SOUTH AFRICAN OPPOSITION
But others , led by regional economic powerhouse South Africa , see the idea as a distant and impractical prospect that would infringe the sovereignty of member states , although all 53 members of the AU say they agree with the idea in principle .
Gaddafi spent three decades preaching Arab unity before turning most of his attention to the African project , saying the continent was closer to him than Middle Eastern countries who had rebuffed his attempts to forge union .
One delegate , who asked not to be identified , told Reuters : " African countries should work closer together , yes .
But a United States of Africa is not something that could happen overnight .
Many countries have reservations . "
He said Gaddafi 's election would not change the situation .
An often heated three - day summit devoted to Gaddafi 's project in Ghana in 2007 did not reach a deal despite the participants being berated by the fiery Libyan leader .
The first day of this summit on Sunday again pulled back from accelerating the process .
Kikwete told reporters the meeting had agreed to replace the African Union Commission with an " authority " rather than an immediate pan-regional government as it had proposed .
This would be launched at the next summit in July .
He said this would move it closer to a federal government but he was vague on how much real new power the authority would have .
ALIEN PAST
For a month or so in the summer of 1990 , I was hired to work as a ‘ conceptual architect ’ on the movie project Alien III .
Given my legally contentious relationship with Hollywood film studios , I have to preface the post with this explanation : the drawings made by me that I reproduce with this post , and their copyrights , are the property of the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ; I reproduce them here under my rights of fair use , for educational purposes only ; copying or reproducing the images of these drawings for any commercial purposes , without the explicit permission of Twentieth Century Fox is strictly forbidden by law .
These drawings were made — in Hollywood and Pinewood Studios , England — for a movie that was never made .
The movie called Alien3 that was made and seen around the world was conceived and directed by David Fincher , and is notable for it ’s unremarkable sets and its unrelenting grimness .
The movie I made designs for was directed by Vincent Ward , but ended in its early stages , when he left the project .
The story of the Ward movie was radically different , though it deployed the same basic characters , in that the setting was a religious colony that had escaped the earth and inhabited an abandoned commercial facility deep in space .
They had adopted a Medieval way of life , without electricity or modern technology .
The Ripley - Alien drama was to be played out inside this crumbling , artificial world .
Under Ward ’s direction , this would have become something highly original , a movie in which the architecture would have had a central part .

Suppose you are teaching economics at a large university and want a new way of getting the interest of your students .
It occurs to you that a substantial fraction probably play World of Warcraft .
It also occurs to you — since you too play WoW — that the game contains a complex economy that poses all sorts of interesting questions for an economist .
You announce a new course — WoW economics — and get a gratifying large enrollment .
Now what ?
WoW has markets and prices , including an auction house with many buyers , many sellers , and a wide range of products for sale .
Prices are readily observed — starting prices , buyout prices , relative prices at one time , changes over time .
Actual sales prices are a bit harder , but if your students are active players they are probably buying and selling things and could be persuaded to keep track of prices paid and received and make the information available to the rest of the class .
Consider one simple puzzle — relative prices of ore .
Low level players mine copper , higher level iron , mithril , thorium , … .
What determines relative prices ?
One ’s first guess might be that prices are higher the higher the level of the ore ; a high level player can mine low level ores but not the other way around , making the potential supply higher at the lower level .
And higher level ore is used to make metal used to make weapons and armor useful to higher level characters , who typically have more virtual gold to spend .
It sometimes works , but not always .
One reason is that ore is a joint product .
Some players may spend their time wandering around in search of ore to mine , but a lot of ore , I suspect a majority , is produced by players who are wandering around killing monsters and doing quests , happen to see a vein , and mine it .
As the population of a server accumulates more and more high level characters , more and more time is being spent wandering in high level areas with high level ore , producing an increase in the supply of adamantium , a decrease in the supply of copper .
What about demand ?
High level characters need high level gear made from high level metal , so one might expect demand to shift in the same way as supply .
What complicates that is the process of skilling up — becoming a better and better smith ( or jeweler or leatherworker ) , able to make better and better stuff .
Before you can make swords out of mithril you must first make them out of iron , before that copper ( I simplify , as any WoW enthusiast will realize ) .
If your high level character decides to take up smithing he must start at the bottom .
Even if he himself is a miner , he is not spending his time in the low level areas where copper is mined , so goes to the auction house instead — bidding up the price of copper .
Patterns of prices change over time , sometimes in comprehensible ways .
Not long ago a new option opened up in the game , a type of character that got to start not at level 1 but at level 55 .
Your brand new level 55 Death Knight fights like a level 55 — but if he takes up smithing it will be at skill level 1 .
The effect on the relative prices of low and high end ore and metal is left as an exercise for the reader .
For a second example of WoW economics , consider the opportunities for arbitrage , both across goods and across time , and the implications thereof ..
Any miner can , at the cost of a little time , convert a lump of iron ore into a bar of iron , or a bar of iron and a lump of coal into a bar of steel .
The result should be a predictable relation between the market prices of lumps of ore and bars of metal , or of iron , coal and steel .
You can look on the auction house and see if the pattern holds .
Similarly , any predictable pattern of price changes over time — some things being more expensive on the weekend , say , when more players are online — should open opportunities for enterprising players to buy low , sell high , and make a profit .
The result of players doing so should be to raise low prices , lower high prices , and eliminate the pattern .
Does it happen ?
There is no antitrust law in WoW , which makes it a good place to observe collusive behavior by sellers .
My wife , who spends more time in the auction house buying ad selling than I do , has observed both an attempt to corner a market and an attempt , at least partly successful , to form a cartel — a cartel she was invited to join .
Her refusal was met by a threat to drive her out of the market by underselling her .
The organizer of the cartel had apparently not read Aaron Director ’s analysis , reflected in McGee ’s classic article on the myth of predatory pricing ; it had not occurred to him that if he was selling , at an artificially low price , ten times as many gems as the interloper , he was also losing money ten times as fast .
It took only a few days for him to discover the flaw in the strategy and abandon it .
These are a few examples I have come across of economics in the World of Warcraft .
It should not be hard to come up with enough more to fill a quarter .
If anyone wants to try it I will be happy to offer more suggestions .
Nearly 80 percent of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon results from cattle ranching , according to a new report by Greenpeace .
The finding confirms what Amazon researchers have long known – that Brazil ’s rise to become the world ’s largest exporter of beef has come at the expense of Earth ’s biggest rainforest .
More than 38,600 square miles has been cleared for pasture since 1996 , bringing the total area occupied by cattle ranches in the Brazilian Amazon to 214,000 square miles , an area larger than France .
The legal Amazon , an region consisting of rainforests and a biologically - rich grassland known as cerrado , is now home to more than 80 million head of cattle .
For comparison , the entire U.S. herd was 96 million in 2008 .
The number of cattle bred in the Legal Amazon is growing fast : between 1990 and 2003 , the bovine herd more than doubled , from 26.6 million to 64 million head of cattle – 60 % of the herd are in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará .

Environmentalists have plenty of reasons to worry about this expansion , including destruction of wildlife habitat , seizure of lands occupied by indigenous people , and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from deforestation ( which accounts for 50 - 75 percent of Brazil ’s total emissions ) , but there ’s not a lot they can do – cattle ranchers and agribusiness ( including industrial soy farmers ) form a powerful lobby in Brazil .
One hope is that the Brazilian government ’s recently announced plan to reduce forest clearing 2,100 square miles per year by 2018 could help cut incentives for deforestation , including new infrastructure projects and low - interest loans .
Another is that the recent collapse in commodity prices – including beef and soy – will remove , or at least delay , the primary economic impetus for agricultural expansion in the Amazon .

So what does this all mean for beef consumers in the United States ?
Not a lot at the moment .
Brazilian beef is mostly exported to Europe .
Still Brazilian beef has characteristics that some markets may see as favorable – Amazon cattle are effectively “ free - range ” , “ grass - fed ” , and possibly “ organic ” , depending on the definition .
Further some producers – led by Aliança da Terra , an NGO run by an American rancher named John Carter – are working to reduce the ecological impact of beef production in the Amazon .
Others are looking at intensification to raise more cattle per unit of land and thereby diminish the need to clear forest land .
Of course intensification , with associated industrial feedlots and corn-and - antibiotic - fed cattle , is not without controversy .
In the end some would argue that eating less beef is part of the ultimate solution to this and many of the planet ’s environmental problems .
A 2006 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) found that meat production generates more greenhouse gas emissions ( 14 - 22 percent of global emissions ) than either transportation or industry .
Of meats , beef is the most carbon - intensive with the production of a 1 - pound paddy resulting in roughly 36 - pounds of CO2 emissions or 13 times the emissions from chicken .
With global demand for beef on the rise — especially in emerging economies like China , Russia , and Brazil — the ecological footprint of cattle on the planet is set to continue its expansion .
A scrap metal dealer from Zhejiang Province , China , has fulfilled a childhood dream and won a place in our hearts by building a bunch of Transformers - like pseudo - bots out of junked cars .
The intrepid geek says he built the army to advertise his business , but we suspect that 's just the excuse he gave his family when asked why he spent weeks building giant replicas of kids ' toys .
Mr. Zhu , who apparently did n't care enough about publicity to give China Car Times more than his surname , swiped car and bike parts from his business until he could crib together a mufflers - and - rims Optimus Prime .
We did notice a slight continuity error :
The E32 BMW he used was built well after the first - generation * Transformers * was filmed .
While Mr. Zhu might be referencing Transformers : Generation 2 , we think he just could n't find any older Bimmers he could chop up and weld into a fake robot .
At least Zhu can stow Ratbat in the in - dash cassette deck .
More pictures of the Autobots and Decepticons after the jump .
While a pile of older - than - Kup car parts might seem more Red Green than Red China , one must remember that scrap metal is serious money in a country where raw material feeds the factory beast .
Zhu sacrificed more than time to fulfill his dream — he sacrificed valuable recyclables .
In addition to the 7 - series , there 's a Muppet - faced motorcycle and a creepy , gangly Giacommetti-esque figure all made from salable scrap .
Even bigger than scrap metal is the Transformers franchise , the first foreign cartoon broadcast in China .
Although American kids loved Transformers and the action figures it spawned changed the way we play , the show was even bigger in China .
Every night at six , Chinese youngsters would rush home to watch the cartoon and pester their parents to buy the action figures from Hasbro .
More than $ 661 million worth of Transformer toys have been sold since 1987 , according to China.org.cn , though we suspect a majority of sales are to now - wealthy thirty - somethings who can finally afford to buy the toys they dreamed of as a kid .

One of the biggest criticisms of string theory is that its predictions can't be tested experimentally - - a requirement for any solid scientific idea .
That 's not true anymore .
At a AAAS session on Sunday , physicists said string theory is making important contributions to the study of two extreme forms of matter -- one heated to trillions of degrees , the other chilled to near - absolute zero .
In both cases the matter became a " perfect liquid " that ripples and flows freely , like water .
String theorists analyzed the results by applying what they had learned from pondering how a black hole might behave in five dimensions .
Then they went on to calculate just how free - flowing these liquids might be , predictions that the experimenters are using to guide the next stage of their work .
" It 's really a surprising , I would say serendipitous , once - in - a - generation convergence of scientific communities , " says Peter Steinberg , a nuclear physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory and one of the organizers of the panel .
" None of us saw this coming . "
( Full disclosure : Peter invited me to be a discussant for the session , which meant I got to take in all the talks and then ask the panel whatever I wanted .
Sweet ! )
Not to say that string theory has been proved .
Clifford Johnson of the University of Southern California , the string theorist on the panel , was very clear about that .
All the arguments about whether nature is composed of unimaginably tiny vibrating strings and multiple dimensions , and whether this will eventually explain the basic workings of the universe , are still unresolved .
" We 're still very far from getting string theory in good enough shape to really understand all those questions , " he said .
" But what is really encouraging is when that tool box you 've been working on to gear up to understand those questions , when you find a way of making that toolbox useful in some other experiments .
That tells you that your tool is a robust tool that may be on the right track .
So we have n't proven that reality is all about string theory or however you want to put it , but we certainly have indeed found a place , it seems , where string theory has been a useful guide and has made been making some modest but sharp and testable predictions in the lab . "
The tale begins in 2002 , when researchers in John Thomas 's JETLab group at Duke University announced that they had created a super - cooled gas of lithium 6 atoms that behaved like a fluid ; see their paper here ( subscription required . )
They did this , Thomas explained , by trapping about 300 million lithium 6 atoms in a tiny , cigar - shaped bowl of laser light .
At this point the atoms look like a little red ball , visible in a photo he flashed on the screen .
Then they hit the ball of atoms with a carbon - dioxide laser beam .
The atoms started banging into each other and quickly evaporated .
This cools them -- something we 're all familiar with from getting chilly as our sweat dries -- until they reach a temperature of about a billionth of a degree above absolute zero .
At this point the blob of atoms began acting strangely .
Laser flash photos showed that it expanded but only in one direction , and in a way characteristic of flowing liquid .
In technical terms , they had created the first strongly interacting Fermi gas .
The gas 's super - fluid behavior , Thomas said , is similar to what takes place in superconducting materials , which conduct electrical current with perfect efficiency .
Today 's superconductors operate only at relatively cold temperatures , and scientists have been working for decades to create one that operates at room temperature .
The behavior of the lithium gas is analogous to that of a superconductor that could operate at temperatures of thousands of degrees , making this work of great interest to condensed - matter physicists .
Flash forward three years to Brookhaven National Laboratory , where physicists had been studying head - on collisions of gold nuclei at RHIC , the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider .
As Steinberg put it , the collision of 400 of these nuclei produces 10,000 particles , primarily quarks and gluons , in a tiny drop of matter that may be the long - sought quark - gluon plasma .
The quark - gluon plasma is an idea that stems from the curious nature of the strong force , which binds quarks together to make protons and neutrons .
The strong force is carried by the gluon particle .
Unlike most of the forces we 're familiar with , it 's like a rubber band : it becomes stronger when you try to pull the quarks far apart .
If you squeeze quarks close enough together , the rubber band part of the force melts away and the quarks and gluons are able to freely interact with each other .
In contrast to Duke 's super - cold lithium blobs , the RHIC plasma was super - hot , as in trillions of degrees , said RHIC collaborator Barbara Jacak of Stony Brook University .
The last time the universe was that hot was one microsecond after the big bang , and so physicists are hoping their experiments at RHIC will shed light on the state of the universe at that long - ago instant .
Weirdly , the hot RHIC plasma also flowed like a liquid ; the lab 's 2005 announcement of the discovery described it as the most perfect liquid ever observed , with virtually no viscosity -- the quality that makes honey flow more slowly than milk .
The fact that the plasma behaved like a liquid surprised scientists , who had expected it to take the form of a gas .
While the particles in these fluids are independent , they are also strongly coupled , meaning that each one is tied very tightly to nearby things .
As Steinberg puts it , " The system moves in concert .
You do n't think of it as particles ; you think of it as a stuff . "
Johnson describes it as a form of emergent behavior that is akin to the wetness of water .
Individual particles in water do n't have any property that could be called wetness .
Wetness only arises when very many molecules are present .
But are these liquids really perfect ?
Enter the string theorists , who are quite at home in multiple dimensions and bring a whole new vantage point to the question .
" The goal is try to understand what are essentially new phases of matter that are showing up at these laboratories , " Johnson said .
" It 's exciting .
It 's novel .
It 's not often we create new phases of matter in the world , " phases that are thought to naturally exist only just after the big bang or in the cores of compact stars .
The string theory analysis starts not from the viewpoint of quarks and gluons , but from quantum black holes -- a theoretical form of black hole that is very tiny and , unlike its massive star - gobbling cousin , has never been observed in nature .
Suppose , Johnson said , you had a quantum black hole in a five - dimensional universe , in which there are four dimensions of space and one of time .
If you were to build a box around that black hole , the holographic principle states that you could understand all of its internal physics from a perch on this surrounding wall .
The holographic principle is so called because it's akin to creating a 3 - D image on a two - dimensional sheet .
String theory along with the holographic principle provides a view of quantum gravity that allows you to look inside the black hole and understand its internal physics .
It turns out that " this physics that lives on these walls really resembles the physics we 're seeing in the experiments .
That 's the exciting thing , " Johnson said .
String theory provides a kind of dictionary that translates between our four - dimensional world , where the experiments take place , and the five - dimensional world in which theorists envision the quantum black hole .
As for the black hole and the extra dimensions , Johnson said he 's agnostic as to whether they exist or not .
He thinks of them as a tool , one that allowed string theorists to calculate the ratio of viscosity to the fluid 's entropy , a measure of its disorder .
String theory predicts that this ratio is naturally very low for the two experimental " perfect liquids . "
The experimenters are now closing in on that value , which will reveal just how perfect the liquids are .
" Why does it work so well ?
What are the prospects for more success ?
These are things we are still trying to understand , " Johnson said .
" This is also a very powerful test of the tools that come from string theory .
We 've been working in isolation for a long time , not knowing whether these tools necessarily are anything to do with experimental physics . "
This collaboration between string theorists and experimentalists in two fields of physics came about by happenstance .
Perhaps , the panelists said , there are ways to foster other such discussions and collaborations , which do n't naturally occur in the world of science , where specialists tend to huddle only with others of their own kind .
Update : I 'd like to thank Clifford Johnson and William Zajc , my fellow discussant and co-organizer of the session , for thoughtful feedback and additional explanations that led to most of the tweaks above .
As Ben Franklin would say : Blog in haste , tweak at leisure !
Tweaks underlined .
Update : Clifford blogs about the session here in a 24 - style account that covers the whole day .

Newswise —
More than a million cancer survivors living in the United States are foregoing what they believe is necessary medical care due to the cost , and Hispanics and African - Americans are twice as likely to go without services , according to data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research conference on the Science of Health Care Disparities .
" These survivors are either going without , or significantly delaying , dental care , general medical care , mental health care or prescription drugs , " said Kathryn Weaver , Ph.D. , a cancer prevention fellow at the National Cancer Institute .
Although insurance status did play a role , foregoing care due to cost still persisted among the insured .
" There are significant out - of - pocket expenses , even for those with insurance , " said Weaver .
Weaver and colleagues used data from the Center for Disease Control 's National Health Interview Survey to identify 6,602 adult cancer survivors .
Of these survivors , 64.3 percent were female , 4.8 percent were Hispanic , 6.4 percent were non-Hispanic black and 88.8 percent were non-Hispanic white .
The survey is conducted annually and questions about 30,000 to 40,000 households .
Overall , the prevalence of foregoing medical care due to cost was 7.8 percent for general medical care , 9.9 percent for prescription medication , 11.3 percent for dental care and 2.7 percent for mental health care .
Compared to non-Hispanic whites , Hispanics were 2.14 - fold more likely to forego prescription medications due to cost concerns and African - Americans were 87 percent more likely to forego prescriptions .
For dental care , Hispanics were 2.31 - fold more likely to go without and African - Americans were 57 percent more likely .
These differences persisted after statistical adjustments for education , health insurance coverage and non-cancer medical comorbidities .
" Efforts to expand insurance coverage might go some way toward addressing these problems , but absent that , clinicians need to be more aware that their patients are not getting these services and work to try to connect them to charity or low - cost care , " said Weaver .
The mission of the American Association for Cancer Research is to prevent and cure cancer .
Founded in 1907 , AACR is the world 's oldest and largest professional organization dedicated to advancing cancer research .
The membership includes more than 28,000 basic , translational and clinical researchers ; health care professionals ; and cancer survivors and advocates in the United States and 80 other countries .

The future of motor vehicles lies in improved efficiency and that is to the left of the gasoline ICE in the chart .
That future is electric vehicles powered by high ERoEI renewable electricity .
This post is not intended to provide a rigorous analysis of automobile efficiency but aims to provide an overview of the efficiencies of different drive system - fuel combinations .
The procedure followed is to identify the main energy efficiency factors and to multiply these to provide the overall efficiency in % .
The efficiency of fuel source is based on ERoEI where :
ERoEI = energy procured / energy used to procure energy
Efficiency = ( ERoEI -1) / ERoEI
I have not considered the energy embedded in the vehicles and energy losses downstream from the motor in the drive systems .
The objective is to highlight the major differences between the 4 fuel / drive system combinations .
The all electric car powered by renewable wind electricity
ERoEI for wind ~ 20 , efficiency factor = 0.95
Grid transmission losses = 0.9
Battery efficiency = 0.97
Motor efficiency = 0.92
Combined efficiency = 76.3 %
Gasoline internal combustion engine ( ICE )
Procuring oil , ERoEI = 30 ( assumed ) , efficiency = 0.967
Refining and transport losses = 0.9
ICE efficiency = 0.4
Combined efficiency = 34.8 %
Hydrogen fuel cell
The calculation is based on producing hydrogen from electrolysis of water using wind power electricity and is based heavily on an analysis by Ulf Bossel ( reference at end ) .
Wind power , as for all electric car = 0.95
Losses due to electrolysis of water = 0.7
Compression of hydrogen = 0.9
Losses during distribution = 0.9
Losses during hydrogen transfer = 0.97
Fuel cell efficiency = 0.5
Motor efficiency = 0.92
Combined efficiency = 24 %
Bio-ethanol internal combustion engine
ERoEI for temperate latitude ethanol ~ 1.5 , efficiency = 0.33
Processing and delivery ( estimate ) = 0.95
ICE efficiency = 0.4
Combined efficiency = 12.5 %
Hybrids and plug - in hybrids
I 've not covered these but assume that their efficiency will lie between gasoline ICE and all electric .
The world , and in particular the UK , is currently in the eye of the storm of a full blown energy crisis .
I think virtually everyone is agreed that improving energy efficiency is essential to the short - term survival of our industrial economies .
It is therefore extremely pertinent to ask why EU and US governments have and are still supporting ethanol production for vehicular transportation ?
And in my own country ( Scotland ) why it is that our parliament continues to support hydrogen fuel cell research and to offer the false hope of a hydrogen economy ?
At the same time it is pertinent to ask what on earth has driven Saab and Volvo to produce ethanol powered vehicles that are arguably the least energy efficient cars built in recent decades .
What are their engineers thinking about , and why ?
The future of motor vehicles lies in improved efficiency and that is to the left of the gasoline ICE in the chart up top .
That future is electric vehicles powered by high ERoEI renewable electricity .
On a final more light hearted note , many UK readers will be familiar with the BBC motoring program Top Gear , hosted by Jeremy Clarkson the self styled opponent of all things politically correct who recently added to his notoriety by describing Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a one eyed Scottish Idiot .
A number of weeks ago Top Gear road tested the Tesla all electric car to destruction and a Honda hydrogen fuel cell vehicle - which the Top Gear team loved .
They explained that hydrogen was abundant , but stuck on to other stuff .
And all that had to be done was to scrape it off .
Guys , I 'm a great fan of your show , but please take some time to ponder the chart up top and to maybe bring some energy reality to the motoring debate .
Top Gear : Perhaps Clarkson would like to test drive this model ?
Shown is the all electric Fiat 500 .

The disconnect between Republican members of Congress and governors recalls the mid-1990s , when Republicans took control of both the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years .
After an initial public show of being partners in a “ Republican revolution , ” the partnership all but dissolved when governors strongly objected as the more dogmatic conservatives in Congress tried to cut domestic programs and then shut down the federal government in an unsuccessful showdown with President Bill Clinton .
Recently , Governors Schwarzenegger , Crist , Douglas and Rell joined 14 Democratic governors in signing a letter to Mr. Obama lauding his economic plan .
Other Republicans would have signed on , said a person familiar with the letter ’s drafting , but for party pressure in their states .
The National Governors Association sent a bipartisan letter of support to Congressional leaders of both parties , signed by its Democratic chairman , Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania , and Mr. Douglas , its Republican vice chairman .
“ The combination of funds for Medicaid , education and other essential services is critical for governors as they work to manage the downturn in their states and improve government for the long term , ” it said .
Mr. Crist even campaigned last week with Mr. Obama in Florida for the recovery package .
“ Whether it ’s teachers or people on road crews helping our infrastructure , those in the health care arena as it might relate to Medicaid , all of these areas are important , all of them can produce jobs , ” Mr. Crist said , adding , “ Regardless of what your party is , Republican or Democrat , it really does n’t matter .
We have a duty and an obligation to the people who elected us , no matter what our position happens to be , to work together to get through this thing . ”
Yet all 16 of Florida ’s Republicans in Congress voted against the package .
Representative Cliff Stearns condemned it during the final debate as an “ unprecedented big - government grab for citizen reliance on the federal government . ”
Joe Scarborough , a former Republican congressman from Florida , called the bill “ a steaming pile of garbage ” on his cable television talk show .
The House Republican leader , John A. Boehner of Ohio , angrily dumped the 1,073 - page bill to the floor during debate .
In the Senate , John McCain of Arizona called it “ nothing less than generational theft . ”
And Republicans in both chambers derided what they described , often misleadingly , as pork spending for the likes of marsh mouse preservation .
Many projects , however , reflected the job - creation wish lists that governors had sent in .
Utah ’s Republican governor , Jon Huntsman Jr. sought up to $ 14.4 billion for roads , rail and sewer projects and for construction of a prison , courthouses and veterans ’ nursing homes .
Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama , another Republican , came to Washington to discuss transportation projects with his state ’s Congressional delegation .
“ He ’s going to make sure Alabama does n’t miss out on the money we ’re entitled to , ” a spokesman said .
Rick Falkvinge is the face and voice of the Swedish Pirate Party , the party that he founded in 2006 , but being a pirate is n't all gold doubloons and chests of booty .
Falkvinge is a principled pirate — and that means working for the sake of the cause even when the pay is low , or nonexistent .
He currently takes no salary for his work , but he gets along by finding supporters willing to donate toward the costs of his food and rent .
Limited resources do n't mean he 's thinking small , though .
Indeed , he wants to ( democratically ) take over the world , and he has a plan .
A pirate 's life for me
What catapults someone into such a lifestyle ?
For Falkvinge , it was Sweden 's 2005 debate over changes to copyright law .
In his view , the issue received tremendous media coverage and generated obvious interest among the public , but politicians basically failed to notice the entire debate .
He wondered how to get their attention , and he concluded it probably could n't be done .
So Falkvinge decided that the only way to make change happen was to " bypass the politicians entirely and aim for their power base . "
Credit : Jacob Bostr ?m
That meant a new political party , the Pirate Party — " Piratpartiet " in Swedish .
Falkvinge registered the domain in December 2005 and threw up a website that " looked like shit . "
But looks were n't the point ; the site 's manifesto was something he hoped would find an audience .
( Read it in Swedish [ PDF ] or in an English translation ) .
It did .
When the site went live on January 1 , 2006 , Falkvinge hoped he might " get a couple thousand visits , " collect some volunteers , and refine the document .
The goal was ( eventually ) to round up enough signatures to get the Pirate Party registered with Sweden 's electoral authority so that it would be on the ballot for the upcoming September 2006 elections .
After that , who knew — maybe the fledgling movement could even pick up a seat ?
Falkvinge posted his new site into a chat channel — it was " all the advertising I ever did . "
The site quickly racked up three million hits and pulled in links from sites like Slashdot and Digg .
The challenge turned out not to be attracting interest , but channeling massive interest into a movement .
A theory of movement
Falkvinge had given some thought to " movements " already .
He had a theory that every major social shift followed a three - stage pattern .
First , wild activists provoke the public to generate attention around an issue .
Next , academics get involved in researching the issue .
Finally , the issue is successfully politicized .
It 's a pattern that Falkvinge sees in both the labor and environmental movements , both of which have spawned vibrant European political parties such as the Social Democrats and the Greens .
When it came to issues of copyright , " piracy , " and the production of art and entertainment , provocateurs like Shawn Fanning of Napster fame had blazed a trail for a decade already .
Academics had been pumping out a recent body of literature on copyright in the digital age .
But there were no political parties that even appeared to take the issue seriously .
So Falkvinge set out to organize the inchoate interest generated by his Pirate Party website .
His first test was Sweden 's electoral authority , which would not accept electronic signatures on petitions .
That meant the hip new party 's first task was an old and unbelievably mundane one : collecting paper signatures from Swedish residents .
When the volunteers came through with the required signatures , Falkvinge saw that he had a loose , unstructured organization — but one capable of getting things done .
To boost the party 's profile beyond the hardcore pirate demographic , the mainstream media 's reach was needed .
But the media did n't appear interested in a fledgling Pirate Party .
That is , until the ( unrelated ) Pirate Bay file - sharing site was raided by Swedish authorities in the middle of 2006 .
In a moment , the issue of copyrights and file - sharing was front - and - center in the popular consciousness .
" We had been trying to get into mainstream media from January to May , " said Falkvinge , but after the raid , suddenly " my face was on every news broadcast on every hour on every channel . "
The Pirate Party tripled its member count in a week .
The election : a splash of cold water
If the sudden success of the party made it seem as though God himself wore an eyepatch and flew the Jolly Roger , the 2006 Swedish elections sounded a wake - up call : this " politics " thing was going to be tough .
Under the Swedish system , parliamentary seats are handed out on a percentage basis — win ten percent of the vote and get ten percent of the seats .
But , in order to keep Parliament from dissolving into a hundred tiny parties , each party has to clear a four percent national threshold ( or gain 12 percent of the votes in any particular district ) before it gets any seats at all .
Get 3.9 percent of the vote and you go home with nothing .
In the 2006 fall elections , when Swedes went to the polls , Falkvinge had " high expectations " that his new party might pick up a seat or more .
But when the votes were tallied , Piratpartiet had a mere 0.63 percent of the national total with 34,918 votes ( results in Swedish ) .
In other words , no seats .
On the other hand , the party had been around for less than a year and managed to garner more votes than did several established politicians .
The Pirate Party was dismissed as " this election 's joker party , " says Falkvinge now , but he never accepted that characterization .
Instead , he took comfort from the fact that the Pirate Party had become the third largest party ... outside of parliament .
It was n't much , but it was something .
Gaining seats
After the electoral defeat , Falkvinge and his fellow pirates sat down to talk strategy .
They developed a three - part plan that would govern their actions for the next four years , fully expecting that they could board and loot both the European Parliament and the Swedish one in that amount of time .
The strategy began with the creation of a youth section called Young Pirate ( Ung Pirat ) .
Such youth political groups , common in Europe , are set up to develop young political talent and provide a counterbalance to the grey - haired elders who run most parties .
Because the Pirate Party 's membership already skewed young ( high school and college students are the largest demographics ) , it was n't long before Young Pirate was the third largest political youth group in Sweden .
What makes the Young Pirate story so odd is that the group is actually funded with taxpayer money .
In Sweden , the government doles out kronor to youth groups based on the size of their membership .
By January 2009 , Young Pirate was raking in 1.3 million kronor a year ( about $ 150,000 ) from the Swedish government , according to Swedish newspaper The Local .
The music industry was less than pleased .
" It is surprising .
Ung Pirat works in principle to encourage something illegal , " said Lars Gustafsson , head of IFPI Sweden .
" That they then receive money from a state institution is remarkable . "
With the youth section developing quickly , the Pirate Party has been focused on the second bit of its plan for world domination : a seat in the European Parliament .
The election for Swedish MEPs opens May 20 , and voters can cast a ballot through June 7 .
MEP elections are notorious for significantly lower turnout than big national elections , and Falkvinge is counting on low turnout to propel his forces into a seat .
The Pirate Party needs an estimated 100,000 votes to cross the four percent threshold in the election .
In 2006 , it only picked up 35,000 , so Falkvinge admits this is a challenge .
Still , the party has seen significant growth in the last two and half years , and the success of its young wing was responsible for a 4.5 percent showing in recent mock elections in Swedish schools .
Even if the pirates are closed out once more , time appears to be on Falkvinge 's side — unless his Young Pirates mellow as they age .
Stimulus bill expected to restart mine cleanup
When the Beal Mountain mine opened in 1988 near Butte , Mont. , its owner promoted open - pit cyanide leaching for extracting gold from ore as modern and environmentally friendly .
Pegasus Gold Corp. , a Canadian company , extracted almost 460,000 ounces of gold over a decade before closing the mine and declaring bankruptcy in 1998 .
It left behind a 70 - acre , cyanide - contaminated leach pond with a leaky liner and tons of rubble that sends selenium - laced runoff into streams , threatening cutthroat trout and other fish .
The $ 6.2 million reclamation bond posted by the company does n't come close to covering the full cost to clean up the mine , which could total almost $ 40 million .
Efforts to clean up one of the West 's most enduring and dangerous legacies - tens of thousands of abandoned hard - rock mines , many dating to the 19th century - should get a boost from the economic stimulus bill awaiting President Obama 's signature .
The final bill , approved by the House and Senate on Friday , contains more than $ 1.5 billion for construction and maintenance projects in the Bureau of Land Management , the National Park Service and the Forest Service .
That includes addressing pollution and safety hazards caused by abandoned mines on public lands .
The three agencies together spent about $ 25 million on mine cleanup in the budget year that ended Sept. 30 , according to the staff of Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , one of the lawmakers who sought the money .
Projects ranging from repairing trails to replacing equipment also are eligible for the money , so there is no guarantee the money will be spent on mine cleanup .
The bill says preference is supposed to go to projects that generate most jobs .
Advocates for cleaning up abandoned mines say the work is a big job - generator .
" These much - needed funds will create thousands of jobs , reduce water pollution , eliminate public safety threats , and restore fish and wildlife habitat in rural communities across the country , " said Lauren Pagel , policy director for Earthworks , an environmental group focused on mining issues .
The Government Accountability Office estimates there are at least 161,000 abandoned hard - rock mines in Alaska and 11 other Western states , plus South Dakota .
Open mine shafts and decaying structures pose safety hazards , contaminants are polluting streams and groundwater , and piles of tailings tinged with arsenic have been left behind .
The Environmental Protection Agency estimates it could cost as much as $ 50 billion to clean up all the nation 's abandoned hard - rock mines .
Anti-tax groups questioned whether mine cleanup merits funds at all , considering that the bill is intended to jump - start the economy .
Cleanups are temporary and unlikely to have any lasting economic effect , said Pete Sepp , a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union , which advocates for less government spending .
A report last year by the Interior Department 's inspector general said abandoned mines on Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service land are exposing people to dangerous contaminants such as arsenic , lead and mercury .
At the Mojave National Preserve in California , investigators found mine shafts along roads that were large enough to swallow cars .

Successful financial traders may be born , not made .
That ’s the implication of a new study which found that traders who excel at short - term or “ high - frequency ” trading may have been exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the uterus .
These traders can hold their stock for minutes , or mere seconds , before selling – requiring high levels of confidence and fast reaction times .
Last year , John Coates at the University of Cambridge , UK , and his colleagues found that traders who started their days with elevated testosterone made more money than those who did n’t .
But successful traders are n’t all macho and aggressive risk - takers – characteristics typically associated with high testosterone .
“ The good ones are very calm , they do n’t lose their temper , and probably the most extreme sport they do is fly fishing , ” says Coates .
“ They ’re not cavemen . ”

Because individual responses to testosterone can be affected by how much of the hormone you were exposed to in the uterus , Coates wondered if this could also be exerting an effect .
So he recruited 49 male traders from the City of London and looked at their index - to - ring - finger ratio – a marker of prenatal testosterone exposure .
Profitable digits
He found that traders with a longer ring fingers , and therefore higher prenatal testosterone , made on average six times the profits of traders exposed to low levels of the hormone , and tended to remain traders for longer .
Previous studies have also suggested a link between a low index - to - ring - finger ratio and autism , and better sporting ability .
“ This study provides evidence for human beings of what we know from studies of animals , that exposure to sex hormones early in life predisposes the nervous systems and resulting behavior to develop in certain ways , ” says Bruce mcEwen of the Rockefeller University in New York .
“ In this case the development of the risk taking , visual - motor skills , etc that make for success in this kind of rapid stock trading . ”
“ However , it takes environment , or the experiences and opportunities that a person has , to further shape the brain to this particular career path , ” he adds .
And while finger length may provide some indication of your suitability to financial trading , Coates cautions bosses against using it to make hiring decisions .
Goodbye CV ?
Other factors undoubtedly play a role , and the effects of high prenatal testosterone may be a disadvantage in other types of trading .
For example , other studies have suggested that people with a high index - to - ring - finger ratio make better mathematicians , so they may excel in more analytical city jobs .
“ My hunch is that this correlation could reverse in types of trading where people position for long - term [ as opposed to short - term ] gains , ” says Coates .
However , John Manning , an evolutionary psychologist and author of The Finger Book ( read our review ) says it would be interesting to see if finger ratios correlate with other professions .
For example , you might expect a low index - to - ring - finger ratio to correlate with military ability , while a higher ratio might correlate with performance in personnel management , or in professions such as nursing , occupational therapy and the teaching of very young children , he says .

The Pentagon ’s top military officers are recommending to Obama that he shift U.S. strategy in Afghanistan .
Secret report urges new Afghan plan
The Pentagon ’s top military officers are recommending to President Barack Obama that he shift U.S. strategy in Afghanistan — to focus on ensuring regional stability and eliminating Taliban and Al Qaida safe havens in Pakistan , rather than on achieving lasting democracy and a thriving Afghan economy , officials said .
The recommendations to narrow U.S. goals are contained in a classified report by the Joint Chiefs of Staff that is likely to be shown soon to Obama as part of a review of Afghanistan strategy announced by the new administration .

Obama is expected to announce soon his decision on a request for additional forces from the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , Lt. Gen. David McKiernan .
Several officials said they believe the president will approve sending three additional combat brigades to Afghanistan , totaling roughly 10,000 to 12,000 troops .
But a decision by Obama about whether to approve a more far - reaching shift in U.S. objectives in Afghanistan will be made later as part of the strategy review , the officials said .
In addition to the Joint Chiefs , Obama will hear recommendations from Gen. David Petraeus , in charge of U.S. Central Command , and from Richard Holbrooke , Obama ’s civilian envoy to Afghanistan .
The review is not expected to be completed for several months .
As he weighs his options , Obama will have to balance his calls during the campaign for intensified effort in Afghanistan against recent warnings by some of his senior advisers , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , of the dangers of getting deeply engaged in a place that has a long and bloody history of resisting foreign occupations .
Obama has indicated in recent weeks that he favors the idea of setting limited objectives , including ensuring that Afghanistan " cannot be used as a base to launch attacks against the United States . "
He cited the need for " more effective military action " while warning of Afghan hostility to foreign troops .
His " No. 1 goal " is to stop Al Qaida , he said .
The Chiefs ' recommendations have been approved by Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs , and seen by Gates , one official said .
In calling for narrowing U.S. goals , the report reflects concern on the part of some Army and Marine commanders about sending thousands of additional American troops to fight in what could be a lengthy conflict in Afghanistan .
Though Obama is likely to approve the three additional three brigades , the Chiefs considered and rejected the option of a recommending an even larger “ surge ” for Afghanistan , the officials said .
More troops could still be approved as part of the strategy review , another official emphasized .
In their report , the Chiefs concluded that the existing American goals in Afghanistan , established by the Bush administration , are overly broad and ambitious .
The report does not call for abandoning U.S. hopes of turning Afghanistan into a moderate Western - style democracy , or for halting counternarcotics efforts , but it does suggest making those steps part of a long - term vision , rather than a goal .
With insurgent violence in Afghanistan worsening significantly during the last year , the Chiefs ' report argues for setting more concrete objectives that are achievable and realistic in the short - term , the officials said .
Obama already has demonstrated his willingness to employ U.S. strikes using unmanned aircraft in Pakistan ’s largely lawless western border region , a tactic originated by the Bush administration .
But the Chiefs are recommending a broader effort to train and equip Pakistani security forces to conduct counter - insurgency operations in the tribal areas , and to apply pressure on Pakistan ’s military and intelligence services to sever their ties with militants , one of the officials said .
Amid growing concern about the stability of Pakistan , the Chiefs ' report also calls for putting renewed focus by the U.S. government on ensuring that Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons remain under its government ’s control , the officials said .
Though that has long been a U.S. aim , the officials said that including it in the report was a way to focus new attention on the problem in case militant groups threaten Pakistan ’s stability .
Capt .
John Kirby , a spokesman for Mullen , declined to comment on the contents of the report .
In a speech on Monday to the Reserve Officers Association , Mullen stressed the need to halt the Al Qaida and Taliban use of the Pakistan ’s border regions as safe haven from which to mount attacks in Afghanistan .
“ We cannot accept that Al Qaeda leadership , which continues to plan against us every single day ” has a “ safe haven in Pakistan ” and “ could resume one in Afghanistan , ” he said .
Mullen did not mention the Chief ’s Afghanistan report in his remarks .
Gates has also called publicly in recent weeks for setting modest , near - term goals for Afghanistan .
“ This is going to be a long slog , and frankly , my view is that we need to be very careful about the nature of the goals we set for ourselves in Afghanistan , " he told the Senate Armed Services Committee .
" If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of central Asian Valhalla over there , we will lose , because nobody in the world has that kind of time , patience and money , ” he added .
As a presidential candidate , Obama described Afghanistan as a central front in combating terror , drawing a distinction with the Bush administration , which argued that it was in Iraq .
Two of the three combat brigades that the Pentagon is recommending he send to Afghanistan are now designated for Iraq and would be redirected , if Obama backs McKiernan ’s recommendation .
On Monday , in a quarterly report required by Congress on security conditions in Afghanistan , the Pentagon reported that “ the spring and summer of 2008 saw the highest levels of violence ” since the U.S. invasion in 2001 .
“ The Taliban regrouped after its fall from power and has coalesced into a resilient and evolving insurgency , ” concluded the report .
Between January and Dec. 10 , 2008 , 132 U.S. personnel in Afghanistan died as the result of hostile action , up from 82 in 2007 .

Dear Barack ,
I can call you Barack , ca n't I ?
I mean , I do n't feel that I know you well enough to call you " Barry , " but Mr. Obama seems so formal .
It might be fun to say Mr. President , though .
Dear Mr. President ,
I voted for you .
I argued about you -- mostly , it 's true , with other people who also voted for you .
This is , after all , Portland , Ore .
You know , " Little Beirut " ?
I do n't know if you 've heard that one .
Portlanders wear that Bush I epithet with pride .
You can look it up with your BlackBerry , which I heard you got permission to keep .
Good job !
I bought a T - shirt with your face on it , and I actually wore it .
I donated small amounts to your campaign , multiple times .
I should let you know here that I do n't make a lot of money .
I 'm friends with you on Facebook .
( I 'm also friends with Michelle , who seems like an amazing woman .
Being her husband speaks very highly of you .
I 'm also a fan of Aretha Franklin 's Inauguration hat , but that might not be so relevant . )
So , here 's the thing :
I would totally understand if you 've been too busy with your new job to update Facebook recently .
Anyone would .
You 're a busy man .
But your Facebook page has been updated .
Blank !
The employer field is blank !
That does n't make any sense .
I have a few suggestions , so you can pick whichever one sounds best to you :
• The people of the United States of America
• The United States of America
• The Constitution
I 'm sure this is just an oversight .
I 'm sure this is n't the kind of arrogance we 'd expect from your predecessor .
You 're probably not even the one who actually fills out your Facebook info .
It would mean a lot to have that field filled in , though .
Maybe even just " you , " though that might be a little too clever .
Hit me up on Facebook and let me know .

Today , Hershey closed down its Reading , PA plant after 23 years of production , and moved 300 jobs to Mexico .
Teamsters President Jim Hoffa asked a good question , when are we going to tell these companies that enough is enough ?
Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said , “ That plant stood for decades in Reading , providing countless families with good wages and job security .
Members of this community helped build that company and this is how they are repaid .
Hershey ’s actions are unconscionable in this economic climate .
Pennsylvania lost nearly 60,000 jobs in the last quarter of 2008 and the estimate for the month was well over 30,000 jobs lost .
When are we going to tell companies like Hershey that enough is enough ? ”
It is interesting that this occurs on the same week where Obama visited Canada , and changed his tune on NAFTA .
On the campaign trail Obama suggested withdrawing from NAFTA , but this week he said that he wants to do things that will grow trade between the U.S. and Canada , “ I provided Prime Minister Harper an assurance that I want to grow trade , not contract it . ”
Obama said that he wants to change NAFTA without hurting trade .
Advertisements
Hoffa asked a really good question .
When is it enough ?
There is n’t much of a manufacturing sector in the United States , but I do give Obama credit for not selling the false bill of goods that other candidates have sold in the past , that he will bring the manufacturing sector back , but he ca n’t tell labor that he is against NAFTA while going to Canada and softening his tone .
I do n’t think that there is an easy answer here .
I would expect more jobs to be leaving as state and local governments can no longer afford to give the generous tax cuts that have been used to lure these kinds of jobs in the past .
What Hershey did in Reading was morally wrong , but corporations are not moral creatures .
They are judged strictly based on profits , and moving jobs to Mexico increases profits .
Obama wants to replace these jobs through his green economic plan .
If this works , expect labor to be very happy with him , but should the green jobs be slow to materialize , Obama and organized labor could be on a collision course that only the passage of the Employee Free Choice
Act would prevent .
West Allis -
As Brad Krause planted a tree in his yard last summer , a neighbor noticed that in addition to a shovel , Krause had a tool not usually required for yard work - a gun in a holster .
Police arrived and gave Krause a ticket alleging disorderly conduct , launching a case that a national gun-rights group has been watching for months .
On Tuesday , Krause won acquittal in what some advocates say is one of the first so - called open - carry gun cases heard in a Wisconsin court .
Municipal Judge Paul Murphy said he had reviewed several state statutes and court cases related to the right to keep and bear arms .
' There being no law whatsoever dealing with the issue of an unconcealed weapon or the so - called open carry is why we 're here today , ' Murphy said .
In the end , he determined Krause 's actions did not rise to disorderly conduct and found him not guilty .
City Attorney Scott Post declined to comment Tuesday .
Police responded to Krause 's home in August after the neighbor called .
They arrested Krause , gave him a disorderly conduct ticket and seized his gun .
Krause hired an attorney , Steven Cain , and fought the charge during a court trial in December .
After Murphy 's ruling Tuesday , Krause said the significance of the case extends beyond gun rights .
' The reason people are upset about this is it 's not about guns .
It 's about civil liberties .
And we obviously have a property issue .
There was no warrant issued , no exigent circumstances , no permission to enter the property , yet the police stormed in with guns drawn and put my life at risk , ' Krause said .
Asked why he was carrying a gun to plant a tree , Krause said , ' There 's no requirement to justify why you 're able to exercise constitutional rights .
I and everyone else are able to go to church , they 're able to vote , they 're able to speak their mind .
Even though the city might not like it , we have that right . '
His attorney said the overarching issue in the case was whether it is legal to openly carry a gun .
' The law in Wisconsin really only limits concealed carry , ' Cain said .
Cain argued that the U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that found Washington , D.C. 's gun ban unconstitutional concluded that open carry is 'an individual right that should n't be abridged by law enforcement .
That 's what the case is generally all about . '
West Allis Deputy Chief Rick Balistrieri said Tuesday 's verdict will not change the way his officers respond to similar calls , noting they must assess all calls on a case - by - case basis , particularly when a gun is involved .
Krause 's case had been one of several around the country followed closely and promoted by Virginia - based OpenCarry.org .
' Really , the larger issue is not even a gun rights issue , ' said organization co-founder John Pierce .
' It 's the issue of having a disorderly conduct statute that is a catch - all statute for otherwise legal behavior . '
Last August , the U.S. Army held a three - day conference in Portsmouth , Virginia , to look at new developments in military science and hardware .
The confab was called the " 2008 Mad Scientist Future Technology Seminar . "
Really .
It was .
" The objective of the seminar was to investigate proliferating technologies with the potential to empower individuals and groups in the next 10 - 25 years , " according to an unclassified summary of the Mad Scientist gathering , obtained by Danger Room .
As you 'd expect from such a colorfully - titled gathering , the collected brains predicted a world in which individuals would have easy access to everything from ray guns to nano - bots to bioengineered weapons to arms for creating international chaos online .
" The U.S. must accept the reality that it can no longer assume technological superiority over the rest of the world .
Ready access to scientific information and technological know - how has and will continue to level the playing field , " the Mad Scientist summary notes .
" In the operational environment of 2030 and beyond , the destructive / disruptive capability of the individual and small group will be more effective , more lethal , more easily developed / acquired , more efficiently delivered , and more easily concealed and transported ...
Individuals with access to the global information grid can easily acquire the knowledge needed to develop lethal bio agents , literally in their kitchen sink .
Nanotechnology and robotics will offer opportunities to introduce and spread bio and chemical agents into targeted populations . "
Turning to forward - looking thinkers is a time - honored government tradition .
Shortly after 9/11 , for instance , the Army met with Hollywood screenwriters and directors to forecast terrorist scenarios .
Last year , the Department of Homeland Security held a gathering of science - fiction writers to solicit advice on which technology programs to fund .
In comparison , the Mad
Scientist gathering of Ivy League researchers , defense contractors , think tankers , and NASA scientists seems rather conventional .
The Mad Scientist group sees more than just a world of danger in the 2030s .
" Most likely results include an increased life span , a solution to the energy crisis , ready availability of food and fresh water to all , a global distribution of technology , education , economics , and – therefore – wealth .
This will reduce the tension between the ' haves ' and
' have - nots ' while the capabilities of robotics and access to virtual reality to both care for and entertain will create the perception of well - being almost universally around the globe .
Advancements are limited only by imagination and resources . "
Who knows what they 'll dream up after that ?

TO UNVEIL preparations for global democracy 's greatest logistical feat , an Indian election , representatives of 47 political parties were summoned to Delhi on February 3rd .
Sarong - wrapped Tamils , grey - trousered Communists and north Indians in dhotis , rough - spun shawls and kurta - pyjamas , costumes increasingly rare outside parliament these days , were among them .
Absent , alas , were the emissaries of a dazzling new actor - politician , Chiranjeevi —an immortal of “ Tollywood ” , the Telugu - language film industry of Andhra Pradesh — as election officials ran through arrangements for a poll that is expected to begin in April , extend over several weeks , and for which nearly 700 m voters have been registered .
Adding to the drama was an ugly row between two of the officials themselves .
N. Gopalaswami , head of India 's Election Commission , has been trying to sack his deputy , Navin Chawla , whom he accuses of bias in favour of the Congress party , which leads India 's ruling coalition .
With Mr Chawla expected to take over from Mr Gopalaswami when he retires in April , Congress 's main opponent , the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , is predictably enraged .
But Congress insists that Mr Chawla , an acolyte of its former leader , Indira Gandhi , stay put .
Some fear the spat augurs an ill - tempered — even unjust — election .
India 's two main parties were already nervy .
As at the pre-poll meeting , they find themselves in an increasingly crowded arena .
Neither has a hope of winning an outright majority in the election .
After decades in decline , Congress cobbled together a government in 2004 after winning 145 of a possible 543 seats — the lowest winning tally in any Indian election .
Yet neither of the parties can be confident of beating this score .
So , as important as the election 's outcome will be their subsequent race to recruit allies among the proliferating regional , caste - based and leftist parties .
If neither of the big parties musters a majority that way , India 's next ruling coalition may even emerge from this horde .
Compared with the Hindu nationalists , Congress in fact seems quite perky .
The reason why is not obvious .
At the end of a five - year term , dominated by a booming economy , including a run of annual economic growth of 9 % , the government has hit trouble .
The economy is slowing ; the IMF has forecast GDP growth of 5.6 % in the financial year ending in April .
Thousands of jobs have already been lost .
The terrorist atrocity in Mumbai last November has also spread gloom .
And the party 's septuagenarian prime minister and acting finance minister , Manmohan Singh , is incapacitated : off work for a month after undergoing heart bypass surgery on January 24th .
In fact his absence has not caused much obvious disruption : a sign of how constrained he has been , at the helm of a massive and feuding coalition .
A result close to its 2004 performance would be creditable for Congress .
It is likely to retreat in Andhra Pradesh , the state where it won most seats in 2004 , and where the emergence of a new party under Mr Chiranjeevi , a star of 148 Telugu and Hindi films , will further divide the vote .
Congress will hope to make good in , for example , Kerala , Rajasthan and Punjab .
It needs to , since the prospects of some of its allies elsewhere are even worse .
In Bihar and Tamil Nadu , Congress 's two biggest regional allies look set for a beating .
The Communists , whose “ outside ” support propped up the government until they stalked away last year , are also expected to fare worse than in 2004 .
Partly to leave the door open for fresh “ post - poll ” alliances , after the votes are counted , Congress announced on January 29th that it would fight the election solo ; though , as in 2004 , it will form alliances state by state .
Mr Singh 's health is a worry for Congress .
A conciliatory figure , he has been much criticised for his gentle leadership .
Yet he has been more evident in recent months , securing the passage of a vaunted nuclear co-operation deal with America , and saying shrewd things about the world economy .
Congress 's leader , Sonia Gandhi , who passed up the job of prime minister five years ago to forestall controversy over her foreign ( Italian ) birth , would like the loyal Mr Singh to remain prime minister until her gauche 38 - year - old son , Rahul , is considered up to the job .
If Mr Singh could not dust himself off for another year or two at the helm , it is not clear to whom Mrs Gandhi might turn .
The BJP also has leadership worries , but they go deeper .
Shattered to lose power in 2004 , the party has since been riven by feuding between its two main constituents , Hindu ideologues and secular free - marketeers .
A string of state - election victories , and the nomination last year of L.K. Advani , a doughty octogenarian , as its prime - ministerial candidate had seemed to reverse the party 's decline .
But after some disappointing state - election results in December , and recent incidents of terrorism and vigilantism by Hindu fundamentalist thugs , the party 's ideological chasm has reopened .
And Mr Advani , despite launching a slick new blog , is suddenly seeming his age .
The BJP rank - and - file , as well as many Indian industrialists , would prefer to follow Narendra Modi , a charismatic , fire - eating Hindu - chauvinist and chief minister of Gujarat , who has a reputation for efficient economic management , but was implicated in a pogrom against Muslims in 2002 .
If not in this election , Mr Modi 's time may come .
On current form , the BJP 's electoral prospects look no better than Congress 's , which probably explains why its rival seems oddly chipper .
The logic of anti-incumbency , a rule of thumb in predicting Indian elections , suggests the Hindu nationalists will decline in several northern bastions , including Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh .
They must also fear a wipe - out in Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) , a giant northern state with 80 parliamentary constituencies , which played a big part in propelling them to power in the 1990s .
The BJP fared miserably in UP 's 2007 state election , which was swept by the Bahujan Samaj Party , an outfit dedicated to dalits , Hinduism 's former “ untouchables ” , and led by a mercurial and scandal - prone woman , Mayawati .
To the joy of some 250 m dalits , and the consternation of almost everybody else , Miss Mayawati hopes to claim the prime ministership for herself .
She is one of two poles around which a non-Congress , non-BJP government might emerge .
The other is a coalition of irritated former allies of both Congress and the BJP , including Communists and regionalists , and known as the “ third front ” .
A currently fashionable theory is that , if both big parties do as modestly as many expect , Congress could choose to lend its parliamentary votes to such a government , rather than lead a weak administration in troubled times .
What good this unstable arrangement might do India is rather hard to grasp .
European economies agree on need for regulation clampdown Agence France - Presse

BERLIN 
The heads of Europe 's largest economies agreed Sunday on the need for greater regulation of financial markets and to double IMF funding to avoid a repeat of the global economic crisis .
The leaders of Britain , France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the Netherlands met in Berlin to hammer out a joint European stance for the Group of 20 meeting of developed and developing countries in London on April 2 .
They agreed that " all financial markets , products and participants -- including hedge funds and other private pools of capital which may pose a systemic risk -- must be subjected to appropriate oversight or regulation , " a summary of the meeting said .
The leaders proposed adding an extra 250 billion dollars ( 195 billion euros ) , double the current level of funding , to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) budget so it can work more effectively to prevent future financial crises .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said a reinforced IMF would be able to help central and eastern European countries swept up in a growing economic crisis as western banks withdraw credit .
" We are proposing today ... a 500 - billion - dollar IMF fund that enables the IMF not only to deal with crises when they happen but to prevent crises , " Brown told a press conference .
" There is a need for a global New Deal so that the world economy can recover , " he said , referring to the plan to end the 1930s Great Depression .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said participants in the April summit to be attended by US President Barack Obama , " will bear a historical responsibility " and warned that concrete decisions had to be reached by then .
" By April 2 , we have to succeed and we cannot accept that anything or anyone gets in the way of that summit ... if we fail there will be no safety net , " Sarkozy said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Europeans were determined that a better - regulated financial system would emerge from the wreckage of the deepest financial crisis since World War II .
" It 's not a case of talking up the situation but we want to send the message that we have a real opportunity to come out strengthened from this crisis , " she stressed .
Merkel acknowledged that details of how hedge funds and complex financial products would be regulated still needed to be worked out .
But a joint stance on the funds -- highly speculative and lightly regulated entities accused of fuelling instability in financial markets -- represents a shift in the long - held position of countries like Britain .
London had resisted greater regulation of hedge funds , which supporters say benefit the economy in part by bearing risks others are unwilling to take , although Brown called recently for stronger rules .
The results of Sunday 's meeting will be discussed by all 27 European Union members at summits in March .
But agreement might be hard to find , according to Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek , whose country holds the rotating European Union presidency .
He said Sunday 's talks had exposed deep rifts .
" If I put it very tenderly , the divergence in opinions was rather big , " Topolanek told reporters on the plane home .
" It was obvious that the four countries representing the EU in the G20 ( France , Germany , Britain , Italy ) do not have the same opinion on a number of issues , " he added .
The world 's major economic powers are under pressure to build on pledges made at a G20 summit in Washington in November , where they formulated an action plan to fight the crisis .
But the global recession has worsened since then , prompting governments to push through massive economic stimulus packages and overshadowing efforts to reform the global financial system .
The national stimulus plans have sparked fears of protectionism .
The end - of - meeting statement however gave a watered - down response to such concerns , saying only that Europe would take " measures that keep distortions to competition to an absolute minimum .
" We expect the other G20 states to behave likewise , " it added .
Welcoming what he called progress on regulatory reform and on efforts to prevent a worsening of the global crisis , Bank of America senior economist Holger Schmieding said : " On balance , however , the statement seems to focus a bit more on tightening long - term regulations than on the even more urgent task of tackling the immediate crisis . "
The commitment rebuking protectionism also remained vague , Schmieding said .

Second editions galore
Adrian announced today that he ’s working on revising The Definitive Guide to Django to produce a second edition that covers Django 1.0 , which is awesome news for anyone who ’s used the book as a guide to learning Django .
In the same vein , I ’d like to announce something that ’s been unofficially mentioned a couple times but never fully clarified : I ’m busy working on the second edition of Practical Django Projects , which will also cover Django 1.0 ( and maybe a feature or two from Django 1.1 , depending on how the writing schedule works out ) .
With the first edition , I learned a lot about how to write a book , and also a lot about how not to write a book .
Aiming for the moving target of Django just prior to 1.0 was probably a bad idea , but unfortunately that ’s the way the schedule happened ( waiting any longer to publish would have delayed the book into sometime this year , from what I can tell ) .
And while in theory the book was supposed to be accompanied by a source - code download for the applications it covered , the need to bring that code into line with changes before 1.0 ( and then bring it up to 1.0 ) meant that a working download would have made no sense — either I ’d have to provide code people could n’t use with a current Django , or I ’d have had to rewrite large sections of the book to include alongside it , explaining why the code looked different .
Either way , it ’d suck .
Fortunately , we now have a stable , backwards - compatible Django codebase , so that should n’t be a problem the second time around ( and I ’ve got some neat plans for handling the book ’s accompanying code , which hopefully I ’ll get to unveil in a little while ) .
I do n’t yet know when the second edition will go to press , but I ’m pretty sure it ’ll be in the first half of this year .
So keep an eye out ; it ’ll also include at least one completely new chapter , so even folks who ’ve seen copies of the first edition should be able to get something new out of it .
What you 're discovering is one of the many ways in which virginity as a concept does n't make sense .
If you two pursue sexual pleasure together , however you choose to do it , you 're having sex .
sexiguitargrrl asks :
I
am bisexual and my girlfriend and I are planning on having sex for the
first time .
We both are virgins and want to lose it to each other but
do n’t know how and how will we know that we lost it ?

Let me be plain : the way I see it , if you two choose to pursue sexual pleasure together , whatever you choose to do in that pursuit , you ’re having sex ; you ’ll have had sex .
That ’s not
only the case for women partnered with women and men partnered with
men , but also for women partnered with men , or people having any kind
of sex together of any given gender or gender identity .
We cannot
easily define what sex is or is not for all people , because when we try
and do that , we usually wind up leaving out a whole lot of people and
their sexual experiences .
For example , you might not say that sex is
having your neck rubbed , if I feel sexual while I someone is doing that
to me , my partner feels sexual while doing it , and I reach orgasm that
way , to boot , how is that not sex ?
Conversely , while so many people
define vaginal intercourse as sex , if a given woman never enjoys that ,
if it does n’t feel sexual to her , and she never gets off with it , how
does it make sense to define that as sex for her ?
Ultimately , we have
to leave it up to everyone as individuals to define what sex is or
is n’t , because our experiences and sexualities are just too diverse to
try and fit us all into one box , and how I might define it for you is
inevitably going to be biased based on my own personal experiences ,
ideals or agenda .
Let ’s take a look at some of the conflicts the concept of virginity may pose to you and has posed for many .
We explain a lot at Scarleteen that virginity is not a medical term .
However , historically , many have made an attempt to try and make it a
medical term by considering the " loss " of virginity to be the
" breaking " of the hymen for women ( there has never really been any such
attempt to medicalize virginity for men ) .
That ’s something we ’ve known
to be flawed for some time now , for a bunch of reasons .
The hymen is a thin , elastic membrane tethered just within the
vaginal opening — which tends to cover it through childhood and some
of adolescence — which usually gradually erodes over time , a process
that most typically starts around puberty , and which can last anywhere
form several years to even decades .
That wearing away is typically due to a lot of different things : due
to vaginal secretions and menses , the increase of estrogen in the body ,
general physical activity , partnered genital / vaginal sex or
masturbation of several types , even childbirth , since for some women ,
the hymen will not have completely eroded by the time they give birth .
Generally , the hymen will start to develop what we call
" micro-openings , " which get larger and larger over time , until
eventually , for most women , only a trace of the hymen is left — and
usually remains through life — just inside the vaginal opening .
What
the hymen looks like as it wears away varies among women , and what rate
it wears away at also varies among women .
While some women may have a hymen earnestly break or tear — rather
than gradually wearing away — due to genital injury , rape or very
aggressive vaginal sex , for most , losing the hymen is not a one - shot
deal , something that happens all at once when any given woman has
intercourse or any one kind or incident of vaginal sex .
Some women even
become pregnant with their hymens still largely intact ( thanks to those
little micro-openings and the oft - mistaken idea that direct genital
contact with an intact hymen is safe ) , which is an occasional reality
that flies in the face of the historical notion that no previous
vaginal intercourse or a seemingly intact hymen means a woman ’s progeny
can easily be tracked to the man responsible for first intercourse with
her or " breaking " her hymen .
Even for heterosexual women who define first sex as intercourse , if
what virginity is defined as is the " loss " of the hymen , then plenty of
women who have had intercourse will leave it still being virgins .
Conversely , plenty of women who have never had partnered sex , but whose
hymens have worn away or been torn would not be considered
virgins .
There was so much ignorance about women ’s bodies for so much
of history that until relatively recently , people just did n’t know all
of this stuff , and in some places still , they still do n’t know
it , or choose to deny the reality of our anatomy in order to hold up a
cultural belief .
These are some of the reasons why defining virginity
that way is seriously problematic , and why it is not a term you are
likely to hear a sound sexual healthcare provider use .
Since virginity as a concept has historically nearly always been —
and usually is still — about heterosexuals and also about marriage ,
when we talk about virginity , we ’re going to find ourselves talking
about heterosexuality , heterosexism and heteronormativity a lot .
If
you ’re looking in history for inclusion of lesbian women , or bisexual
or heterosexual women who have had sex with other women , when it comes
to concepts of virginity , give on up .
There ’s nothing to find .
However , even for heterosexual women , defining when they have had
" real " sex as when they have had vaginal intercourse is a strange thing
to do since a majority of women , vaginal intercourse is n’t an activity
where they are even likely to reach orgasm or experience as much
pleasure as they might with other activities , like oral or manual
clitoral stimulation .
Like so much else when it comes to virginity ( and
even sexuality as a whole ) as a concept , this is another area where
what sex is and is not is being defined not based on all the bodies and
persons involved , but on one : while most women do not reach orgasm from
intercourse alone , most men do , and that ’s who , through most of time ,
has also been in charge of defining sex and virginity .
Lastly , I think the idea that when we choose to be sexual with
someone else , we " lose " something is pretty backwards .
When we choose
to share our sexuality with someone else who also wants to share theirs
with us , we are creating something which did not exist before , not
losing something or taking something away from someone .
We ’re making
something new .
While sometimes the notion of sex as loss is about loss
of childhood , the idea of sex as a loss mostly tends to come from
places you probably — especially as someone who loves women — would
not appreciate ; from ideas about women as property , women as nonsexual
beings , women ’s sexuality as an object or something to " give " to a
husband or man who " takes " it away , or women ’s sexuality as something
rapists rob from us .
One would hope that those kinds of notions would
be left well outside the bedroom in a healthy sexual relationship
between equals and partners who are seeking to share mutual physical
pleasure and emotional care or love .
What sex is and is not for any given person or couple just is n’t
something we can easily or universally define , because we are all
different , our sexualities all vary somewhat , and our sexual
experiences vary .
How we have sex with someone is n’t one given thing :
some days , we may want to have oral and manual sex , some days , manual
sex all by itself , some days , shared massage with intercourse ( and
women who want that with female partners can experience that with hands
or sex toys ) , some days , a lot of kissing , verbally sharing fantasy and
mutual masturbation .
We find out how we have sex with a given partner
by talking with them , communicating in other ways , and experimenting
together to suss out what feels good and what does n’t .
That ’s a
constant process , too ( and part of what makes sex exciting ) : we do n’t
learn how to have sex with any given activity once , and then do or
enjoy it exactly the same way every day or with every partner .
As well , what sex is and is not is not so simple as talking about
what tab is in what slot : it also has to do with what ’s going on
interpersonally , emotionally and psychologically , which is , for
example , why rape — for the person being raped — is not sex , even
though some of the same things may be happening physically which two
people choose to do when both people are consenting and are seeking
shared pleasure and / or union .
Frankly , I ’m a proponent of throwing away the whole notion of virginity .
This is the 21st century , after all , not the 10th .
Personally , I just feel like it is a concept so steeped in the
oppression of women ( and which historically and globally has been and
is sometimes still rife with violent and tragic consequences for many
women ) , in ignorance about sexuality , and in defining sex in ways that
strike me as counter to healthy , positive sexuality that it ’s way past
reclaiming .
Now , you may have a different opinion , and find that it is
something you want to reclaim and redefine for yourself .
Some women ,
despite the history , do find concepts of virginity personally
liberating .
If you do want to do that , then the answer is that you get
to define it however you choose , in whatever way makes sense to you and
fits your reality .
I ca n’t tell you how to do that or what that will
be , because I have no way of knowing what your experiences will be
like , what sexual activities you two will engage in , or what each of
your personal values are : this is one of those things you ’re going to
have to find out about for yourself .
But what I ’d suggest is that you consider allowing the sexual
experiences you two have together to determine what is meaningful and
enjoyable for you both : not for anyone else , just for the two of you .
I would also suggest that by all means , if you want to recognize and
celebrate any or all of your first - times with sex or a partner , that
you feel free to do that — however you define those first times —
with the love , awareness , reverence or delight you feel .
First - times of
all sorts are important to many people , and we can recognize and honor
them whether or not they have anything to do with anyone ’s pre-existing
ideals or standards : we all get to determine what our own milestones
are .
I would suggest that you focus not on any kind of loss , but on the
quality of the sex and relationship you are discovering , creating and
cultivating , and on you two exploring sexual activities together based
on what feels authentic and good for you both — physically ,
intellectually and emotionally — and which is a unique reflection of
who you both are separately and together as a couple .
I ’d suggest that
you bear in mind that despite numerous attempts to try and make it so ,
there never has been and never will be a one - size - fits - all definition
of what sex is or is n’t for all of us .
Sex between people , or even
alone with masturbation , has always been diverse and highly individual
when people let it be that way , rather than trying to do what they
think they ’re supposed to , or try and fit someone else ’s set of ideals
or cultural mandates .
The great part about approaching sex with someone in these ways is
that this kind of approach also tends to be what results in a sex life
which everyone involved will feel best about and enjoy most .

Disney and Lucasfilm have conveniently joined forces to completely creep me out .
Granted , it ’s not the licensing deal itself – in fact , the combination of Disney and Star Wars is actually pretty clever , and I kind of dig the carbonite Donald Duck .
But why why why did they decide to put Minnie Mouse in the gold slave bikini ?
It ’s not as if that ’s the only iconic image of Princess Leia – I ’m sure that Minnie would have looked quite cute in a white dress with big hair buns sticking out under her ears .
I do n’t think that “ sex sells ” really applies in this case .
Still , if scantily - clad cartoon mice are your thing , there are only 600 available , so be sure to get your plane tickets to Disneyland or Disney Hollywood Studios to pick one up for $ 195 .

In his bar overlooking the Ebro river as it rushed beneath the elegant footbridge designed by the renowned architect Zaha Hadid , Rafael Moreno glumly surveyed the handful of customers picking at their lunchtime food .
" We have already had to lay people off , " he said .
" They were meant to start building offices here , but I can't see it happening any time soon .
This crisis is going to last . "
Moreno's bar , Bocados , opened last year with riotous success amid the euphoria of Zaragoza 's international Expo fair .
The city was booming , and so was Spain .
It was the country that was creating most jobs and attracting most immigrants in Europe and it was celebrating its fifteenth consecutive year of economic growth .
Now the empty , rubbish - strewn Expo site , with its pavilions half - gutted and Hadid 's expensive bridge fenced off to the public , is a symbol of Spain 's precipitous fall from a bricks - and - mortar boom to a bust that has given it the developed world 's highest unemployment .
In a country destroying jobs at a breathtaking rhythm , once flourishing Zaragoza and the region around it is declining even faster than the national average - with unemployment up 75 % in a year .
The shock has already sent protesters on to the city 's streets in their tens of thousands .
" If this is n't fixed : Strike ! Strike ! Strike ! " , they chanted at a recent rally .
With Spain 's property developers queuing up to file for bankruptcy and employees at a local General Motors factory waiting to discover whether their jobs will survive a global restructuring plan to be announced this week , the mood becomes bleaker by the day .
Similar stories are being told across recession - hit Spain , with economists predicting that unemployment will rise from its present level of 14 % to 20 % by the end of the year .
" I 've got one more month 's work and then no idea what will happen , " said Angel López , an electrician who came to Zaragoza to help build the Expo pavilions and hotels .
" I will go abroad if I have to .
No one is going to build here any more . "
Spain 's construction sector , fuelled by cheap credit both for Spaniards and for foreigners seeking holiday homes , had swollen to twice the size of that in other countries .
As the bubble grew , building sites sucked in unskilled workers , helping to multiply its immigrant population eightfold in 10 years and encouraging young people to swap school for easy money .
A property crash , already on its way before the global financial meltdown started , has sent those workers spilling into the dole queues .
Behind them they have left plunging property prices and a stock of empty , unsold new homes that is now close to 1.5m .
The new unemployed are now dragging everyone from bank tellers to waitresses behind them .
" The last time I was unemployed was 15 years ago , " said waitress Sonia Gascón , 38 , huddling in the early - morning cold with 60 other people as she waited for an employment office to open .
" Construction work stopped , then the car factory slowed down and suddenly people stopped coming through the restaurant doors , " she said .
" My son is 16 and I can't see what future he has got . "
Gascón estimated that her dole money would last for two years and then she would fall back on her family - the traditional Spanish comfort at times of crisis .
But not everyone has that luxury .
Already in Zaragoza , and elsewhere , they are talking of " the new poor " .
" I 'm ashamed to be here , because I 've worked on building sites all around Spain for the past 15 years , " said Juan , a neatly dressed Ecuadorean waiting outside the soup kitchen run by the Nuestra Señora del Carmen parish church , who did not want his real name used .
" But I have n't worked for six months and I 've got a wife and two children to keep . "
Workers inside the kitchen said things were becoming dramatically worse .
" We can only feed 122 people at a time , " said social worker Lucía Capilla , adding that most of the newcomers were legal immigrants .
" In November we started handing out food in bags because we could not get everyone into the dining room .
Yesterday we had to hand out 30 bags . "
Charity workers blame a creaking social support system and mortgages taken out to buy overpriced houses for the emergence of a new kind of poverty .
Crucially , they say , Spain 's 10 % of immigrants cannot turn to their families for support .
Among Zaragoza 's many woes is the General Motors car factory in nearby Figueruelas , where production of Corsa and Minerva cars has dropped dramatically .
" We wo n't know what will happen until GM presents its plan for the whole company on Tuesday , " said shop steward Juan José Arceiz .
" This crisis has caught us when our own company was already in crisis . "
The Socialist government of prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has given Zaragoza 's town hall € 115 m ( £ 102 m ) to spend on emergency public works as part of a nationwide € 11bn attempt to create jobs .
Zapatero wants 25,000 small projects up and running in the spring .
" But that is only temporary , " said Luisa Fernanda Rudi , the regional boss of the opposition People 's party , which wants lower taxation and looser employment regulations .
" We need reforms . "
Even Pedro Solbes , the finance minister , has recognised that there are limited funds in the bank to pay for public works and the huge new bill for unemployment benefit .
That is not news that Joan Bakos , 46 , a truck driver who sold his home in Romania to emigrate seven years ago , wants to hear .
He is now living off €400 a month but has mortgage payments of € 800 .
" Everything has gone from white to black in just a few months , " he said as he prepared for a gloomy silver wedding get - together on Valentine 's Day yesterday .
" I ca n't see any way out . "

A terrible thing happened recently .
You might have missed it .
AOL Hometown , which itself was actually a combination of a bunch of previously acquired websites , shut down .
It shut down on October 31 of this year .
If you try to go to a site that used to be hosted there , you are forwarded to a weblog entry by “ The AOL Hometown Team ” , that says this , in total :
Hometown Has Been Shutdown
Posted on Nov 6th 2008 1:30 PM by Kelly Wilson
Dear AOL Hometown user ,
We ’re sorry to inform you that as of Oct. 31 , 2008 , AOLÂ ®
Hometown was shut down permanently .
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause .
Sincerely , The AOL Hometown Team
And that , my friends , is it .
There was a weblog posting on this same site , informally , on August 4th , letting people know AOL Hometown was being shut down , and maybe you should make an effort to get it .
Officially , though , notification was sent out ( how ?
In what way ? ) on September 30th , giving people essentially 4 weeks to figure out how to get their data off the servers , find a new place to send the data , get that arranged , and then do the transfer .
Of course , many people may not have been checking their e-mail .
Some people might have had un - working e-mail and not been notified .
Some people might have not understood how to make things run .
Go ahead and read these comments .
They ’re heartbreaking .
2 . Is there not a way to obtain the blogs anymore .
I was unable to transfer them before oct 31 .
Please let me know if there is anyway to get them .
Thank you Sandra 5 .
My question is like those above .
Is there anyway still to retrieve my hournals and homepages ?
I tried before the deadline but nothing happened .
These are my memories .
Things I wanted to remember about my kids .
And when I tried to access them before the deadline I was unable to .
Otherwise I would have printed it all out .
Please help .
12 . WHERE IS THE HOME PAGE IT TOOK MONTHS FOR ME TO BILL .
I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY NOTICE VIA THE MAIL OR E-MAIL .
PLEASE HELP ME FIND MY WEB PAGE SO I CAN COPY IT AND MOVE IT SOME WHERE ELSE .
17 .
What happened to my web page on my husband , Bob Champine , that took me many years to put together on his career and which meant a lot to me and to the aviation community .
I noticed with 9.0 I lost the left margin and the picture of him exiting the X - 1 .
I need to restore it to the internet as it is history .
Please tell me what to do .
I will be glad to retype it , I just do n’t want it lost to the world .
I need help .
Gloria Champine
It ’s all fine and good , those readers who sneer and say “ you get what you pay for ” and “ ha ha , losers ” .
But the fact is , these people were brought online and given a place for themselves .
Like a turkey drawn with a child ’s hand or a collection of snow globes collected from a life well - lived , these sites were hand - made , done by real people , with no agenda or business plan or knowledge , exactly , of how everything under the webservers worked .
They were paying for their accounts , make no mistake – this was often provided to them as a tool combined with their AOL accounts .
Some were absorbed from other companies as AOL purchased them .
Some of these websites had existed for a decade .
Some people did n’t back things up .
Some had moved on .
The data , however , stayed where it was , for years on end , and if someone happened to not be online for 4 weeks and be prepared on short notice to retrieve their stuff , then they were well and truly fucked .
Browsing the weblog that represents where these tens of thousands of websites used to go , you end up facing Kelly Wilson .
Kelly Wilson is like the fucking Grim Reaper of websites .
If you browse this collection of her postings , you can see she ’s primarily doing the same thing : “ These sites will be shut down .
You better get your shit off because that ’s it , it ’s gone .
You have 3 weeks .
GO . ” Â One of these sites being shut down is Ficlets .
Read this weblog entry from the creator of Ficlets and try not to have an emotional reaction .
If you ’re going to start composing something at me with a salad of sneering and a dash of cynicism , just fuck off right now .
We ’re the failures here .
We failed them .
Our little technorati , our people who cry for open source and beg us for money to Fight For Electronic Freedom and make their rounds at all the right cocktail parties at tech shows .. where the hell are they now ?
We ’re talking about terabytes , terabytes of data , of hundreds of thousands of man-hours of work , crafted by people , an anthropological bonanza and a critical part of online history , wiped out because someone had to show that they were cutting costs this quarter .
It ’s an eviction ; a mass eviction that happened under our noses and we let it happen .
I ’ve been evicted before – I was kicked out of a boarding house I used to live in between 1992 and 1997 .
Eviction laws were in place and I was sent notification after notification , shoved into my mailbox , left under my door , explaining my rights and how to appeal and how much time I had .
It was done during the summer months , because winter would be a hardship .
It was handled coldly , nastily , but it was done according to law , and luckily , I had a place to move onto .
( They were closing up the building to turn it into professional space , which it is to this day . )
When we evict people from their webpages , fuck all is required .
And before you sneer at AOL people , these people who trusted AOL : how about your Flickr ?
Your Facebook ?
Whatever the hot new wig - wag that you ’re dumping hours into without thinking about it ?
What , you ’re paying for something ?
Check this recent event out , paying subscriber : you have shit .
Because of a cascade of EULA and Best Practices , and most importantly , a complete disregard for the importance of this data , we ’re going to let it happen again .
And again .
And again .
Think your site is untouchable ?
Think again , pokey .
What am I saying here ?
I ’m saying that , like a real eviction , there should be practices in place .
When you open your doors to hosting user content , you should have rules in action that , unless it ’s a complete and total fire sale and you have no hope of even staying open that long , then you should be required , yes by law , assholes , to make the data available to customers for an extended period of time .
There ’s business opportunity here , for warehouses of data that can take in , say , AOL Hometown , and hold it for a year or longer , allowing people to acquire their data over the course of that year .
With legislation or even the kind of peer pressure you all used to dupe people into Creative Commons , you could have this be the norm from this point forward .
If you tell people they can upload their content , you should have a clear and distinct way for them to retrieve their content .
People do it ad - hoc as they can , but the abilities of most people , the people without an engineering degree or years of experience , to get back what they put up is minimal .
It ’s not that important .
We should make it important .
How many more times will we allow this ?
How long before someone takes a fucking stand ?
Update :
This page got an awful lot of attention , and so I decided a clarification was in order .

Air Trike – $ 2550.00 ( These photos are of a prototype .
The production model has the front and side pieces black anodized and looks much cooler and more finished )
The Air Trike is incredibly simple to work with .
Installation is as easy as affixing four bolts .
Though the Air Trike was designed around the Flat Top platform , adapters are available for all popular paramotor designs .
Carbon fiber axles and aircraft grade aluminum construction mean the Air Trike is incredibly durable and stable !
It has been tested extensively at high speeds and with heavy loading .
The front landing gear is castered , ensuring that the trike will not tip over during landing or takeoff .
This is the key to the Air Trike ’s stability .
Although the design of the Air Trike is incredibly robust , it weighs in at only 26 pounds !!!
It can support you , your paramotor , and your gear with a max gross weight of 500 pounds !!
All custom fittings are expert - machined from billet aluminum .
The high quality of the Air Trike speaks for itself .
The Air Trike is the latest most advanced paramotor trike on the market .
The huge difference between the Air Trike and other paramotor trikes on the market is safety , light weight , durability , ease of breakdown and stability .
A huge part of safety has to do with crumple zone .
Impact protection under your spine can easily be the difference between life death .
The key is to make a trike with a low stable center of gravity but also with ample crumple zone to absorb impact in a crash .
The Air Trike has 21 inches of crumple zone under the pilots butt which is really incredible .
Notice many trikes out there have only 5 - 6 inches under the pilot or even have the pilot sitting over the top of a steel bar .
It does n’t take much impact to cause spine injuries and from years and years of experience that is a major concern to address .
21 inches of crumple zone is enough to absorb even a full stall straight into the ground with very little risk of injury let alone death .
Zero people have ever died on the Air Trike and the crumple zone has been extremely effective in saving many many people ’s lives .
Do not even consider a trike that does n’t have at least 16 - 21 inches of crumple zone under you .
In this sport you WILL smack into the ground at some point .
Just like if you ride a dirt bike you will at some point dump it .
So having a paramotor trike designed to save your butt is absolutely critical .
At only 26 lbs the Air Trike is the lightest paramotor trike on the market .
That is a huge feat .
Despite being the lightest though it is also one of the tuffest and most durable .
Weight is a really big factor on an aircraft .
Many trikes out there literally weight 90 lbs !
That ’s just the trike part and does n’t even include the paramotor to push it .
That is 64 lbs more weight you have to carry compared to the Air Trike which makes a huge gigantic difference in fuel economy , distance to launch , ease of transport and moving it around , noise levels and climb rate .
It is such a huge different the Air Trike is really unmatched in the industry .
The Air Trike is also really a very strong unit and can easily support the weight of much heavier pilots along with upwards of 150 lbs in the luggage bag .
The carbon fiber axles give a very nice ride with just the right amount of spring to them .
It took quite a bit of trial and error to find the perfect winding for the carbon fiber struts .
Out first prototypes you can see in a few videos was a bit too soft allowing the trike to come a bit too low to the ground .
Our current production model is much stiffer so even a 300 lb pilot will have no problem at all with harder landings without bottoming out .
Another thing we made sure of is that the struts will actually allow you to bottom out before they break .
So if you hit pretty hard you can skip off the skids without snapping your axles .
They absorb an incredible amount of energy before failure .
We ship the Air Trike in a box that is only 24x24x15 so it breaks down incredibly small and light for transport or shipping .
An entire Flat Top Ninja & Air Trike can easily fit in the back of a Prius C. Remove the 3 struts and in seconds the Air Trike becomes the most portable trike on the market .
Even the luggage bag that is available for the Air Trike packs up very small when not in use but can hold an incredible amount of gear .
You can easily fit a 6 gallon gas can with a gallon of oil and have room to spare for your camping gear and sleeping bag and other items .
It is the flying truck of the paramotor world .
Because of the incredible lightweight it leaves the most headroom for any extra weight you want to carry .
Stability is king with the Air Trike .
It is one of the only trikes on the market with caster to the front landing gear .
Most out there have backwards caster .
This is an incredibly critical factor because with backwards caster if your wing goes off to the right for example , the front wheel will shoot off to the left which is the opposite of what you want it to do .
With the Air Trike though the front wheel casters WITH the wing .
So if the wing goes to the right the front wheel will naturally want to follow along .
One wrong move on most trikes and you will immediately flip over .
With the Air Trike though the stability is absolutely incredible .
If the wing tries to pull you over the Air Trike just turns towards the wing giving you maximum stability .
The very wide stance and properly designed front landing gear make it incredibly stable and forgiving .
Do n’t even consider trikes that have backwards caster .
They flip over very easily .
Also do not even consider a quad .
You simply do NOT make an aircraft with 4 wheels because one wrong move and they will tumble .
While 4 wheels might be more stable for a ground vehicle it is an absolute nightmare for an aircraft .
That ’s why pretty much every aircraft made these days has a tricycle landing gear .
Do not get a paramotor trike with 4 wheels .
They are not even remotely close to the stability and automatic tracking of the Air Trike .
weight shift and certified hook in points is another huge factor when considering a paramotor trike .
What is really hard to comprehend is the fact that most trikes out there are not even designed by actual pilots or experts on the sport .
Many have bars going clear up over the top of your head with glider hook in points way up above the certified level .
This alone has caused many deaths and injuries on these units .
All paragliders are designed and certified with a very specific height hook in point .
That height is the distance between the pilots seat and where the glider actually hooks in .
With bars going up over your head the hook in point can be well over 1 ft above the certified height .
That means all the work done by the glider manufacturers to make the wing stall and spin resistant goes right out the window .
So what would have been a very safe and stall resistant certified glider can become a complete death trap just by hooking it to a very poorly designed trike or paramotor with hook in points that are not even at the certified height .
Do NOT buy a trike that does n’t have certified height hook in points which are lower down under your ribs .
Also by having the glider hook in clear up above your head it gives the glider a lot more leverage with which to flip you over .
So uncertified hook in points clear up above your head in combination with backwards caster to the front landing gear and you can easily realize why you are pretty much guaranteed to flip over the poorly design trikes on a regular basis .
With the Air Trike though it is indeed design by those that actually understand the sport .
The hook in points are exactly within specification of every certified glider and having them down low also gives a huge improvement in stablity .
Another major issue with high hook in points is that it almost complete elminiates your ability to weight shift properly .
That also drastically reduces both control and safety as it forces you to use 10 times more brake than is necessary .
Using far more brakes on a glider that is no longer spin and stall resistant because of the elimination of certified hook in points and you can realize why so many have had horrible experiences on other units out there .
The Air Trike however has incredible weight shift .
You can easily turn just by leaning your body in the direction you want to turn .
That means you can use very minimal brakes and keep the energy for active piloting and stability instead of using all your brakes just to turn .
If you have to use almost all your brake travel just to make a turn how do you active pilot the wing and add more presure when needed if you are in a turn ?
The design of paraglider trikes is absolutely critical .
Far too many out there are built by people who are not even pilots let alone aircraft designers .
Another grreat thing about the Air Trike is how quick and easy it is to remove the paramotor .
So you still have the versatility of being able to foot launch or quickly attach the trike when needed .
Taking the Air Trike on and off the Flat Top paramotor takes only 4 bolts and a few minutes .
Your reserve parachute even stays installed on the Flat Top as you use the main comfort bars and harness of the Flat Top when flying the Air Trike .
So switching back and forth between trike flying and foot launching is very quick and simple with this design .

$ 4300 – 2012 Tandem S - Trike
$ 500 – Luggage Bag
$ 1200 – Streamlined Cloth Fairing
$ 1100 – Trailer Hitch Rack for both Flat Top & S - Trike
$ 3600 – Used 2010 S - Trike
The S - Trike is a landmark in aviation .
The S - Trike can be used with pretty much any paraglider and some skydiving & base jumping canopies for an endless variety of applications from transporting heavy gear to acrobatics .
With the standard Flat Top 200 attached to the back it is capable of carrying up to 350 lbs .
That means a 180 lb pilot can stow up to 170 lbs of gear in the detachable luggage pouch below the unit .
Perfect for ferrying gear into remote areas , taking a camping trip with your buddies or search & rescue missions to military applications .
It can launch in pretty much any decently smooth clearing , fly as high as 18,000 ft and has a fuel range of 280 miles .
Once aloft the pilot can also shut off the motor and use ridge or wave lift and thermals to travel without the use of the engine .
With up to an 11:1 glide ratio and speeds up to 50 mph it is exceptionally versatile .
With a weight of only 144 lbs total after the addition of a Flat Top 200 it is easily within the ultralight classification so there is no license required for the pilot or costly certifications or registration for the aircraft .
It is also very portable when used with the travel rack designed for it which fits any standard receiver hitch and allows both the Flat Top and S - Trike to be carried behind a vehicle without need for a trailer .
Perfectly balanced and fitted with a castered front landing gear the pilot can focus on flying the canopy during launch & landing as the S - Trike will happily follow along to the inputs from recommended gliders .
Once under way and your canopy is flying over head the input from the canopy will allow you to steer back and forth and even drive around in circles without having to press the steering peddles or brakes on the S - Trike for direction while on the ground .
This lightens the load on the pilot allowing them to focus more freely on throttle and toggle input .
The glider hooks in much lower than on other designs making the unit far more stable and less prone to tipping but even with low hang points and a very low center of gravity life saving crumple zone was not forgotten .
With over 21 inches of travel and spring steel axles the S - Trike will absorb an enormous amount of impact to help keep the pilot safe .
Topped off with a quick release seat belt , an all aluminum 6061 T6 chassis and fitted with a High Energy reserve parachute you can see why pilots feel so secure flying it .
Versatility , portability , reliability , usability , survivability .
The S - Trike has revolutionized the world of ultralight aircraft for both men and women alike .

A new study published in January 16 , 2009 edition of Diabetes Care indicates that daily consumption of diet soda plays a key role in the development of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes .
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of findings known to increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and is also known as Syndrome X. Metabolic syndrome includes insulin resistance or actual Type 2 diabetes , low HDL , elevated triglycerides and central obesity ( high waist circumference ) .
Two previous studies have shown a positive correlation between diet soda and metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes .
This study , the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) , was designed to test the association between diet soda and the overall risk of metabolic syndrome , the various components of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes .
The study conclusions support the findings of the previous two studies .
Another study published in the Annals of Epidemiology in Sept , 2006 , found that adults with diabetes who drank one or more diet sodas per day had hemaglobin A1C levels 0.7 percent higher than those who drank none .
HemaglobinA1C is a measurement that evaluates blood glucose control over a period of approximately 3 months .
That difference is what would expect to be found when one group started a new , effective diabetic medication and another group left untreated .
Drinking diet soda daily increased the risk of Type 2 diabetes regardless of initial obesity and changes during the study .
When metabolic syndrome was looked at by individual components , only high fasting blood sugar ( >100 mg/dL ) and high waist circumference ( men : 102 cm/39.78inches ; women : 88 cm/34.3inches ) were significantly correlated with daily consumption of diet soda .
Baseline questionnaires regarding diet soda consumption were collected between 2000 and 2002 followed by three follow up examinations : 2002 - 2003 , 2004 -2005 and 2005 - 2007 .
These exams were to specifically identify the presence of Type 2 diabetes and the various components of metabolic syndrome .
For this study , Type 2 diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose > 126mg / dL , self reported diagnosis or use of glucose lowering medication .
After all data was compiled , adjustments were made for demographics , lifestyle and dietary differences .
Hazard ratios were then calculated for Type 2 diabetes , metabolic syndrome , and the components of metabolic syndrome .
The participants who consumed diet soda were then compared to those participants who did not drink diet soda .
Limitations of the study included : observational design which precluded findings of causality , the possibility of unaccounted for differences in diet and lifestyle , difficulties accurately estimating intake of diet sodas and different artificial sweeteners .
The study authors conclude that : " These results corroborate findings from the ARIC [ Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ] and Framingham studies and show stronger adverse associations exist between diet soda and Type 2 diabetes .
Diet soda consumption , either independently or in conjunction with other dietary and lifestyle behaviors , may lead to weight gain , impaired glucose control , and eventual diabetes . "
While this data cannot establish causality , daily consumption of diet soda was associated with significantly increased risk of certain components of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes .
This study was done by : Division of Epidemiology , University of Texas Health Sciences Center , Houston , TX , the Division of Epidemiology and Community Health , University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN , Center for Human Nutrition , Department of International Health , Division of Cardiology , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD ; the Department of Nutrition , University of Oslo , Oslo , Norway http://www.annalsofepidemiology.org/article/...

Mr. Jackson said that Officer McKie was a husband and father of two who spent two years at the University of Buffalo on a basketball scholarship .
The lawyer added that the officer had an exemplary record in his five years as a correction officer .
“ My client would have no motivation whatsoever to engage in this behavior , ” he said , adding that the prosecution ’s case was “ predicated upon inmates who now , in an effort to save themselves , are pointing fingers . ”
Renée C. Hill , Officer Nelson ’s lawyer , said her client “ denies the charges adamantly . ”
The third correction officer who was indicted , Denise Albright , 43 , of Manhattan , was not present when Mr. Robinson was killed , according to Mr. Jackson , who also represents her .
She was charged with several crimes , including assault and conspiracy , and faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
Officer Albright pleaded not guilty and was held Thursday in $ 50,000 bail .
Twelve inmates were also indicted in connection with the criminal ring and were expected to be arraigned Friday .
Three of them , Joseph Hutchinson , Anquant Bryant and Shaddon Beswick , all 18 , were charged with first - degree manslaughter in the death of Mr. Robinson .

Automobile Magazine Reveals 2009 All - Stars Winners
A List of Ten of the Year ’s Elite , Ranging from the Sexy and Sleek to the Environmentally Innovative and Cost Efficient
AUTOMOBILE
Magazine , America ’s leading automotive lifestyle publication , today announced the winners of its 2009 AUTOMOBILE MAGAZINE All - Stars Awards .
This year 's list is one of the broadest we have compiled .
Our 2008 Automobile of the Year Audi R8 is joined by stalwarts such as the BMW 3 - series , newcomers like the Ford Flex , and repeat winners Chevy Malibu and Volkswagen GTI
These ten cars are the year 's fastest , most exhilarating , ingenious , awe - inspiring , accomplished , and compelling cars available in the U.S. the best Jaguar sedan I have ever driven “ This year ’s list is one of the broadest we have compiled .
Our 2008 Automobile of the Year Audi R8 is joined by stalwarts such as the BMW 3 - series , newcomers like the Ford Flex , and repeat winners Chevy Malibu and Volkswagen GTI , ” said Jean Jennings , president and editor - in - chief of AUTOMOBILE Magazine .
“ These ten cars are the year ’s fastest , most exhilarating , ingenious , awe - inspiring , accomplished , and compelling cars available in the U.S. ”
Each year , the editors of AUTOMOBILE Magazine convene to test , evaluate , and debate the performance , significance , and pure enthusiast appeal of the cars that make the biggest impact .
Award winners will be featured in the February 2009 issue of AUTOMOBILE Magazine , available on newsstands January 6 , 2009 .
AUTOMOBILE Magazine ’s 2009 All - Stars , with editorial assessments , are :
Audi R8 – AUTOMOBILE
Magazine calls the R8 the kind of iconic sports car that comes around once or twice a decade .
Dramatic inside and out , the R8 is wide , low , and purposeful — it is a luxury grand tourer as much as it is a pure sports car .
BMW 3 - series – Do n’t stop the presses : the BMW 3 - series and M3 get another All - Stars award ( its fourteenth , to be exact ) .
Is n’t this déjà vu ?
As always , the competition for the 3 - series keeps getting fiercer , and , as usual , critics say the latest , greatest M3 is a bit too refined .
But BMW ’s masterpiece of all - things - to - all - people engineering remains more fun than anything that ’s more practical and more practical than anything that ’s more fun .
Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 – AUTOMOBILE
Magazine editors found that few words have the ability to adequately convey the rush provided by the most powerful Corvette ever .
The world has produced faster cars , but few offer the same combination of sound , speed , and exhilaration .
60 mph comes in first gear ( in 3.7 seconds ) and 91 mph in second .
Chevrolet Malibu –
There is no need to assemble a laundry list of the Malibu ’s strengths versus its many competitors .
Drive one , and it is clear why AUTOMOBILE Magazine named it an All - Stars winner two years in a row .
The Malibu is the quiet American on this year ’s All - Stars list : a sedan with crisp handling , commutative steering , a properly tuned ride , and an overall feeling of quality .
Ford Flex – With seven - passenger capacity and generous proportions , the Flex is a vehicle that defies conventional wisdom .
AUTOMOBILE
Magazine was taken by the Flex ’s exterior design , which is thoroughly modern while harking back to the glory days of U.S. automakers , and a cabin that is a masterpiece of ergonomic engineering and chock - full of high - tech features .
The Flex concentrates on refinement and emphasizes style while being as practical as a minivan .
Honda Fit –
More than three decades after the original Honda Civic gave Americans a whole new notion of space utilization , the Honda Fit has come along to amaze a new generation .
The new model ’s extra polish elevates the small - car experience with hidden features , a sleeker exterior , a smoother gearbox , and a nicer cabin .
Jaguar XF – What one AUTOMOBILE Magazine editor calls “ the best Jaguar sedan I have ever driven ” is a beautiful , composed , powerful , and lush car .
The XF is impressively quick and refined .
Driving it is not just about going fast ; it is smooth , refined and comfortable for driver and passengers alike when being pressed to deliver its full potential .
Porsche 911 – From its birth in 1964 to the arrival of an improved edition last year , the Porsche 911 has been a rare island of tranquility amid the automotive industry ’s seas of turmoil .
The fortified sixth - generation 911 is gutsier and quicker accelerating , yet it squeezes an additional mpg or three from every gallon of premium .
Breadth of character is another of the 911 ’s endearing traits .
Rear or all - wheel drive , coupe or convertible , outfitted for grand touring or track days , there is a 911 for every purpose .
Mercedes - Benz C63 AMG – Mercedes - Benz ’s mind - set for its AMG cars is to offer insane power in a package that skews towards luxury .
The C63 AMG makes the leap to the All - Stars list because it sacrifices the posh - performance DNA of Mercedes Benz in its quest to be a better driver ’s car .
Other cars in the AMG portfolio are faster , but this one is the most fun .
Volkswagen GTI – With a new version of the GTI due in the U.S. in September , AUTOMOBILE Magazine applauds this return - to - its - roots VW with yet another All - Stars award .
During its three - year run , the GTI ’s performance , comfort , and functionality kept it out front in the race to be the best sporty compact car and also made it the 2007 Automobile of the Year .
Criteria and Evaluation
The AUTOMOBILE MAGAZINE All - Stars are chosen by the AUTOMOBILE MAGAZINE staff , its worldwide bureau chiefs , and its contributors , following an intensive test drive of the year ’s most innovative and important new cars .
Vehicles considered for the All - Stars awards combine the following traits :
Redefines an existing category or creates a new market segment
Provides excellent value and performance for the money
Exhibits an exceptional design
Offers pure driving enjoyment
After a 1000 - mile road trip , winners are determined by a round - table discussion that results in a vote for the ten winners .
The award decisions are not made through an instrumented test process .
Teachers staged a one - day strike last year over pay The biggest teachers ' union in England and Wales is calling for a 10 % pay rise - and says the economic downturn should not be an " excuse " for low pay rises .
The National Union of Teachers has submitted its demand to the profession 's pay review body .
A government spokesman says the current recommended 2.3 % offer represents a " good deal " for teaching staff .
Last year about a third of schools in England and Wales were shut by a one - day teachers ' strike over pay .
Shortages warning Christine Blower , acting general secretary of the NUT , says that the government and pay body should not be " tempted to use the economic downturn as an excuse " for lower pay increases .
" In this round , our case for a 10 % pay rise is based on long - term trends in recruitment , retention and turnover .
It also reflects the extent to which teachers ' pay has fallen behind other graduate professions , " says Ms Blower .
The union 's submission to the School Teachers ' Review Body ( STRB ) calls for " teachers ' pay scales to be increased by £ 3,000 or 10 % , whichever is the greater " .
It also calls for " an additional increase to restore in full the pay losses resulting from below - inflation pay awards from 2005 onwards " .
The NUT says that teachers are falling behind in pay and that it will make " teaching unattractive to graduates who can earn more with less stress in other fields " .
The union warns that without improvements in pay there will be a return to teacher shortages .
Last year , the STRB , the pay body for teachers in England and Wales , recommended a 2.3 % pay increase , and it is now reviewing that figure .
A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families says " the recommended 2.3 % pay award represents a good deal for both teachers and taxpayers " .
" We have increased teachers ' pay by an average of 19 % in real terms since 1997 to recognise the challenging but rewarding job they do with the average salary for classroom teachers now £ 31,400 . "
There have been several reports from the TDA teacher recruitment agency that the economic downturn has boosted interest in teaching - with people looking for more secure public sector jobs .
The TDA , which has reported a 40 % increase in online recruitment inquiries , has been targeting banking and finance workers who might want to switch to teaching .
But the NUT says that the recession is only likely to create a temporary increase in interest in teaching .
Last spring , the NUT staged the biggest teachers ' strike for two decades in pursuit of a pay demand .
Classroom closures were believed to have affected more than two million pupils .

Since this story was originally reported , it has been updated to correct the name of Free- HotSpot.com .
Offering free Wi-Fi can get a cafe more customers , and they ’re browsers , not table - hogs , according to a study of Paris coffee shops .
The study tracked Wi -Fi usage at five Paris branches of coffee chain Columbus Cafe over three months .
According to the chain ’s Wi-Fi provider Free-HotSpot.com , the sites attracted three to five times more users per day than paid - for rivals , but those users stayed online for less time on average than paying users .
Free-HotSpot.com
Vice President Joe Brunoli claimed that the study confounded the popular idea that free Wi-Fi would lead to Internet junkies hogging tables during busy times such as the lunch hour .
" Instead , usage tends to be in the afternoon , which is traditionally a downtime for the hospitality industry , " he said .
Only 3 percent of usage was after the cafes ’ 8 p.m. closing time , he added .
Connection stats showed the cafe hot spots attracted nine to 10 users a day Monday to Friday , falling to six a day on weekends .
That sounds tiny , but Brunoli claimed that usage at pay hot spots can be as low as one or two connections a day .
The average length of connection was 89 minutes , which Brunoli said was shorter than expected , but made sense in hindsight .
" It ’s free , so there ’s no fear that you ’re wasting money , " he explained .
" Connection - hogging is more of a problem for paid schemes , where people think , ‘ I ’ve paid for this , so I ’m going to use it ! ’ "
He added that if each user spends an average of 3 euros ( US $ 5.51 ) , the extra business generated will easily cover the 25 - euro - a - month cost of providing the DSL connection .
Hot - spot installation costs around 90 euros , he said , while ongoing maintenance is paid for by his company from its advertising revenue .
That assumes that Wi-Fi users are indeed additional customers , which is n’t necessarily true , of course .
However , Columbus Cafe ’s marketing director , Luc Heitz , said Wi -Fi is important for keeping existing customers as well .
" Wi - Fi access is one more amenity , one more added service that we can offer to make our existing customers feel at home , and to attract new customers , " he said .
" Most of the customers using the service are business people or students , who are our main target .
" It is difficult to say if the free Wi-Fi service is encouraging them to come into the cafe or not , but what we can say is that these people have been regularly using the service since it was installed .
I ’m sure they ’ve been talking about the service with friends and family , and thanks to that , more and more people are now coming to the cafe . "

A prominent Malaysian opposition legislator resigned today after photographs of her sleeping naked were circulated to the public by cell phone , an embarrassing disclosure that she slammed as a plot to discredit her party .
The People 's Justice Party , however , told 37 - year - old Elizabeth Wong to go on extended leave , and said it will decide later whether to accept her resignation from the central Selangor state assembly .
It is the latest incident in Malaysian politics to intrude into the private lives of politicians , most of whom have been opposition figures .
Among them was People 's Justice Party leader Anwar Ibrahim who has been accused of sodomy twice .
The government has denied a role in the scandals , including Wong 's pictures .

In an emotional news conference , Wong , a well - known human rights activist , did not deny that the pictures in question were of her .
She said it was " an insidious and underhanded attempt " to smear her reputation , adding that " the real objective is to discredit the party . "
" I have done nothing wrong .
I wish to state that I am not ashamed of my sexuality as a woman and as a single person .
I have broken no law , " she said , her eyes brimming with tears .
" In the interest of my party I have decided to offer my resignation , " said Wong .
News reports say the photos were believed to have been taken by her ex-boyfriend without her knowledge in her home last year .
She filed a police complaint Sunday after being informed that a newspaper had received the photographs from unidentified sources .
Wong did not blame the governing National Front coalition directly for her embarrassment , but leaders in her party charged it was politically motivated .
" We asked her to rethink her options .
I am angry .
I am personally disgusted with this kind of gutter politics " by the National Front , party chief Anwar told reporters .

HAROLD MACMILLAN , a patrician British prime minister who came to power in the 1950s , famously asked who are the middle classes .
Had he looked down his nose carefully enough he would have seen them all around him .
By the 1960s they comprised just under a third of the world 's population .
Nowadays the chance that you are a member yourself is high — 57 % of the globe count as middle class , according to Surjit Bhalla , an Indian economist .
This has much to do with impressive economic growth in developing countries .
China 's middle class has expanded particularly rapidly .
Now the bulk of the population of the Middle kingdom are middle class .

Everyone begins training a dog with a number of unknowns .
First , no one can truly know how a dog will react to training and even if you know the breed , there can be differences with each individual breed .
Another unknown is the type of dog training that you use .
Some dogs do well with food based reinforcement and some do not and owners will need to learn as they go along .
While most of the unknowns with dog training can be overcome quickly , many owners make some pretty common mistakes while they are training your dogs .
To avoid those dog training mistakes , it is important to be aware of them and that is exactly what I will be doing in this article ; alerting you to common dog training mistakes that every owner has or will make at one time .
Mistake # 1 : Not Setting Firm and Consistent Rules :
One of the most common mistakes that owners will make actually has nothing to do with the physical act of dog training and is actually a daily occurrence that usually plays in the background .
As every parent will tell you , children require rules and dogs are no different .
There should be rules set in place the moment that a dog is brought home .
This means that if you have a rule for no dogs on the furniture , then you need to stick with it , regardless of how cute a puppy is .
Not establishing those rules right from the beginning can lead to long term behavior problems and your puppy will quickly learn that he can ignore the rules and eventually simply ignore you .
It is important that you avoid this dog training mistake right from the start and make sure that everyone in your house will follow the same rules with your dog to ensure the best success .
Mistake # 2 : Repeat , Repeat , Repeat : Okay , this may be a little confusing since dog training consists of the repetition of an action but while repeating an action over again is fine , repeating a command is not .
When it comes to dog training mistakes , I would say that this is the biggest mistake that owners will make and I have been found guilty of this little offense myself .
It is only natural to repeat a command when a dog does n't listen but it is something that you should train yourself not to do .
When you repeat a command , you are teaching your dog that he does n't have to listen to a command every time .
This means that a command stops having any affect on the dog and you end up having to retrain with a new command , which can take time and can be very frustrating for both you and your dog .
Mistake # 3 : Rewarding Bad Behavior : Although there are several types of dog training available , most trainers and owners will use positive reinforcement training , which consists of treating your dog , usually with food , whenever he does something positive .
While this is an excellent way to train your dog , many owners make the mistake of treating the wrong behavior and end up reinforcing bad behavior .
Bad behavior in dog training is anything that you don`t want your dog to do .
So , for instance , your dog is in the kitchen while you are cooking a meal .
At first it may not seem like he is doing anything but spending time with you and that may have been the case in the beginning but when you drop your first bit of food , or you toss him a little snack , he will quickly learn to beg whenever you are in the kitchen .
Fast forward a year and you have a full grown dog under foot whenever you go to the kitchen simply because you have reinforced that begging in the kitchen is okay .
To avoid rewarding a dog for a bad behavior , don`t praise him , comfort him or treat him when he is doing something you don`t want repeated .
So if he barks at the door , don`t praise him for being a good guard dog and if you drop some food on the floor , pick it up yourself and take it to his dog bowl if you want to give it to him .
By controlling the environment , you can quickly stop yourself from rewarding his bad behavior .
Mistake # 4 : Saving it for a rainy day :
The last common dog training mistake that I am going to mention is the desire to put off training .
Many owners feel that dog training should be done after a certain age but it has been shown time and time again that the longer you wait , the harder it will be to train your dog .
Dog training should begin as soon as you bring your puppy home .
It starts with establishing rules and house training first and then it quickly moves to basic training such as sit , down , stay .
Puppy socialization class usually begins around 11 weeks of age and from there you will quickly start dog training .
Never leave training until your dog is 6 months of age or older since many negative behaviors are established by that time .
In the end , if you are aware of the dog training mistakes that you can make , you will find that you are less likely to make them and your dog will quickly respond to dog training with only a small amount of fuss .

Trillion - dollar stimulus packages , trillion - dollar deficits , a trillion - dollar war , and bank bailouts at $ 300 billion a clip – the immensity of this crisis is not easily grasped .
President Barack Obama 's pronouncements may be bracing , but they do n't add much to one 's understanding , so try this : " Three hundred billion dollars is ... about what we spend annually on the departments of Agriculture , Education , Energy , Homeland Security , Housing and Urban Development and Transportation combined " ( The New York Times , Jan. 4 , p. WK10 ) .
" [ A ] dd up just the funds that have ... been committed [ as of last November , and ] you get a figure ... that is larger ... than the costs of the Marshall Plan , the Louisiana Purchase , the New Deal , the Korean War , Vietnam , and the [ savings and loan ] crisis combined " ( The New York Times , Nov. 28 , 2008 , p.A43 ) .
In response , the U.S. prints wads and wads of what Paul Kennedy in The Wall Street Journal calls " unsecured money " ( Jan. 14 , p.A13 ) – dollars backed by nothing .
Nothing , that is , but a fantasy of American inevitability – which goes something like this :
We are the richest , strongest nation , and we will continue to be the richest and strongest , so foreigners ( China , in particular ) will buy our paper , prop up our government , and invest in our economy , no matter what .
How the richest , strongest nation remains so while carrying the largest debt in history is left to the imagination .
Kennedy writes , " If a miracle happened , and China bought most of [ our debt ] , what would our state of dependency be then ? "
That question is military as well as economic .
We spend more on our military than all other nations combined and bear more worldwide military commitments than any nation ever .
Obama promises to expand our military – a promise most elected Democrats and Republicans applaud .
But how can we expand our military and address our economic crisis with , uh , borrowed money ?
More to the point , why is it in China 's interest to loan us that money ?
The assumption underlying our fantasy of inevitability is , itself , a fantasy – namely , that the American consumer is the engine of the world 's economy , hence the world must come to our rescue .
Not so .
The Economist , Jan. 10 , p.63 : " [ E] merging economies ' reliance on America is often exaggerated .
... [ S ] ince 2000 ... [ m ] ost of [ their ] growth in exports has been within the developing world .
... [ I ]t is ... wrong to assume that they cannot recover until America rebounds . "
Stripped of economic jargon , it goes like so :
This may be the historical moment when China , India , and Brazil are forced to dispense with American consumers .
Their economies are slowing in this crisis , yet still growing ; ours is not .
Their consumer economies do n't depend much on credit , so the credit crunch is n't killing their consumers the way it 's killing ours .
If they can sustain themselves internally and by trading with one another , why prop us up ?
And , again , why , oh why , is it in their interest to rebuild our military ?
Our hopeless confusion about these questions was illustrated , appropriately enough , on the solstice .
Read these three consecutive pages of The New York Times , Dec. 21 , 2008 :
P.WK9 : A lengthy editorial observed , " The [ military ] services are already talking up remote future threats ( most involving a hostile China armed to the teeth with submarines and space - age weapons ) . "
Suggested are various cuts and increases in specific weaponry and an " [ i ] ncrease [ of ] the size of the ground force " to the tune of " $ 100 billion over the next six years . "
This editorial fails to note that we 're broke and can rebuild our military only with borrowed money .
Let 's see , we 'll borrow from China in order to one day fight China ?
And China will abet this ?
Why ?
Next page , p.WK10 : Thomas L. Friedman 's column is titled " China to the Rescue ? Not ! "
He concludes , for various reasons ( some pretty half - baked ) that " China is not going to rescue us .
...
We 're going to have to get out of this crisis the old - fashioned way . "
How do we do that when we 're broke , dependent on China buying Treasury bonds ? " [ B ]y digging inside ourselves and getting back to basics , " whatever that may mean to families having to choose between health care and rent .
Next page , p.WK11 , " Financial Time Bombs , " by Charles Duelfer and Jim Rickards : " [ T ] here is no doubt that [ China 's ] enormous reserves give it de facto veto power over some of Washington 's [ financial ] policies . "
This is an issue of national security , so " who would warn the White House if foreign entities made a concerted attack on our financial system ? "
They want Obama to set up some kind of agency " to plan our response . "
Which would be what , exactly ?
Bomb our bankers ?
War on the people from whom we import our commodities and food ?
Stop borrowing and be broker and then broke ?
Duelfer and Rickards make no concrete suggestions because there is none to make .
Three pages of drivel passing for serious analysis .
Then go to The New York Times of Jan. 8 , where , on p.1 of the Business section , Edmund L. Andrews assures us , " The good news is that , for the moment , there is plenty of cheap money available for the Treasury to borrow , " but , " The situation could worsen if countries like China ... become more reluctant to do so . "
Andrews was probably shocked to read the headline on his own paper 's front page that same morning : " China Losing Taste for Debt From U.S. " :
" All the key drivers of China 's Treasury purchases are disappearing – there 's a waning appetite for dollars and a waning appetite for Treasuries , and that complicates the outlook . "
Uh , yeah , " complicates the outlook " is one way of putting it .
Jump to The New York Times , Jan. 21 , the day after the inauguration , p.A19 , " China Sees Separatist Threats " : " China said ... that American arms sales to Taiwan jeopardize stability in Asia .
... Last October , the Pentagon announced it was selling $ 6.5 billion of weaponry to Taiwan despite protests from Beijing . "
They loan us money that we in turn distribute as arms to their enemy .
Understandably , they 're getting a little sick of that .
At its highest levels , our military is worried that it can no longer do what 's asked of it .
The New York Times , Jan. 13 , p.A9 , " Top Officer Urges Limit on Mission of Military " :
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Mike Mullen , " urged generals and admirals to tell civilian leaders when they believed the armed forces should not take the lead in carrying out policies overseas . "
He " called for more money and personnel to be devoted to the civilian agencies responsible for diplomacy and overseas economic development . "
Defense Secretary Robert Gates also " has delivered a series of talks , remarkable for a Pentagon chief , calling for more resources for civilian agencies responsible for delivering ' soft power . ' "
" Remarkable " is hardly enough of a word .
The insanity of the situation is this :
The military begs relief while politicians promise to expand it with money borrowed from a rival , a potential enemy that appears less and less interested in supporting our economy at the very moment when our economy needs it most desperately .
Meanwhile , our leaders encourage fantasies of American inevitability and assure us that the crisis is temporary .
Fact :
At present , the dollar is , in effect , backed by China – an increasingly reluctant China .
Every dollar we print is a prayer that China wo n't turn us away .
" The value of outstanding American Treasury bills now reaches $ 10.6 trillion .
...
Worry centers on the possibility that foreigners could come to doubt the American wherewithal to pay back such an extraordinary sum " ( The New York Times , Dec. 28 , 2008 , p.WK1 ) .
How will a country that 's lost its manufacturing base pay back $ 10.6 trillion and counting ?
It is not possible .
When the world faces that fact is when our troubles really start .
What 's happened so far is mere rehearsal .
There 's a line going around that just about says it all : " It 's gonna get worse before it gets worse . "
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- Motorcylce manufacturer Harley - Davidson Inc. HOG , - 1.25 % said Friday that it will cut around 1,100 jobs in 2009 and 2010 as it cuts production volumes and restructures .
The company said it will consolidate its two engine and transmission plants in the Milwaukee area into its facility in Menomonee Falls , Wis. , discontinue its domestic transportation fleet , close its distribution facility in Franklin , Wis. , and consolidate paint and frame operations at its assembly facility in York , Pa .
The group said it expects to take one - time charges of $ 110 to $ 140 million and generate annual savings of $ 60 million to $ 70 million .
A bank that was rescued with £ 17bn in state handouts refused to open a " return to Normandy " account for D - Day veterans , on the grounds that it would be a profitless nuisance .
The Normandy Veterans Association asked Lloyds to set up an account for the " Overlord List " – an appeal in The Independent that raised £ 20,000 to take 500 ex-servicemen back to France on 6 June for the 65th anniversary of the Normandy landings .
The request , to a Bristol branch of Lloyds , was received enthusiastically .
However , the NVA 's secretary Peter Hodge was later told the bank 's London headquarters would not approve what it deemed a " temporary " facility because the cash would be withdrawn before the summer and would therefore " provide no benefit " to Lloyds .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The advertising executive Trevor Beattie , who has personally pledged to sponsor 30 veterans from the West Midlands after hearing of our appeal , accused Lloyds of showing " rank insensitivity " .
" We hear a lot from bankers about risk , " he said .
" We , as taxpayers and citizens , are suffering from the absurd risks banks took .
And now this bank refuses to provide a simple , risk - free service for people who risked everything on our behalf .
It beggars belief . "
In a letter to the Bristol branch manager , copied to the Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank , Mr Beattie said : " Your blighted profession has just slipped another rung .
As if banking had not soured its already crass reputation enough .
Not happy with helping bring our economy to the brink of a financial abyss , it now seems that lending a hand to a group of proud octogenarians to whom we all ( yes , even bankers ) owe everything is beyond you .
You are not fit to lace the boots of those we will be honouring in June .
Sleep well . "
Mr Hodge said the NVA asked Lloyds for a special account because it was anxious to make sure the cash and cheques were handled safely .
He said he found the bank 's reluctance impossible to comprehend , adding : " Their main point was that such an account would be difficult to organise and provide no benefit to Lloyds . "
Last night , a spokeswoman for Lloyds TSB said : " We are extremely sorry for the upset and offence we caused Captain Peter Hodge .
Better judgement and more flexibility should have been exercised by us . "
She added that " in order to express our deep regret " , the bank would pay £ 700 to sponsor two veterans to make the return trip to Normandy .
However , the apology came too late for the NVA .
Mr Hodge , 67 , has instead set up an account with HSBC , which said it was " honoured and delighted " to help with the fundraising campaign .
Greens condemn UK Borders Agency for " cowardly " stance
20 February 2009
The Green Party today welcomed a High Court decision which severely criticised home secretary Jacqui Smith over a " manifestly unlawful " deportation of a gay asylum seeker last year .
The Greens applauded the decision by judge Sir George Newman , who has ordered Labour 's home secretary to find the 38 - year - old man and return him to Britain .
Mr X ( 1 ) had been " deliberately misled " by the UK Border Agency , deprived of his right to seek legal advice before his removal and tortured ( 2 )
Joseph Healy , Green Party Euro-election candidate for London , today condemned " this cowardly and illegal action by the Borders Agency . "
Mr Healey , who is himself gay , said : “ This man may now be dead or tortured , for all we know .
Clearly this is of no significance to the Borders Agency , who are egged on by the callous disregard for human rights of this morally bankrupt New Labour government .
This is part of an overall deeply concerning approach to LGBT asylum seekers and needs to end immediately .
I congratulate the judge involved on his humane and fair approach to this deeply serious issue . ”
Phelim Mac Cafferty , the media officer for of the Green Party Lesbian , Gay , Bi and Trans Group added : “ Here we have yet more evidence of the UK Borders Agency depriving immigrants of their rights , and the use of torture against LGBT asylum seekers on UK soil .
The case of Mr X follows the decision by the Agency two weeks ago to deport a gay Iraqi who is almost certainly being sent back to persecution and hatred . "
Phelim continued : “ Mr X joins the many LGBTs who ’ve fled persecution , rape and torture in their home countries .
He fled to our country and the Labour government 's response was to lock him up like a criminal and then throw him out to certain further torture .
" The Green Party says enough is enough of the contradictory policies of a government which on the one hand talks of their commitment to LGBT equality but which is still deporting LGBTs to torture and persecution . "
Phelim concluded :
“ To restore any kind of faith in the UK Borders Agency , we now need as a bare minimum :
1. Compulsory training for all asylum staff on sexual - orientation and trans - awareness .
2. Explicit instructions to all immigration and asylum staff , and asylum judges , that homo , bi and transphobic persecution are legitimate grounds for granting asylum .
3. Clearer and up - to - date guidance from the Home Office for asylum judges to reflect the accurate scale of LGBT persecution throughout the world using expert information from NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch .
4. Legal - aid funding for asylum claims needs to be substantially increased . ”
Notes :
1. Neither the asylum - seeker nor the country to which he was sent can be named .
2. According to The Independent newspaper of Friday 20th February : “ Mr X said that , last September , he was deceived into thinking he was being taken from Tinsley House immigration removal centre , on the perimeter of Gatwick airport , for an interview with an immigration officer .
Instead , without warning , he was taken in a van by four security men to a plane …
He said that , when he resisted leaving the van , he was handcuffed , and punched in his private parts to make him straighten his legs so they could be belted together .
Crying , he was lifted on to the aeroplane and flown out of the country . ”

Back to main news page
One cold March morning , flight attendant Sonia Hartwick saw ice on the wing of the plane she was serving on , Air Ontario Flight 1363 .
Icy wings , as Hartwick knew , can be disastrous — a major cause of airplane crashes .
They can also be easily remedied :
One word from the captain , and the plane can be de-iced and ready to go , usually in less than 10 minutes .
But Hartwick did n't say a thing .
Info US Airways
Years later , she'd have plenty of time to think about the reasons why .
She felt that " pilots did not welcome operational information from crew members , " as one academic study of the Air Ontario flight would later note .
She also trusted the pilots .
Surely , if the ice were a real problem , she reasoned , they would have noticed it .
So Sonia Hartwick kept her mouth shut .
And Air Ontario Flight 1363 crashed just seconds after takeoff , killing 24 people .
Hartwick , unbelievably , survived — survived to tell her story and survived to deal with the guilt of knowing that she could have spoken up .
Paula Walker knew all about Sonia Hartwick .
The Carefree resident has been a flight attendant for 23 years , and Hartwick 's story is legend in the business .
But , more importantly , Walker had served as a trainer to her fellow flight attendants at America West ( now US Airways ) .
The story of Sonia Hartwick 's icy observation is n't just an industry ghost story :
It 's used in training to teach flight attendants to trust their instincts , to be the eyes and ears of the flight , and to speak up when something is n't right .
So on another frigidly cold morning 14 years after the Air Ontario crash , when Walker noticed ice on the wings of America West Flight 851 as it was preparing to leave Calgary for Phoenix , she spoke up — and when she had to , she spoke up again .
It would take three tries , and the efforts of all three flight attendants onboard , to get the pilots to agree grudgingly to de-ice .
But the upshot is this : Flight 851 landed in Phoenix on time , without incident .
Paula
Walker believes the safe landing was due , in part , to her willingness to speak up .
So do the flight attendants serving with her that day , Sue Burris and Brian Shunick .
But Walker , Burris , and Shunick have n't been lauded for their actions .
Just the opposite .
After the trio reported the incident to the Federal Aviation Administration , one of the flight 's pilots fired back at them , hard .
He sued all three flight attendants for defamation , demanding $ 2 million .
He has continued to push the lawsuit in court for nearly three years — and , at this point , the claim is headed to trial .
That could mean lawyer fees and court costs running into six figures .
The situation is unbelievably stressful for the three veteran flight attendants .
But what makes it even worse is that the cost of a trial , much less any jury verdict , would come out of their pockets .
At this point , their airline has decreed that they 're on their own .
According to their union contract , US Airways is supposed to foot the legal bill for any flight attendant sued for something she did as part of her official duties .
The only caveat ?
If the flight attendant has shown " willful misconduct , " the airline is off the hook .
That clearly is n't the case here .
Yes , the record shows that the trio did offer a white lie in a desperate attempt to stop the pilots from taking off without de-icing .
But they never did anything that a normal person would consider beyond the pale : no screaming , banging on cockpit doors , or causing a disturbance .
Yet the airline is refusing to provide one dime for their legal defense .
" When I got involved in this case and they said the company was n't covering their defense , I was very surprised , " says Michael Pearson , the attorney representing the flight attendants .
" They should be treated as heroes , not ostracized . "
So never mind that the three flight attendants may well have saved Flight 851 .
Never mind that the company 's decision could cause a chilling effect among other flight attendants who see something dangerous .
The whistleblowers of Flight 851 are on their own .
The trouble began that morning in 2003 as Paula Walker was closing the cockpit door , just before the plane was to push back from the gate .
The Phoenix - based flight crew was on its first flight of the morning , leaving Calgary to return to Arizona , and the weather was frigid — just about 4 degrees Fahrenheit .
When Walker asked the first officer , Ed Gannon , whether he was going to do the usual wing de-icing before takeoff , he said no .
They did n't need it that day .
Did n't need it ?
Walker could see the wings of the aircraft , and , as she would later write in a memo to the FAA , they definitely had some sort of icy frost on them .
( Through his attorney , Henry Stein , Gannon did not respond to repeated messages seeking comment . )
As experienced fliers know , any sort of contamination on a wing can be a big deal .
Numerous airplane crashes have been attributed to snow or ice on the wings .
And it 's not as though it 's a difficult thing to get the problem taken care of .
Cities like Calgary build de-icing into the flight time .
So Walker appealed to the captain , who serves as the top guy on the flight .
But he told her he was deferring to his first officer , Gannon .
By now , Walker was upset .
She says she sought out the other two flight attendants , Sue Burris and Brian Shunick .
Both , like her , had nearly 20 years ' experience with America West .
Since the three had been flying together nonstop for the past month , they had an easy camaraderie .
All three agree :
They saw ice .
" I 've been with this company 20 - something years , " Shunick says .
" I see ice on the wings , I know what it is . "
This is the point where I , as a frequent flier , start feeling really nervous .
Of course , we 're always in a rush for takeoff , and when the pilot gets on the intercom and talks about how we 're going to be delayed because they 're doing some safety check , I roll my eyes just like anyone else .
But contamination on the wing is serious , serious business .
This is not just better - safe - than - sorry ; this is , literally , life and death .
So , of course , the flight attendants were freaking out .
The pilots had pushed back from the gate and were preparing to taxi to the runway .
The flight attendants felt they had to do something to get the pilots ' attention .
" We had to think of something fast , " Walker says .
The three recalled that , as they gazed out the windows looking at the ice on the wings , the passengers seated nearby wondered aloud what they were doing .
Those inquiries , they thought , might have provided enough cover to persuade the pilots to change their minds .
" So we decided , " Walker says , " we 'll say that the passengers are asking about it . "
It fell to Burris to make the call .
She phoned the cockpit and explained that she 'd heard comments ; the passengers were concerned about the ice on the wings .
It was a lie .
But from the point of view of anyone who 's ever been a passenger on a plane , I think it was a forgivable one .
After Burris made that call , First Officer Gannon came out of the cockpit and inspected the wings himself .
As he came back toward the flight deck , as Walker would later write in a memo to the FAA , he grumbled , " Now we have to de-ice to cover our ass . "
Cover our ass .
Not prevent a major catastrophe , but cover our ass .
Nice .
So de-ice they did , and the plane took off .
But the incident was so alarming to Walker that , immediately upon landing at Sky Harbor , she made her way to the airline 's on - site offices .
She explained how Gannon had twice blown her off and it was only after their third attempt to raise the issue that he finally obliged .
Walker says the company was alarmed enough to get a FAA representative on speakerphone .
The FAA rep asked Walker to make a written statement — and asked for statements from Burris and Shunick , too .
All three were happy to comply .
But without thinking of the ramifications , they made a mistake .
In their statements , they repeated their claim that the passengers had raised the issue of the icy wings .
Later , when the FAA was investigating the matter and summoned the three for sworn testimonies , they would volunteer the truth :
They 'd made up the passenger concern just because they did n't know how else to get the pilots ' attention .
The discrepancy in their accounts would later become a major issue .
But they were n't thinking about that in 2003 , moments after their safe landing in Phoenix , as they prepared their statements .
They were only thinking about what might have been .
" I 'd never in my then - 18 years written up anybody for anything , " Walker says .
Burris agrees ; she 'd never lodged a complaint either .
" But this was a potential catastrophe .
To fly with contamination . . .
You just do n't do that . "
As it turns out , the flight attendants were n't the only people who thought the pilots ' actions that day were troubling .
Unbeknownst to them , the de-icing crew at the Calgary airport filled out an " irregularity report " of their own .
" At about 6:15 [ a.m. ] , my de-icing partner . . . approached a member of the flight crew , asking if they were going to require a de-icer , " wrote Arnie Getz , a Calgary - based worker .
" They said no , that they were fine . "
That seemed odd to him .
" We were both surprised , " Getz wrote , " because we could see the frost on the wings and the fuselage . "
Yet only after the plane had pushed back for departure , Getz noted , was it towed back into position for de-icing .
If Getz 's testimony is correct , Paula Walker and her fellow flight attendants may well have saved Flight 851 .
After the flight attendants filed their statements with the FAA , they did n't push the matter .
Nobody called the newspapers .
Nobody lobbied for the pilots to be punished .
" We figured we did our job , and now it was their job , " Burris recalls .
They heard nothing for three years .
" We figured nothing had happened , " Walker says .
But then they got a call from a lawyer at the FAA .
The agency was pursuing the matter ; it was going to call them all in for depositions .
The three attendants cooperated , but the matter ultimately ended in a fizzle .
" We did not take any action against the pilot in the case you referenced , " FAA spokesman Ian Gregor wrote me in an e-mail .
" I cannot comment on the allegations , other than to say that we were unable to substantiate them .
Please note that this does not necessarily mean that we doubted the word of the flight attendants .
" It simply means that we were unable to prove the allegations . "
Gannon obviously saw things differently .
According to the lawsuit he would file against Walker , Shunick , and Burris , he was forced to hire an attorney .
Although the FAA dropped its claims in March 2006 , it cost him $ 21,770 in legal fees , only part of which was reimbursed by the FAA .
Gannon acknowledged that he did , ultimately , observe a " small patch of ice on the right wing . "
And he did , eventually , decide it was " best to err on the side of caution by having the aircraft de-iced . "
But in court filings , Gannon insists he never violated protocol and , contradicting Walker 's testimony , claims he was never approached by the flight attendants before the call from Sue Burris .
Even though his legal bills from the FAA investigation were $ 21,000 , Gannon sued the flight attendants for 100 times that — a staggering $ 2 million .
Gannon initially alleged defamation , tortious interference , and intentional infliction of emotional distress .
The judge tossed out the latter two claims but left the defamation claim .
Now it could end up in trial .
The flight attendants ' lawyer , Pearson , has appealed to higher courts , arguing that their statements must be protected from litigation — they spoke up as part of their official duties , in order to keep passengers safe .
But the courts have refused to get involved at this point .
So the legal proceedings drag on .
If they keep going , the flight attendants could be on the hook for a sum well into six figures .
All three have already refinanced their homes .
They have no idea where to get more money in this economy , much less enough for a trial .
They 're desperate enough to set up a Web site , hoping for donations and support .
They feel they 're out of options .
Their union has filed a grievance , arguing that US Airways simply must pick up the cost of the flight attendants ' legal defense .
But the company is taking the position that the flight attendants lied — never mind that their actions may well have saved the flight from disaster .
A company spokesman declined comment , noting that the airline is n't a party to the suit .
But if anything had gone wrong that day , you can bet it would have been a party to it .
You'd think it would want to reward the flight attendants who came forward . . . not protect the pilot who grudgingly agreed to cover his ass .
" At the end of the day , they 're taught to take whatever measures are necessary to protect the passengers and themselves , " attorney Pearson points out .
And that 's exactly what these three brave flight attendants did .
Thank God .
That 's something we should honor .
And we should expect — no , demand — that any airline we entrust with our lives does the same .
Nuremberg trials also judged “ a waste of time ”

It ’s par for the course for Obama and Biden , the men who promised “ change ” but in every step of their preparations for assuming office have pursued nothing but continuity , to acknowledge that they will protect criminals in the Bush administration from prosecution for authorizing torture , a complete violation of both the U.S. constitution and the Geneva Conventions .
When asked by ABC host George Stephanopoulos if top level Bush administration officials would be prosecuted for mandating prisoner abuse , Biden said that he and Obama would be “ focusing on the future , ” adding “ I think we should be looking forward , not backwards . ”
Such rhetoric goes to the very heart of the gigantic con job the “ Obama change ” hoax has wrought upon millions of befuddled Americans who naively presumed that voting for the lesser of two evils would result in anything other than more evil .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Perhaps Göring , Ribbentrop and the rest of the Nazis prosecuted at Nuremberg for their war crimes were following the wrong line of defense when they claimed they were merely “ following orders , ” they should have just proclaimed that the world should be “ looking forward not backwards ” and according to the Biden / Obama view of justice , they would have got off scot free .
Likewise , pedophiles and rapists who abuse children and women in ways not far removed from what was approved at Abu Ghraib should merely tell police that since the abuse and rape occurred in the past , everybody should just move on , “ looking forwards not backwards ” .
Obama and Biden , with their de-facto pardons of the Bush administration torture masters , are ensuring that what happened at places like Abu Ghraib , including beating people to death , raping people with acid covered batons and sexual abuse of children , will continue to happen in future without consequence .
Of course , those that protect war criminals from prosecution should be treated no better than the war criminals themselves , and when real “ change ” comes to America , Obama and Biden will face the same justice as Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld .

Hackers are finding new ways of tricking potential victims Hackers have discovered a new way of duping users onto fraudulent websites : fake parking tickets .
Cars in the US had traffic violation tickets placed on the windscreen , which then directed users to a website .
The website claimed to have photos of the alleged parking violation , but then tricks users into downloading a virus .
Anti-virus firm McAfee says the Vundo Trojan then gets users to install a fake anti-virus scanner .
Vehicles in Grand Forks , North Dakota , were the targets for this new type of fraud .
Drivers found the following message on the yellow ticket on their windscreen : " PARKING VIOLATION
This vehicle is in violation of standard parking regulations " .
The ticket then instructed drivers to visit a website , where drivers could " view pictures with information about your parking preferences " .
The website instructed users to download a tool bar containing a virus According to internet security watchdog The SANS Institute , the website then had photos of cars in various car parks around Grand Forks and instructed users to download a tool bar to find photos of their own vehicle .
But the tool bar was actually an executable file which installed a Trojan virus that then displayed a fake security alert when the PC was rebooted .
The fake alert then prompted the user to install fake anti-virus software .
Writing on the SANS blog , anti-virus analyst Lenny Zeltser ran through the different stages of infection .
" The initial program installed itself as a browser helper object ( BHO ) for Internet Explorer that downloaded a component from childhe.com and attempted to trick the victim into installing a fake anti-virus scanner from bestantispyware securityscan.com and protectionsoft warecheck.com , " he explained .
It is thought this is the first time fraudsters had used real world solutions to try and trick users , although Mr Zeltser warned that it would not be the last .
" Attackers continue to come up with creative ways of tricking potential victims into installing malicious software .
" Merging physical and virtual worlds via objects that point to websites is one way to do this .
I imagine we 'll be seeing such approaches more often . "

A peek at Phoenix 's HyperSpace fast - boot Linux add - on by Henry Kingman ( Jan. 5 , 2009 )
PC BIOS giant Phoenix Technologies today launched a fast - booting Linux add - on for Windows PCs .
This hands - on review finds " HyperSpace " works to redress slow boot times , WiFi connection hassles , and short battery lives typical of Windows PCs , but sacrifices a lot of flexibility in order to achieve these goals .
Increasingly , notebook and even netbook vendors are grafting fast - booting Linux environments onto Windows PCs .
In fact , Linux Foundation Director Jim Zemlin recently theorized that the trend could result in Linux out - shipping Windows by year 's end .
Fast - boot environments such as HyperSpace , DeviceVM Splashtop , Asus ExpressGate , Dell Latitude On , Toshiba Qosmio , and InterVideo's original InstantON are typically rebranded by OEMs , so few will realize they are using Linux .
That could actually be a good thing for Linux 's reputation on the desktop , given that many of these environments are pretty limited .
HyperSpace flavors and experiences
Phoenix offers a " Hybrid " version of HyperSpace that leverages virtualization hardware built into most laptop chips .
This version lets the user cold - boot into Linux , launch a Firefox 3.0 - based browser , acquire a WiFi connection , and begin working in about 40 seconds , we found in testing on a Lenovo T400 .
After that , suspend and resume is basically instant , and can be controlled by opening or closing the lid .
Thanks to virtualization support , the Hybrid flavor of HyperSpace lets you browse in Linux while booting Windows in the background -- about a four minute orde ... er , process , for Vista Business with the T400's T9600 processor clocked at 2.8GHz .
Once both OSes are up , the F4 function key or a sidebar widget can be used to toggle between them .
Additionally , a rudimentary filemanager affords a view of " My Documents " from within Linux , though all documents -- even simple JPEG images -- must be opened only from within Windows .
Phoenix also offers a " Dual " version of HyperSpace for chips lacking virtualization hardware , such as Intel 's Atom processor for netbooks .
Without virtualization support , the Linux environment must be shut down in order to boot Windows .
But , a nifty hand - off mechanism allows some communication between the OSes : clicking on an unsupported file type in the Linux environment 's browser brings up the option to " open the file with Windows . "
Additionally , both versions of HyperSpace we tested were able to hand network connection information over to Windows , to avoid reconfiguration delays .
Phoenix says HyperSpace 's Linux environment uses " up to 50 percent less " power than Windows , on some systems .
While the wording is odd , we believe the power savings are significant , albeit with a price .
The implementations of HyperSpace on our two test systems appeared to keep most peripheral circuits powered off when running in Linux - only mode .
This affected our ability to connect USB mice and , in the case of the S10 netbook , an external amp and speakers .
Additionally , the implementation in our test systems may have curtailed the Linux system 's access to memory a little too aggressively as a power saving measure , because we experienced a few OOMs ( out - of - memory errors ) when using Firefox with Gmail .
Easy WiFi connectivity is another feature touted by Phoenix , and here , we could not dither .
The interface is very friendly , and it even supports half a dozen cellular data cards ( which we did not have to test , though ) .
Phoenix says its focus on network automation , fast boot , and battery life resulted from a forum that identified these as the top priorities among notebook consumers .
Other features and quibbles
HyperSpace appeared to work mostly as described by Phoenix on our two test systems .
However , the technology is very new , and the tested systems were pre-production models .
Thus , in addition to about a dozen bugs Phoenix admitted it is rushing to fix , we encountered these : Hitting Ctrl - Alt - Backspace in the Linux environment " zaps " the Xorg server , causing an unrecoverable crash .
Other implementers will hopefully build their Xorg binaries without this unfortunate Xorg " feature , " a vestige of the antediluvian days when Linux window manager crashes were actually quite common ( though even back then , it was usually better to ssh in from another system and respawn the wm )
The Linux environment really only offers a browser , Adobe PDF reader , Flash , and Java plugins at this point .
Other fast - boot Linux environments offer media players , photo browsers , and so on .
Presumably , some OEMs may choose to include other applications , such as Skype .
Users can't add browser plug-ins themselves , though Phoenix promises regular updates to paid subscribers .
On the plus side , users can add Firefox extensions .
The systems ' HyperSpace partitions appear to use non-standard partition types and / or filesystems unrecognized by standard Linux utilities such as grub and mount .
The Windows partitions could not be resized with ntfs - resize , though I 'm mystified as to why .
The S10 netbook 's disk actually had 14GB of unused space , which I used to install Debian Lenny ( which ran perfectly , in limited testing ) .
However , grub could not recognize the HyperSpace partition , so installing Lenny meant I lost access to HyperSpace .
Things might have worked had I installed grub to a partition , instead of the MBR .
Or , failing that , on a USB key .
The " HyperSpace " browser is actually Firefox 3.0 , a glance at about : config confirms ( Opera also says its browser can be used in the environment ) .
Yet , its activity icon ( similar to spinning globe in Firefox , or the spinning ' e ' in IE ) is actually the rippling Jolly Roger flag logo introduced with Windows 95 .
That 's just weird .
A widget sidebar provides a kind of fancy graphical bookmarks list , but does not appear to be user - configurable Conclusions
The test systems were pleasant to use .
It 's great to have something around that can hibernate for several days , quickly resuming to check email or look up things from time to time .
There is a lot of promise here .
I found myself reaching for the S10 several times to answer dinner table questions , instead of the usual Nokia N810 .
However , it appears to be early days for the technology .
More work needs to be done to make HyperSpace 's Linux environment feel " complete . "
It seems silly to have to launch Windows just to stream an MP3 over the web , for instance .
Ultimately , it 's really a shame that any PC should need two OSes .
It 's a Frankensteinian kind of thing .
A friend of mine likened it aptly to a car requiring a second steering wheel for parking only .
It 's truly a pity that Windows Vista takes so long to boot , shutdown , resume , hibernate , suspend , and so on .
My own theory is that Vista , codenamed Longhorn and delayed five years , was actually intended to run on much faster processors than Intel and AMD proved capable of producing .
Who knew that Moore 's law would finally be broken , and everything would have to go multi-core ?
And , it 's a pity that Linux , despite getting better all the time , can't run the commercial software applications that users need .
It 's enough to make you think we 're still in the " Model - T " era of computing , and that maybe Linux and free software wo n't be able to save the world , afterall .
Additionally , it 's troubling that HyperSpace currently does not better support the installation of alternative operating systems .
That just seems like a basic right of PC ownership .
Hopefully , this is just a by - product of pre-production nature of the systems we tested , or possibly reviewer error ( though I tried three distros , and ran chkdsk /f on the Vista partition dozens of times ) .
Availability
Phoenix 's HyperSpace appears to be aimed at PC OEMs such as Acer , said to be an early customer .
However , the technology will also be available direct to consumers , priced at $ 60 / year for the Hybrid version or $ 40 for the Dual version ( three year discounts are also available ) .
Further details may be found at a new website , here .

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland/14

Summary
Everything you ever wanted to know about currying , partial application , higher order functions and related topics .
Advertisement
Higher order functions and curried functions A language has support for first class functions if it is possible to use a function as a regular value , i.e. if it is possible to pass a function to another function , or return it from a function .
In a language with first class functions , it is therefore possible to define the concept of higher order function is : a function which accepts in input or returns in output ( or both ) another function .
Various imperative languages have support for higher order functions : all the scripting languages , the latest version of C# , Scala , and a few others .
Still , functional languages have a better support and higher order functions are used in those language much more that in imperative languages .
This is especially true for languages such as ML and Haskell , which support curried functions out of the box : in such languages all functions are really unary functions ( i.e. they accept a single argument ) and functions of n arguments are actually unary functions returning closures .
In Scheme this behavior can be emulated with macros .
Here is an example of how one could define curried functions in Scheme : ( def- syntax curried - lambda ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub ( curried - lambda ( ) b b* ... ) #'( begin b b* ... ) ) ( sub ( curried - lambda ( x x * ... ) b b* ... ) #'( lambda ( x ) ( curried - lambda ( x* ... ) b b* ... ) ) ) ) ) ( def-syntax ( define - curried ( f x ... ) b b* ... ) #'( define f ( curried - lambda ( x ... ) b b* ... ) ) ) define - curried defines a function with ( apparently ) n arguments as an unary function returning a closure , i.e. a function with ( apparently ) n- 1 arguments which in turns is an unary function returning a closure with n - 2 arguments and so on , until it returns an unary function .
For instance , the following add function ( define - curried ( add x y ) (+ x y ) ) apparently has two arguments , but actually it is an unary function returning an unary closure : > ( add 1 ) #< procedure > > ( ( add 1 ) 2 ) 3
You can see how the macro works by using syntax - expand : > ( syntax - expand ( curried - lambda ( x y ) (+ x y ) ) ) ( lambda ( x ) ( curried - lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) )
The internal curried - lambda has a single argument in this case and thus expands to a regular lambda function , but you can see that in general you will have a tower of nested lambdas , which dept is equal to the number of arguments .
Whereas it is possible define curried functions in Scheme , usually this is not very convenient , unless you are trying to emulate ML or Haskell idioms .
Out of the box , Scheme supports functions with multiple arguments in a traditional fashion , i.e. the same as in Python : thus , the most convenient construct is not currying , but partial application .
The Pythonistas here will certainly think of functools .
partial , an utility which was added to the standard library starting from Python 2.5 .
Schemers have something similar ( but of course better ) in the form of SRFI - 26 , i.e. the cut and cute macros by Al Petrofsky .
Partial application : cut and cute Instead of spending too many words , let me show an example of how partial function application works both in Python and in Scheme .
Here is the Python version : >>> from functools import partial >>> from operator import add >>> add1 = partial ( add , 1 ) >>> add1(2 ) 3 and here is the Scheme version : > ( import ( srfi - 26 ) ) ; assuming it is available in your implementation > ( define add1 ( cut + 1 <> ) ) > ( add1 2 ) 3 In Python , partial ( add , 1 ) returns an unary callable object that adds 1 to its argument ; in Scheme , ( cut + 1 <> ) returns an unary function that does the same .
The Scheme version is better , since the arguments of the resulting functions are immediately vas visible as slots ( i.e. the <> symbol ) .
For instance > ( define greetings ( cut string - append " hello " <> " and " <> ) ) has two slots and therefore is a function of two arguments : > ( greetings " Michele " " Mario " ) " hello Michele and Mario "
It is also possible to define a variable number of arguments by using the rest - slot symbol <...> : >
( define greetings ( cut string - append " hello " <> " and " <...> ) ) > ( display ( greetings " Michele " " Mario " "
" ) ) hello Michele and Mario
We can even use a slot for the function : for instance , the higher order function apply could be implemented as ( cut <> <...>) .
Moreover , there is a cute macro which acts exactly as cut , with a single difference : the arguments in cute are evalued only once ( the e stands for evalued ) , whereas cut is not safe against multiple evaluation .
In particular , if you define > ( define add - result ( cute + ( long - computation ) <> ) ) then add - result performs the long computation only once , at definition time , and not every time it is called .
For more details I refer you the SRFI - 26 specification .
fold - left and fold - right A couple of commonly used higher order functions in Scheme and other functional languages are fold - left and fold - right .
They entered in the R6RS standard , but they are also available from SRFI - 1 , therefore you can leverage on them even if you are using an R5RS Scheme .
fold - left and fold - right will remind Pythonistas of reduce , which is also a folding function .
However , it is well known that Guido dislikes it and nowadays reduce is no more a builtin ( in Python 3.0 ) ; it is still available in the functools module , though .
For some reason ( probabily the order of the arguments which I cannot remember ) I cannot use reduce in Python , whereas I have less problems with fold - left e fold - right in Scheme and other functional languages .
fold - left and fold - right have a nearly identical API : both allow to traverse a list by accumulating values and by returning at the end the final accumulator .
For instance , if you want to sum the values of list , here is an idiomatic solution in Scheme ( another one is ( apply + numbers - list ) : > ( fold - left + 0 ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) ; sum all elements starting from 0 ; fold - right works too 6
In general , the function in fold - left takes N + 1 arguments , where N is the number of lists you are looping over ( usually N = 1 ) and the leftmost argument is the accumulator .
The same is true for fold - right , but then the rightmost argument is the accumulator .
Notice that fold - left is quite different from fold - right , since they work in opposite order : > ( fold - left ( lambda ( acc el ) ( cons el acc ) ) '( ) ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) ( 3 2 1 ) > ( fold - right ( lambda ( el acc ) ( cons el acc ) ) '( ) ' ( 1 2 3 ) ) ( 1 2 3 ) In the first case fold - left loops from left to right ( the element 1 is the first to be consed , the element 2 is the second to be consed , and the element 3 is the last to be consed , so that the final result is ( cons 3 ( cons 2 ( cons 1 ' ( ) ) ) ) i.e. ( 3 2 1 ) ) whereas in the second case fold - right loops from right to left .
In order to give an example of use , here is how you could define a flattening procedure by using fold - right : ( define ( flatten lst ) ( fold - right ( lambda ( x a ) ( if ( list ? x ) ( append ( flatten x ) a ) ( cons x a ) ) ) '( ) lst ) )
You can check that it works with a few tests : ( test " flatten null " ( flatten '( ) ) '( ) ) ( test " flatten plain " ( flatten ' ( a b c ) ) ' ( a b c ) ) ( test " flatten nested " ( flatten '( ( a b ) ( c ( d e ) f ) ) ) '( a b c d e f ) )
Here is another example , a function to remove duplicates from a list : ;; ex : ( remove - dupl = ' ( 1 2 3 1 5 2 4 ) ) => ( 1 2 3 5 4 ) ( define ( remove - dupl eq ? lst ) ( reverse ( fold - left ( lambda ( acc el ) ( if ( exists ( cut eq ? <> el ) acc ) ; duplicate acc ( cons el acc ) ) ) '( ) lst ) ) )
Notice the use of cut to define an unary function ( cut eq ? <> el ) which checks if its argument is equal - according to the provided equality function - to a given element el .
exists is one of the list processing utilities standardized by the R6RS document .
Here is a test : ( test " remove - dupl " ( remove - dupl equal ? '( 1 #f 2 #f 3 ) ) '( 1 #f 2 3 ) )
Having first class functions in a language means much more than having map , filter or fold .
Perhaps in the future I will add another episode about advanced usage of functions , such a parsing combinators or formatting combinators ; for the moment what I said here should be enough , and the next episode will be devoted to another typical feature of functional languages : pattern matching .

Rare , Storied Pink Iguana Discovered
Just in time to deem it endangered , scientists discover an elusive new species of iguana on the Galapagos
Nouriel Roubini , the New York University professor who predicted the global credit crisis , said a government - backed bank '' may crack ' ' as officials try to bail out their financial systems .
'' The process of socializing the private losses from this crisis has already moved many of the liabilities of the private sector onto the books of the sovereign , '' Roubini wrote on his Web site today .
'' At some point a sovereign bank may crack , in which case the ability of the governments to credibly commit to act as a backstop for the financial system -- including deposit guarantees -- could come unglued . ''
Roubini did n't identify any sovereign bank that might run into difficulty .
He also said he sees a 30 % chance of an '' L - shaped near - depression ' ' without '' appropriate and aggressive policy action ' ' by the US and other major economies to prevent a sovereign bank 's failure .
The latest data indicate fourth - quarter gross domestic product in key economies including the US , the euro zone and Japan may be worse than initially reported .
'' The global economy is now literally in free fall as the contraction of consumption , capital spending , residential investment , production employment , exports and imports is accelerating rather than decelerating , '' Roubini said .
The protracted downturn Roubini warned of can only be prevented by ``a strong , aggressive , coherent and credible combination of monetary easing ( traditional and unorthodox ) , fiscal stimulus , proper clean - up of the financial system and reduction of the debt burden of insolvent private agents ( households and non-financial companies ) , '' he said .

Grapefruit is a library for Functional Reactive Programming ( FRP ) with a focus on user interfaces .
FRP makes it possible to implement reactive and interactive systems in a declarative style .
To learn more about FRP , have a look at http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming.
This package contains general user interface support .
To make use of it , it has to be complemented by a UI backend .
It is possible to have different UI backends implementing the same general interface on top of different UI toolkits .
At the moment , the only backend is one based on GTK +.
This is provided by the grapefruit - ui - gtk package .

The action today revolved around several issues :
•IFPI 's Peter Danowsky noted that the damages levied against the Pirate Bay are the equivalent of legally obtained licenses to distribute the music world - wide .
In the case of artists like the Beatles who do not distribute music online , the damages are 10 x the amount of other artists .
Danowsky refutes claims that The Pirate Bay does not have any money to pay these damages .
Once again , the defense claimed the money is n't there .

• Sony claimed that TPB never removes torrents at the copyright holder 's request ( even though they have the ability to do so ) and they even go so far as to mock the companies for complaining .
• Damages for infringements that occurred before the official launch of the media ( as it did with Prison Break ) should be calculated as the cost of a special " global preview license . "
• The defense called for an acquittal for their clients on all charges .
• The defense claims that the users have control of the content on TBP , not their clients .
That 's when Carl Lundström 's lawyer , Per E Samuelsson laid down the King Kong defense :
" EU directive 2000/31 / EG says that he who provides an information service is not responsible for the information that is being transferred .
In order to be responsible , the service provider must initiate the transfer .
But the admins of The Pirate Bay do n't initiate transfers .
It 's the users that do and they are physically identifiable people .
They call themselves names like King Kong , " Samuelsson told the court .
" According to legal procedure , the accusations must be against an individual and there must be a close tie between the perpetrators of a crime and those who are assisting .
This tie has not been shown .
The prosecutor must show that Carl Lundström personally has interacted with the user King Kong , who may very well be found in the jungles of Cambodia , " the lawyer added .

• By accident , both the Pirate Bay defendants and the prosecution ended up dining at the same Italian restaurant at lunch .
Will the King Kong defense have an impact ?
Stay tuned — there are still 10 days left in the trial .

LEEDS , England , Jan. 24 ( UPI ) -- A 61 - year - old British man must pay for the government clean - up of his home , in which 17 truckloads of hoarded rubbish was hauled away , a court says .
It took that many skips , or dumpsters , to hold all the trash removed from the Leeds , England , home of Anthony Cockerham , The Daily Telegraph reported .
Leeds County Court Friday ordered him to pay up to $ 55,000 for the work and legal fees from a long court battle to enter the home , the newspaper said .

Cockerham had refused to allow officials to enter the residence , but when a warrant was finally obtained , city workers said they " found the rooms stuffed from floor to ceiling with possessions , bin bags full of rubbish and old newspapers . "
The state of the home was discovered after a neighbor complained about a rat infestation in 2005 , the Telegraph said .
" You may say an Englishman 's home is his castle but when public health is at stake we have to take measures to protect people , " said Steve Smith , the Leeds City Council 's executive board member for environmental services .

Pelosi Does About - Face on Bush Prosecution
by Ralph Lopez
In a startling reversal on Fox News Sunday , Nancy “ impeachment - is - off - the - table ” Pelosi said the law might compel Democrats to press forth on some prosecutions , even if they are politically unpopular , adding : “ That ’s not up to us to say that does n’t matter anymore . ”
Of Bush administration crimes Pelosi questioned “ do we even have a right to ignore it . ”
In recent weeks the passion of the public for holding the Bush administration accountable has taken the party by surprise , as the question on Obama ’s Change.gov website which had the most votes as a priority involved the appointment of a special prosecutor .
The Bush administration has acknowledged authorizing torture ,
which , because many prisoners in Guantanamo were known to have been swept up because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time , may have been practiced on innocent persons .
The Bush administration also withdrew the case of Jose Padilla , in which an American citizen was tortured for 3 1 / 2 years before being granted a trial , before the constitutionality of Padilla ’s treatment could be decided by the Supreme Court .
Had the constitutionality of Padilla ’s “ enemy combatant ” status been struck down , the administration might have been open to charges of kidnap and torture .
Already well - known are Bush ’s frequent admission of authorizing illegal spying , which is what brought Nixon ’s downfall .

In other news , members of the National Impeachment Network have issued a list of demands to Obama for the relinquishing of unconstitutional executive powers .
The Constitution Agenda includes :
Ask the Supreme Court to review the Military Commission Act for Constitutionality , and act to repeal it .
The MCA allows Americans to be tried by military tribunal , rather than a civilian jury trial as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment .

Act to repeal .
Signal intention to roll back Warrantless surveillance .
Overturn The Executive Order entitled “ Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq ” which criminalizes anti-war protesters and provides the President with the authority to confiscate the assets of whoever opposes the US led war .

The “ factual situation ” of an open - ended , infinite war horizon is qualitatively different from war against a nation - state , which is what the Quirin decision applied to .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s crucial victory in getting a $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan through Congress was achieved quickly , but his hopes of gaining a bipartisan consensus died an early death .
The bitter Washington debate over the stimulus plan , which the majority Democrats muscled through both chambers despite nearly unified Republican opposition , has political consequences that boil down to one question :
Will it work ?
If it has the desired effect of creating or saving up to 4 million jobs and kick - starting the economy , the package will be judged a smart move akin to President Bill Clinton ’s economic plan that was hotly debated back in 1993 .
Clinton ’s decision to raise taxes to balance the budget was seen as the foundation of the U.S. economic boom of the 1990s .
If it does not , opposition Republicans will be able to argue that Obama should give more consideration to their ideas , which focused on tax cuts .
A lack of an economic rebound will provide fodder they ’ll use against the Democrats in the 2010 mid-term elections .
“ If this works and Obama , through a combination of this and other things , turns the economy around , then Republicans will pay a price , ” Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said .
“ If he does n’t turn the economy around then they ’ll be able to say , ‘ I told you so . ’ ”
Obama argued that Democrats allowed plenty of time to debate the package , but that with the economy needing swift attention , it was time to move on .
“ We had a spirited debate about this plan over the last few weeks , ” he said on Friday .
“ Not everyone shared the same view of how we should move forward , and at times , our discussion was contentious .
But that ’s a good thing . ”
Obama will sign the stimulus bill into law on Tuesday .
The stimulus victory was the achievement in what has been a stormy start for Obama , who as the package was being negotiated , had to deal with an uproar over the tax problems of several top choices for administration posts .
Then his choice for commerce secretary , Republican Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , abruptly withdrew from consideration -- further blunting his bid for bipartisanship .
BLUNT POLITICAL STRENGTH
Republicans were left fuming , complaining that the stimulus package was more of a giant wish - list of unnecessary Democratic spending items instead of what they would have preferred , a slimmed - down version focusing on tax cuts and spending for roads , bridges and other infrastructure projects .
“ They ( Democrats ) have with blunt political strength and in the guise of stimulating the economy pushed through their own political priorities , not those of the American people , ” said Arizona Republican Senator John McCain .
Republican pollster Whit Ayres said Republicans were on solid ground opposing the package .
“ Voting for a bill that is loaded up with an enormous amount of wasteful spending is never a good idea for Republicans , ” he said .
Republican strategist Scott Reed said the party ’s strategy has been wise , “ because it ’s united the party against something that the country , according to polls , does n’t support .
“ The key next step for Republicans is to come forward with some positive alternatives to Obama ’s policies , ” he said .
Other experts were not so sure the Republicans were playing their cards correctly by opposing the stimulus plan , given the grim state of the economy .
Pollster John Zogby said Obama ’s popularity means he has far more credibility than the Republicans .
“ The thing is , he is the president and he ’s still on a honeymoon and he ’s talking bipartisanship .
The Republicans do n’t have a credible enough voice or face right now to project where they ’re at , ” Zogby said .
He said Republicans could face the same situation as Democrats did two years ago when Democrats opposed President George W. Bush ’s surge of fresh troops into Iraq , a policy they were forced much later to admit had succeeded .
“ For Republicans this may be the wrong time and the wrong issue for them to rediscover ideological purity , ” he said .
How quickly the economy can be stimulated will be of utmost importance in the months ahead .
William Galston , an economist at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Clinton White House , said his best estimate was that the stimulus would create upward of 2.5 million jobs .
“ Economists of all stripes , it seems to me , are in agreement that it will be a net job generator , ” he said .

C++ implementation of the C# Property and Indexer with Accessor - Modifiers
Introduction
What this article presents is implementing in C++ the C# functionality for both Property and Indexer and controlling their compile - time accessibility using accessor - modifiers .
The provided source code contains a generic framework for performing both Property and Indexer in C ++.
The only thing that the user of this framework needs to implement is an Accessor functor , which requires set and get accessor functions .
The framework provides pre-defined properties , each with different accessibility options , which will wrap around the user - defined Accessor functor .
Thereby , to declare a property within a Host class is simply choosing a property based upon expected accessibility and assigning it with an Accessor .
Properties are known as smart fields , and enable access to member variables of a class , but maintains encapsulation by implicit access to its set and get accessors .
Indexers are also called smart arrays in C# , and can be used to use an object as an array .
Similar to C# Properties , the subscript ( [ ] ) operator has access to its own set and get accessors .
Doxygen generated source code is available here : Documentation .
Background
My programming lingua franca has been C++ for quite a while , and thereby it is my foundation for other programming languages like Java and C# .
Every time I see some feature with these other languages , I am curious enough to query if that feature could be implemented in C++. C# Properties and Indexers is a case in point .
In CodeProject , I have read several articles on C++ implementation of C# Property , and none pertaining to C# Indexer .
However , I did not find an article that provided compile - time check of declared accessibility of a Property 's field .
The code presented in this article provides Property and Indexer functionality in C++ , including compile - time check of declared accessibility of the assigned accessor - modifier for set and get accessors .
C++ Property Layout
Collaboration Model
In this C++ implementation of C# Property , there are three components :
Accessor defines how values are managed by the set or get accessor member functions .
The value can either reside within the scope of the Accessor or within the scope of its friend Host .
Property is a container of a single reference to an Accessor , and it defines the access scope ( public or private ) to the Accessor 's set and get member functions through its access functions ( i.e. , assignment and cast operators ) .
Host is a container which may reference one or more Properties .
Host is a friend of both Property and Accessor .
The purpose of this friendship is if either of the Property access functions ( i.e. , assignment and cast operators ) are declared private to those outside the scope of the Host class , the Host can still access the value within its internal scope , directly through its referenced Property , or indirectly through the Property 's referenced Accessor .
Call Model
Listed here is the call model of this C++ implementation , from assigning to acquiring values through a C# Property .
Value assignments to a Property field are performed through its assignment operator .
If the access - modifier for this operator is public , then any entity outside the scope of the Host class can make the property 's value assignments .
, then any entity outside the scope of the Host class can make the property 's value assignments .
If the access - modifier for this operator is private , then only the Host can make the property 's value assignments .
All Property value assignments are passed to the Accessor 's public set member function .
The set accessor passes the value to any assigned resource .
The assigned resource can either be within the scope of the Accessor or within the scope of its friend Host .
Value retrievals from a property field are performed through a cast operator .
If the access - modifier for this operator is public , then any entity outside the scope of the Host class can request the property 's value .
, then any entity outside the scope of the Host class can request the property 's value .
If the access - modifier for this operator is private , then only the Host can request the property 's value .
All Property value requests are passed to the Accessor 's public get member function .
The get accessor requests a value from any assigned resource .
As with the set accessor , the assigned resource can either be within the scope of the Accessor or within the scope of its friend Host .
Accessor Interface and Base Classes
Every Accessor for a property must define the following functions :
A get property accessor is used to return the property value .
property accessor is used to return the property value .
A set property accessor is used to assign a new value .
The interface IAccessor defines the expected accessor functions , and the abstract base class AccessorBase holds the ValueType value shared by the accessor functions .
template < class Host , typename ValueType > class IAccessor { public : virtual void set ( Host* , const ValueType ) = 0 ; virtual ValueType get ( Host * ) const = 0 ; } ; template < class Host , typename ValueType > class AccessorBase : public IAccessor < Host , ValueType > { public : typedef ValueType value_type ; } ;
Accessor Implementation Example
The class Number_Accessor is a derivation of the AccessorBase class , and has a ValueType of int .
In this example implementation , the value reference for the set and get accessors is within the scope of this class : private int m_value .
template < class Host > class Number_Accessor : public AccessorBase < Host , int > { friend Host ; public : void set ( Host * , const int _value ) { m_value = _value ; } int get ( Host * ) const { return m_value ; } private : int m_value ; } ;
Property Interface and Base Class
The abstract class PropertyBase holds an instance of the Accessor container .
PropertyBase is abstract because it does not hold implementations of its derived interface IProperty .
template < typename ValueType > class IProperty { virtual ValueType operator =( const ValueType& value ) = 0 ; virtual operator ValueType ( ) const = 0 ; } ; template < class Host , class Accessor , typename ValueType > class PropertyBase : public IProperty < ValueType > { public : PropertyBase ( Host *_ pHost ) : m_pHost ( _pHost ) {} ValueType operator =( const ValueType& _value ) { m_Accessor.set ( m_pHost , _value ) ; return _value ; } operator ValueType ( ) const { return m_Accessor.get ( m_pHost ) ; } protected : Host * m_pHost ; Accessor m_Accessor ; } ;
Properties with Different Access Modifiers
There are three different Property classes , and each has a different arrangement of access - modifiers to their setter and getter functions :
Property : setter and getter functionality are both public .
Property_Set_Public : setter is public and getter is private .
Property_Get_Public : setter is private and getter is public .
Notice that the access modifiers for the accessor methods of the class Property are both public :
template < class Host , class Accessor , typename ValueType > class Property : public PropertyBase < Host , Accessor , ValueType > { public : Property ( Host *_pHost = NULL ) : PropertyBase ( _pHost ) {} public : using PropertyBase < Host , Accessor , ValueType > : : operator = ; public : using PropertyBase < Host , Accessor , ValueType > : : operator ValueType ; } ;
Host Using C++ Property Implementation
Understand that the purpose of the article is to provide a generic toolkit ( a framework ) for performing a Property within a C++ class , the only thing that the user needs to implement an Accessor .
Define Accessor
To define an Accessor , derive a class from AccessorBase and implement the expected set and get accessor functions .
Here , an accessor Number_Accessor is derived from TAccessor , which encapsulates the scope of the accessor 's value of type int within .
template < class Host , typename ValueType > struct TAccessor : public AccessorBase < Host , ValueType > { void set ( Host * , const ValueType _value ) { m_value = _value ; } ValueType get ( Host * ) const { return m_value ; } protected : ValueType m_value ; } ; template < class Host > struct Number_Accessor : public TAccessor < Host , int > {} ;
Define Properties for Host
Within a
Host class , each property is defined ( typedef ) with its expected accessibility and accessor .
To define a Property within this framework , select one of these Property classes based upon the accessibility needs : Property , Property_Set_Public , or Property_Get_Public , and assign it the expected Accessor it will represent .
In the following coding example , the class Test has defined three different Properties ( each with a different accessibility scope ) and all using the same accessor Number_Accessor .
class
Test { typedef :: Property < :: Test , ::Number_Accessor<:: Test > , ::Number_Accessor<:: Test>::value_type > Property_Number ; typedef ::Property_Set_Public< :: Test , ::Number_Accessor<:: Test > , ::Number_Accessor<:: Test>::value_type > Property_Set_Public_Number ; typedef ::Property_Get_Public< :: Test , ::Number_Accessor<:: Test > , ::Number_Accessor<:: Test>::value_type > Property_Get_Public_Number ; public : Property_Number Number_A ; Property_Set_Public_Number Number_B ; Property_Get_Public_Number Number_C ; } ;
Using Host with Properties
When actually using the just implemented class Test , at compile - time , you can see the setters and getters of each of the three properties ( Number_A , Number_B , and Number_C ) which are accessible outside the scope of their Host class .
Referencing the following code , notice where the compile - time errors are occurring for each of the restrictive access Properties .
void main ( ) { :: Test test ; int i = 0 ; { test .
Number_A = 10 ; i = test .
Number_A ; } { test .
Number_B = 10 ; } { i = test .
Number_C ; } }
C++ Indexer Layout
Collaboration Model
In this C++ implementation of the C# Indexer , there are three components for providing accessor functionality through a Host 's subscript operator .
IndexerAccessor is the same as a Property 's Accessor , except the set and get accessors are passed the index value provided though the called subscript operator .
Indexer is the same as a Property .
Host may define at most one subscript operator .
When a Host 's subscript operator is used , it passes out an instance of a derived Indexer .
Depending upon the usage of the subscript operator , assigning values is performed by the Indexer 's assignment operator , and acquiring values is performed by the Indexer 's cast operator .
Call Model
The call model for the C++ implementation of a C# Indexer is essentially the same as the C# Property , except the Host 's subscript operator usage is made indirectly through an instance of a derived Indexer .
What is occurring is that the Indexer is being used as a functor , i.e. , simply any object that is called as if it is a function providing access to the Accessor .
IndexerAccessor Interface and Base Classes
The only difference between the interface IIndexerAccessor and the interface IAccessor is that the set and get accessor member functions require an additional parameter ( index ) which is provided upon usage of the Host 's subscript operator .
template < class Host , typename ValueType > class IIndexerAccessor { public : virtual void set ( Host* , const int _index , const ValueType ) = 0 ; virtual ValueType get ( Host* , const int _index ) const = 0 ; } ; template < class Host , typename ValueType > class IndexerAccessorBase : public IIndexerAccessor < Host , ValueType > { public : typedef ValueType value_type ; } ;
IndexerAccessor Implementation Example
The class Number_Indexer_Accessor is a derivation of the class IndexerAccessorBase , and has a ValueType of int .
In this example implementation , the value reference for the set and get accessors is not within the scope of this class but within the scope of its Host : private int * m_ptrArray .
template < class Host > class Numbers_Indexer_Accessor : public IndexerAccessorBase < Host , int > { friend Host ; public : void set ( Host * _pHost , const int _index , const int _value ) { _pHost-> m_ptrArray[ _index ] = _value ; } int get ( Host * _pHost , const int _index ) const { return _pHost -> m_ptrArray[ _index ] ; } } ;
Indexers Interface and Base Class
The abstract class IndexerBase holds an instance the IndexerAccessor container .
IndexerBase is abstract because it does not hold implementations of its derived interface IIndexer .
Indexers with Different Access Modifiers
As with Properties , there are three different Indexers , and each has a different arrangement of access - modifiers to their setter and getter functions :
Inderer : setter and getter functionality are both public .
Indexer_Set_Public : setter is public and getter is private .
Indexer_Get_Public : setter is private and getter is public .
Notice that the access modifiers for the accessor methods of the class Indexer are both public :
template < class Host , class IndexAccessor , typename ValueType > class Indexer : public IndexerBase < Host , IndexAccessor , ValueType > { public : Indexer ( Host *_pHost , int _index = 0 ) : IndexerBase ( _pHost , _index ) {} public : using IndexerBase < Host , IndexAccessor , ValueType > : : operator = ; public : using IndexerBase < Host , IndexAccessor , ValueType > : : operator ValueType ; } ;
Host Using the C++ Indexer Implementation
This is a simple example using the class Indexer with the previously implemented IndexAccessor labeled Numbers_Indexer_Accessor .
Host 's Subscript Operator and Indexer
The class Host_Numbers_Indexer defines an Indexer using a Numbers_Indexer_Accessor labeled Number_Indexer .
Every time the Host 's subscript operator is called ( for either assigning or acquiring values ) , an instance of Numbers_Indexer is provided , and acts as a functor for setter and getter operations .
And most importantly , notice in particular what is returned from the subscript operator of Host_Number_Indexer ; which is an Indexer derived Numbers_Indexer .
class Host_Numbers_Indexer { friend ::Numbers_Indexer_Accessor<::Host_Numbers_Indexer > ; friend ostream &operator <<( ostream & , const Host_Numbers_Indexer & ) ; typedef :: Indexer < ::Host_Numbers_Indexer , ::Numbers_Indexer_Accessor<::Host_Numbers_Indexer > , ::Numbers_Indexer_Accessor<::Host_Numbers_Indexer>::value_type >
Numbers_Indexer ; public : Host_Numbers_Indexer ( int _sizeArray = 10 ) { m_sizeArray = ( _sizeArray > 0 ?
_sizeArray : 10 ) ; m_ptrArray = new int [ m_sizeArray ] ; assert ( m_ptrArray != 0 ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < static_cast < int >( m_sizeArray ) ; i++ ) { m_ptrArray [ i ] = i ; } } Host_Numbers_Indexer:: Numbers_Indexer operator [ ] ( int _index ) { return Numbers_Indexer ( this , _index ) ; } private : int * m_ptrArray ; size_t m_sizeArray ; } ;
Using the Host 's Indexer through the Subscript Operator
Referring to the following code , upon creating an instance of the class Host_Numbers_Indexer , it populates a private array with ten integers .
The initial contents of this array are dumped .
Then , through the Host 's subscript operator , the Indexer passes in the integer 30 into the sixth position of the array through the IndexAccessor , and then reads it back .
The modified contents of this array are dumped again .
Host_Numbers_Indexer test ; cout << " Before input : " << endl << " test : " << endl << test << endl ; test [ 5 ] = 30 ; cout << test [ 5 ] << endl ; cout << " After input : " << endl << " test : " << endl << test << endl ;
Output
This is the console output of the aforementioned code .
Before input : test : 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 30 After input : test : 0 1 4 9 16 30 36 49 64 81
Conclusion
By reverse engineering the C# Property and Indexer , I have gained an even greater appreciation in the flexibility that C++ provides .
Although it maybe very straightforward to use these features in C# , I found this exercise in putting together this code in C++ very engaging .
Black squares are replacing colourful icons all over Twitter and other social network sites as part of a protest against New Zealand government proposals for internet regulation
Just when everybody decided to start using the microblogging service Twitter , things have taken a distinctly dark turn .
All across the site , people 's icons have started disappearing – their colourful avatars replaced , instead , with simple black squares almost everywhere .
And it 's not just on Twitter : similar blackouts are taking place across Facebook , MySpace , Bebo and elsewhere too .
It turns out that this is n't the result of a malicious hacker or even a random technical fault .
Nor have these icons and photos been whisked away by aliens in some sort of avatar - snatching heist .
Instead the so - called " internet blackout " is part of a political protest against a law that has outraged internet campaigners in New Zealand .
The law in question is Section 92a , an amendment to the country 's copyright law that is due to come into force at the end of February .
It [ ] tells internet service providers that they " must adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides for termination " of accounts used by anyone deemed a " repeat infringer " – regardless of whether the person has been convicted of a crime or not .
Proponents say Section 92a is necessary to keep a lid on the problem of illegal downloading and copyright infringement online .
Critics point out that it goes even further than the " three strikes " laws that have recently been under consideration in France and Britain – and that it eschews the burden of proof in favour of presuming guilt by association .
Plus , they say , somebody could end up shutting down the internet connection at a library , school or hospital by downloading illegally over their network .
" Under the new law , anyone who provides any form of services over the Internet is an ISP , " said Geekzone NZ .
" That means libraries , councils , schools , businesses , government offices , you name it .
If you share your Internet connection with your flatmates , you 're probably an ISP too under the new act . "
As part of the protest , New Zealand 's Creative Freedom Foundation is asking internet users to replace their photos and icons with blank spaces to give people an idea of what the internet could look like under the new regime .
Bronwyn Holloway - Smith , director of the CFF , says thousands of New Zealand musicians and artists have signed a petition against the law , and that the public needs to voice its frustration .
" While copyright infringement is a problem for artists , our petition shows that thousands of artists think that it is a greater problem for people not to get a trial , " she said .
" Treating fans as guilty until
proven innocent is n't what artists want done in their name , and many see that as being damaging to creative industries . "
Another pertinent question might be to wonder whether the internet blackout will have any effect .
After all , online action has a spotty record of success at best – just witness the vast numbers of toothless Facebook protest groups or Downing Street 's Petitions website for evidence .
But the CFF is using the blackout as one part of a wider campaign including petitions , parliamentary protests and writing to the government to complain .
Even though the blackout might not make a difference to ministers in Wellington , plenty of people are still joining in .
Arch - Twitterer Stephen Fry , who gave the campaign a huge boost when he posted about it earlier this week , suggested that taking part could be the only real way for some people to show support .
" It may not bring the NZ gov to their senses , " he posted .
" But can it hurt for them to learn of our outrage ? "
SAN FRANCISCO —
The Bush administration on Tuesday will try to convince a federal judge to let stand a law granting retroactive legal immunity to the nation 's telecoms , which are accused of transmitting Americans ' private communications to the National Security Agency without warrants .
At issue in the high - stakes showdown — set to begin at 10:00 a.m. PST — are the nearly four dozen lawsuits filed by civil liberties groups and class action attorneys against AT&T , Verizon , MCI , Sprint and other carriers who allegedly cooperated with the Bush administration 's domestic surveillance program in the years following the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
The lawsuits claim the cooperation violated federal wiretapping laws and the Constitution .
In July , as part of a wider domestic spying bill , Congress voted to kill the lawsuits and grant retroactive amnesty to any phone companies that helped with the surveillance ; President - elect Barack Obama was among those who voted for the law in the Senate .
On Tuesday , lawyers with the Electronic Frontier Foundation are set to urge the federal judge overseeing those lawsuits to reject immunity as unconstitutional .
At stake , they say , is the very principle of the rule of law in America .
" I think it does set a very frightening precedent that it 's okay for people to break the law because they can just have Congress bail them out later , " says EFF legal director Cindy Cohn .
" It 's very troubling . "
The judge presiding over the case , U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker of San Francisco , announced late Monday he wanted to discuss 11 questions ( .pdf ) at Tuesday 's hearing , one of which goes directly to the heart of the immunity legislation .
" Is there any precedent for this type of enactment that is analogous in all of these respects : retroactivity ; immunity for constitutional violations ; and delegation of broad discretion to the executive branch to determine whether to invoke the provision ? , " the judge asked .
Carl Tobias , a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law , says the immunity legislation , if upheld , " makes it possible to extend immunity to other areas of the law . "
He agreed , for example , that it would not be far - fetched to imagine Congress immunizing ExxonMobil for the 1989 Valdez oil spill " for national security reasons . "
A jury awarded about $ 5 billion in punitive damages in that case , an amount the courts reduced to $ 500 million .
In the telecom immunity challenge , the government argues that the telecoms should not be punished , or suffer the threat of punishment , for a surveillance program that the Bush administration claims was designed only to fight terrorism .
The government also denies the lawsuits ' allegations that the surveillance was a broad dragnet that sucked down Americans ' communications on a wholesale basis .
The administration also says the immunity is warranted because the lawsuits threaten to expose government secrets .
The EFF brought the original spying lawsuit in 2006 against AT&T , and has since been joined by dozens of others targeting the nation 's telecommunications companies .
The EFF 's case , which has been consolidated with the others in the U.S. District Court of San Francisco , includes so - called whistle - blower documents from a former AT&T technician .
The EFF claims the documents describe a secret room in an AT&T building in San Francisco that is wired to share raw internet traffic with the NSA .
The government sought to dismiss the original EFF case , and others that followed , on the grounds that they threatened to expose state secrets .
Judge Walker has ruled against the government , saying the case could proceed .
The government appealed .
But before the appeal was decided , Congress on July 9 gave the president the power to grant immunity to the carriers .
The EFF is now challenging the immunity legislation on the grounds that it seeks to circumvent the Constitution 's separation of powers clause , as well as Americans ' Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures .
" The legislation is an attempt to give the president the authority to terminate claims that the president has violated the people 's Fourth Amendment rights , " the EFF 's Cohn says .
" You ca n't do that . "
Two weeks ago , the administration told Walker in a court filing ( . pdf ) that the immunity legislation " represents the considered judgment of our nation 's political branches that , in the unique historical circumstances following the 9/11 attacks , telecommunications companies should not bear the burden of defending against claims that those companies assisted the government in its efforts to detect and prevent further terrorist attacks . "
Congress , the government continued , " concluded that those companies should not face further litigation if they provided such assistance pursuant to a court order or a written certification , directive or request from a senior government official , or did not provide the alleged assistance . "
The immunity law allows the government to file a classified brief with Judge Walker activating immunity for a particular communication company .
Walker then has little power to deny the request , unless the judge finds the immunity legislation is itself unconstitutional .
Oral arguments in Walker 's courtroom are scheduled for 10 a.m. PST on Tuesday .
Threat Level will cover the proceedings live .
Chia Seed - The Ancient Food of the Future By : William Anderson
In the last twenty five years , there has been a resurrection in the definition of medicine , a resurrection that amplifies the significance of our eating habits and our lifestyle .
Medicine is not only defined as a treatment for illness and disease , it is now understood to be for the prevention of illness and disease .
That would mean , for example , laughter is a medicine because research found it to boost the immune system .
Exercise is good medicine for its cardio - vascular stimulation , muscle toning and flexibility and expelling toxins and for giving you a feeling of well - being , all immune boosters .
To express a positive attitude towards life is not only good medicine for you , it is good medicine for those in contact with you .
But the most important medicine , especially for the prevention of illness and disease , is our diet .
It only needs our cooperation in supplying proper hydration and the needed nutrients to effectively maintain a state of well - being .
Research has revealed that more than two thirds of all deaths in the United States are diet related .
More than 50 % of all deaths are caused from coronary occlusion , blockage of the blood flow to the heart and / or the brain .
These are all preventable deaths according to the Journal of American Medical Association which published in 1961 that ,  All coronary occlusion can be eliminated by 97 % through a vegetarian diet . 
Fourteen hundred Americans are dying of cancer every day .
In the prestigious Advances in Cancer Research , they concluded ,  At present , we have overwhelming evidence ( that ) none of the risk factors for cancer is more significant than diet and nutrition . 
Because the question of what might be the optimum diet can , at times , be emotionally charged for many people , having had a significant emotional commitment in believing they know whats best , I would like to suspend the issues of diet and introduce you to a super food that all would agree on .
It is known as the Chia Seed .
Once valued so much that it was used as currency , this unique little seed has exceptional nutritive and structural benefits .
Chia , is familiar to most of us as a seed used for the novelty of the Chia Pet , clay animals with sprouted Chia seeds covering their bodies .
Little is known , however , of the seeds tremendous nutritional value and medicinal properties .
For centuries this tiny little seed was used as a staple food by the Indians of the south west and Mexico .
Known as the running food , its use as a high energy endurance food has been recorded as far back as the ancient Aztecs .
It was said the Aztec warriors subsisted on the Chia seed during the conquests .
The Indians of the south west would eat as little as a teaspoon full when going on a 24hr .
forced march .
Indians running form the Colorado River to the California coast to trade turquoise for seashells would only bring the Chia seed for their nourishment .
If you try missing a spoonful of Chia in a glass of water and leaving it for approximately 30 minutes or so , when you return the glass will appear to contain not seeds or water , but an almost solid gelatin .
This gel - forming reaction is due to the soluble fiber in the Chia .
Research believe this same gel - forming phenomenon takes place in the stomach when food containing these gummy fibers , known as mucilages , are eaten .
The gel that is formed in the stomach creates a physical barrier between carbohydrates and the digestive enzymes that break them down , thus slowing the conversion of carbohydrates into sugar .
In addition to the obvious benefits for diabetics , this slowing in the conversion of carbohydrates into sugar offers the ability for creating endurance .
Carbohydrates are the fuel for energy in our bodies .
Prolonging their conversion into sugar stabilizes metabolic changes , diminishing the surges of highs and lows creating a longer duration in their fueling effects .
One of the exceptional qualities of the Chia seed is its hydrophilic properties , having the ability to absorb more than 12 times its weigh in water .
Its ability to hold on to water offers the ability to prolong hydration .
Fluids and electrolytes provide the environment that supports the life of all the bodys cells .
Their concentration and composition are regulated to remain as constant as possible .
With Chia seeds , you retain moisture , regulate , more efficiently , the bodies absorption of nutrients and body fluids .
Because there is a greater efficiency in the utilization of body fluids , the electrolyte balance is maintained .
Example : Fluid and electrolyte imbalances occur when large amounts of fluids are lost resulting from vomiting , diarrhea , high fever , or more commonly from sweating ?
The loss of extracellular fluid occurs in these conditions .
Intercellular fluid then shifts out of cells to compensate , causing abnormal distribution of electrolytes across cell membranes resulting in cellular malfunction .
So .
Retaining and efficiently utilizing body fluids maintains the integrity of extracellular fluids , protecting intercellular fluid balance .
The results of which ensure normal electrolyte dispersion across cell membranes ( electrolyte balance ) , maintaining fluid balances , resulting in normal cellular function .
Chia seeds are the definitive hydrophilic colloid for the 21 century diet .
Hydrophilic colloids , ( a watery , gelatinous , glue - like substance ) form the underlying elements of all living cells .
They posses the property of readily taking up and giving off the substances essential to cell life .
The precipitation of the hydrophilic colloids cause cell death .
The food we eat , in the raw state , consist largely of hydrophilic colloids .
When cooked on the other had , precipitates its colloidal integrity .
This change in the colloidal state alters the hydration capacity of our foods so as to interfere with their ability to absorb digestive juices .
If we were to eat a raw diet we wouldnt need to introduce the addition of any hydrophilic colloid to our diet .
Uncooked foods contain sufficient hydrophilic colloid to keep gastric mucosa in the proper condition .
But even with raw foods , they must first be partially broken down by the digestive juices , beginning in the mouth and continuing through he upper tract , to allow the gelatinous reaction to take place .
Because of this upper tract digestive process , those who suffer from slow digestion , gas formation , relaxed cardia and heartburn in which the burning is due to organic acids instead of an excess of the normal hydrochloric acid , which frequently accompanies chronic inflammation disease affecting such organs as the heart , lungs , gall bladder and appendix , are usually restricted from eating raw foods .
A hydrophilic colloid incorporated with these foods may be used either in connection with the patients regular food or with whatever diet the physician feels is best suited for his patient .
The patient with gastric atony or nervous indigestion who complains of heartburn and / or vomiting four to five hours after eating is often helped .
There is a lessening of emptying time if the stomach and an improvement in gastric tone .
A strict dietary regimen is at as necessary when the hydrophilic .
Chia seed may be used in conjunction with almost any diet your doctor or nutritionist feels is necessary for your condition .
The Chias hydrophilic colloidal properties aid the digestion of any foods contributing to the patients suffering as a result of a sour stomach .
Even if you have sensitivity to certain foods , they may be tolerated with slight discomfort or none at all if a hydrophilic colloid is made a part of your diet .
The positive effects on the digestion in the upper portion of the gastrointestinal tract often leads to puree their foods may find benefits from hydrophilic colloids which may lead to eliminating the necessity for pureeing .
Even raw vegetables , green salads and fruits , which are largely restricted , may often be given to these patients with little or no discomfort after a short time .
There are several hydrophilic foods available that offer these natural benefits .
Cactus juice , beet juice , agar , the edible seaweeds , and many proprietary preparations , which include the silica gels , mucilaginous substance of vegetables origin , are among colloids that prove effective .
Each one of the above mentioned substances have one or more drawbacks .
They are either too expensive , they may produce toxic side effects , bad tasting , not readily available , insufficient hydration capability , or it is indigestible .
Chia seed , a muscle and tissue builder and an energizer of endurance with extensive hydration properties , possesses none of the above disadvantage , and because if its physiochemical properties , supports effective treatment in immediate problems of digestion .
Exactly why this should be true may be puzzling at first .
However , if we consider the effect of unusual irritation upon the nerves of the gastrointestinal canal , it is reasonable the think that a less violent and more balanced digestion might quiet the activity of the otherwise hyperactive gut .
Inasmuch as the same foods , which formerly produced irritation , may frequently be continued without harm when hydrophilic colloids are used .
The relief to nerve irritation seems to offer a logical explanation .
The change , in the lower gastrointestinal tract , is due to the effect of the hydrophilic colloid and to a more complete digestion - taking place along the entire tract due to physiochemical alterations .
Both factors are important , as there is undoubtedly a better assimilation of food that supports enhanced nutritional absorption while significantly extending necessary hydration as well as encouraging proper elimination .
As a source of protein , the Chia , after ingestion , is digested and absorbed very easily .
This results in rapid transport to the tissue and utilization by the cells .
This efficient assimilation makes the Chia very effective when rapid development of tissue takes place , primarily during growth periods if children and adolescents .
Also for the growth and regeneration of tissue during pregnancy and lactation , and this would also include regeneration of muscle tissue for conditioning , athletes , weight lifters , etc .
Another unique quality if the Chia seed is its high oil content , and the richest vegetables source for the essential omega - 3 fatty acid .
It has approximately three to ten times the oil concentrations of most grains and one and a half to two times the protein concentrations of other grains .
These oils , unsaturated fatty acids , are the essential oils your body needs to help emulsify and absorb the fat soluble vitamins , A , D , E , & K .
Chia seeds are rich in the unsaturated fatty acid , linoleic , which the body cannot manufacture .
When there are rich amounts of linoleic acid sufficiently supplied to the body trough diet , linoleic and arachidonic acids can be synthesized from linoleic acid .
Unsaturated fatty acids are important for respiration of vital organs and make it easier for oxygen to be transported by the blood stream to all cells , tissues , and organs .
They also help maintain resilience and lubrication of all cells and combine with protein and cholesterol to form living membranes that hold the body cells together .
Unsaturated fatty acids are essential for normal glandular activity , especially of the adrenal glands and the thyroid glad .
They nourish the skin cells and are essential for healthy mucus membranes and nerves .
The unsaturated fatty acids function in the body by cooperating with vitamin D in making calcium available to the tissues , assisting in the assimilation of phosphorus , and stimulating the conversion of carotene into vitamin A . Fatty acids are related to normal functioning of the reproductive system .
Chia sees contain beneficial long - chain triglycerides ( LCT ) in the right proportion to reduce cholesterol on arterial walls .
The Chia seed is also a rich source of calcium as it contains the important mineral boron , which acts as catalyst for the absorption and utilization of the calcium by the body .
Chia , as an ingredient , is a dieters dream food .
There are limitless ways to incorporate the Chia seed into your diet .
Chia must be prepared with pure water before using recipes .
The seed will absorb 9 times its weight in water in less than 10 minutes and is very simple to prepare .
Food Extender / Calorie Displacer :
The optimum ratio of water to seed , for most recipes , is 9 part water to 1 part seed .
One pound if seed will make 10 pounds of Chia gel .
This is the most unique structural quality of the Chia seed .
The seeds hydrophilic ( water absorbing ) saturated cells hold the water , so when it is mixed with foods , it displaces calories and fat without diluting flavor .
In fact , I have found that because Chia gel displaces rather than dilutes , it creates more surface area and can actually enhance the flavor rather than dilute it .
Chia gel also works as a fat replacer for many recipes .
Making Chia Gel ( 9to1 ratio ) :
Put water in a sealable plastic container and slowly pour seed into water while briskly mixing with a wire whisk .
This process will avoid any clumping of the seed .
Wait a couple of minutes , whisk again and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes .
Whisk again before using or storing in refrigerator ( Gel will keep up to 2 weeks ) .
You can add this mix to jams , jellies , hot or cold cereals , yogurts , mustard , catsup , tarter sauce , BBQ sauce , etc. .
Add the gel , between 50 % to 75 % by volume , to any of the non - bake mentioned foods , mix well and taste .
You will notice a very smooth texture with the integrity of the flavour intact .
In addition to adding up to 50 % to 75 % more volume to the foods used , you have displaced calories and fat by incorporating an ingredient that is 90 % water .
Use as a fat replacer , for energy and endurance , or for added great taste , buy substituting the oil in your breads with Chia gel .
Top your favorite bread dough before baking with Chia gel ( for toping on baked goods , breads , cookies , piecrust , etc. , reduce the water ration to 8 parts water to 1 part Chia seed ) for added shelf life .
There are additional benefits from the Chia seed aside from the nutritive enhancements when used as an ingredient .
It was also used by the Indians and missionaries as a poultice for gunshot wounds and other serious injuries .
They would pack the wounds with Chia seeds to avoid infections and promote haling .
If you place a seed or two in your eyes it will clean your eyes and will also help to clear up any infections .
There is a wealth of benefits beyond the information outlined in this article and treasure - trove of benefits yet to be discovered .
Chia seed , having a qualitatively unique situational richness along with a profound nutritive profile is one of mans most useful and beneficial foods and is destined to be the Ancient Food of the Future .
" There is Truth in the information outlined in this article .
Truth flows with the fluidity and ease as the valleys river .
Each drop , as with each word flows as the river in the Truth that reaches to and becomes the ocean .

“ SOCIAL warming has joined global warming as our biggest challenge , ” Alvaro Rodriguez , a Mexican businessman and social entrepreneur , told a group of Davos men and women at last week 's World Economic Forum ( WEF ) .
They did n't need much convincing : while they brainstormed in the Swiss mountains , strikes and riots convulsed the world .
There was plenty of enthusiasm , too , for Mr Rodriguez 's solution : promote entrepreneurship in places that , at least until a few months ago , were considered emerging , rather than submerging , markets .
So Davos men and women agreed : the global economic crisis is also a time of great opportunity .
That duality defined this year 's WEF , which despite rumours of important people staying away and of a ban on parties , was as busy and boisterous as ever .
Here are our other highlights :
Doctor Doom : Nouriel Roubini comfortably saw off Robert Shiller , George Soros , Stephen Roach and Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the dismal - science celebrity death match by predicting the end of the world as we know it .
“ Why are there so many gloomy economists here ? ” asked one Davos Man , before concocting a Darwinian theory of natural selection whereby any economist who was optimistic at Davos last year did not get invited back .
So if the world has not ended next January , perhaps Davos has seen the last of Mr Roubini .
Reuters
Putting on his friendliest face
Doctor Evil : Everybody had a Vladimir Putin story , even if it was only remarking on how bizarre it was to hear the Russian leader talk of the need for international co-operation while adopting the most hostile body language and persona in WEF history .
His cruel dismissal of an offer of help by Michael Dell left the computer entrepreneur looking like he had been punched by Vitaly Klitschko , the ( Ukrainian ) heavyweight champion of the world , also a Davos attendee .
Book of the week : Wen Jiabao , China 's premier , said he was re-reading Adam Smith 's “ Theory of Moral Sentiments ” .
How many of the capitalists at Davos could say the same ?
Indeed , how many of them have read it once ?
Absent Friends : Reportedly , a visitor without a hotel room tried to check in to the Belvedere as John Thain , an executive recently ousted by Bank of America and no longer welcome in Davos , only to be told that Mr Thain had already arrived .
Happily , he got a room when he said , “ Actually , I'm Larry Summers . ”
While failed bankers were not much missed , the lack of heavyweight representation from the Obama administration led some to wonder if Davos was losing its relevance .
Others suspect that Team Obama will turn out in force next year , rather than leave the stage to Mr Wen and his brand of Sino - Scottish capitalism .
Best catchphrase : “ Doing an Erdogan ” , Davos - speak for hissy fit , after Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the prime minister of Turkey , stormed off stage and flew home when he was not allowed to respond to a long rant by Shimon Peres .
Runner up : a remarkable number of grey - haired political leaders and company bosses have adopted as their own British Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's self - promoting rallying cry that “ Now is no time for novices ” .
Top celebrity : No Bono or Brangelina this year , but Davos was not celebrity - free .
Jet Li , a Chinese movie star , stole the show .
At a session called “ From Philanthrocapitalism to Philanthrocrisis ? ” , he asked Bill Clinton if he could call him “ my brother ” ( yes ) .
He then energised an audience keen for an injection of optimism by describing how he persuaded 1 m Chinese to donate to One Foundation , his charity .
Outrageous speculation : Goldman
Sachs survived the financial crisis , just , but will it survive the recovery , given how many of its talented bankers are preparing to escape the dead - hand of government regulation by quitting to start their own investment firms ?
Will Microsoft finally be killed off by Google , the launch of whose free “ G - drive ” operating system is said to be imminent ?
Most alarming statistic : A survey of opinion in 20 countries by Edelman , a public relations firm , found that public trust in business leaders has plunged to new lows .
Nearly two - thirds of those surveyed said they trust corporations less today than they did a year ago .
The plunge was most dramatic in America : only 38 % say they trust business to do what is right ( a 20 % drop from last year ) and just 17 % say they trust information from a company 's chief executive .
Best jokes : Q . What is the capital of Iceland ?
A. About two krona .
Q. What is the difference between Ireland and Iceland ?
A . One letter and about six months .
Least likely terrorist :
An Icelandic entrepreneur furiously points to the website Icelanders Are Not Terrorists .
Listening to Gordon Brown talk about international co-operation in Davos has been unbearable , he says , given the British prime minister 's use of international anti-terror laws to attack Iceland 's banking system .
One - third of Iceland 's population has signed the petition on the website , so when recession - hit Brits send Mr Brown into exile , he had best not go there .
Top letter : A tie between B and J. Many at Davos thought that the best way to save the world economy is to focus on “ Banks , banks , banks ” , while others called for “ Jobs , jobs , jobs ” .
Either way , the WEF intends to launch a high - level organisation to advise the leaders of the G20 countries on “ shaping the post - crisis world ” .
Best party :
The parties were supposed to have been toned down , but that was just spin .
True , some banks thought twice about spending taxpayers ' money on grand cru , though JPMorgan offered cocktails .
But reports that McKinsey was not bringing its much - loved dance band happily proved false .
Google again delivered the goods , turning its so - called “ lounge ” into such a hip nightclub that bouncers blocked the corridor of the luxurious Belvedere hotel , forcing irate movers and shakers to wait in line .
The bouncers claimed to be Google employees .
One was asked if he worked for media relations .
He replied , “ No , for business development ” .
For Google 's sake , let 's hope not .
Most inspiring moment : Archbishop Desmond Tutu speaking to pupils at the Dignity Day held in a school in Davos , followed by Peter Gabriel singing his great protest song about the death of Steve Biko , a South African anti-apartheid campaigner .
In these dark days , the hopeful words of the song seem even more powerful : “ You can blow out a candle , / But you can't blow out a fire ./
Once the flames begin to catch , / The wind will blow it higher . ”
That fire is the right sort of social warming .

You ’ve probably heard about the recent Facebook TOS debacle and subsequent backpeddling .
After a few quiet changes to the terms , a bunch of users of the social networking site revolted , followed by preparation to file a formal complaint by the Electronic Privacy Information Center to the FTC .
So Facebook has backed down , reinstating the previous version of the terms ( last modified in September ) .
However , this does n’t mean that all is well .
On the contrary , Facebook ’s terms have always been a little scary when it comes to your content .
Here is what Facebook ’s TOS still says :
When you post User Content to the Site , you authorize and direct us to make such copies thereof as we deem necessary in order to facilitate the posting and storage of the User Content on the Site .
By posting User Content to any part of the Site , you automatically grant , and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant , to the Company an irrevocable , perpetual , non-exclusive , transferable , fully paid , worldwide license ( with the right to sublicense ) to use , copy , publicly perform , publicly display , reformat , translate , excerpt ( in whole or in part ) and distribute such User Content for any purpose , commercial , advertising , or otherwise , on or in connection with the Site or the promotion thereof , to prepare derivative works of , or incorporate into other works , such User Content , and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing .
You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time .
If you choose to remove your User Content , the license granted above will automatically expire , however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content .
Facebook does not assert any ownership over your User Content ; rather , as between us and you , subject to the rights granted to us in these Terms , you retain full ownership of all of your User Content and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with your User Content .
( emphasis added )
Of course , I should note that despite the title of this post , the terms do make it clear that Facebook never owns your copyright–but in the copyright world , having a non-exclusive license with all of those rights attached to it is n’t much different .
The problem with these terms is that it looks like the first sentence nullifies the overarching character of the rest , and that the second - to - last sentence gives you a clear way out , but that actually is n’t so clear .
I mean , it ’s bad enough that most people do n’t even read terms of service or end - user license agreements , but most of the time the important stuff is shoved into confusing legalese anyway .
I wo n’t bore everyone with the possible interpretations of the paragraph above , but if you ’re interested , I would recommend taking a look at this article from the Santa Clara Computer & High Technology Law Journal .
One kind of alarming theory is that the first sale doctrine ( i.e. , what lets you sell a copy of a book once you ’ve bought it ) might allow Facebook to sell your content even after you ’ve left the site –because since they do n’t have the authority to use the content anymore at that point , they ca n’t make copies of it and thus only have the one .
Granted , this is kind of a stretch , but it ’s a possible interpretation .
And of course , until you actually delete everything on your account , they can use your content pretty much any way they want as long as it ’s in “ connection with the site , ” which is pretty broad–including making derivative works .
The moral of this story is , of course , always pay attention to the TOS if you ’re posting anything that might potentially be of value anywhere .
Like , I do n’t know , if you ’re a teenager now and in thirty years you ’re running for president .

FEBRUARY 17 -- A 14 - year - old Wisconsin girl who refused to stop texting during a high school math class was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct , according to police .
The teenager was busted last Wednesday at Wauwatosa East High School after she ignored a teacher 's demand that she cease texting .
The girl , whose name we have redacted from the Wauwatosa Police Department report , initially denied having a phone when confronted by a school security officer .
However , the phone was located after the girl was frisked by a female cop .
The Samsung Cricket , the police report noted , was recovered ' from the buttocks area ' of the teenager .
The student was issued a criminal citation for disorderly conduct , which carried ' a bail of $ 298 , ' and had her phone confiscated .
The girl , who was barred from school property for a week , is scheduled for an April 20 court appearance on the misdemeanor rap .

A case in Maryland is requiring that state ’s highest Court to find the line between freedom of speech and business disparagement :
In a First Amendment case with implications for everything from neighborhood e-mail lists to national newspapers , an Eastern Shore businessman argued to Maryland ’s highest court yesterday that the host of an online forum should be forced to reveal the identities of people who posted allegedly defamatory comments .
It is the first time the Maryland Court of Appeals has confronted the question of online anonymity , an issue that has surfaced in state and federal courts over the past few years as blogs and other online forums have increasingly become part of the national discourse .
The businessman , Zebulon J. Brodie , contends that he was defamed by comments about his shop , a Dunkin ’ Donuts in Centreville , posted on NewsZap.com .
The shop was described as one “ of the most dirty and unsanitary - looking food - service places I have seen . ”
The comment was posted in a 2006 exchange among anonymous posters named CorsicaRiver , RockyRacoonMd and others .
Brodie is not certain which poster is responsible for that and other remarks that he claims were defamatory , and he has only their screen names .
Brodie is demanding that Independent Newspapers Inc. , the company that owns the site , divulge the identities of his critics .
A Circuit Court judge in Queen Anne ’s County ordered the company to hand over the information .
The company appealed , setting up yesterday ’s argument in Annapolis .
(…)
A number of state courts have heard similar cases , and Levy urged the Maryland judges to follow the lead of New Jersey , where in 2001 an appeals court crafted a standard for cases involving subpoenas to identify anonymous Internet speakers .
The court required plaintiffs to produce “ sufficient evidence ” of their cause of action and mandated that judges balance First Amendment rights against the strength of the plaintiffs ’ case and the need for identities to be disclosed .
But Poltrack argued that the circuit judge , Thomas G. Ross , conducted a balancing test of his own and concluded that Independent Newspapers was obligated to identify the users sought by Brodie .
Poltrack said that requiring plaintiffs to provide evidence at such an early stage was unfair .
“ It ’s a tremendous and onerous burden , ” he told the judges .
This is it .
The conclusion to Grant Morrison ’s tour - de - force exploration — and dismantling — of the DC Universe .
Plagued by delays , DC finally brought in a committee of artists to finish the whole thing just one month after it was originally intended to wrap up .
So how was it ?
The word I ’d actually go for is bittersweet .
Final Crisis is more ambitious and , in a way , more epic than Crisis on Infinite Earths , Zero Hour , or Infinite Crisis .
They destroyed alternate universes , revised the current universe , or went back in time to adjust the beginning of the universe , but despite the fade - out pages in the middle of Zero Hour , none of those ever gave the impression that it was all over for the good guys , and they were left picking up the pieces .
In this issue we learn just how hard it is to kill a god .
We learn what super - heroes do when they can’t save the world by fighting .
Multiple plots by multiple characters come together , and we learn just why some characters are in the book in the first place .
The narrative structure has fragmented even further , with some events only getting a panel or two and maybe a caption , much of it told in flashback from the end of all things .
I ’ve been saying for several months that it ’s a 12 - issue story chopped down to 7 books , but now I ’m beginning to think to really do justice to all the ideas presented , and all the plot threads , you ’d have to expand it to at least 24 issues , possibly more .
There ’s also a heavy meta - textual emphasis on story , which I suppose I should have expected after reading Superman : Beyond .
Thinking about it , this goes back at least as far as Morrison ’s run on Animal Man , in which the title character learned that he literally was a comic book character , with writers artists and editors dictating his life .
But it also made some parts of the issue feel like I was reading Sandman ( more about that later ) .
It ’s only in these last two issues that I really felt like pieces of the story from tie-ins were missing .
I did n’t have a problem with the bits of Batman ’s story that were told only in “ Last Rites , ” or the story with Black Lightning and the Tattooed Man from “ Submit . ”
But then I did n’t read either of those , and just took things in stride .
I did read “ Superman : Beyond , ” and while I felt that the yellow submarine and the multiversal Superman mission would have worked fine without that story , the introduction and nature of Mandrakk the Dark Monitor still felt out of place , even after having read the side story .
( Interesting : I just realized I ’ve actually provided supporting evidence for my Final Crisis Theory of Impenetrability . )
Anyway , at this point I do n’t think I can say anymore without revealing too much , so spoilers after the cut .
.
.
SPOILERS !

Killing Darkseid is not easy .
It took Batman with an unobtanium bullet just to give him a mortal wound , and two Flashes to bring Death to him … but it still took him long enough to die that he took the rest of the world — or possibly the universe — with him .
A significant chunk of the story takes place after the end of the world .
That ’s what I find so ambitious about this compared to the other Crises :
We watch the world disappear until there ’s nothing left but the Watchtower , then nothing left but a barren plain , Metron ’s Chair , and Superman .
I ’ve been trying to place what it reminds me of .
It ’s something like the scenes at the end of time in Neil Gaiman ’s original Books of Magic miniseries , but it ’s also like the destruction of the Dreaming in Sandman : The Kindly Ones , or the end of Elric ’s world in Stormbringer .
Or the final scene of End of Evangelion .
There ’s just this overwhelming sense that it ’s all over , we ’ve lost , the world is gone , and there ’s nothing left but trying to salvage a few tattered survivors .
Though I think the feel of it is more like the final sequence in 2001 : A Space Odyssey after Dave goes into the monolith .
That part works .
The few surviving heroes on the Watchtower , trying to save Earth ’s survivors .
Superman alone in the void .
The arrival of an army of Supermen from 50 universes , Green Lanterns from dozens of worlds , and other heroes gathered together by the rogue Monitor Nix Uotan .
The big villain , Mandrakk the Dark Monitor , being a cosmic vampire who literally sucked the life out of the universe ?
Not so much .
I also found myself unclear on whether it was only Earth and surrounding space that had been destroyed , sucked into the singularity and transformed into Darkseid , or whether it was supposed to be the entire universe .
I initially got the impression that it was the whole universe , but on second read , the Green Lanterns still seemed to be outside looking in ( and still seeing an after - image of Earth ) while everything inside was emptiness .
It certainly makes more sense that way , because there ’s no indication that they put the rest of the universe ’s population in shrunken cold storage to keep them alive through the event .
And what about animals ?
This concept falls apart pretty quickly once you start thinking about it .
I liked some of the nods to past stories , like seeing the Zoo Crew returned to their original state after the awful please - tell - me - this - is - setup - for - some - payoff ending of Captain Carrot and the Final Ark , or the Sunshine Superman from Morrison ’s Animal Man run .
( Now that I think of it , Final Ark actually fed into Final Crisis much more cleanly than Countdown or Death of the New Gods . )
I was also glad to see the Flash family reunion on - panel .
I was beginning to worry that Iris and Jai would n’t make it out of this miniseries .
Also : it ’s good that they did n’t hit the reset button such that the event never happened .
I hope the next few months of stories show a world rebuilding , and deal with ramifications of ordinary people who did and did not fall victim to the Anti-Life Equation .
It does n’t have to be the focus of every story , just a background detail , like the way Keystone City is always repaving its streets .
As for wiping out the Monitors , I can see why Morrison wanted to end the story with them vanishing .
But at the same time , I kind of hoped they ’d stick around : they were far more interesting in a few pages of Final Crisis # 1 than they were in 52 weeks of Countdown to Final Crisis , and it would have been nice to leave them available for other writers .
( Though as has been pointed out with other characters , there ’s really nothing stopping anyone from bringing them back anyway . )
Overall , I ’d say that Final Crisis was similar to Seven Soldiers in that it was a bold narrative experiment that almost worked .

The Mobile World Congress brings together top telecom companies , Internet groups , and handset makers in Barcelona February 16 till 19 .
REUTERS / Gustau Nacarino
BARCELONA ( Reuters ) - Key mobile phone industry players have agreed to fit phones with the same power socket by 2012 , industry group GSMA said on Tuesday .
It said handsets would have a micro USB interface , already used to transfer pictures from digital cameras to a computer .
The initial group of companies that have signed for the change include Nokia , LG , Motorola , Samsung and Sony Ericsson .
Operators such as AT&T , Orange , Telefonica , T - Mobile and Vodafone are also part of the initiative .
The GSMA said that eventually it expected mobile phones to ship without a charging plug and cable because everybody would have one .
This should also lead to less waste and could yield energy savings because the agreement calls for chargers to meet efficiency targets , the group said .
Explay Colibri pico- projector module : 70 - inch SVGA picture possible
Texas Instruments may have wowed at CES last month with their pico - projector modules , but they certainly wo n’t have the whole market to themselves .
At Mobile World Congress next week , Explay will launch their Colibri mobile - projection module , a compact projector capable of creating a 70 - inch image at VGA , WVGA or SVGA resolutions .
In fact the Colibri measures just 24 x 28.6 x 7 mm , and draws just 1.3W , supposedly making it the smallest , least power consuming and highest resolution projector module in the industry .
Pictures from 7 to 70 - inches can be projected from 20 to 200 cm distance , with a 10 Lm brightness .
The Colibri will be used in the latest version of Explay ’s OiO mobile projector , which promises 2.5 hrs runtime from a unit just 50 x 100 x 14 mm .
It apparently uses “ Always Focus ” , which presumably removes the need for a manual focusing control , and can project onto flat or curved surfaces .
We ’ll hopefully have a chance to catch up with Explay at MWC next week , and see if the Colibri and OiO are everything the company promises .
Press Release :
LOS ALGODONES , Baja California Norte -
The pornography arrest of an 88 - year - old snowbird in Mexico , along with his grandson , is quickly escalating into an international incident .
Family members of Edward Chrisman of Washington , who was jailed Jan. 8 with 40 - year - old Gary Chrisman Jr. , say the two men are victims of Mexican injustice .
But the woman who pressed charges for soliciting nude photographs of her 13 - year - old daughter said police acted properly .
The Chrismans are about to enter their fourth week behind bars while family members carry on a publicity campaign declaring they are innocent targets of an attempted shakedown .
Shannon Perkins , sister of Gary Chrisman Jr. , said Mexican officials twice suggested that charges would be dropped if family members came up with thousands of dollars in bribe money .
" The corruption and injustice in Mexico are completely out of control , " Perkins wrote in a letter to the media .
" When people become so desperately greedy for money that they would fabricate atrocious stories and slander two innocent men's reputations without remorse , we have a serious problem on our hands . "
In an interview with The Arizona Republic last week , the 13 - year - old girl 's mother offered an entirely different account .
The mother , who filed the criminal complaint , said she and her daughter are not greedy or corrupt Mexicans , but U.S. citizens who live in Yuma and filed the police report out of fear .
" This is the truth , " the girl 's mother concluded , her eyes welling .
" My daughter is afraid . . . .
And all the lies keep coming " in news stories .
Conflicting accounts
Los Algodones is a popular border destination just southwest of Yuma , where tourists seek cut -rate prescription medications and low - cost medical care .
Most of the town 's estimated 4,000 residents depend on dollars from American visitors for subsistence , and the community even has a squad of special " tourism police " to ensure good relations .
All of which makes the he - said - she - said incident at the mother 's novelty store , Novedades Jasmine , all the more puzzling .
According to Perkins , her grandfather and brother visited the Mexican town Jan. 8 so Gary Chrisman could have dental work done .
Although most tourists park at the border and walk into Mexico , Perkins said , her brother drove across the border because of his grandfather 's failing health .
She added that Gary Jr. , a Yuma security guard , had received a camera for Christmas and was taking cultural pictures in Mexico .
So the two men drove beyond the main tourist zone and stopped at Novedades Jasmine to buy a soda .
Inside , Gary Chrisman Jr. asked the girl and two young women if he could take their photographs .
According to Perkins , one of the women requested money , and Gary Jr. gave her about $ 25 .
The mother 's version of the event : The Chrismans first visited on Jan. 5 while her daughter was tending the shop with two other women .
The mother said Gary Chrisman entered the store alone and took some normal pictures with permission , then said , " Without clothes , I 'll pay more . "
When the girls refused , the girl 's mother said , the visitor displayed a knife and said things would go bad if the girls told anyone .
She added that the man wrote his name and phone number on a sheet of paper , telling the girls to call if they had a change of heart .
She said her daughter was shaken that day as she told of the incident .
On Jan. 8 , she said , Chrisman returned and again offered to pay for photos without clothing .
" My daughter told him , ' No , and get out of here . ' "
The girl 's mother said she arrived in her car as the men were driving away .
She followed , calling police on her cellphone .
As a businesswoman who relies partly on tourism , she said she has no motive to fabricate such a story .
She added that her daughter remains fearful and has been traumatized by media coverage .
" They say I 'm telling lies , but police have a page with his name and number on it , " she added .
Jail conditions
Perkins said her brother and father have clean records , and it makes no sense that they would risk arrest for naked pictures when there is a free strip - tease bar just down the street .
Perkins also noted that allegations about a knife are not in the police report .
" Absolutely ridiculous .
Gary does n't even own a knife , " she said .
After the arrest , Perkins said , her grandfather and brother were held in horrid conditions , forced to sleep on concrete without food , water or family notification .
The two men had no hearing for five days , she said , and were told they had been found innocent .
But that decision was promptly reversed , and they were shipped to a prison in Mexicali , where they remain .
Early this week , Perkins and other family members offered to provide documents for a news report on the case .
However , when a reporter arrived in Yuma , a representative refused to divulge the records or the name of the family 's attorney in Mexico .
Foreign affairs
Accounts of what happened in Los Algodones merge on one important point : Edward Chrisman did not enter the store .
The girl 's mother said she has no idea why the octogenarian was arrested and does not believe he should be in jail .
" We 're so outraged that this could happen , " Perkins said .
" My grandfather was n't even doing anything .
He was in the car . "
Even Los Algodones Mayor Hector Guzman said he is mystified and is pressing for a quick resolution to the court case .
Guzman became part of the intrigue early when he did a television interview and declared that photographs seized from Gary Chrisman Jr. 's camera are not illegal .
Some media reports indicated the mayor had ruled both men innocent .
In fact , Guzman said , he does not know what happened in the store and will let the justice system determine guilt or innocence .
Media coverage further fueled the controversy .
Initial news reports in Mexico contained lurid , inaccurate allegations and distorted mug shots .
Subsequent online reports in the United States were somewhat sympathetic to the Chrisman family .
An Internet article by KOMO - TV of Seattle , Wash . , appeared under the headline : " Family : Wrongfully held man may die in Mexican jail . "
The Chrisman family is trying to apply political and economic pressure on other fronts .
Last week , Sen. Maria Cantwell , D - Wash . , announced she would contact the State Department .
Guzman said he is aware that the case has international implications .
" It 's very difficult , " he added .
" We never have problems like this .
This is a peaceful pueblo , and we always respect people whether they are citizens or not . "

Access to education is only one of the many gender inequality examples .
Like a domino effect , gender discrimination further leads to illiteracy and economic independence .
It can even go as far as women representation in government .
Sadly , women are traditionally assigned a disproportionate amount of care work , such as housekeeping and motherhood .
Further , the time that women devote to such unpaid tasks directly and negatively impacts their workforce participation , hence their inability to foster economic independence .
In the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) , fighting continues among various rebel armies , tribes , the Congolese army and U.N. forces .
The dire situation has prompted the government of DR Congo to ask for help , and invite the armies of neighboring South Sudan , Rwanda and Uganda to enter their territory on several joint operations , to hunt down and pacify or dismantle at least two major rebel armies operating in the lawless border region .
Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda was captured in January by Rwandan forces , but his army is still active - and Ugandan troops are seeking out the rebel Ugandan Lord 's Resistance Army , which has taken refuge in eastern DR Congo .
Once more , caught in all of this are the local civilians , terrorized by fleeing and advancing troops of all kinds .

It 's a common , almost clichéd observation that the American media is less critical of Israeli policy than the Israeli media .
In mainstream American depictions of the ceaseless misery of the Middle East , Israeli righteousness and Arab violence are routinely emphasised .
The reality of Israeli settlements and Palestinian suffering have been , at best , a footnote .
Conservatives often complain that the news is n't even more biased toward the Jewish state – or the most hawkish elements within it – but such carping both obscures and reinforces the real distortion in American Middle East coverage , serving as a pre-emptive warning to any outlet that might show too much sympathy for the Palestinians .
( The crudeness of Israel 's most vociferous detractors on the far left does n't help , since it further marginalises criticism of Israel as the preserve of cranks who can't see a difference between Dachau and Jenin . )
Slowly , though , something is changing .
As Israel pulverises Gaza , questions and doubts about Israeli policy are becoming more prominent in the American media .
The failure of the war in Iraq and the attendant discrediting of neoconservatism has opened up new space in the American conversation .
With the American right dejected and weakened , there 's less pressure on the press to display the kind of boorish one - sidedness that self - congratulatory conservatives like to call " moral clarity " .
Israel 's disproportionate retaliation in Gaza is increasingly recognised as both brutal and , in all likelihood , ultimately futile .
In destroying Gaza , Israel is also destroying the American taboo that has ensured the country such unstintingly favourable media coverage .
On December 31 , CNN took on the contentious question of whether Israel or Hamas broke the ceasefire , precipitating the current fighting .
First , the network aired a clip of the liberal Palestinian legislator Mustafa Barghouti saying : " The world press community or media community is overwhelmed with the Israeli narrative , which is incorrect .
The Israeli spokespersons have been spreading lies all over .
The reality and the truth is that the side that broke this truce and this ceasefire was Israel .
Two months before it ended , Israel started attacking Rafah , started attacking Hamas and never lifted the blockade on Gaza . "
Ordinarily , TV journalists would follow such a clip – if they even aired it in the first place – with one of Israel making its case , and would stop at that , leaving an audience already predisposed against the Palestinians to sort out the truth .
Instead , anchor Rick Sanchez did something that should be commonplace , but sadly is not : he endeavoured to find out who was right .
" And you know what we did ?
I 've checked with some of the folks here at our international desk , and I went to them and asked : ' What was he talking about , and do we have any information on that ? ' " said Sanchez .
And he reported that his sources confirmed that Barghouti was right .
Since then , questioning and outright condemning Israeli actions have become increasingly common in the establishment press .
On January 8 , the op -ed page of the New York Times ran three opinion pieces critical of Israel .
" When it is shelled by its neighbour , Israel has to do something , " wrote columnist Nick Kristof .
" But Israel 's right to do something does n't mean it has the right to do anything . "
Last week , a new issue of Time magazine appeared , its cover showing a star of David behind rows of barbed wire and the headline " Why Israel can't win " .
The extremely conservative Wall Street Journal opinion page ran a piece by George Bisharat with the headline " Israel is committing war crimes " .
" Israel 's current assault on the Gaza Strip can not be justified by self - defence , " it began .
" Rather , it involves serious violations of international law , including war crimes .
…
Hamas fighters have also violated the laws of warfare , but their misdeeds do not justify Israel 's acts . "
No doubt , some of Israel 's most aggressive partisans are going to be alarmed by this sudden shift in the American discourse .
They 're used to dismissing the world 's criticism of Israel as the mutterings of antisemites and bien - pensant third - worldists .
The US has been a cocoon that protects Israel and its advocates from facing harsh judgments .
But Israel has been ill served by America 's endless indulgence .
What is happening in Gaza endangers , first and foremost , the benighted people who live there and who are dying by the hundreds .
It also endangers Israel itself , pushing already elusive prospects for peace ever more out of reach .
An American media that turned a blind eye to Israeli expansionism and human rights abuses ultimately made the Jewish state less , not more , secure .
Without the US putting pressure on Israel to dismantle the settlements and loosen the blockade in Gaza , leaders there had neither the incentive nor the political cover to do so .
Now that the American press is displaying a bit of courage in facing an unfolding catastrophe abetted by American leadership , perhaps our politicians will have room to do the same .

As a television series Max Headroom : 20 Minutes into the Future was one of my favorite shows from the 80s .
Of course the character of Max pre-dates that series — he got his start with a talk show in England in 1985 which in many ways inspired Space Ghost : Coast to Coast .
When Coke launched their new formula they made the bold move of picking Max as their spokesperson using the tagline “ Catch the Wave ! ”
Folks loved Max but not the new Coke and the old Coke was bought back with the label “ Classic Coke ” ( which was just recently dropped ) .
What I love about this first commercial from Australia ( from 1987 ) is that ’s much more racy than this ad from the States which was made at the same time :
In these two spots from 1986 and 1987 Max Headroom refutes the infamous Pepsi challenge , which on a nerd note was created by John Sculley when he was at Pepsi before he left to become CEO of Apple Computer in 1983 :
This spot which was produced a bit later harkened back to Max Headroom ’s talk show roots , but with the extra twist of casting him as a gameshow show host :
Of course Max Headroom ’s appearance was n’t just limited to television , Coke made a wide range of goodies from plastic cups to posters to skateboards :
Catch the Wave !
My special thanks to Todd Franklin from the photo of the Max Headroom cup .

One of Cryptogon ’s core contributors created this presentation .
He will be showing this to executives at a large financial organization .
( He asked me not to say which one . )
He ’s very interested in getting feedback on this :
I ’ve included my comments below :
Hi [ Deleted ] ,
This presentation is very good .
For a mainstream audience of [ Deleted ] ,
this goes pretty far .
I ’m quite surprised they would be at all receptive
to anything like this …
If it was me presenting this , I would focus a little more on the role
that exotic derivatives have played in this .
The commoditization of
traditional loan products , and the resulting derivatives became an
addiction that most banks ( and many other financial entities , pension
systems , municipalities , NORWAY ! etc ) simply could not resist .
That ’s
what ’s different about this “ bust ” cycle .
It could be orders of
magnitude worse than anyone thinks because this type of leverage has
never been used before .
Also , as to the question of why other countries continue to provide
credit to the U.S. , yes , the U.S. military is an issue , but I would
argue that it ’s a house of cards .
In my opinion , the core of it is
economic .
Look at economies like Germany and Japan .
Where would they be
without the U.S. to dump finished goods ?
Many countries are heavily
dependent on exporting finished goods to Americans who can no longer
keep the Ponzi scheme expanding .
This is an endemic flaw in the system .
This is structural .
It has been
allowed to continue over decades , and it is now off the rails .
I love the Long Term Scenarios matrix on slide 17 .
Man , nobody said it
was going to be easy !
I can’t agree with you more on slide 19 , How to Heal the Economic
System .
That ’s it .
That ’s what has to happen .
I feel as though a new economic paradigm could spring up around JUST
food and clean energy projects .
It would n’t be limited to that , of
course , but these are areas of massive importance to everyone .
Areas
where people can participate by the millions .
Of course , doing things
that make sense along these lines are illegal , or have compliance issues
associated with them to make them impossibly expensive and cumbersome to
consider .

The best book about Runyon is Jimmy Breslin ’s slightly dispiriting biography , published in 1991 , one of those “ matches ” that make a publisher feel wonderful until the manuscript comes in .
Writers train for one length or another , and Breslin ’s is essentially a series of eight - hundred - word columns strung together , all told in that good Breslin style , where this guy said that to this other guy — quick glimpses of Prohibition , the Hearst press , stealing coats in the Depression — so that the total effect is like watching the world ’s longest subway train go by at night .
Still , there is something more in Runyon , one feels on rereading him , than just old jokes and columns and nostalgia for “ Runyonland . ”
Pete Hamill , another newspaperman turned novelist , has written a lovely introduction to the best current collection of Runyon , “ Guys and Dolls and Other Writings , ” emphasizing the artistry that it took to make funny stories from the resistant material at hand .
And there is something genuinely artful , not just artisanal , in his writing .
Musical comedies work by creating circumstances in which people can sing their loves and dreams .
A kind of love and a kind of dream , deeper than might be apparent , must run through Runyon ’s writing to make it sing so well .
By a cosmic coincidence , Damon Runyon was born in Manhattan , but it was Manhattan , Kansas — as though God were giving him the right birthplace for the obit but keeping him away from his true home until he was ready .
The young Runyon actually grew up in Colorado , and stayed there until he was thirty .
The Colorado - Manhattan connection in that period is so singular as to look almost significant : the newspaperman Gene Fowler , who was the prime historian of John Barrymore and the other hard - drinking upper - Broadway thespians ( as they called themselves ) , came from there ; and so did this magazine ’s Harold Ross , the epitome of a country boy landing a biplane on Broadway .
If there ’s any meaning to the pattern , it may be that Colorado was n’t Iowa .
In the tales about the early years of all three guys , there is always an emphasis on con games seen , card games played , a quarrel with Bat Masterson just missed .
These guys are not farming .
A newspaper - trained poker player coming from Colorado in those years probably thought of himself as cannier and tougher than the city slickers , who were there to be taken .
Runyon had met Harry the Horse , or another version of him , before he ever got to town .
And then , just as it takes a naïf to find Paris cafés adorable — the natives find them about as interesting as diners — it took another kind of naïf to think that the lowlifes of Broadway were charming .
( Old - timers tell me that the cheesecake at Lindy ’s was actually very gummy . )
When Runyon at last arrived in New York , in 1910 , it took him a while to find his way .
He went to work for the Hearst press — not at the Evening Journal but at the American .
It ’s one of those distinctions that seem slight now but mattered then : the Evening Journal was the popular screaming tabloid , while the American was Hearst ’s attempt at a quality paper .
So Runyon started out on the higher side of the ledger already , and at the top , covering the New York Giants .
He began his life in New York cautiously ; he planted his wife , who followed him from Colorado , in the outer boroughs , and fathered a couple of children in that absent and absent - minded way of newspapermen of the time .
Baseball , already the sacrament of the tabloids , was where he made his first mark , and where he seems to have made his first distinct turn : he had come to New York idolizing the great and virtuous Giants pitcher Christy Mathewson , whom he had been writing about back in Colorado for years , sight unseen .
Discovering that the real Mathewson was a bit of a prig and a bore — he could play and beat six of his teammates at checkers all at once , but then , Runyon noted , the teammates could barely tell a jump from a julep — Runyon decided to look elsewhere for his stories .
He wrote about Bugs Raymond , the drunken , carousing hurler who was Billy Martin to Matty ’s Tom Seaver .
Runyon pitched his tent on the shady side of the street , where the stories were .
It was only slowly , and over time , that he insinuated himself into the night world that he made his own best subject .
His method was a simple form of Broadway Zen : he went to Lindy ’s , then an all - night Jewish deli on Broadway , and sat .
“ I am the sedentary champion of the city , ” he explained .
“ In order to learn anything of importance , I must remain seated .
Why I am the best is that I can last an entire day without causing a chair to squeak . ”
It seems to have been true ; the interesting bad guys of that era — the Frank Costellos and Arnold Rothsteins — apparently did n’t mind having newspapermen around who were listening , perhaps because they assumed from first principles that newspapermen were harmless and too intimidated even to need to be bribed .
Basically , Runyon spent the twenties absorbing the material he would use in the thirties .
He had published some bad poetry in a Vachel Lindsay manner , and only much later began trying to turn the gangster - talk he heard into stories .
But his ambitions were in place all along .
This pattern — sportswriter into writer — was so familiar that it is easy to forget its peculiarities .
The great American humorists of the first half of the twentieth century divide pretty neatly into newspaper guys and magazine writers , drudges for the penny press and hacks for the slicks , as they thought of themselves .
Runyon , Lardner , and Don Marquis were all newspaper writers ; Perelman , Thurber , and Benchley all magazine guys .
What divided them was education and the felt experience of the Great War .
Runyon ’s style , like that of Lardner and Fowler and Ben Hecht , is still rooted in prewar expectations .
The literary manners of the O .
Henry age — particularly the marriage of the louche and the lugubrious — lingers in his work till the end and gives it , along with its energy , a certain stagy quality .
So Runyon , though dreaming of “ real ” writing , dreamed of it in a very late - eighteen - nineties way .
[ #unhandled_cartoon ]
The key moment for Runyon occurred in 1929 , after Arnold Rothstein was murdered in a strange , never quite explained hotel shooting .
Runyon , as the writer who knew him best , or , at least , was his best listener , felt obliged to produce something , but could n’t find a way to get it out — until he began to write about the gangsters he had come to know as fictional characters , and , weird stroke of genius , as comic fictional characters .
He saw that he could dramatize his accumulated experience of violence on Broadway if he made it funny .
He sat down and , in longhand , wrote , “ Only a rank sucker will think of taking two peeks at Dave the Dude ’s doll , because while Dave may stand for the first peek , figuring it is a mistake , it is a sure thing he will get sored up at the second peek , and Dave the Dude is certainly not a man to have sored up at you . ”
The story sold to a Hearst magazine for the nice sum of eight hundred dollars .
Others followed .
Fiction was a way of putting funny hats on hit men .
Stories of this kind , the Runyon story , began to pour out of him for the next decade .
Sales figures are hard to find , but it seems fair to say that Runyon became a more genuinely popular writer in the thirties than almost any other American humorist .
His stories got sold to Hollywood for twenty films , including “ Lady for a Day ” ( which was later remade , with Bette Davis , as “ Pocketful of Miracles ” ) and “ Little Miss Marker , ” which made Shirley Temple into a star .
Like Anita Loos , he got his first real dose of highbrow appreciation when his stories were published in England , in the mid-thirties .
Reading the thirties stories straight through , one is startled by the lack of characterization .
Runyon does n’t really study gangsters ; he just makes up a cookie - shape called Gangster and bakes extras as needed .
The lack of sentiment and the love of language are what ’s new in his work .
Where the other newspaper - made writers tended to be , as newspaper columnists still are , moralistic — Lardner , although a master of common speech , is intent on unmasking the cruelty beneath the cheerfulness of American life — Runyon ’s stuff is strictly amoral , with a tearjerking moment set down here and there like last night ’s carnation floating by in the gutter .
No one grows or changes or learns , everyone ’s motive is mercenary , everyone is flat as a pancake , no moral drama takes place — all the life is in the language .
Like Wodehouse , whom he in some ways resembles , Runyon inherited a comedy of morals and turned it into a comedy of sounds , language playing for its own sake .
That language still dazzles and delights .
The usual thing is to insist that Runyon had an amazing “ ear ” for natural idiom , but , as Cy Feuer points out , Runyon ’s dialogue is essentially unplayable , too far removed from any human idiom to be credible in drama .
What Runyon was n’t doing while he was sitting in Lindy ’s was just listening and taking dialogue down .
Writers with a good ear ( Salinger , John O’Hara ) certainly listen more acutely than the rest of us , but what they really have is a better filter for telling signal from noise , and then turning it into song .
There are two layers of idiom - making laid one on top of the other in Runyon ’s writing , a technique that accounts both for its complexity and for its comic , slightly out - of - focus nature — for its mixture of authenticity and unreality .
As far as one can tell , Jewish crooks of the period really did speak a surprisingly elaborate and cautious diction .
They did n’t speak like Runyon characters , but they tried to speak high for the same reason that they polished their shoes and tipped their hats and dressed in suits : fancy was classy .
This tendency still shows in Sinatra ’s recorded speech , which , when made for public consumption , is extremely “ high , ” a Hoboken boy ’s idea of a class act .
But with Runyon the crucial added thing , as Hamill points out , is that the Narrator is not just telling his stories but writing them .
He ’s reporting a slang of the streets and writing a yarn at the same time .
A whole second story of over - elaboration is placed on top of the already stilted - up vernacular , like one of those buildings on Forty - sixth Street where the ground floor is a restaurant with waiters coming in and out while girls in leotards work out in a dance studio on the floor above .
The ever - blossoming additional clauses are most often the Narrator ’s idea of written language stapled awkwardly onto his knowledge of spoken language :
For all the hype about hybrids and electric cars , the best way to reduce our carbon footprint is to make the cars we 're already driving more efficient .
But switching a vehicle to alternative fuels or getting a plug - in hybrid conversion is expensive , and the IRS , foolishly , does n't cut you any slack for it .
Although the government provides tax breaks for hybrids and alt - fuel vehicles produced by major automakers , it does n't provide any relief to those who make their existing cars greener .
" There are no incentives for the 248 million vehicle owners in the United States to convert their vehicles into cleaner , greener plug - in hybrids , " says Frank Kuchinski of Poulsen Hybrid , one of a growing number of companies doing such conversions .
Such a policy is short - sighted , given the emphasis lawmakers put on easing our dependence on foreign oil and the urgent need to address global warming .
It must be changed .
Plug - in hybrids capable of 100 miles per gallon or more and electric vehicles that emit no emissions hold great promise for weaning us from oil .
But they remain years , if not decades , away from widespread adoption .
Toyota has been building the Prius for a decade and only recently saw sales surpass 1 million .
Gas -electric vehicles like the Prius and forthcoming Honda Insight still comprise less than 3 percent of the market .
A growing number of companies are developing the technology to convert gasoline cars to run on ethanol or compressed natural gas , and others are converting hybrids to plug - in hybrids .
Such conversions typically cost several thousand dollars , but can reach as much as $ 35,000 .
That has advocates like Andy Grove , the Intel founder who has called for 10 million plug - in conversions by 2012 , to propose a federal tax credit that would cover half the cost of making the switch .
Kuchinski recommends increasing the gas tax — something that is long overdue anyway — to pay for it .
He says the question is , " Are consumers willing to add a few pennies to the gasoline tax to fund green incentives for consumers who want to convert their vehicles into a plug - in hybrid or would like to purchase a new hybrid or plug - in hybrid ? "
It 's a good idea .
After all , if the IRS can provide tax breaks to people who claim their SUVs as a business expense , it can offer some relief to people who do something that , ultimately , benefits us all .*

The death toll from fires in southern Australia has reached at least 108 , the worst in the country 's history .
Thousands of firefighters , aided by the army , are battling several major bush fires , and the number of dead is expected to rise as fires are put out .
Arsonists responsible for lighting the fires could be charged with murder , police have said .
Entire towns in Victoria state were destroyed as fires were fanned by extreme temperatures and wind .
Temperatures are dropping now , but officials fear they will not be able to get the fires under control until there is substantial rain .
" We could still have a lot worse , " said Sharon Smee of Victoria 's Country Fire Authority .
" There 's still hot spots out there and there 's a lot of people who are really exhausted and tired . "
' Absolutely horrific ' Firefighters have been battling against what are described as the worst conditions in Victoria 's history .

The fires have destroyed entire towns and many miles of farm and forestland

John Coleridge from the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne said most of those rescued from the fires had suffered burns .
" They range from minor , just the soles of their feet running away through embers , to people who 've got major , life - threatening burns , " he said .
" And unfortunately there are some people who will not survive . "
The BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney said police suspect that in at least one case fires have been restarted by arsonists after being extinguished by firefighters .
New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees said arsonists faced a maximum 25 years ' jail .
" We will throw the book at you if you are caught , " he was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
" Some of these fires have started in localities that could only be by hand , it could not be natural causes , " Victoria state Police Deputy Commissioner Kieran Walshe was quoted as saying by AFP .
He said there would be a " full , thorough investigation " .
AUSTRALIAN BUSH FIRES 16 February 1983 : 75 dead , 2,300 homes destroyed in " Ash Wednesday " bushfires in Victoria and South Australia 8 January 1969 :
At least 22 dead , 230 homes lost in rural Victoria 7 February 1967 : 62 dead , 1,300 homes destroyed in fires in Hobart , Tasmania 13 January 1939 : 71 dead , 700 homes destroyed in " Black Friday " fires in Victoria February - March 1922 : 60 die in Gippsland , eastern Victoria
" Pretty certain my house has gone "
At least 700 homes have been destroyed in Victoria and about 14,000 homes are without power .
Most of the people who died came from a cluster of small towns to the north of Melbourne .
The BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney said many charred bodies had been found in cars .
It is thought they were trying to escape the fires but were overtaken by their " sheer speed and ferocity " .
Some cars appeared to have crashed into one another as people tried to flee the flames .
Victoria Country Fire Authority said the death toll had risen to 108 .
At least 18 people were reported to have died in the town of Kinglake , four at Wandong , four at St Andrews and three at Strathewen .
One Strathewen resident told ABC local radio how people had witnessed " absolutely horrific " scenes as they had helped battle the flames .
" The school 's gone , the hall 's gone ... some people left it too late .
We 've lost friends , and we 're just waiting for more - children , loved ones , " she said .
The town of Marysville , with about 500 residents , was said to have been burned to the ground , though most residents managed to shelter from the blaze in a local park .
Australia is a tough country to live in .
We have had no rain for eight weeks and that is why so much is burning .
Alison Blakeley , Melbourne
Your comments : Australian fires Nick Bryant : Worst of days
In Kinglake , where witnesses said most of the town was destroyed , one woman quoted by the Melbourne Age described the arrival of a badly burnt man and his daughter seeking shelter on a patch of open ground .
" He had skin hanging off him everywhere and his little girl was burnt , but not as badly as her dad , and he just came down and he said ' Look , I 've lost my wife , I 've lost my other kid , I just need you to save [ my daughter ] , ' " she said .
' Tragic day '
Tens of thousands of firefighters have been trying to contain blazes in two other states - New South Wales and South Australia - but the fires there were largely contained or burning away from residential areas .
The fire service is using water - bombing aircraft to contain fires and thousands of volunteers are using water hoses .
Witnesses say the fires have been up to four storeys high ( Pic : Grant Smith ) " It 's obviously a tragic day and a tragic week in our history , " Victorian state Premier John Brumby said .
Late on Sunday , he said he had accepted an offer from Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to send in troops to relieve overstretched emergency crews .
" Hell in all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria in the last 24 hours , " said Mr Rudd .
Bush fires are common in Australia , but the current blazes have eclipsed the death toll from what had been the previous worst fire in 1983 , when 75 people died on a day that became known as Ash Wednesday .
The leader of the Green party , Bob Brown said summer fires would get worse unless Australia and other nations showed more leadership on reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" It 's a sobering reminder of the need for this nation and the whole world to act and put at a priority our need to tackle climate change , " he said .

( CNN ) --
In her first interview since giving birth , the teenage daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said having a child is not " glamorous , " and that telling young people to be abstinent is " not realistic at all . "
Bristol Palin says " everyone should just wait 10 years " to have a baby , rather than when you 're young .
" It 's just , like , I 'm not living for myself anymore .
It 's , like , for another person , so it 's different , " Bristol Palin told Fox News ' Greta Van Susteren .
" And just you 're up all night .
And it 's not glamorous at all , " she said .
" Like , your whole priorities change after having a baby . "
The 18 - year - old , who gave birth in late December , said she is being helped tremendously by her mother , grandmother , cousins and other family members .
She is engaged to teen father Levi Johnston , who is now working for his father and trying to complete school , but said she wishes that she waited another 10 years to have a baby .
It was " harder than labor " telling her parents she was pregnant .
" Well , we were sitting on the couch , my best friend and Levi , and we had my parents come and sit on the couch , too .
And we had my sisters go upstairs , " Bristol said .
" And we just sat them down , and I just -- I could n't even say it .
I was just sick to my stomach .
" And so finally , my best friend just , like , blurted it out .
And it was just , like -- I do n't even remember it because it was just , like , something I do n't want to remember . "
Todd and Sarah Palin were " scared just because I have to -- I had to grow up a lot faster than they ever would have imagined , " Bristol said .
Her parents insisted that she and her boyfriend hash out a " game plan " immediately .
And now her parents and relatives are all pitching in to help take care of the child , particularly when Bristol is at school during the day .
Van Susteren was delicate with the teenager but pointedly asked if " contraception is an issue here . "
" Is that something that you were just lazy about or not interested , or do you have philosophical or religious opposition to it , " Van Susteren asked .
Bristol quickly answered that she did n't want to get into specifics .
The best option is abstinence , the teen said , but added that she did n't think that was " realistic . "
Watch Bristol Palin say that abstinence is " not realistic at all " »
While her mother was running for vice president , the teenager said her treatment in the media was " evil . "
She said she read some of the tabloids that wrote about her .
People did n't understand , she said , and some media reports perpetuated falsehoods about her experience .
" They thought that , like , my mom was going to make me have the baby , and it was my choice to have the baby , " she said .
" And it 's just -- that kind of stuff just bothered me . "
Van Susteren asked , " But this is your issue ?
This is your decision ? "
Bristol answered yes .
" ( It ) does n't matter what my mom 's views are on it .
It was my decision , and I wish people would realize that , too , " she said .
The network interview was Bristol 's idea , the teen said .
And she apparently sprung the news to her parents that she was going to speak publicly the day before the network taping .
The teen said she wanted to tell her story so that other young people might think twice about having sex .
" I 'd love to [ be ] an advocate to prevent teen pregnancy because it's not , like , a situation that you would want to strive for , I guess , " Bristol said .
Gov. Palin made an unexpected appearance during the interview in Alaska , and Van Susteren asked her about her daughter 's pregnancy .
" Not the most ideal situation , certainly you make the most of it , " the governor said .
Bristol is a " strong and bold woman , and she is an amazing mom , " Palin said .
" And this little baby is very lucky to have her as a mama .
He 's going to be just fine . "

If a hundred of the most talented members of the advertising industry were tasked with creating an image to illustrate the concepts of poverty and famine , quite possibly none of them would come up with anything nearly as grippingly and devastatingly effective as a 1993 picture snapped by South African freelance photographer Kevin Carter :
The PHOTO in the mail is the “ Pulitzer prize ” winning photo taken in 1994 during the Sudan famine .
The picture depicts a famine stricken child crawling towards an United Nations food camp , located a kilometer away .
The vulture is waiting for the child to die so that it can eat it .
This picture shocked the whole world .
No one knows what happened to the child , including the photographer Kevin Carter who left the place as soon as the photograph was taken .
Three months later he committed suicide due to depression .
This was found in his diary , “ Dear God , I promise I will never waste my food no matter how bad it can taste and how full I may be I pray that He will protect this little boy , guide and deliver him away from his misery .
I pray that we will be more sensitive towards the world around us and not be blinded be our own selfish nature and interests . ”
I hope this picture will always serve as a reminder to us that how fortunate we are and that we must never ever take things for granted .
His poignant photograph of an emaciated toddler who collapsed from hunger on her way to a feeding center in famine - ravaged Sudan while a vulture ominously loomed in the background was originally published in the New York Times ( which later described it as “ a metaphor for Africa ’s despair ” ) and earned Carter the 1994 Pulitzer Prize in the Feature Photography category , and the image has since become widely known as a metaphor for Africa ’s despair .
As described in Time magazine , the scene Carter captured in his now - famous photograph was one he stumbled across during a trip he made on his own in order to cover the civil strife in war - torn Sudan :
In 1993 Carter headed north of the border with [ friend and fellow journalist ] João Silva to photograph the rebel movement in famine - stricken Sudan .
To make the trip , Carter had taken a leave from the [ South Africa ] Weekly Mail and borrowed money for the air fare .
Immediately after their plane touched down in the village of Ayod , Carter began snapping photos of famine victims .
Seeking relief from the sight of masses of people starving to death , he wandered into the open bush .
He heard a soft , high - pitched whimpering and saw a tiny girl trying to make her way to the feeding center .
As he crouched to photograph her , a vulture landed in view .
Careful not to disturb the bird , he positioned himself for the best possible image .
He would later say he waited about 20 minutes , hoping the vulture would spread its wings .
It did not , and after he took his photographs , he chased the bird away and watched as the little girl resumed her struggle .
Afterward he sat under a tree , lit a cigarette , talked to God and cried .
“ He was depressed afterward , ” Silva recalls .
“ He kept saying he wanted to hug his daughter . ”
After another day in Sudan , Carter returned to Johannesburg .
Coincidentally , the New York Times , which was looking for pictures of Sudan , bought his photograph and ran it on March 26 , 1993 .
The picture immediately became an icon of Africa ’s anguish .
Hundreds of people wrote and called the Times asking what had happened to the child ( the paper reported that it was not known whether she reached the feeding center ) ; and papers around the world reproduced the photo .
Friends and colleagues complimented Carter on his feat .
His self - confidence climbed .
But Kevin Carter was also a troubled soul , struggling with issues such as financial insecurity , drug problems , failed relationships , and the horrors of having witnessed multiple scenes of death — enough of a burden for anyone to struggle with , but in Carter ’s case a burden made extra- heavy by the critical condemnation heaped upon him for taking the photograph that had made him world - famous :
Though the photo helped draw enormous attention to the humanitarian crisis that was engulfing Sudan , it was criticized by others who felt that Carter should have helped the girl and was instead exploiting her suffering for his gain .
The real vulture , they said in vitriolic hate mail , was Carter himself .
Some photojournalists might have easily dismissed such criticism , but it hit Carter hard and fed his self - doubts .
On 27 July 1994 , barely two months after having received his Pulitzer Prize , 33 - year - old Kevin Carter could shoulder that burden no more and took his own life :
The Braamfonteinspruit is a small river that cuts southward through Johannesburg ’s northern suburbs — and through Parkmore , where the Carters once lived .
At around 9 p.m. , Kevin Carter backed his red Nissan pickup truck against a blue gum tree at the Field and Study Center .
He had played there often as a little boy .
The Sandton Bird Club was having its monthly meeting there , but nobody saw Carter as he used silver gaffer tape to attach a garden hose to the exhaust pipe and run it to the passenger - side window .
Wearing unwashed Lee jeans and an Esquire T - shirt , he got in and switched on the engine .
Then he put music on his Walkman and lay over on his side , using the knapsack as a pillow .
The suicide note he left behind is a litany of nightmares and dark visions , a clutching attempt at autobiography , self - analysis , explanation , excuse .
After coming home from New York , he wrote , he was “ depressed … without phone … money for rent … money for child support … money for debts … money !!! …
I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings & corpses & anger & pain … of starving or wounded children , of trigger - happy madmen , often police , of killer executioners … “
Although the purported diary entry ( beginning “ Dear God , I promise I will never waste my food ” ) that has been tacked onto this photograph may sound like something Kevin Carter might have written , those words were not recorded in his diary , nor are they known to have been written or spoken by him .
They were added to the photograph by an unknown hand after the picture had been circulating on the Internet for several years .
Kevin Carter ’s life ( and death ) was the subject of the 2004 documentary , The Life of Kevin Carter .

A global chain of Bob Marley - themed One Love cafes is being planned Bob Marley drinks , luggage , stationery , hotels and video games could soon appear after the late reggae star 's family struck a merchandise deal .
" We 're open to licensing just about anything , " said the late reggae icon 's daughter Cedella .
But she added : " If it is not right , we will not do it . "
The family has teamed up with private equity firm Hilco to capitalise on his name and songs and to stop bootleggers .
A Bob Marley lager and coffee will be among the first items on the market .
Headphones , snowboards , shoes , musical instruments and electronics are on a list of other products that will be developed in a major expansion of Marley 's official merchandise range .
Some will bear the music legend 's name and image , while others will be tied in to song titles or lyrics from his best - known tunes .
Cedella Marley has based a children 's book on one of her father 's hits Cedella Marley , the singer 's eldest child , has already published a children 's book called Three Little Birds , based on the anthem of the same name , known for its refrain of : " Do n't worry about a thing , ' cause every little thing 's gonna be all right . "
Three Little Birds could be expanded into a range of children 's clothes , shoes and toys , she suggested .
Another plan is to open a global chain of One Love cafes where people can " come , eat good Jamaican food , talk about the music , listen to the music , live bands " .
" That 's something that we 've always wanted to explore , " Ms Marley told BBC News .
" We 're talking [ about ] all over the world - one in London , one in Asia , one in Amsterdam . "
There is already a Bob Marley Resort & Spa in the Bahamas , which could be the springboard for a string of Marley hotels .
Ms Marley said interest in her father was growing , almost 30 years after his death .
" The things that dad spoke about are still the things that we all need to fix and work on , " she said .
This is a big business for bootleggers - we want to stop some of the nonsense , and make sure the great stuff upholds our standards
Cedella Marley
" Sometimes when you put on his records it 's like he 's talking about today , right now .
" The message is still about hope and peace and all of us coming together .
That 's what makes him special .
All of us can relate to him . "
The family say they hope to avoid over - commercialising the image and music of Marley , an artist with one of the most cherished and enduring legacies in music .
But they want to feed the demand that has spawned a counterfeit merchandise industry worth an estimated $ 600 m ( £ 415 m ) , and keep control of the star 's persona .
" This is a big business for bootleggers , " said Ms Marley .
" We want to stop some of the nonsense , and make sure the great stuff upholds our standards .
We 're in control . "
Asked whether the family had effectively sold a slice of Marley to the private equity firm , his daughter insisted Hilco had become the family 's partners to develop and manage the merchandise .
" Nothing has been sold " , she said .

The Criminal Front
In the Line of Fire
Mexico has pretty much always been a rough - and - tumble place .
In recent years , however , the security environment has deteriorated rapidly , and parts of the country have become incredibly violent .
It is now common to see military weaponry such as fragmentation grenades and assault rifles used almost daily in attacks .
In fact , just last week we noted two separate strings of grenade attacks directed against police in Durango and Michoacan states .
In the Michoacan incident , police in Uruapan and Lazaro Cardenas were targeted by three grenade attacks during a 12 - hour period .
Then on Feb. 17 , a major firefight occurred just across the border from the United States in Reynosa , when Mexican authorities attempted to apprehend several armed men seen riding in a vehicle .
The men fled to a nearby residence and engaged the pursuing police with gunfire , hand grenades and rocket - propelled grenades ( RPGs ) .
After the incident , in which five cartel gunmen were killed and several gunmen , cops , soldiers and civilians were wounded , authorities recovered a 60 mm mortar , five RPG rounds and two fragmentation grenades .
Make no mistake , considering the military weapons now being used in Mexico and the number of deaths involved , the country is in the middle of a war .
In fact , there are actually three concurrent wars being waged in Mexico involving the Mexican drug cartels .
The first is the battle being waged among the various Mexican drug cartels seeking control over lucrative smuggling corridors , called plazas .
One such battleground is Ciudad Juarez , which provides access to the Interstate 10 , Interstate 20 and Interstate 25 corridors inside the United States .
The second battle is being fought between the various cartels and the Mexican government forces who are seeking to interrupt smuggling operations , curb violence and bring the cartel members to justice .
Then there is a third war being waged in Mexico , though because of its nature it is a bit more subdued .
It does not get the same degree of international media attention generated by the running gun battles and grenade and RPG attacks .
However , it is no less real , and in many ways it is more dangerous to innocent civilians ( as well as foreign tourists and business travelers ) than the pitched battles between the cartels and the Mexican government .
This third war is the war being waged on the Mexican population by criminals who may or may not be involved with the cartels .
Unlike the other battles , where cartel members or government forces are the primary targets and civilians are only killed as collateral damage , on this battlefront , civilians are squarely in the crosshairs .
There are many different shapes and sizes of criminal gangs in Mexico .
While many of them are in some way related to the drug cartels , others have various types of connections to law enforcement — indeed , some criminal groups are composed of active and retired cops .
These various types of criminal gangs target civilians in a number of ways , including , robbery , burglary , carjacking , extortion , fraud and counterfeiting .
But of all the crimes committed by these gangs , perhaps the one that creates the most widespread psychological and emotional damage is kidnapping , which also is one of the most underreported crimes .
There is no accurate figure for the number of kidnappings that occur in Mexico each year .
All of the data regarding kidnapping is based on partial crime statistics and anecdotal accounts and , in the end , can produce only best - guess estimates .
Despite this lack of hard data , however , there is little doubt — based even on the low end of these estimates — that Mexico has become the kidnapping capital of the world .
One of the difficult things about studying kidnapping in Mexico is that the crime not only is widespread , affecting almost every corner of the country , but also is executed by a wide range of actors who possess varying levels of professionalism — and very different motives .
At one end of the spectrum are the high - end kidnapping gangs that abduct high - net - worth individuals and demand ransoms in the millions of dollars .
Such groups employ teams of operatives who carry out specialized tasks such as collecting intelligence , conducting surveillance , snatching the target , negotiating with the victim 's family and establishing and guarding the safe houses .
At the other end of the spectrum are gangs that roam the streets and randomly kidnap targets of opportunity .
These gangs are generally less professional than the high - end gangs and often will hold a victim for only a short time .
In many instances , these groups hold the victim just long enough to use the victim 's ATM card to drain his or her checking account , or to receive a small ransom of perhaps several hundred or a few thousand dollars from the family .
This type of opportunistic kidnapping is often referred to as an " express kidnapping " .
Sometimes express kidnapping victims are held in the trunk of a car for the duration of their ordeal , which can sometimes last for days if the victim has a large amount in a checking account and a small daily ATM withdrawal limit .
Other times , if an express kidnapping gang discovers it has grabbed a high - value target by accident , the gang will hold the victim longer and demand a much higher ransom .
Occasionally , these express kidnapping groups will even " sell " a high - value victim to a more professional kidnapping gang .
Between these extremes there is a wide range of groups that fall somewhere in the middle .
These are the groups that might target a bank vice president or branch manager rather than the bank 's CEO , or that might kidnap the owner of a restaurant or other small business rather than a wealthy industrialist .
The presence of such a broad spectrum of kidnapping groups ensures that almost no segment of the population is immune from the kidnapping threat .
In recent years , the sheer magnitude of the threat in Mexico and the fear it generates has led to a crime called virtual kidnapping .
In a virtual kidnapping , the victim is not really kidnapped .
Instead , the criminals seek to convince a target 's family that a kidnapping has occurred , and then use threats and psychological pressure to force the family to pay a quick ransom .
Although virtual kidnapping has been around for several years , unwitting families continue to fall for the scam , which is a source of easy money .
Some virtual kidnappings have even been conducted by criminals using telephones inside prisons .
As noted above , the motives for kidnapping vary .
Many of the kidnappings that occur in Mexico are not conducted for ransom .
Often the drug cartels will kidnap members of rival gangs or government officials in order to torture and execute them .
This torture is conducted to extract information , intimidate rivals and , apparently in some cases , just to have a little fun .
The bodies of such victims are frequently found beheaded or otherwise mutilated .
Other times , cartel gunmen will kidnap drug dealers who are tardy in payments or who refuse to pay the " tax " required to operate in the cartel 's area of control .
Of course , cartel gunmen do not kidnap only their rivals or cops .
As the cartel wars have heated up , and as drug revenues have dropped due to interference from rival cartels or the government , many cartels have resorted to kidnapping for ransom to supplement their cash flow .
Perhaps the most widely known group that is engaging in this is the Arellano Felix Organization ( AFO ) , also known as the Tijuana Cartel .
The AFO has been reduced to a shadow of its former self , its smuggling operations dramatically impacted by the efforts of the U.S. and Mexican governments , as well as by attacks from other cartels and from an internal power struggle .
Because of a steep decrease in smuggling revenues , the group has turned to kidnapping and extortion in order to raise the funds necessary to keep itself alive and to return to prominence as a smuggling organization .
There is very little chance the Mexican government will be able to establish integrity in its law enforcement agencies , or bring law and order to large portions of the country , any time soon .
Official corruption and ineptitude are endemic in Mexico , which means that Mexican citizens and visiting foreigners will have to face the threat of kidnapping for the foreseeable future .
We believe that for civilians and visiting foreigners , the threat of kidnapping exceeds the threat of being hit by a stray bullet from a cartel firefight .
Indeed , things are deteriorating so badly that even professional kidnapping negotiators , once seen as the key to a guaranteed payout , are now being kidnapped themselves .
In an even more incredible twist of irony , anti-kidnapping authorities are being abducted and executed .
This environment — and the concerns it has sparked — has provided huge financial opportunities for the private security industry in Mexico .
Armored car sales have gone through the roof , as have the number of uniformed guards and executive protection personnel .
In fact , the demand for personnel is so acute that security companies are scrambling to find candidates .
Such a scramble presents a host of obvious problems , ranging from lack of qualifications to insufficient vetting .
In addition to old - fashioned security services , new security - technology companies are also cashing in on the environment of fear , but even high - tech tracking devices can have significant drawbacks and shortcomings .
For many people , armored cars and armed bodyguards can provide a false sense of security , and technology can become a deadly crutch that promotes complacency and actually increases vulnerability .
Physical security measures are not enough .
The presence of armed bodyguards — or armed guards combined with armored vehicles — does not provide absolute security .
This is especially true in Mexico , where large teams of gunmen regularly conduct crimes using military ordnance .
Frankly , there are very few executive protection details in the world that have the training and armament to withstand an assault by dozens of attackers armed with assault rifles and RPGs .
Private security guards are frequently overwhelmed by Mexican criminals and either killed or forced to flee for their own safety .
As we noted in May 2008 after the assassination of Edgar Millan Gomez , acting head of the Mexican Federal Police and the highest - ranking federal cop in Mexico , physical security measures must be supplemented by situational awareness , countersurveillance and protective intelligence .
Criminals look for and exploit vulnerabilities .
Their chances for success increase greatly if they are allowed to conduct surveillance at will and are given the opportunity to thoroughly assess the protective security program .
We have seen several cases in Mexico in which the criminals even chose to attack despite security measures .
In such cases , criminals attack with adequate resources to overcome existing security .
For example , if there are protective agents , the attackers will plan to neutralize them first .
If there is an armored vehicle , they will find ways to defeat the armor or grab the target when he or she is outside the vehicle .
Because of this , criminals must not be allowed to conduct surveillance at will .
Like many crimes , kidnapping is a process .
There are certain steps that must be taken to conduct a kidnapping and certain times during the process when those executing it are vulnerable to detection .
While these steps may be condensed and accomplished quite quickly in an ad hoc express kidnapping , they are nonetheless followed .
In fact , because of the particular steps involved in conducting a kidnapping , the process is not unlike that followed to execute a terrorist attack .
The common steps are target selection , planning , deployment , attack , escape and exploitation .
Like the perpetrators of a terrorist attack , those conducting a kidnapping are most vulnerable to detection when they are conducting surveillance — before they are ready to deploy and conduct their attack .
As we 've noted several times in past analyses , one of the secrets of countersurveillance is that most criminals are not very good at conducting surveillance .
The primary reason they succeed is that no one is looking for them .
Of course , kidnappers are also very obvious once they launch their attack , pull their weapons and perhaps even begin to shoot .
By this time , however , it might very well be too late to escape their attack .
They will have selected their attack site and employed the forces they believe they need to complete the operation .
While the kidnappers could botch their operation and the target could escape unscathed , it is simply not practical to pin one 's hopes on that possibility .
It is clearly better to spot the kidnappers early and avoid their trap before it is sprung and the guns come out .
We have seen many instances of people in Mexico with armed security being kidnapped , and we believe we will likely see more cases of this in the coming months .
This trend is due not only to the presence of highly armed and aggressive criminals and the low quality of some security personnel , but also to people placing their trust solely in reactive physical security .
Ignoring the very real value of critical , proactive measures such as situational awareness , countersurveillance and protective intelligence can be a fatal mistake .
Currently , there are fairly generic terms to describe balanced news coverage , such as “ both sides of the story , ” which represent journalistic ideals , not legal requirements .
But with Democratic proponents of the so - called “ Fairness Doctrine ” now empowered in a new Congress , opponents of forced balance are speaking out against possible legislation .
Repealed by the FCC in 1987 , the legislation required broadcasters – who use government - owned airwaves to transmit their content – to provide equal representation for both sides of a political issue .
President Barack Obama had said during the 2008 presidential campaign that he does not support reinstatement of the law .
But there is an appetite for the law in the Democratic camp .
While no legislation recalling the measure has been introduced , the concept has prominent supporters in the newly Democrat - heavy Congress , including Sens.
Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) , Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , and Richard Durbin ( D - IL ) .
Supporters ' rationale for the Fairness Doctrine is that the airwaves are owned by the public .
Critics fear that a new law could compel radio and TV stations , for example , to balance liberal and conservative hosts .
“ I believe very strongly that the airwaves are public and people use these airwaves for profit , ” Feinstein told The Hill in 2007 .
“ But there is a responsibility to see that both sides ... of the big public questions of debate of the day , are aired ... with some modicum of fairness . ”
Yet , FCC commissioner Robert McDowell has warned that a new bill , or other efforts to regulate public affairs coverage , could go beyond TV and radio to the Internet , cable , and satellite radio , according to a report in Broadcasting & Cable .
Chris Battle , partner at public affairs firm the Adfero Group , says there is little need for the law since the popularization of blogging and other do - it - yourself media .
The proliferation of such platforms has also made it more difficult for a federal agency to regulate , he adds .
“ Debate is a very nuanced , complex thing , ” he says .
“ How do you decide what consists one side or the other ?
Those are the kind of absurd questions that would have to be very seriously debated , [ such as ] who [ is ] the official and final voice of what represents one side ? ”
Opponents of the Fairness Doctrine have another important ally in McDowell , who said in a January 29 speech that he opposes the legislation , partially on practical grounds that it could not be enforced , especially if proponents tried to apply it to the blogosphere .
“ If the doctrine were to return in some form or another , does anyone think the [ FCC ] is any better equipped today than it was in 1973 to untangle the knotty problems of enforcement by assuming the role of editor - at - large for the entire country ? ” he asked rhetorically .
“ Even if the FCC had a large number of people to devote to such reviews , which it does n't , and even if the prospect of government regulators scrutinizing individual editorial choices were not so constitutionally unsavory , which it is in practical terms , enforcement of the doctrine presents intellectually thorny challenges . ”
However unlikely its reimplementation , Battle adds that the Fairness Doctrine – even if applied only to now - conservative - dominated talk radio – could benefit the PR sector .
If the measure were to gain passage , PR firms could , in theory , demand airtime for their clients , he says .
“ In a sense , it could be a boon for the PR industry , ” he says , “ because any time Rush Limbaugh [ or a liberal host ] makes an argument that goes against the message or mission of a client , [ a PR pro ] could call up with the law on [ his or her ] side and demand an opportunity to put the client 's views forward . ”
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -
The auto industry 's historic meltdown showed no signs of relenting in January , with Ford Motor Co. , General Motors Corp . and Chrysler on Tuesday posting U.S. sales declines of more than 40 % -- below even the lowest of Wall Street targets .
Toyota Motor Corp. TM , - 1.29 % , on the brink of posting its first - ever operating loss , fared only slightly better as the entire global auto industry continues to suffer .
With the majority of automakers having reported , the annualized sales rate for the month is poised to break below 10 million cars and trucks .
Analysts had predicted an annual sales rate of 10.2 million .
" It 's actually a little worse than we were expecting and we were one of the lowest in terms of what we were forecasting for January , but we 're not surprised at all , " IHS Global Insight analyst John Wolkonowicz said .
" This is going to be a very tough year for the auto industry . "
Listen to full interview .
The lowly figures also touch levels not seen since the early 1980s as consumers sit on their cash in the face of soaring unemployment and plunging home values .
In fact , GM sales analyst Mike DiGiovanni said in a conference call the industry numbers are on track to mark the worst January since 1963 and , if the rate hits 9.8 million vehicles , would mark the first time ever that China has surpassed the U.S. in terms of monthly sales .
Ford kicks off the carnage
Ford Motor Co. F , - 1.34 % reported a 40.2 % drop in the world 's biggest car market last month , pinning the blame on a pullback from its fleet customers and saying its retail business has stabilized since the swift retreat last fall .
Ford sales , including the Volvo brand , which is currently being shopped , pulled back to 93,506 from 156,391 a year earlier .
“ " Even with a boost from the anticipated federal stimulus plan , we see consumers taking a cautious approach to large - ticket discretionary purchases . " ” — Efraim Levy , S&P Equities analyst
Ford , Lincoln and Mercury car sales dropped 35.1 % to 28,707 .
Trucks fell 40.5 % to 61,889 , with the flagship F - Series pickup down 38.6 % .
Fleet sales , primarily to rental - car companies , plunged 65 % , the company said .
The retail business slipped 27 % , though Ford pointed out that it gained retail market share for the fourth consecutive month , a streak it last assembled in 1995 .
Ford is looking for government stimulus to provide some support or maybe even a catalyst heading into the second half of what looks to be a very difficult year .
Standard & Poor 's Equity Research Services analyst Efraim Levy reiterated his hold rating on shares of Ford following the results , warning that if retail declines were to continue at this rate , the company , like its domestic rivals , will likely have to tap the government for loans .
" Even with a boost from the anticipated federal stimulus plan , we see consumers taking a cautious approach to large - ticket discretionary purchases , " Levy said .
Ford shares shrugged off early declines to close up more than 4 % higher at $ 1.96 .
Ford last week posted a fourth - quarter loss of $ 5.9 billion , bringing its total loss for the year to $ 14.6 billion , the company 's worst ever .

GM slashes production ; Chrysler leads declines
GM GM , - 2.37 % said its sales fell 48.9 % to 128,198 light vehicles from 250,926 in January 2008 .
The car side plunged 57.9 % to 43,943 while truck sales lost 42.5 % to 84,255 .
The automaker also forecasted its North American production to total 380,000 vehicles in the first quarter - 118,000 cars and 262,000 trucks , down 57 % from the same quarter last year .
DiGiovanni blamed not only lower fleet sales , but also the customer 's inability to obtain adequate financing .
" People are coming in , wanting to buy vehicles and they 're being turned down , just that simple , " he said .
" We have to break and thaw the credit markets for consumers who want to buy automobiles .
We 're seeing some minor thawing occurring but not nearly enough . "
The dismal numbers come as GM , along with Chrysler , prepares to update the U.S. government as to whether the recent federal bailout is yielding the necessary results .
GM shares failed to hold positive territory , closing down 1.4 % at $ 2.85 .
Separately , Chrysler was hit the hardest of all , with its sales down 55 % to 62,157 cars and trucks from a year ago on the back of an 81 % drop in fleet sales .
As was the case with GM , Steve Landry , head of Chrysler sales and marketing , pointed to the lack of consumer credit , not so much waning demand for Chrysler vehicles .
" We saw a negative trend in December , we 're seeing it again this month and we could see it for the year , " he said .
" Many more consumers wanted to buy a vehicle than could qualify for financing under the current credit conditions . "
Same story for the Japanese
Toyota said its U.S. sales declined 31.7 % to 117,287 vehicles from 171,849 a year ago .
Passenger - car sales fell 28.9 % to 67,263 , while light - truck sales dropped 37.6 % to 42,548 .
Toyota is scheduled to hold a conference call Friday to discuss what is expected to be a massive loss .
Honda Motor Co. HMC , - 1.18 % reported a drop of 27.9 % to 71,031 vehicles from 98,511 a year ago .
Total U.S. car sales slipped to 40,532 from 55,345 a year ago , and truck sales dropped to 30,499 from 43,166 last year .
Nissan Motors NSANY , +2.27 % said sales fell 29.7 % to 53,884 units from 76,605 a year ago .
Nissan brand sales fell to 46,769 vehicles from 67,961 , and sales of the luxury Infiniti line dropped to 7,115 units from 8,644 a year ago .
Shares of Toyota , Honda and Nissan all rose at least 2.5 % for the session .
On a positive sales note , Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. bucked the prevailing industry trend by reporting a 14.3 % rise to 24,512 units from 21,452 units in January 2008 .
Hyundai sold 1,056 of its luxury model Genesis sedan .
" We got off to a quick start in January thanks to the rollout of our all new Hyundai Assurance Program , which has struck a chord with the American consumer during these uncertain times , " Hyundai 's head of U.S. sales Dave Zuchowski said .
The " Assurance Program " provides insurance against new car buyers losing their jobs or suffering some other life altering events .
Today ’s ABC Radio National
All in the Mind has a fascinating discussion on how we attribute intentions to other people which covers some surprising and counter - intuitive examples of how our understanding of other people ’s desires are biased by the situation .
There ’s a great example depicted in this YouTube video which I highly recommend , but essentially the example is this :
A vice president of a large company goes to the CEO and says “ We have a new business plan .
It will make huge amounts of money for the company , but it will also harm the environment ” .
The CEO says “ I know the plan will harm the environment , but I do n’t care about that , I ’m just interested in making as much money as we possibly can .
So let ’s put the plan into action ” .
The company starts the plan , and the environment is harmed .
The question is , did the CEO harm the environment intentionally ?
As it turns out , most people say yes to this question .
Now have a think about this similar scenario .
A vice president of a large company goes to the CEO and says “ We have a new business plan .
It will make huge amounts of money for the company , but it will also help the environment ” .
The CEO says “ I know the plan will help the environment , but I do n’t care about that , I ’m just interested in making as much money as we possibly can .
So let ’s put the plan into action ” .
The company starts the plan , and the environment is helped .
The question is the same – did the CEO intentionally help the environment in this case .
Curiously , most people say no .
Despite the CEO making the same decision in both cases .
The programme is full of many more fascinating examples of how our judgement of intention is affected by the outcome rather than the decision the person makes .
However , I wonder whether our judgements are clouded by the notion of responsibility rather than purely intention , where we place much greater social weight on responsibility for damaging actions , than beneficial ones .
This area is largely being explored by the new area of ‘ experimental philosophy ‘ that aims to empirically test our assumptions about traditionally philosophical issues .

Explore an interactive map of the world warmed by 4 °C
ALLIGATORS basking off the English coast ; a vast Brazilian desert ; the mythical lost cities of Saigon , New Orleans , Venice and Mumbai ; and 90 per cent of humanity vanished .
Welcome to the world warmed by 4 °C .
Clearly this is a vision of the future that no one wants , but it might happen .
Fearing that the best efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions may fail , or that planetary climate feedback mechanisms will accelerate warming , some scientists and economists are considering not only what this world of the future might be like , but how it could sustain a growing human population .
They argue that surviving in the kinds of numbers that exist today , or even more , will be possible , but only if we use our uniquely human ingenuity to cooperate as a species to radically reorganise our world .
The good news is that the survival of humankind itself is not at stake : the species could continue if only a couple of hundred individuals remained .
But maintaining the current global population of nearly 7 billion , or more , is going to require serious planning .
Four degrees may not sound like much – after all , it is less than a typical temperature change between night and day .
It might sound quite pleasant , like moving to Florida from Boston , say , or retiring from the UK to southern Spain .
An average warming of the entire globe by 4 °C is a very …
As the One Laptop Per Child project scrambles to revitalize itself after numerous setbacks , staff layoffs and dismal sales , it could find the footing it needs to survive by playing to its product 's hidden strength as a low - priced , take - it - anywhere e-book reader .
The OLPC's XO Children 's Machine is still a little clunky around the edges , and the availability of free , modern e-books is slim .
But several open source projects are emerging that promise to improve the XO 's capability as an e-book reader .
Once the kinks around software and content are ironed out , the XO could be pitched to commuters , students and travelers as a purely consumer device — " it 's the rugged Kindle ! " — the OLPC project can generate much - needed revenue to fund its educational , open - hardware goals .
" It is a great e-book , " says Walter Bender , former president of OLPC software and content who is now the head of Sugar Labs , the non-profit group that continues to develop the XO 's " Sugar " interface .
Bender says he can't speak for OLPC regarding its sales strategy , but he does say that its laptop has a significant advantage :
Unlike e-books devices like Amazon 's Kindle or Sony 's Reader , the XO is a fully featured computer .
" So while you can use it to read a PDF or wiki page , " he says in an e-mail , " you can also use it to annotate pages , write commentary , or even publish your own book : consumer as producer . "
Like Bender , those involved directly with the project are quick to point out that OLPC is still primarily focused on serving the developing world and not consumers .
But they also acknowledge that the little green - and - white machine fills a niche .
The XO laptop 's greatest asset is the quality of its hardware .
It 's beefy and difficult to damage .
The battery lasts around six hours under normal use — not as long as the Kindle or Sony 's Reader , but comparable to newer netbooks — and it lasts a few hours longer if you turn off the backlight behind the LCD screen .
The XO 's screen was designed for high visibility with the backlight off , especially outdoors in daylight .
You can also flip the screen around and put the XO into tablet mode .
When you do , it 's comfortable to hold and scroll through pages using the keypads under your thumbs .
It 's cheap , too .
An XO Children 's Machine , when purchased through the Give 1 , Get 1 program , costs $ 200 — cheaper than Amazon 's Kindle ( $ 360 ) and Sony 's Reader ( $ 270 ) .
OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte has been making the rounds with a mocked - up design of the next generation XO , a booklike dual screen computer with a hinge .
Negroponte says the new hardware will be ready in 2010 .
In the meantime , the XO 's creators are n't interested in pimping out their hardware to turn a quick profit , but they do see the potential .
" We 're not planning on selling machines directly to people in the U.S. , but the XO is an awesome e-book reader , " says OLPC director of community content S.J. Klein .
" Our primary interests are in making sure there are amazing new books for people to use , and in making the experience as interesting and engaging as possible . "
The availability of books for the device is one major stumbling point .
For example , you can't buy a bestseller at Amazon and expect it to work on your XO .
The files are saddled with Digital Rights Management , or DRM , restrictions that limit you to reading on an approved device — such as Amazon 's Kindle .
There are free books to be had , though .
The Internet Archive currently has one million books available for free , and the nonprofit continues to add to its library at a rate of 1,000 books a day .
There are also thousands of free books available through sites like Gutenberg.org , Manybooks.net and Feedbooks.com .
The XO also has the ability to read offline web pages , so a user can download stories from news websites and read them on a train or on the beach .
Still , the software is young and presents usability problems .
Sugar , the XO 's Linux - based desktop environment , can be confusing for adults used to their Windows and Mac desktops .
It comes with some bare - bones reader software built in , but to get type to display optimally , you have to learn how to install fonts — using a Linux command line , no less .
Some e-books also have to be re-formatted with larger type or narrower margins before you can read them without a heap of zooming and scrolling .
" I definitely agree that one of the strengths of the OLPC is the e-book reader ability , " says Aleksandar Kalev , a software developer working on an e-book viewer for the XO .
" However , I do n't think that , for the moment , it could compete with the dedicated e-readers . "
The device is too big and a bit too sluggish , and Sugar is too young of an operating system , he says .
Sugar Labs plans to release a new version of the Sugar desktop for the XO in March 2009 , featuring an improved default reader .
There are also several open source software alternatives in the works that significantly improve the e-book experience .
The most promising is GnuBook , which uses HTML and JavaScript to render pages in an easy - to - browse interface .
There 's also the more mature FBReader , which integrates directly with online libraries .
The Evince community , which produces a document viewer for Linux , has been working closely with the OLPC project as well .
Whatever innovations come about , they will happen with the project 's educational goals in mind , says OLPC 's Klein .
" We want it to be an awesome experience for everyone , but especially for teachers and people reading in classrooms , " he says .
" And especially classrooms that do n't have walls or paper . "

Definitions
P + F = C + 2 , where
P is the number of phases in the system A phase is any physically separable material in the system .
Every unique mineral is a phase ( including polymorphs ) ; igneous melts , liquids ( aqueous solutions ) , and vapor are also considered unique phases .
It is possible to have two or more phases in the same state of matter ( e.g. solid mineral assemblages , immiscible silicate and sulfide melts , immiscible liquids such as water and hydrocarbons , etc. )
Phases may either be pure compounds or mixtures such as solid or aqueous solutions -- but they must " behave " as a coherent substance with fixed chemical and physical properties .
C is the minimum number of chemical components required to constitute all the phases in the system For historical reasons , geologists normally define components in terms of the simple oxides ( e.g. SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , CaO , etc. ) .
If two possible components always occur in the same proportions in multiple phases in a system , these can be combined into a single component ( remember , we are always trying to define the minimum number of components required to make all the phases in the system ) .
Consider the reaction :
CaMg( CO 3 ) 2 + 2 SiO 2 = CaMgSi 2 O 6 + 2 CO 2
Dolomite + 2 Quartz = Diopside + 2 Carbon Dioxide
Normally we would pick the 4 components : CaO , MgO , SiO 2 , and CO 2 based on the simple oxides .
However , because Ca and Mg are in a 1:1 ratio in both dolomite and diopside ( and not present in quartz or carbon dioxide ) , we can consider this a ternary system with components : CaMgO 2 , SiO 2 , and CO 2
In some geologic systems it is convenient to define the components in terms of end - member compositions ( e.g. binary systems such as carbonates , CaCO 3 - MgCO 3 ; alkali feldspars , NaAlSi 3 O 8 - KAlSi 3 O 8 , etc. ) .
In some cases , a given mineral assemblage may be represented by a sub-set of the whole system if fewer components are needed to define the compositions of the observed mineral assemblage -- this is known as a degenerate system .
A good example of this can be seen on a ternary ( 3 component ) chemographic projection if the phases of interest plot in a co-linear fashion ( i.e. requiring only two components to define the phase compositions in what is otherwise a three component system ) .
A more complete discussion of components can be found in the section on Plotting Mineral Compositions and Chemographic Projections .
F is the number of degrees of freedom in the system ( also referred to as the variance of the system ) .
For geologic applications , this generally refers to the number of variables ( e.g. pressure and temperature ) that can be independently changed without altering the state of the system ( i.e. the number of phases and their compositions are constant ) .
Three common types of equilibria are possible : Invariant equilibria , in which neither P or T can be changed ; on a phase diagram , this is represented as a singular invariant point
Univariant equilibria , in which either P or T can be changed independently , but to maintain the state of the system , there must be a corresponding change in the other variable ; on a phase diagram this is referred to as a univariant curve
and Divariant equilibria , in which both P and T are free to change independently without changing the state of the system ( but bounded by the conditions defined by the univariant equilibria ) .
The integer in the Gibbs Phase Rule is related to the number of intensive parameters ( i.e. those that are independent of mass ; such as pressure and temperature ) that are being considered .
Note that many phase diagrams consider only one intensive parameter ( e.g. T - X fluid , where T is intensive , and the mole fraction of fluid is related to the amount of mass of the fluid components ) ; in this case , the Gibbs Phase Rule would be : P + F = C + 1 .

The system is entirely composed of H 2 O , so there is only one component present .
O , so there is only one component present .
The phases present represent three states of matter : liquid ( water ) , solid ( ice ) , and vapor ( steam ) .
All have distinct physical properties ( e.g. density , structure -- or lack of , etc. ) and chemical properties ( e.g. Δ G formation , molar volume etc. ) so they must be considered distinct phases .
G molar volume etc. ) so they must be considered distinct phases .
Note that there is only one point on this diagram where all three phases coexist in equilibrium -- this " triple point " is also referred to as an invariant point ; because P and T are uniquely specified , there are zero degrees of freedom .
Each of the curves represents a chemical reaction that describes a phase transformation : solid to liquid ( melt / crystallization ) , liquid to vapor ( boiling / condensation ) , solid to vapor ( sublimation / deposition ) .
There are three univariant curves around the invariant point ; it is always the case that for a C - component system , there will always be C+2 univariant curves radiating around an invariant point .
This relationship is further explained in the unit on the Method of Schreinemakers .
There is only one degree of freedom along each of the univariant curves : you can independently change either T or P , but to maintain two coexisting phases along the curve the second variable must change by a corresponding fixed amount .
There are three distinct areas where only ice , liquid , or vapor exit .
These are divariant fields .
T and P are both free to change within these fields and you will still have only one phase ( a bit hotter or colder , or compressed or expanded , but nonetheless the same phase ) .
The end of the " boiling curve " , separating the liquid to vapor transition , is called the " critical point " .
This is a particularly interesting part of the phase diagram because beyond this region the physico - chemical properties of water and steam converge to the point where they are identical .
Thus , beyond the critical point , we refer to this single phase as a " supercritical fluid " .
Phase diagram for the one component system Al 2 SiO 5 .
The entire system is defined by one component : Al 2 SiO 5 ( i.e. all the phases can be completely made of this one component )
SiO ( i.e. all the phases can be completely made of this one component )
There are three solid phases shown in this diagram : the polymorphs of Al 2 SiO 5 andalusite , kyanite and sillimanite .
SiO andalusite , kyanite and sillimanite .
There is only one unique place on this diagram where all three phases can coexist in equilibrium -- the invariant point at 3.8 Kb and 500 o C ; at this point there are zero degrees of freedom .
C ; at this point there are zero degrees of freedom .
There are three univariant reactions on this diagram , each representing the phase transitions : andalusite = sillimanite , andalusite = kyanite , and kyanite = sillimanite .
In each of these reactions , either pressure or temperature can be changed independently , but for the state of the system to remain the same ( i.e. two solid phases coexisting in equilibrium ) , the other variable must change by a fixed amount to maintain the assemblage on the univariant curve -- so there is one degree of freedom .
In a later section , we will see that the univariant curves represent the condition where Δ G rxn = 0 ( i.e. the intersection of the " free energy surface " with the Pressure - Temperature plane represented by the phase diagram ) .
G = 0 ( i.e. the intersection of the " free energy surface " with the Pressure - Temperature plane represented by the phase diagram ) .
There are three divariant fields in which only a single mineral phase is stable .
Within these fields pressure and temperature may be changed independently without changing the state of the system -- thus there are two degrees of freedom in the divariant fields .
Assumptions
The relationships described by the Gibbs ' Phase Rule apply the concepts of equilibrium thermodynamics .
It is assumed that geologic systems have enough time to naturally equilibrate .
It is also assumed that geologic systems are " closed " systems -- that is the mass of the system remains essentially constant , and the system is free to consume or liberate energy to do work .
For geologic systems , heat and work are considered to be the major contributors to the system 's energetics -- that is , " P - V work " is the dominant source of energy consumed / liberated by the system .
We do not consider the effects of external fields ( e.g. electrical , magnetic , gravitational ) , and we do not consider surface energy or boundary effects .
No kinetic effects are considered .
This may present problems with an equilibrium thermodynamics approach if metastable phases are present in the system .
In natural settings it is common for a given mineral to exist under physical conditions that exceed its predicted stability limits .
A good example is the persistence of kyanite into the sillimanite stability field .
This particular reaction a ) has a very small Δ G rxn ( and thus , a small " driving force " to make the reaction go ) , and b ) the polymorphic reaction is of the " reconstructive " kind , and requires the breaking and reforming of strong covalent bonds .
The presence of metastable phases may complicate matters in trying to determine the equilibrium conditions for stable mineral assemblages , but they are essential indicators of changing physical conditions that allow us to interpret Pressure - Temeperature - time Paths .
G ( and thus , a small " driving force " to make the reaction go ) , and b ) the polymorphic reaction is of the " reconstructive " kind , and requires the breaking and reforming of strong covalent bonds .
The presence of metastable phases may complicate matters in trying to determine the equilibrium conditions for stable mineral assemblages , but they are essential indicators of changing physical conditions that allow us to interpret Pressure - Temeperature - time Paths .
In some cases , surface reactions ( e.g. sorption , catalysis ) may operate in geological environment and contribute to the overall energetics of the system .
Surface energies are not included in the Gibbs Phase Rule formulation .
Gibbs ' Phase Rule cannot be applied indiscriminately .
It is important to obtain the best possible characterization of the identity , composition and structural state of the phases present .
For example , complex materials such as mixed layer silicates may cause problems , or minerals that exhibit a range of structural states ( e.g. the alkali feldspars ) .
An overview of analytical techniques that are used to characterize minerals , melts and fluids can be found at the companion website on Geochemical Instrumentation and Analysis
Recognizing these assumptions and limitations , the Gibbs Phase Rule still provides a powerful way to analyze and interpret geological systems .
Although geologic systems are dynamic and often in a state of disequilibrium , the equilibrium approach demonstrates what the state of the system would be given sufficient time and energy to achieve that equilibrium .
It also provides information on the phase changes or reactions that would be expected in a system that is thrown out of equilibrium due to changes in physical conditions .
Thus a knowledge of the sequence of possible reactions provides important information about " pathways " in geologic systems that allow interpretations of tectonic environments , petrogenetic processes , and the evolution of geologic systems ( see following chapters on Pseudosections , P - T-t Paths , and Advanced Modeling Programs ( ThermoCalc , TWEEQ , PERPLEX , MELTS ) .
Derivation of the Phase Rule
Minerals are the monitors of the physical and chemical conditions under which they formed .
The occurrences of minerals , their parageneses ( stable associations ) , types of reactions , and compositional variation ( e.g. zoned minerals ) all provide important information about geologic history and processes .
Of particular importance to geologists are : Gibbs ' Phase Rule provides the theoretical foundation , based in thermodynamics , for characterizing the chemical state of a ( geologic ) system , and predicting the equilibrium relations of the phases ( minerals , melts , liquids , vapors ) present as a function of physical conditions such as pressure and temperature .
Gibbs '
Phase Rule also allows us to construct phase diagrams to represent and interpret phase equilibria in heterogeneous geologic systems .
In the simplest understanding of phase diagrams , stable phase ( mineral ) assemblages are represented as " fields " ( see colored areas on the figure to the right ) in " P - T space " , and the boundaries between stable phase assemblages are defined by lines ( or curves ) that represent reactions between the phase assemblages .
The reaction curves actually represent the condition ( or the locus of points in P - T space ) where=0 ; for more information on this point see Gibbs Free Energy .
A solid understanding of Gibbs ' Phase Rule is required to successfully master the applications of heterogeneous phase equilibria presented in this module .
Gibbs Phase Rule is expressed by the simple formulation :
It is generally the case that as the number of components increase , the variance of the system must also increase .
Conversely , as the number of phases increase in the system , the variance of the system must correspondingly decrease .
A corollary to Gibbs ' Phase Rule is : for a given rock in equilibrium at a fixed P and T , the number of phases is less than or equal to the number of components .
Geologic systems are really rather simple !
This means that we have a reasonable expectation that we can successfully interpret the conditions of formation of rocks in their natural settings , and to model their behavior using the thermodynamic databases and programs presented at the end of this module .
Let 's consider the simple 1 component system for HO :
Now , let 's consider a simple 1 component system that describes the mineral phases in the aluminosilicate system :
These principles extend to the more complicated binary , ternary and multi- component systems presented in the next section (s ) of this module on Phase Diagrams and Pseudosections
There are a number of important assumptions that must be considered when applying Gibbs ' Phase Rule :
It is important to recognize that the simple formulation of Gibbs ' Phase Rule is derivative from fundamental thermodynamic principles .
The Gibbs - Duhem equation establishes the relationship between the intensive parameters temperature ( T ) and pressure ( P ) and the chemical potential of all components ( μ i ) in the system :
dG = Vdp - Sdt + ΣN i dμ i
This means that there are
C + 2 independent variables that describe the system : P , T and one each for the chemical potential for all components , and
P independent equations ( of the Gibbs - Duhem form ) that describe the energetics of the system -- one equation for each phase .
In mathematical terms , the variance ( F ) is determined by the difference between ( C+2 ) variables and ( P ) equations .
Thus , or as originally written ,

It is quite likely that you have not heard of the most important developments this week in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
In the West Bank , while it has been " occupation as normal " , there have been some events that together should be overshadowing Gaza , Gilad Shalit and Avigdor Lieberman .
First , there have been a large number of Israeli raids on Palestinian villages , with dozens of Palestinians abducted .
These kinds of raids are , of course , commonplace for the occupied West Bank , but in recent days it appears the Israeli military has targeted sites of particularly strong Palestinian civil resistance to the separation wall .
For three consecutive days this week , Israeli forces invaded Jayyous , a village battling for survival as their agricultural land is lost to the wall and neighbouring Jewish colony .
The soldiers occupied homes , detained residents , blocked off access roads , vandalised property , beat protestors , and raised the Israeli flag at the top of several buildings .
Jayyous is one of the Palestinian villages in the West Bank that has been non-violently resisting the separation wall for several years now .
It was clear to the villagers that this latest assault was an attempt to intimidate the protest movement .
Also earlier this week , Israel tightened still further the restrictions on Palestinian movement and residency rights in East Jerusalem , closing the remaining passage in the wall in the Ar - Ram neighbourhood of the city .
This means that tens of thousands of Palestinians are now cut off from the city and those with the right permit will now have to enter the city by first heading north and using the Qalandiya checkpoint .
Finally – and this time , there was some modest media coverage – it was revealed that the Efrat settlement near Bethlehem would be expanded by the appropriation of around 420 acres land as " state land " .
According to Efrat 's mayor , the plan is to triple the number of residents in the colony .
Looked at together , these events in the West Bank are of far more significance than issues being afforded a lot of attention currently , such as the truce talks with Hamas , or the discussions about a possible prisoner - exchange deal .
Hamas itself has become such a focus , whether by those who urge talks and cooption or those who advocate the group 's total destruction , that the wider context is forgotten .
Hamas is not the beginning or the end of this conflict , a movement that has been around for just the last third of Israel 's 60 years .
The Hamas Charter is not a Palestinian national manifesto , and nor is it even particularly central to today 's organisation .
Before Hamas existed , Israel was colonising the occupied territories , and maintaining an ethnic exclusivist regime ; if Hamas disappeared tomorrow , Israeli colonisation certainly would not .
Recognising what is happening in the West Bank also contextualises the discussion about Israel 's domestic politics , and the ongoing question about the makeup of a ruling coalition .
For the Palestinians , it does not make much difference who is eventually sitting around the Israeli cabinet table , since there is a consensus among the parties on one thing : a firm rejectionist stance with regards to Palestinian self - determination and sovereignty .
During the coverage of the Israeli elections , while it was clear that Palestinians mostly did not care which of the candidates for PM won , the reason for this apathy was not explained .
Labor , Likud and Kadima alike , Israeli governments without fail have continued or intensified the colonisation of the occupied territories , entrenching Israel 's separate - and - unequal rule , a reality belied by the false " dove " / " hawk " dichotomy .
Which brings us to the third reason why news from the West Bank is more significant than the Gaza truce talks or the Netanyahu - Livni rivalry – it is a further reminder that the two - state solution has completed its progression from worthy ( and often disingenuous ) aim to meaningless slogan , concealing Israel 's absorption of all Palestine / Israel and confinement of the Palestinians into enclaves .
The fact that the West Bank reality means the end of the two - state paradigm has started to be picked up by mainstream , liberal commentators in the US , in the wake of the Israeli elections .
Juan Cole , the history professor and blogger , recently pointed out that there are now only three options left for Palestine / Israel : " apartheid " , " expulsion " , or " one state " .
The path of the wall , and the number of Palestinians it directly and indirectly affects , continues to make a mockery of any plan for Palestinian statehood .
Jayyous is just one example of the way in which the Israeli- planned , fenced - in Palestinian " state - lets " are at odds with the stated intention of the quartet and so many others , of two viable states , " side by side " .
As the World Bank pointed out ( pdf ) , land colonisation is not conducive to economic prosperity or basic independence .
In occupied East Jerusalem meanwhile , Israel has continued its process of Judaisation , enforced through bureaucracy and bulldozers .
The latest tightening of the noose in Ar - Ram is one example of where Palestinian Jerusalemites are at risk of losing their residency status , victims of what is politely known as the " demographic battle " .
It is impossible to imagine Palestinians accepting a " state " shaped by the contours of Israel 's wall , disconnected not only from East Jerusalem but even from parts of itself .
Yet this is the essence of the " solution " being advanced by Israeli leaders across party lines .
For a real sense of where the conflict is heading , look to the West Bank , not just Gaza .
It was a voice of anguish that pierced a nation .
Israeli TV broadcast a father ’s heartbreak Friday night when a Palestinian doctor living in Gaza made a frantic phone call to a newscaster saying an Israeli tank had shelled his home , killing three of his daughters and injuring other family members .
Izz el - Deen Aboul Aish , who speaks Hebrew , worked as a gynecologist in an Israeli hospital .
Even as the crossings between the Gaza Strip and Israel had largely been closed in recent months , he had traveled frequently from one place to the other .
But he had remained in Gaza since the Israeli offensive began 21 days ago .
He gave frequent interviews to the Israeli media on living conditions in the seaside enclave .
He spoke of having tanks around his house and of passing through checkpoints ; he told Israelis what it was like to be Palestinian .
Minutes away from a scheduled phone interview on Israeli TV 10 with newscaster Shlomi Eldar , Aboul Aish called Eldar ’s cellphone , screaming and weeping in Arabic and Hebrew .
The doctor ’s home had been struck by a shell :
Advertisement
“ Oh God , oh my God , my daughters have been killed .
They ’ve killed my children .
. . .
Could somebody please come to us ? ”
Sitting at his news desk for one of Israel ’s main evening news broadcasts , Eldar held his phone up .
For three minutes and 26 seconds , Aboul Aish ’s wailing was broadcast across the country .
Eldar welled up .
He put his head down .
He looked at the camera .
He looked at his phone .
He made pleas for help for the family , but the doctor kept crying , his voice scratchy , like sand on paper , until Eldar took out his earpiece and walked off the set to try to arrange for help .
The newscaster ’s bewildered face seemed to capture a bit of pause in a nation that has largely supported its military campaign and prefers not to question its course .
News reports said there had been shooting in the area of the doctor ’s house before the shelling .
The Israeli military had no immediate comment .
Advertisement
Israeli officials permitted ambulances carrying members of the doctor ’s family to cross the border to a hospital .
Aboul Aish was a single father .
His wife had died of cancer .
He made his daughters sleep close to the walls of their home in hopes that would keep them safe if airstrikes or artillery collapsed the ceiling .
“ I do n’t know how this man will stand on his feet again after this tragedy , ” Dr. Liat Lerner - Geya , an Israeli who worked with Aboul Aish , told the Hebrew - language news website Ynet .
“ He would come to Israel and sleep at friends ’ houses for three nights .
Even though he had all the necessary permits , they always gave him trouble at the crossings .
But he believed there should be coexistence and practiced this in his work . ”
After the newscast , Eldar met with reporters .
He said the doctor told him that evening “ that since his wife ’s passing , the girls had been his entire life .
He said his eldest daughter wanted to study at Haifa University .
Just today another one of his daughters had told him she had gotten her period .
‘ In the middle of a war you get your period .
You are a woman now . ’ ”
Advertisement
She and her sisters are dead .
The news spread across Israel ’s websites ; the video of the doctor ’s broadcast quickly made it to YouTube .
Eldar said of Aboul Aish : “ It is simply surreal .
He is part of this place yet not of it , belonging and not belonging . ”
Even so , across Israel the doctor ’s anguished voice kept playing over and over .

“ Kavoshgar ” Launch Site shown in yellow ; Satellite and rocket body shown in white
There will be plenty of time to discuss the security implications of Iran ’s Omid satellite but for right now , let ’s take a minute to appreciate the technological feat it represents !
In the face of world opposition and sanctions , Iran has joined a very exclusive club : those countries that have managed to orbit a satellite .
NASA has posted the first orbital elements of the satellite and its third stage rocket body and , running the orbits backwards , they are totally consistent with a launch from the “ Kavoshgar ” launch site at 18:38 on 2 February 2009 ( GMT ) .
Both the satellite and the rocket body come together and pass over the launch site at that time .
The objects both have inclinations of about 55 degrees which is consistent with a launch toward the South East , which does not fully take advantage of the rotation of the Earth and was presumably chosen for range safety issues .
( Sorry , a previous version of this post was somewhat confused on this point due to my wanting to get it posted as soon as possible ! )
The objects ended up in orbits with apogees of 322 km and perigees of 242 km .
The orbital period of 90 minutes implies an orbit that is slightly lower than the Iranian statement of 14 orbits per day but not troublingly so .
( My guess is that Iran must have had sufficient telemetry to do a preliminary orbital analysis at the time of the satellite separation though the satellite would certainly have been visible from Iran after its first orbit . )
The two stages to the Safir launcher that are visible in the pre-launch photos would not , I believe , get a satellite into orbit .
The most likely explanation is a solid - propellant third stage inside the clam shell nose faring .
What would be helpful is if somebody ( amateurs ? ) watched the brightness of the rocket body ( once that is definitively identified ) to see if we can get some indication of its size from that .
There should definitely be a considerable size difference between Safir second stage ( which is about 5 m long and 1.25 meters in diameter ) and a hypothesized third stage inside the clamshell .
Update : Amateur satellite observers in the UK have have used the radio signals from 2009 - 004A to determine it is the satellite .
Optical observations seem to indicate that the rocket body is considerably brighter ( mag. 4.5 ) than the satellite ( which varies between 5 and 7 ) .
This would seem to favor the two stage hypothesis : Iran has probably developed a more powerful fuel / engine combination for the second stage !
Now we can start being concerned about the security implications .
One of the biggest questions that linger in the minds of millions of international students in the US now is that of their longevity in these foreign grounds .
As the coronavirus outbreak brought about plenty of changes to the entire world , the US also had to go through quite a few regulations that made life a bit different .
But in the last three months , it was n’t just the pandemic that meddled with the peace in the country .
The ‘ Black Lives Matter ’ movement and riots was a game - changer in the history of the country , and now the news of Kanye West contesting for the Presidential elections has taken the world by a storm .
As most people have found their comfort in lounging over their couches all day long , some are still struggling to live with this reality .
The ones who are being targeted now are the international students who flew from the homeland to this country of dreams to build their career .
With the latest changes brought to the visa regulations , many of these students are facing a hard time preparing to face these challenges .
Trump ’s Far - Reaching Impositions
Returning to an American institution has been put under the haze now as the directive by the Trump administration aims at pushing the students who are pursuing their courses on the online platforms .
They would be stripped of their visas as the classes are moving online without much relevance for the existence of institutes .
While the students seem targeted and eyed for the clear attempt of riding them off from the grounds for a stable future after the pandemic , the universities look onto this move by the government as a political attempt to put pressure on them to reopen .
Many of the students consider this as a flaw in the logistics of the country and its institutions .
However , the ones who have spent a chunk of their parents ’ earnings on their studies and are from countries that have insufficient technologies to aid online learning are facing the hardest time with their future having been seemingly altered .
In - person classes for international students might seem like an improbable program , and millions of students can get affected badly .
The unprecedented pandemic has hampered the students who were about to complete their program this year , and this directive has further added uncertainty to their lives .
Some of them are rueful about the decision of opting for the university in America over the prestigious ones in their homeland .
Thousands of students have signed petitions in an attempt to demand the government to rethink about this directive .
A few universities have stated that this move is political and that it will subside as the in - person classes are enabled .
Some other institutes are reconsidering the policy of reopening with the in - person sessions for international students .
They have also been trying to ease the fears of the students and their parents by claiming that the situation will change as soon as the issue is presented to the government .
I got a whim I need catered to .

Anyone who grew up in the 1980s and had a personal computer , either an Apple or IBM , likely knew about a company that – at the time – revolutionized the computer game industry .
That company was Sierra On - Line , makers of adventure games such as King ’s Quest , Leisure Suit Larry , and Police Quest .
These games are virtually unplayable these days as the technology has dramatically changed .
But back in the day , these games , brought to us by Ken and Roberta Williams , were cool , particularly if you did n’t have a Nintendo .
Here they are :
King ’s Quest : Quest for the Crown ( 1984 )
The Kingdom of Daventry has its magical items stolen : a magic mirror , an invincible shield , and a chest that is always filled with gold .
King Edward the Benevolent sends his bravest knight , Sir Graham , to retrieve them .
If he succeeds , he will become the next king .
Classic part : Climbing the beanstalk , waiting for the giant to go to sleep , then taking the chest from him .
You can also kill the giant with a slingshot .
King ’s Quest II : Romancing the Throne ( 1985 )
The magic mirror shows King Graham a vision of a woman , Valanice , imprisoned on the top of an ivory tower .
Graham is then teleported to the world of Kolyma to rescue her .
There he must travel through sea , air , and even death to gain the keys that unlock the three doors to the world where Hagatha the witch has imprisoned Valanice .
Classic part : Going into Dracula ’s castle .
At the cave entrance to Hagatha ’s Cave , if you arrive at the right time , you can see the Batmobile drive out and drive back in .
King ’s Quest III : To Heir is Human ( 1986 )
A boy named Gwydion is enslaved by the wicked magician Manannan .
Gwydion was kidnapped from Daventry by the magician when he was young , and this adventure tells the story of his journey back to Daventry .
Classic part :
While in the desert , making sure you do n’t face Medusa as you hold up the mirror to her , thus turning her to stone .
King ’s Quest IV : Perils of Rosella ( 1988 )
King Graham has a heart attack .
The good fairy Genesta teleports princess Rosella to the land of Tamir , where she learns about a magical fruit that can heal her father .
However , Genesta herself is weakened because the evil fairy Lolotte stole Genesta ’s talisman .
If Rosella cannot return the talisman to Genesta , the good fairy will be unable to help her return to Daventry in time to save her father .
Classic part : Playing the organ at night in the haunted house !

Note :
This article is n't about securing the Python interpreter against crashes / segfaults or exhaustion of resources attacks .
For help with that , take a look at the excellent sandboxing features of PyPy .
Those of you wanting to just know about the practical applications of this , scroll down to the bottom of the article =)
There have been many attempts to secure the Python interpreter so that untrusted code can be safely executed alongside trusted code .
Working attempts like Restricted Python and zope .
proxy unfortunately come at a high cost in terms of performance .
Old - school Python hackers would probably remember the deprecated rexec module which used to be enabled in the standard library .
This module , along with it 's Bastion sibling , provided a framework for “ restricted execution ” of Python code .
The rexec module encouraged a certain design pattern which depended on class attributes being kept “ private ” from untrusted code .
Unfortunately , Python 's introspection powers are heavily geared against this and there are many many dark corners from which one can peer deep into the heart of classes .
So it was no surprise that , soon after the introduction of new - style classes in Python , rexec was dumped .
And all hopes of securing the Python interpreter in an efficient way went the way of Plan 9 .
Now , those in the security world are probably aware of the Object Capability model of security as pioneered by the likes of the Actors model and the E language .
Entire Operating Systems have been implemented free of viruses thanks to this model .
For a long while I have felt that there exists a major subset of Python that is suited for use through the object capability model .
After all capabilities are just non-forgeable references .
We already have this in Python .
The next step is to simply ensure that there is no global shared state .
And whilst a lot of existing code uses global shared state , there is nothing in the Python language that imposes this limitation .
Thus it should be possible to isolate a capability - secure subset of Python and build up from there .
Since I 've had this insight , the Google Caja project have done the exact same for Javascript .
They identified a capability - secure subset of Javascript and have built up from there …
So how can we Python hackers get beyond shared state ?
After all , there is no “ private ” in Python .
Right ?
Well , not quite .
We can use closures as an easy way of emulating a private scope in Python .
After all this is how it 's done in other capability - based languages .
This is nothing new .
Ka -Ping
Yee had this insight on Python - Dev years ago !
But what about Python 's various introspective powers you ask ?
Unlike the deep plumbing of classes , Python 's functions are relatively isolated and makes our life much easier .
This makes sense when you realise that Python classes are actually syntactic sugar and sets of protocols on top of functions .
But functions are n't opaque beasts by default .
There are a number of variables which “ leak ” information .
The ones I identified were :
FunctionType.func_closure/__closure__
FunctionType.func_code/__code__
FunctionType.func_globals/__globals__
GeneratorType.gi_code
GeneratorType.gi_frame
type.__subclasses__
And thanks to the Python security challenge using safelite .
py we 've been able to identify attributes of FrameType as additional ones , e.g .
FrameType.f_locals
As you can see this is a pretty small list .
( Especial thanks to Paul Cannon for being the first with his hardcore hack to show that frame objects are accessible . )
Now this list is in no way the definitive final list .
The Python challenge is still ongoing — try safelite .
py yourself and see if you can find more !
But the fact that there have been no new exploits in the last 24 hours despite over a 1,000 unique downloads of safelite .py in the same time gives me some confidence that we are getting towards a comprehensive list .
If we can ensure that untrusted code will never be able to access the final list of these variables , then we can ensure that “ private ” data using closures stays private .
And from that basis , we can start building an object capability framework in Python !!
In safelite .py , I use ctypes to completely remove these variables from the Python interpreter .
This is a neat approach which Phillip J. Eby showed me and means that we can start building an object capability framework in Python today !
The flip - side of removing these variables however is that the code which uses these variables wo n't work .
Boo !
So I made getter functions like sys.get_func_code and patched the handful of functions in the standard library like inspect.
getargspec to use these instead .
The idea being that trusted code would have a reference to the sys module and be able to use them whilst untrusted code would not .
But Guido van Rossum — in the conversation that started here — convinced me that Python already has the support for doing this !
And this is where our old friend rexec deserves some thanking .
It turns out that rexec is only one half of Python 's restricted execution support .
The other half has been living inside the Python Interpreter for well over a decade .
For the sake of simplicity let 's call this PIRE — Python Interpreter 's Restricted Execution .
And since there is seemingly no comprehensive documentation of PIRE , I 'll provide a summary here .
Whenever you read / write an attribute on one of Python 's builtin objects , it will raise a RuntimeError stating that the attributed is restricted if both of the following conditions are true :
The attribute has a READ_RESTRICTED and / or WRITE_RESTRICTED flag set .
and / or flag set . PyEval_GetRestricted ( ) returns True .
The flags are set when members of an object are defined .
For example , in funcobject .c we find :
static PyMemberDef func_memberlist [ ] = {
{ " func_closure " , T_OBJECT , OFF ( func_closure ) , RESTRICTED | READONLY } ,
{ " func_doc " , T_OBJECT , OFF ( func_doc ) , WRITE_RESTRICTED
} ,
{ " __doc__ " , T_OBJECT , OFF ( func_doc ) , WRITE_RESTRICTED
} ,
{ " func_globals " , T_OBJECT , OFF ( func_globals ) , RESTRICTED | READONLY } ,
{ " __module__ " , T_OBJECT , OFF ( func_module ) , WRITE_RESTRICTED
} ,
{ NULL } /* Sentinel */
} ;
where RESTRICTED is just a shorthand for READ_RESTRICTED|WRITE_RESTRICTED .
As for PyEval_GetRestricted , a pure Python equivalent would look like :
import __builtin__
def PyEval_GetRestricted ( ) :
" " " Return if the we are in restricted execution . " " "
current_frame = PyEval_GetFrame ()
if current_frame .
__builtins__ != __builtin__ :
return True
else :
return False
In other words , it checks to see if the __builtins__ variable in the current execution frame is the exact same as the default __builtin__ module [ Note the difference in spelling of the two variables ] .
If they differ , restricted execution is assumed .
Let 's see how this works out in practice :
>>> import md5 , inspect
>>> def dummy ( secret ) :
... " " " A dummy function which creates a closure . " " "
...
... def get_secret_hash ( hexdigest = True ) :
... if hexdigest :
... return md5 . new ( secret ) . hexdigest ()
... return md5 . new ( secret ) . digest ()
...
... return get_secret_hash
>>> get_secret_hash = dummy ( ' My Secret . ' )
In normal execution , we can access the func_closure attribute :
>>> get_secret_hash .
func_closure
( < cell at 0x23da10 : str object at 0x23ef98 > , )
And use that to get at the secret :
>>> get_secret_hash .
func_closure [ 0 ] .
cell_contents
' My Secret . '
But if we set the __builtins__ variable , restricted execution mode kicks in :
>>> __builtins__ = {}
>>> get_secret_hash .
func_closure
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
...
RuntimeError : restricted attribute
Tada !!
Now the eagle - eyed amongst you would have noticed the import of the inspect module above .
We will use this to show how trusted code can still access restricted attributes whilst within restricted execution .
The inspect module has a useful getargspec function which accesses restricted attributes to find a function 's signature .
And , as we can see , it works even in restricted execution mode :
>>> inspect .
getargspec ( get_secret_hash )
( [ 'hexdigest ' ] , None , None , ( True , ) )
Why does this work ?
Because the scope in which getargspec was defined did n't have a custom __builtins__ and this was captured in the getargspec.
func_globals .
This is just genius !
And it provides us with a framework on top of which we can build the object capability secure Python .
All we need to do is add the identified set of leak variables to the existing set of restricted attributes .
For those who are not familiar with the internals of PIRE , I present a summary here of the current ( in Python 's SVN trunk ) set of restricted attributes .
The bitwise - OR - able flag contants are defined in structmember .h :
READ_RESTRICTED
Not readable in restricted mode .
WRITE_RESTRICTED
Not writable in restricted mode .
RESTRICTED
Not readable or writable in restricted mode .
In classobject.c , instance method objects :
im_class RESTRICTED im_func RESTRICTED __func__ RESTRICTED im_self RESTRICTED __self__ RESTRICTED
In classobject.c , class objects :
__dict__ RESTRICTED __class__ WRITE_RESTRICTED
In classobject.c , instance objects :
__dict__ RESTRICTED __class__ RESTRICTED
In cPickle.c :
A private copy of the Pickler registry tables is used when PyEval_GetRestricted ( ) .
In fileobject .c :
The file ( ) constructor will raise an error when PyEval_GetRestricted ( ) .
In funcobject.c , function objects :
func_closure RESTRICTED __closure__ RESTRICTED func_code RESTRICTED __code__ RESTRICTED func_defaults RESTRICTED __defaults__ RESTRICTED func_dict RESTRICTED __dict__ RESTRICTED func_doc WRITE_RESTRICTED
__doc__ WRITE_RESTRICTED
func_globals RESTRICTED __globals__ RESTRICTED func_name WRITE_RESTRICTED
__name__ WRITE_RESTRICTED
__module__ WRITE_RESTRICTED
In marshal .c :
Unmarshalling code objects will raise an error when PyEval_GetRestricted ( ) .
In methodobject.c , bultin functions :
__self__ RESTRICTED __module__ WRITE_RESTRICTED
As you can see some of the “ leak ” attributes that I want to restrict are already restricted in Python !
All we need to do is add the following changes :
In codeobject .c :
Creating new code objects directly will raise an error when PyEval_GetRestricted ( ) .
In frameobject .c :
All attributes of Frame objects are restricted except for f_restricted .
In genobject .c :
gi_code RESTRICTED gi_frame RESTRICTED
In typeobject .c :
__subclasses__ RESTRICTED
The nice thing about this is that we can then use it in environments like Google App Engine , where we cannot use the ctypes - based approach .
Here 's my patch for Python's SVN trunk : pytrunk.secure.patch
You can review the patch for acceptance into Python core here :
With this patch in place ( and assuming that there are n't more “ leak ” attributes lying around ) , we can start building up a true , secure , object - capability framework in Python .
We 'd need to add things like import mechanisms and start whitelisting builtin functions for use .
This is a big undertaking and is one that I am committed to — and will appreciate fellow collaborators who want to make this happen .
That includes you hopefully =)
Now , some of you may be wondering what the fuss is ?
Why bother creating such an object capability framework in Python ?
For that let me give you a few use cases .
All on App Engine .
Custom Templates by Users
Web applications like Blogger do n't allow users to customise their blogs using a rich language .
Instead they have a proprietary templating system which for the most part is just variable substitution .
Imagine instead if you could let your users use a templating language like Genshi .
Users could have the full expresivity of the Python language to generate the output they want .
The problem with letting users do that today is that they would be able to use it to get at the rest of your application and start doing evil things to your database .
But with an object capability based framework in place , you could give users the capability to execute Genshi templates without worrying about them somehow getting access to your database .
And the nice thing about App Engine is that they already have something similar to PyPy 's sandbox running — so your users wo n't be able to segfault your processes .
UserScripts : Python Services in Apps
Web applications like Twitter and Facebook provide APIs which let developers write services which run on their own servers .
Imagine instead a ‘ Plex ’ application on App Engine which allowed users to create and run arbitrary Python services on their data .
Not only would this save resources — how many copies of Twitter 's database are there ?? — but it could allow for interesting and composable services .
Perhaps even a command line for the internet ?
Services could be provided with a minimal __builtins__ which allowed them to access the current user 's data and not anyone else's .
Here 's a minimal example to get you thinking :
def create_safe_get ( user_id , db = db ) :
def _safe_get ( key_name ) :
return db .
get ( user_id + key_name )
return _safe_get
safe_builtins [ ' db_get ' ] = create_safe_get ( ' tav ' )
exec ( service , { ' __builtins__ ' : safe_builtins })
There are lots and lots of possibilities — imagine a GreaseMonkey - like system but running on the server - side and with Python … the possibilities are only limited by our imagination .
But in order for any of this to be possible , the patch has to be accepted first .
Guido has already promised to accept the patch ( for both Core Python and App Engine ! ) if it gets reviewed .
So , if you are a Python - Dev-er , can you please review it :
If not , can you at least let Python - Dev know that you 'd like to see this patch through ?
Thanks !
Let me know what you think in the comments below .

DENVER , Feb. 9 ( UPI ) --
Health officials say they 've treated the first known case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in the United States .
An unidentified patient treated a year ago at Lutheran Medical Center in Denver was later found to have the disease , apparently contracting it in Uganda , the Rocky Mountain News reported Monday .
Advertisement
Hospital officials told the newspaper they are working with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Centers for Disease Control to determine the risk to doctors and staff members who came in contact with the patient .
Marburg hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus indigenous to Africa , is transmitted by contact with infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans .
The News said the patient , who recovered , came into contact with fruit bats in Uganda , which are capable of harboring the Marburg virus .
A common refrain of the uninformed is that I have nothing to hide so therefore I do n’t care who peeks through my window .
Until the power balance of the country or community changes and when political views are no longer in vogue .
Perhaps that minor mistake suddenly becomes a crime or something you did n’t know you even did has become an issue .
Those who refuse to think beyond today have no tomorrow .
Google as a company has a policy ” You can make money without doing evil “ , but the question is with a corner on the search market of the Internet and rolling out a variety of tools is that motto even possible to uphold .
In a dictatorial and autocratic world where the span of the Internet crosses international borders can Google even claim to be “ nice ” .
To make our case that you may be in grave jeopardy up to and including national security consider this .
What if the government bound by law not to gather personal information about citizens ( Privacy Act 1974 could instead just purchase a large volume of information about citizens .
Just such a deal was made by the government to purchase what it could not gather from ChoicePoint .
Of course , ChoicePoint is the company that also sold records and personal identification information to Nigerian scam artists .
Also , ChoicePoint is not above purportedly acting in an illegal manner as a corporation .
We as individuals though think we have nothing to hide .
That might be the case if the rest of the world was as ethical as we think we are .
The point of bringing ChoicePoint up is that it aggregates into a data warehouse a huge amount of financial information .
You are not asked permission to do this , or asked if you wish it done , but it occurs .
Where ChoicePoint does this with financial data that is discrete Google does this with behavior and personal data .
Simplistically ChoicePoint gathers data on what you are and Google gathers data on who you are .
Your search and web - browsing history defines your behaviors and motives .
First , lets break the anonymity of the Internet myth .
Every time you access a web page or get an email you expose an extensive amount of information .
The web server logs for example your internet protocol address , the type of browser , where you browsed from to that server , and how long you spend on that server .
That is how they also can know the physical location of your computer .
If you log into Google and provide your credentials your Internet protocol address is logged with that .
So even though you do n’t log in to Google they know it is you by drawing a correlation between the Internet Protocol address and the user credentials .
Should you move around a lot Google can by inference figure out where you are and even build a picture of your normal habits .
Even if you do not use
Google the websites you may visit could be using Google Analytics which means you are still being tracked to the same level by Google .
Whether or not Google actually does this currently is immaterial .
The capability exists .
That capability can be used by law enforcement to convict you of crimes .
But , in a fit of privacy minded zeal Google only keeps that information 2 years .
Thereby protecting absolutely nothing .
Deleting stale data is just a good practice .
Say for instance you are n’t sitting at home in a nice warm Lazy Boy chair and you are a political dissident in a repressive country .
Google can then provide to that repressive government information about your activities .
Worse in an age where the Internet is the subjective organ of national and international discourse what if a company had the ability to wipe your ideas out ?
Say you are that dissident and bowing to pressure of a government the search engine companies wiped you out and removed you from all listings ?
Just such things are happening not just to Google , but Yahoo also .
In other words Google and other search engines can decide who has a voice .
Your friends will say that they do not use the Internet and why should they be concerned .
Some people will say that they totally agree that Google is evil and will only use other search engines .
To bad .
Because Google is using you anyways .
With the advent of Google Mail and contextual searching of Google Mail for add sense when you send an email to somebody else Google can get their feral claws into your information anyways .
Google would disagree stating that they believe in privacy while at the same time in their own privacy document stating :
“ Even if a message has been deleted or an account is no longer active , messages may remain on our backup systems for some limited period of time . ”
As mentioned earlier that period of time is 18 to 24 months .
Though others are sure that is a lot longer as the large storage features mean nobody ever deletes anything .
When challenged by this argument the luddites among us will of course say they do not even use GMAIL so therefore they are safe from the minions and Googliers .
Of course they are right up until Google actually started taking pictures in our back yards .
There is nothing like having our private lives instantiated on the web for the entire world to peruse .
You may have no expectation of privacy , but the recording of events , without your knowledge is a violation of your privacy .
An argument that can be fought by different nations from different cultures .
Do not worry though .
Google was more than willing to violate peoples property rights to impact their privacy rights as they sought to record things they should not have had access too .
One aspect is that regardless of how you feel about the technologies privacy aspects these same tools can be used by terrorists to impact national security .
Of course when you have a satellite partially purchased by and used to assist the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
Of course Google Earth can look down on our back yards behind our fences we erect for privacy to peer into our lives without our knowledge .
So , our mythical friend , who does n’t use Google search , does n’t use GMAIL , does n’t send email to anybody who uses GMAIL , does n’t browse the web , does n’t have a house , does n’t go outside , is not worried about national security , but they should still be worried .
So , if having pictures of you was not enough tracking your every movement in cyber space was not enough to worry you now they can track your every movement in real space too via your new Google Android cell phone .
Sure this can be a feature but there are issues with it too .
As you will notice the new Google Latitude is built upon those same features of GMAIL and search that are so problematic .
What is considered privacy ( as stated in the video ) is only so strong as the weakest link .
People have expressed concern about the Big Brother State being a governmental intrusion , but in state decline and corporate ascension it just might be those free web services that you have to worry about .
Privacy in general is eroding faster than Google ’s patience for old , fat , bald academic bloggers .
Dismissing this as paranoia is a sign of the impact Google has had on society .
With the expansion of Google into books , scholarly works , copying the Internet , and expanding into content services , where will the expansion and destabilization of intellectual property end ?
My aim and goal of this blog post was to attempt to expand the discussion of privacy and show through documented argument ( hence all the links ) that even the great goodness of Google has clay feet .
And , that as users of the Internet and as individuals we need to be aware of the inherent problems of a surveillance society even if it does not come from the government .
More importantly when you consider information assurance and security ( confidentiality , integrity , and availability ) and the standard high volume of reporting on distribute attacks against availability .
It becomes harder to show what an attack looks like against confidentiality .
This post should show that confidentiality can be easily attacked and in many cases we will even say thank you and think warmly of the people who violated it .
Reporter : Bush administration lying about Blair House booking David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday January 7 , 2009
Print This Email This
The Bush administration claimed on Tuesday that the reason Blair House was not available for the Obamas to live in when their daughters started school in Washington on January 5 was that former Australian Prime Minister John Howard had previously been booked to stay there overnight on January 12 .
However , political columnist Margaret Carlson believes this is a lie .
Carlson told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann , " I reported -- but also the Washington Post reported -- on December 11 and 12 that there were no foreign dignitaries booked into Blair House during that period of time . "
When the Post reported on the rejection of the Obamas ' request in December , it noted that White House spokespersons had referred to " previously scheduled events and guests that could n't be displaced " but that " administration officials said there are no foreign dignitaries scheduled to stay there during the first two weeks of January . "
" I have the feeling they actually asked [ Howard ] to come and stay so that there might be some plausible reason for not letting the Obamas stay there , " Carlson suggested .
Carlson went on to say , " Blair House might look small , but it 's actually 119 rooms , with 35 bathrooms .
Howard would n't even have to share a sink with the Obamas .
...
But most importantly , it 's secure .
By having to stay at the Hay - Adams , not only do the Obamas have to move twice ... but the security cost to taxpayers is enormous . "
" How could the Bush administration possibly think all this would n't get out ? " asked Olbermann .
Carlson suggested in response that " saying ' No ' to the Obamas is just a feather " when " we 're being left with our retirement funds losing 50 % of their value and we 're mired in two wars . "

Dec. 12 , 2008  --
A coal industry Web site featuring cute lumps of coal caroling rejiggered holiday songs about clean technology was shut down Friday after it drew a chorus of angry boos from environmental groups .
Launched this week by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity ( ACCCE ) , the site allowed visitors to dress up a choir of blinking , grinning lumps of anthracite in festive scarves and hats and then select from an altered repertoire of pro-coal carols .
" Frosty the Coal Man " and " Clean Coal Night " ( instead of " Silent Night " ) were two of the options .
But just five days after the campaign 's launch , the ACCCE decided to take down the interactive flash Web site .
Joe Lucas , vice president of the ACCCE , attributed the sudden change to underperformance , not to fire from critics who think the only place for coal is in a Christmas stocking .
" The site traffic was a little underwhelming for me , " he said .
Since Monday , the site had received 21,000 visits , he said , adding that he would have been more satisfied with at least 40,000 visits .
When asked if they were responding to criticism from environmental groups , Lucas would only say that the slow traffic drove their decision to remove the site .
He also said that taking down the carolers ' site allowed his group to focus on a new television ad unveiled today .
But environmental groups are celebrating like it 's already Christmas .
Rob Perks , the campaign director for environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council , said he " absolutely " thought that the site had been taken down because of criticism from his group and others .
On Tuesday , he took the campaign to task in a blog post titled " Can Industry Get Any More Cynical Than Coal Carolers ? "
His blog entry for Friday read : " Big Coal 's worst ...advertising...campaign...ever is no more !
" I feel like they took their lumps and went home , " he said .
Cynicism or Strategy ?
Earlier this week , the Union of Concerned Scientists issued a statement that said , " When you can't refute the sobering facts about the product you 're peddling , just dress it up , have it sing Christmas carols and sit back and wait for the public to come rushing to your side .
Ah , if only fun outerwear and corny songs could erase coal 's dirty statistics . "
The statement included the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming and sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid raid .
Rob Perks , the campaign director for environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council , also took the campaign to task in a blog post titled " Can Industry Get Any More Cynical Than Coal Carolers ? "
' Worse Than Joe Camel '
" This is the most cynical ploy that I 've ever seen from the industry .
It 's worse than Joe Camel selling cigarettes , " Perks told ABCNews.com .
Along with several other environmental groups , Perks ' organization last week launched The Reality Coalition , a grass - roots public awareness effort to dispel the myth of clean coal .
The coalition 's primary message is that coal cannot be considered clean until its carbon dioxide emissions , which are contributing to global warming , are captured and stored .
That process mitigates global warming by capturing and storing underground carbon dioxide emitted from coal plants .
Despite test projects in the United States , no coal plant in the country has fully integrated the process .
The first power plant in the world to do so opened in Germany this fall .
" I think people have to realize that there is no such thing as clean coal , " Perks said .
" You might as well believe in unicorns if you believe in clean coal . "
But coal industry representatives argued their strategy was intended to raise public awareness about the benefits of coal - generated technology in a different and more light - hearted way .
" This is obviously a very serious subject , " said Joe Lucas , vice president of ACCCE .
" There has been a lot of engagement this year in the policy dialogue with the presidential campaign .
This was an opportunity to sit back and not be so serious for once . "
He said the campaign was " a little tongue in cheek , " but was intended to drive home the message that coal is affordable as an energy option , abundant in resources and generates jobs .
" Let 's face it , coal has not been the gift of choice for Christmases past , " said Lucas .
But , as energy costs go up , " this is the year that people are probably happy to get coal in their stocking . "
He was n't surprised that environmental groups had expressed dismay at the campaign , but said the groups were " moving the goal post of what is clean coal technology . "
So … What Is Clean Coal Technology ?
Lucas said the industry disagrees with the environmentalists ' definition of clean coal technology as only that which involves the capture and storage ( or sequestration ) of the global warming pollutant carbon dioxide .
He argued that clean coal " is so much bigger than that . "
Up until now , he said , the focus has been on reducing the emissions of sulphur dioxide , mercury and other pollutants .
And , he emphasized , the industry has been successful in that , citing emissions reductions that have measurably improved public health .
The next challenge is to bring to market carbon capture and storage , he said .
In 2009 , the industry will see the first commercial deployment of carbon capture technology at a plant in West Virginia , he said .
A full - scale deployment is slated for a different plant in 2010 , Lucas continued .
Describing clean coal technology as only carbon capture and storage , Lucas said , " is like describing medical technology as only MRI machines . "
Many industry watchers , however , warn that the coal coalition 's term " clean coal " is a term of art .
" It 's essentially meaningless and it's extremely misleading , " said Brad Johnson , a research associate at the Center for American Progress , a Washington , D.C. - based think tank founded by John Podesta , a former official in the Clinton administration and currently an adviser to President - elect Obama 's transition team .
While it 's true that , decades ago , the clean coal targets were indeed sulphur dioxide and similar pollutants highlighted in the Clean Air acts , the focus has shifted to carbon dioxide and its effects on the climate .
" Now we 're no longer talking about particulate matter so much , we 're not talking about acid rain so much .
What we 're worried about now is climate change and carbon dioxide , which is much harder to pull out of the smoke coming out of the smokestack , " said John Anderson , a visiting scholar at nonprofit and nonpartisan think tank Resources for the Future .
" The current issue is CO2 . "
As the country considers an energy mix that will mitigate climate change , Johnson said a distinction needs to be drawn between policy discussions about how we use coal and propaganda campaigns .
Obama Uses the Term Clean Coal
The coal industry 's campaign may call its resource affordable , abundant and job - generating .
But , Johnson said , it 's affordable only if you ignore the public health , environmental and community costs associated with it .
It 's abundant , only if you accept outdated statistics , he argued .
And , while we 're in a situation in which every job matters , he said , it 's no more job - creating than renewable resources .
With the same kind of investment , he said , other energy sources can create more jobs
Johnson acknowledged that the coal industry 's campaigns had been successful in getting influential people to integrate the words " clean coal " into their conversations .
Obama , for example , used the phrase on the campaign trail and still features it on his energy policy Web site .
But energy experts say it 's not entirely clear what his use of the term means for energy policy decisions under his administration .
Some say Obama 's appointment of people like renewable energy advocate Steven Chu to his Cabinet indicates that he is interested in advancing low - carbon solutions .
But , they also concede that his position on the issue has been vague .
His leadership will be necessary to develop and implement clean coal technology that substantially reduces global warming .
But , given an economy that continues to slide , this path may be more difficult to take .
" The problem is that clean coal means more expensive energy and this is really going to be the choice for the next administration .
If you want cleaner energy , it 's going to mean more pennies per kilowatt hour depending on how far you go , " Anderson said .
" So the choice for Obama really is n't just if you want to be clean or not , it 's how clean at what price . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. syphilis rates rose for a seventh year in 2007 , driven by gay and bisexual men , while chlamydia reached record numbers and gonorrhea remained at alarming levels -- especially among blacks , health officials said on Tuesday .

Blacks make up 12 percent of the U.S. population , but account for about 70 percent of gonorrhea cases and almost half of chlamydia and syphilis cases , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said .
Black women ages 15 to 19 have the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea , and gonorrhea rates for blacks overall were 19 times higher than for whites , the CDC said .
Dr. John Douglas , who heads the CDC ’s division of sexually transmitted disease , or STD , prevention , said overall syphilis , chlamydia and gonorrhea rates are unacceptably high .
Cases of these three STDs are reported by U.S. states to the CDC .
In 2007 , 1.1 million U.S. cases of chlamydia were reported , up from about 1 million in 2006 and the most ever , and the rate rose by 7.5 percent from the prior year , the CDC said in a report .
Douglas said the figures may reflect that more people
are being diagnosed rather than a rise in infections .
In addition , more than 350,000 cases of gonorrhea were reported in 2007 , essentially unchanged from 2006 , the CDC said .
Gonorrhea rates fell dramatically from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s , with little progress since .
Chlamydia and gonorrhea are easily diagnosed and treated , but frequently have no symptoms and remain undetected .
Untreated , chlamydia and gonorrhea -- both bacterial infections -- can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women .
The two infections also can cause ectopic pregnancy , chronic pelvic pain and other health problems .
“ Of all the causes of infertility , this is probably the most preventable -- since these infections can be prevented , diagnosed and treated , ” Douglas said in a telephone interview .
In men , gonorrhea can cause a painful condition of the ducts attached to the testicles that cause infertility .
Gonorrhea also can spread to the blood or joints and can be life threatening .
Chlamydia complications among men are rare .
Douglas said to avoid STDs , teens can delay the beginning of sexual activity , people can limit the number of sexual partners and use condoms .
“ Condoms have risk - reduction value for every sexually transmitted condition , ” Douglas said .
Syphilis is less common than the others , with 11,466 cases reported in 2007 .
Rates rose 15 percent from 2006 .
Syphilis rates dropped by 90 percent in the 1990s to a record low level in 2000 , and officials thought it might disappear as a public health threat before its resurgence this decade .
Syphilis has increased each year since 2000 -- its rate is up 81 percent -- with gay and bisexual men representing 65 percent of cases , the CDC said .
Douglas said many cases are occurring in HIV - positive men who are choosing other HIV - positive men as sexual partners .
“ Within that relationship , they are less concerned about the transmission of other conditions .
They ’re not using condoms .
They believe that their partner already has got the worst they can get -- they ’ve got an HIV infection , ” he said .
When all STDs are considered , including human papillomavirus ( HPV or genital wart virus ) and herpes simplex viruses , almost 19 million new infections occur each year , with nearly half among those ages 15 to 24 , the CDC said .

Advertisement Dozens of motorcyclists ' lives could be saved every year if air bag jackets were made compulsory , accident and emergency doctors have said .
The jackets are the equivalent of car air bags and inflate if the rider is thrown off during a crash .
In one version , the jacket is attached to the bike by a lead which detaches when the rider has come off suddenly .
The Department of Transport said it had no plans for a new law but said it welcomed anything to improve safety .
Vital organs
Although motorcyclists make up just 1 % of road users , they account for 20 % of fatalities .
Figures for 2007 show that 561 bikers died on the roads .
Andy Parfitt , an A&E doctor at St Thomas ' Hospital in London , said : " There is a shocking number of deaths of motorcyclists on the roads .
I think dozens of lives could be saved if these jackets were made compulsory .
It stopped me from rolling as well .
It stops the bounce .
I think it 's the bounce when you 're crashing at speed that hurts you
Stuntman Rob
Hunt after testing an air bag jacket
Have Your Say : Should air bag jackets be made compulsory ?
Dr Parfitt , a keen biker , said : " There 's no question that what the jackets do afford is , they protect a motorcyclists ' vital organs , neck and spine over and above the level that a normal jacket would do .
" A majority of deaths in motorcycle accidents are due to injuries to these vital organs that should be protected by these jackets . "
One rider whose experience underlines the kind of injuries that motorcyclists can receive in accidents is 32 - year - old Dineth Wijayarathna .
He was involved in a crash two years ago on a private track that left him seriously injured .
He said : " I was doing about 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) , the rear wheel suspension failed on my motorcycle and I came off , broke my pelvis in two places , broke my back and broke a few ribs . "
He needed two major operations , could n't walk for six months and still feels the after - effects two years on .
" I 've got a plate in the front of my pelvis with six bolts in it .
I 've got two 9 cm ( 3.5 in ) bolts going through my pelvis into my spine , " he said .
" It was awful .
Not being able to walk , not being able to do normal bodily functions for such a long period of time was n't the best fun . "

There are different types of air bag jackets on sale in the UK , which cost up to twice as much as standard jackets .
One version , sold by Point Two , is attached to bikes by a lead and , if the wearer falls off , that triggers a small gas canister that inflates the jacket in less than one fifth of a second .
The spine is then held tight and the air bag protects the area between the neck and pelvis .
Newsbeat gave one of the jackets to Rob Hunt , a stuntman for 12 years .
He said afterwards : " It just stops you from going anywhere .
It 's tight .
It 's protecting all around my ribs . "
" It felt as though I was picked up off the floor and I was on the air bag .
It was just like gliding on air .
" It stopped me from rolling as well .
It stops the bounce .
I think it 's the bounce when you 're crashing at speed that hurts you . "

Enlarge By Gerald Herbert , AP President - elect Barack Obama met with reporters at his transition office in Washington on Tuesday after discussions with his economic advisers .
WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama warned Tuesday that the nation could face " trillion - dollar deficits for years to come " but vowed to pursue long - term budget changes as he presses for immediate new spending and tax cuts to jump - start the struggling economy .
Two weeks before he takes office , Obama said his budget aides told him that he will inherit huge deficits following the government 's multibillion - dollar financial bailouts .
He vowed to block pet projects sought by members of Congress , known as " earmarks , " create an economic recovery oversight board and post details of all spending projects on the Internet .
POLITICS BLOG : Dire warnings from the president - elect " We 're going to have to bring significant reform not just to our recovery and reinvestment plan , but to the overall budget process , " Obama said after meeting with economic advisers at his transition office .
" We 're going to have to stop talking about budget reform , " he added .
" We 're going to have to totally embrace it . "
Obama vowed again that he would block earmarks from the massive economic stimulus package now being drafted in Congress , which will include road and bridge projects and $ 300 billion in tax cuts .
He made his remarks surrounded by aides including Peter Orszag , his choice for White House budget director , Treasury secretary nominee Timothy Geithner , and Lawrence Summers , his choice for National Economic Council director .
The president - elect did not specify the size of the stimulus package or of his first budget , which will be submitted to Congress in early February .
He vowed to work with both parties in Congress and is " willing to make some difficult choices in how we get a handle on this deficit . "
The president - elect 's comments on earmarks came as the chairmen of the House and Senate appropriations committees unveiled new rules on how their panels will deal with earmarks .
Rep. Dave Obey , D - Wis. , and Sen. Daniel Inouye , D - Hawaii , will require lawmakers to post on their websites all funding requests for special projects when they make them and explain the value of their project .
In addition , all requests will be published earlier than previously required .
Now , these requests will be outlined when they are considered by subcommittees , rather than at the full committee level .
Obey and Inouye also said they plan to hold the total cost of earmarks to less than 1 % of discretionary spending .
In a related issue , Sens. Kent Conrad , D - N.D. , and Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , have proposed a special commission to develop spending cuts and tax hikes that would be voted up or down as a package .
The model would be the commission set up by Congress to shut down military bases .
Maya MacGuineas , president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , said Obama is saying the right things but faces a political challenge in meeting his goals for deficit reduction .
MacGuineas , whose organization forecast a trillion - dollar budget deficit last year , said it is easy to see Congress borrowing money for the stimulus and then " turning their attention elsewhere . "
The only solution , she said , is a package of spending cuts and tax hikes , " and they 're going to have to be big . "

In the present recession , advocates of government intervention often evoke the specter of the Great Depression .
Unless the government intervenes massively , we are told , we risk an economic collapse comparable to that of the 1930s .
To see the fallacy of this claim , it is imperative to understand that government intervention both led to the Depression and prevented recovery from it .

SolarBotanic is a company which researches and specializes in an emerging tech dubbed biomimicry -- which seeks to mimic nature , and use nature - inspired methods to solve human problems .
SolarBotanic is focusing on energy production , and , to that end , they 've developed what they call Energy Harvesting Trees .
The trees are n't " real , " ( they 're just modeled on real ones ) ; these are composed of Nanoleafs , which use nanotechnology designed to capture the " sun 's energy in photovoltaic and thermovoltaic cells , then convert the radiation into electricity . "
They also have stems and twigs which house nano - piezovoltaic material which act as generators producing electricity from movement or kinetic energy caused by wind or rain .
The company has several patents on the technology already , and are currently seeking partners for funding and development .
We do n't really have any details about what these fake trees look like -- but Thom Yorke 's probably going to write a song about them .
Casey : Report on riot censored for inmate in Beaumont COMMENTARY
Did reporter try to cause prison riot ?
Chronicle reporter Susan Carroll does n’t look like someone who would intentionally start a prison riot .
She is petite , dresses professionally and , like most good reporters , does not make a habit of trying to draw attention to herself .
But there it was in black and white .
Actually , it was in black and pink , the official color of carbon copies from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice , the agency that runs our state prisons .
Carroll had written a story , said the denial notification form , “ that a reasonable person would construe as written solely for the purpose of communicating information designed to achieve the breakdown of prisons through offender disruption such as strikes or riots . ”
As a result , the story had been sliced out from the Sunday , Jan. 18 , edition of the Chronicle delivered to inmate David Chiles at the LeBlanc Unit near Beaumont .
Reason ‘ fit most closely ’
Carroll ’s article , headlined “ U.S. teens carry out bloody work for cartel , ” told the story of some Texas youths who ran drugs and murdered people on behalf of the notorious Zetas arm of the Gulf Cartel , one of Mexico ’s most powerful gangs .
When I asked Carroll about it she just smiled : “ You know , it occurred to me that it had been a long time since I caused a prison riot … ”
She was just kidding , of course .
So , in a sense , were the folks who run Texas prisons .
Jason Clark , a TDCJ spokesman , noted that the form “ Denial Notification ” had only six boxes for mailroom censors to check .
The one I quoted above , he said , “ fits most closely ” the reason Carroll ’s article was excised and destroyed .
No info on explosives
He ’s right .
As far as I could decipher , the article did not in any way :
• • Contain contraband .
• • Contain information regarding the manufacture of explosives , weapons or drugs .
• • Encourage homosexual or deviant criminal sexual behavior , thereby being “ detrimental to offenders ’ rehabilitation . ”
• • Contain material on setting up and operating criminal schemes or on concealing such schemes .
• • Contain sexually explicit images .
The article did n’t include any of that stuff , so the closest fit was a box regarding material written solely for the purpose of causing a riot .
The prison censors , explained Clark , did n’t really think Carroll wrote the story for any nefarious reason other than , perhaps , to help sell newspapers .
It was , after all , a fascinating story .
But the story included information on the arrests of 14 Gulf Cartel members .
Thirteen have pleaded guilty to various crimes .
Charges against one have been dropped .
Reporting of such developments can be problematic , said Clark .
“ The situation can be delicate , ” he said .
“ If inmates understood someone was indicted from a gang , it could raise tensions in that group .
They might think a fellow inmate had snitched . ”
The attitude among censors is that being safe is better than being sorry .
It does n’t even matter if the inmate subscribing to the paper is a gang member .
Other inmates might see the article .
And it ’s not as though censors have time to review material in a scholarly fashion .
The system ’s roughly 156,000 inmates were sent 18.4 million pieces of mail in the last fiscal year .
In addition , they were sent 186,632 packages .
Every piece of mail was opened and inspected .
With that volume , it is hardly surprising that prison censors offer something of a paradigm of the criminal justice system : Criminals cheat and lie while assembly - line justice attempts , with varying degrees of success , to approximate the truth .

Dwindling water supplies are a greater risk to businesses than oil running out , a report for investors has warned .
Among the industries most at risk are high - tech companies , especially those using huge quantities of water to manufacture silicon chips ; electricity suppliers who use vast amounts of water for cooling ; and agriculture , which uses 70 % of global freshwater , , says the study , commissioned by the powerful CERES group , whose members have $ 7tn under management .
Other high - risk sectors are beverages , clothing , biotechnology and pharmaceuticals , forest products , and metals and mining , it says .
" Water is one of our most critical resources – even more important than oil , " says the report , published today .
" The impact of water scarcity and declining water on businesses will be far - reaching .
We 've already seen decreases in companies ' water allotments , more stringent regulations [ and ] higher costs for water . "
Droughts " attributable in significant part to climate change " are already causing " acute water shortages " around the world , and pressure on supplies will increase with further global warming and a growing world population , says the report written by the US - based Pacific Institute .
" It is increasingly clear that the era of cheap and easy access to water is ending , posing a potentially greater threat to businesses than the loss of any other natural resource , including fossil fuel resources , " it adds .
" This is because there are various alternatives for oil , but for many industrial processes , and for human survival itself , there is no substitute for water . "
In a joint statement , CERES ' president Mindy Lubber and Peter Gleick , president of the Pacific Institute , urged more companies and investors to work out their dependence on water and future supplies , and make plans to cope with increased shortages and prices .
" Few companies and investors are thinking strategically about the profound business risks that will exist in a world where climate change is likely to exacerbate already diminishing water supplies , " they say .
" Companies that treat pressing water risks as a strategic challenge will be far better positioned in future , " they add .
The CERES report adds to growing concern about a looming water crisis .
In the Economist 's report , The World in 2009 , Peter Brabeck - Letmathe , chairman of food giant Nestlé , wrote : " under present conditions … we will run out of water long before we run out of fuel " .
And at its annual meeting this year the World Economic Forum issued what it itself called a " stark warning " that " the world simply cannot manage water in the future in the same way as in the past or the economic web will collapse " .
CERES , which has members in the US and Europe , made recommendations , including that companies should measure their water footprints from suppliers through to product use , and integrate water into strategic planning , and that investors should independently assess companies ' water risk and " demand " better disclosure from boards .
The apparently successful launch of an Iranian satellite looks very different from Washington than it does from Tehran .
For the Iranian government it is an important milestone along the road to reclaiming Persia 's ancient claim to major power status , which it feels the jealous west is trying to deny it .
It is also enormously significant in Iranian internal politics .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad got elected promising economic benefits for the common man and modernisation .
He has made a complete mess of the first part of that mission .
Delivering the second is important for his prospects of re-election in June , in the eyes of both the average voter and – even more importantly , given the controlled nature of Iranian democracy – the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
From Washington , London and some other western capitals , the launch is seen primarily through the prism of Iran 's nuclear project .
The capacity to put an object into space , together with the feared capability to build a nuclear device , spells – for some at least – the eventual threat of an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) that could reach the US .
" There are dual applications for satellite launching technology in Iran 's ballistic missile programme .
As a result we think this sends the wrong signal to the international community , which has already passed five successive UN security council resolutions on Iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes , " Bill Rammell , the minister of state at the Foreign Office , said today .
For that reason the satellite launch has a direct and immediate bearing on the debate over the US missile defence scheme .
Barack Obama 's team has hinted the scheme could be reviewed .
That hint brought immediate dividends in the relationship with Moscow , which felt threatened by the deployment of missile interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic .
The Bush administration insisted the system was a shield against Iran ; the Russians saw it pointing at them .
The Russian government said that in return for Obama 's change in tone it would review its own plans to put tactical missiles in its western enclave of Kaliningrad .
The diplomatic thaw , which is only a week old , generated hopes of a more productive bilateral relationship .
All that is now under greater threat as a result of the Omid satellite launch by Iran , if it pushes the missile defence argument back in favour of the hawks .
Mark Fitzpatrick , a specialist on the Iranian nuclear programme at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , said : " It 's almost as if the Iranians are in league with ballistic missile defence adherents in the United States . "
From a purely technical point of view , the advances represented by the satellite launch are incremental .
The ballistic technology is basically the same as Iran 's Shahab - 3 missile , which was tested to great fanfare last year .
That technology demonstrated Iran could reach Tel Aviv , Cairo or Riyadh with its missiles .
The Omid satellite launch confirms that Iranian scientists have mastered the separation of payload from missile in space and placing a payload into the right orbit , both useful skills for an ICBM .
It does not imply Iran is on the brink of targeting Washington with a nuclear warhead .
" The Iranians have shown a very rudimentary capability in a technology that requires far greater sophistication , " Christopher Pang , an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute , said .
Fitzpatrick argues that a more significant missile test took place in November .
The Sajjil missile launched then has about the same range as the Shahab - 3 , about 1,250 miles ( 2,000 km ) , but it uses solid fuel rather than liquid .
That is militarily significant because it is less volatile and can therefore be launched with shorter notice .
The Iranians have certainly shown a lot of interest in projecting their military strength far beyond their region .
However , they are probably still some way away from deploying long - range nuclear missiles .
By this summer Iran will probably have produced enough low - enriched uranium to produce a bomb , if it was turned into highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) .
But that process would be hard to carry out without the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , noticing .
Then the HEU would have to be crafted into a warhead small enough to put on top of a missile .
That too is very difficult .
According to the most recent estimate by the US intelligence community , the Iranians gave up trying to do that in 2003 .
The Israelis have rubbished that estimate , and will be telling the Obama administration : " We told you so . "
The launch does not directly affect Israel , as Iran has already shown it can reach Tel Aviv with the Shahab - 3 missile .
But the Omid satellite launch will inject more anxiety and urgency into the international debate on Iran , at a time when the new US government is trying to create some breathing space with friendly overtures to Tehran .
In April , an auction by Julien 's Auctions at the Beverley Hills Hilton will provide an unprecedented look into the private world of Michael Jackson .

Himmelsfeuerwerk Taghelle Nacht über Nordeuropa
Viele Menschen im Norden Deutschlands wurde gestern Zeugen eines beindruckenden Himmelsschauspiels .
Ein Meteorit stürzte in die Erdatmosphäre und leuchtete den Abend taghell aus .
Eine Kamera in Schweden zeichnete das Phänomen auf .
Special correspondent Oscar Swartz reports .
STOCKHOLM — Prosecutors dropped half of the charges in the landmark trial of The Pirate Bay file sharing site Tuesday , leaving observers stunned and prompting questions about the government ’s preparedness in the long - awaited criminal proceeding .
" I will drop all charges that relate to producing infringing copies and will hence restrict the prosecution to the act of making works available to the public , " prosecutor Hakan Roswall announced at the opening of the second day of the trial .
" When I talk about making something available to the public I mean making available torrent files . "
At an intermission , Roswall refused to clarify the change of heart to reporters .
" As you can see I have a lot of other things to think about , " he said .
" There will be new adjusted charges distributed on paper tomorrow , Wednesday . "
Four men associated with the defiant BitTorrent tracking site are on trial for contributory copyright infringement .
Hans Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundströmface face up to two years in prison each , in addition to fines as high as $ 180,000 .
The Pirate Bay ’s supporters quickly claimed victory in the blogosphere , and many expressed astonishment at the course - correction .
This was , after all , supposed to be the seminal piracy prosecution , with Hollywood throwing the kitchen sink at a few defiant Swedish computer nerds .
Peter Danowsky , the attorney representing the music labels , downplayed the reduction in charges .
" It ’s a largely technical issue that changes nothing in terms of our compensation claims and has no bearing whatsoever on the main case against The Pirate Bay , " he said in a statement .
" In fact it simplifies the prosecutor ’s case by allowing him to focus on the main issue , which is the making available of copyrighted works . "
The move is remarkable because of the extensive groundwork the content industries and the prosecutor has laid for the case .
The Motion Pictures Association and other plaintiffs had collected evidence for many months by participating in file - sharing torrent swarms , dumping screenshots of downloads in progress and collecting information before the raid on May 31 , 2006 , in which 195 computers were trucked away by the police .
The prosecutor led an investigation for two - and - a - half years after that .
The prosecution has specified 21 works of music , nine movies and three computer games that were allegedly infringed .
The Pirate Bay defendants were not charged with direct copyright infringement , but only in assisting in committing such acts .
Under Swedish law , prosecutors must therefore prove the defendants engaged in " facilitating for other people to make available a copyright protected work via transmission on the internet " in a specific file on a specific date .
The hitch in the prosecutor ’s plan hinges on Pirate Bay ’s dual - functionality .
The site includes a " tracker " that coordinates communication between peers downloading and uploading files .
But it also has a searchable index that merely lists the torrent files available through a variety of trackers , not just The Pirate Bay’s .
The prosecutor now appears to agree with the defendants that he cannot prove that the specific files at issue were handled by Pirate Bay ’s trackers .
The only thing that is left is " assisting making available " the torrent files , a charge that the prosecution evidently hopes to press based on Pirate Bay ’s index alone .
The move may have been prompted in part by the defendants ’ opening statements .
On Monday , Pirate Bay co-founder Fredrik Neij discussed so called " trackerless torrents , " which use a Distributed Hash Table , or DHT , and do n’t rely on a torrent tracker at all .
" We believe he dropped charges after having googled all night about DHT , " an upbeat Peter Sunde , one of the defendants , told Wired.com later .
Fredrik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm
Warg boasted that they were just scratching the surface of the flaws in the government ’s case , and that they would raise deeper technical points later in the trial .
It remains to be seen whether facilitating making torrent files available is enough to commit the criminal act of assisting in copyright infringement .
" Absolutely not , " claimed Rick Falkvinge , the leader of The Pirate Party .
" If they can claim that facilitating for others to publish a torrent file , which contains no copyright protected information whatsoever , then this shows that they want to shut down the internet for good . "
Many people like working with the pawn shops mainly because they usually find them favorable and easy to work .
Mostly , people who work with these shops are people who are not living affluent lives and are generally in jobs that do not pay high salaries .
These people could also comprise those people who do not require such big loans as those given by the banks due to nature of the person ’s necessity .
Some reasons why many people prefer these loans given by the pawn shops include the following :
They are flexible and convinced
Pawn shops are easily available to their customers .
This implies that a person can secure a loan at any given time provided they have the item to give in the place of the loan .
People could also get as much loan as their items can manage .
There are usually no restrictions on getting a loan ever after you have already obtained another one and kept it pending .
Unlike in the bank where once you get a loan , you cannot get another one before completing the previous one , pawn shops can loan you based on the frequency one brings an item .
This is because , it is not necessary for the person to return the money as it is the situation in banks .
They give instant cash
Once you get item to a pawn shop , the pawnbrokers will instantly give you cash equivalent to an agreed fraction .
The cash given do not require a chain of approval from different personels as it is the situation in banks .
Once you get your loan and have agreed on the grace period after which the loan will either be returned or the item will change ownership to stand in place of the loaned amount .
It is not a must return the loan
When a person decides to obtain a loan from a particular bank where the person is a member , they usually have the exact amount , they need from the bank .
And before the loan is approved , the person goes through a certain procedure which involves signings .
From this , the person is bound by the signatures would they fail to meet the agreement .
On contrary , pawn shops do not operate in that manner .
The person is not held under pressure because the item given could be of no use to them hence they can hope not refund the money .
There is no follow - up mechanisms either by the notifications in pawn shops , but banks have to notify the person oftenly about the outstanding loan .
Due to the above reasons , and many others , people have developed much interest in working with pawn shops .
This is basically achieved after one have weighed the two loan agents and exclusively evaluating them .

6/16/2017 New Paramotor Trike World Altitude Record !!
18,208 ft on the Flat Top Ninja and Air Trike just beat the previous paramotor trike altitude record which was also set with the Flat Top Ninja and Air Trike at 16,245 ft .
This new altitude record of 18,208 ft was set with a completely stock Flat Top Ninja , Air Trike and Dominator paraglider .
This was also without even tuning or having to adjust the mixture which is truly incredible .
The Flat Top Ninja just as advertised can go anywhere from sea level to over 18,000 ft without every having to change carburetor settings .
8/30/2013 Paramotor World Speed Record !!
SUPERDELL
Schanze , the WPPGA Paramotor World Champion , ups the ante by braking his own world speed record once again .
This time on the new XXS Dominator paraglider from U - Turn USA .
To get an accurate speed you must clock it with a GPS in both directions and then take the average to eliminate any tail wind from being a factor .
By clocking both directions and taking the average on GPS ground speed you get a very accurate true air speed and 51 mph is indeed the fastest paraglider in the history of time .
The previous record was 50 mph set on the 11sm Morpheus acro glider .
Unlike the Morpheus acro glider which was really lacking in safety and ease of launch the Dominator is a paraglider that is so incredibly safe it is the very wing that SUPERDELL puts his own children on when they fly .
This is an enourmous breakthrough as you generally have to choose between performance or safety .
Now with the new Dominator you get performance AND safety all in one wing .
Once again pushing the boundary of what ’s possible the bar has just been raised once again .
Another kudos to the most respected pilot in the history of the sport for another incredible achievement !!!
Glider Control
Glider control is extremely important in mastering powered paragliding .
The key to students graduating from the WPPGA training with such incredible paramotoring skills is their complete mastery of glider control .
You would not be sent into the air to pilot an airplane without learning the controls first .
The same holds true with these aircrafts .
You do n’t want to learn how to kite your paraglider while having a motor strapped to your back , and you definitely do n’t want to learn the proper skills and reflexes of glider control WHILE you are in the air .
It is unnecessary and unsafe to do so when you can develop those skills while still on the ground .
Benefits of Glider Control
It is extremely common to find paramotor instructors who will throw their students into the air on their first day or two of training .
This is a huge problem .
Without developing the proper glider control skills students do not have the reflexes to properly react to situations that can and will arise .
Without proper reflexes you are over 5000 times more likely to take a collapse , and reaction times will often be so bad that those without proper training end up doing the wrong thing at the wrong time , making bad situations even worse .
Instructors embodying this method of “ training ” are rolling the dice with their life and those of their students , and the wrong number comes up over and over again .
Glider control can not be stressed enough !
Instructors and Glider Control
An instructor ’s job is not simply to “ get you into the air ” .
An instructor ’s job is to help students progress in their skills and ensure that those skills are mastered before taking flight .
If you are not ready , then you do not fly .
Glider control is the first step .
These are the training methods that should be used by paramotor instructors .
ONLY the WPPGA trains their students according to these practices .
If you get the proper training and fly quality equipment , paramotoring is an extremely fun and extremely safe extreme sport .
Do I have any readers left who think humans are rational about risks ?
Abstract
Low processing fluency fosters the impression that a stimulus is unfamiliar , which in turn results in perceptions of higher risk , independent of whether the risk is desirable or undesirable .
In Studies 1 and 2 , ostensible food additives were rated as more harmful when their names were difficult to pronounce than when their names were easy to pronounce ; mediation analyses indicated that this effect was mediated by the perceived novelty of the substance .
In Study 3 , amusement - park rides were rated as more likely to make one sick ( an undesirable risk ) and also as more exciting and adventurous ( a desirable risk ) when their names were difficult to pronounce than when their names were easy to pronounce .
Bernard Madoff was arrested December 12 , 2008 for an alleged $ 50 billion investor fraud and released on $ 10 million bail .
While the press heralds this as the biggest ponzi scheme in history , it ’s a pittance compared to the real estate schemes that have created the present financial crisis .
Like Madoff ’s scheme , the house market became dependent on a steady price increase .
Buyers were willing to pay high prices with the expectation that they could later sell for a profit .
Eventually , without substantial inflation , houses had to become unaffordable .
House prices had reached levels that often required most of a household ’s income .
Subprimes were just a frantic attempt to continue this pyramid .
Like every ponzi scheme , some means must be found to get more money from new “ investors ” to payoff old .
As a result of constant lobbying by the real estate and banking industry , the government promoted homeownership as the “ American Dream . ”
It subsidized it by mortgage tax deductions , inflation and the willingness of Freddy and Fannie to continually raise the loan bar .
After the bailout of the saving and loans in the ‘ 90s , mortgage lenders came to believe that the Feds would always support rising house prices .
The real estate agent industry and the commercial real estate agent industry , with the acquiescence of a heavily lobbied government , has created the homeowner myth by a constant stream of propaganda .
We were told that as the price of goods inflates our savings dwindle , but house prices consistently appreciate and are a hedge against inflation .
Also , we were told that our house is an investment , and , for most of us , our biggest investment .
It consumes most of our income .
According to this “ reasoning , ” by building “ equity , ” we can refinance and reduce our payments , and as our equity grows , we can “ trade up . ”
We were told that buying any house will “ get our foot in the door . ”
A hole in a wall is thus a “ starter , ” “ fixer - upper , ” or a “ diamond in the rough . ”
If we dared to complain about the stratospheric price of houses , we were told , “ Hey , it ’s just the natural law of supply and demand ! ”
Homeowners were hoodwinked into believing that their home was a nest egg .
Houses are not capital goods ; they ’re consumables .
The real value of property depends on its location – proximity to schools , police , fire , social services , roads and other infrastructure .
All of these are paid by taxes , yet many politicians ran on platforms to reduce taxes .
Their constituents were led to believe that high mortgage payments were inevitable , and that tax reduction is the only way that they could make ends meet .
As tax bases fell , civic programs were cut .
The price of the property increased , but it real value declined .
One major difference between Madoff and the mortgage schemes is that Madoff was arrested while the mortgage bankers are being bailed out .
Even programs created by the government ostensibly to help homeowners in foreclosure are actually geared to help the mortgage bankers .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , the $ 300 billion “ Hope for Homeowners ” program begun Oct 1 has not helped a single homeowner !
In my next post I will present ideas on how nationalizing Freddie and Fannie can create a mortgage bank , produce affordable housing , and reduce the risk of foreclosure .
I would like this to be an open forum that will solicit ideas and suggestions .

Family Security Matters
Gerry J. Gilmore , American Forces Press Service
December 18 , 2008
Pentagon officials have established a new rapid - response joint task force and plan to create two more in coming years to bolster assistance to civil authorities following potential chemical , biological or nuclear attacks or natural disasters , a senior U.S. official said here yesterday .
The new units will team with other federal agencies in support of local responders following chemical , biological or nuclear terror attacks on the homeland or during natural disasters , Paul McHale , assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and Americas ’ security affairs , told American Forces Press Service and Pentagon Channel reporters .
The establishment of the new units “ builds upon a decade of improving [ Defense Department ] capabilities to deal with a domestic terrorist attack involving a weapon of mass destruction , ” McHale said .
The first new 4,700 - member task force was assigned to a component of U.S. Northern Command on Oct. 1 , McHale said .
The new unit , he said , is built around a core of active - duty soldiers from the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team based at Fort Stewart , Ga .
This task force , he said , falls under the control of Northcom ’s Joint Force Land Component Command , U.S. Army North , in San Antonio .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Plans are to stand up the other two new joint task forces in 2010 and 2011 , respectively , McHale said .
These units , he said , mostly will comprise reserve component personnel from all the military services .
Each task force will be capable of performing tasks such as medical response , decontamination , technical rescue , patient evacuation , and communications and logistics support , to include air and land transportation assets for transport of supplies , people and equipment , according to U.S. Army North documents .
The task forces would be ordered into action by the president , McHale said , following requests for disaster - relief assistance from state governors .
The new units , he emphasized , do not conduct law - enforcement missions .
In the event of civil disturbances and some other types of national emergencies , he said , other designated U.S. military units could be ordered by the president to help civil authorities establish order as part of the Garden Plot domestic security plan .
The Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States prompted U.S. officials to consider whether existing National Guard - staffed civil support teams could provide enough resources to support civil authorities during multiple catastrophic events , McHale said .
McHale said 9/11 also “ was the genesis for the creation of U.S. Northern Command . ”
Northcom , he said , is responsible for homeland defense of the continental U.S. and Alaska , while U.S. Pacific Command is responsible for Hawaii .
Air Force Gen. Victor E. Renuart Jr. commands Northcom as well as North American Aerospace Defense Command , which are co-located at Peterson Air Force Base , Colorado Springs , Colo .
National Guard - staffed civil support teams were developed through a Pentagon initiative dating to the mid-1990s .
Today , there are 53 civil support teams distributed across the United States , McHale said .
These 22 - member units , he said , are trained to test for chemical , biological or nuclear contamination in the event of a weapons - of - mass - destruction - attack on the United States .
Additionally , Marine Corps - operated emergency - response units that specialize in relief operations are available during chemical , biological and nuclear attacks , he said .
The Emergency Election Sale is now live !
Get 30 % to 60 % off our most popular products today !
Today , there are only about 50,000 acres of federal geothermal leases in production across the USA which support about 1,200 MW of power capacity .
In California , geothermal energy produces more power in than wind and solar combined , comprising almost 5 % of the state ’s electricity .
But for the past two decades , there were 10 million acres of public land in California with geothermal potential that were off - limits due to bureaucratic oversight that are now becoming available for leasing .
So , how much geothermal energy potential could there be on these 10 million acres ?
If ten percent of the land now open to leasing is eventually developed with similar yields to existing leases , geothermal production would increase 2000 % .
That is equivalent to roughly 243,000 MW , or roughly enough to power the whole state of California .
This is just from the lands in California — the Programmatic Geothermal Environmental Impact Study ( PGEIS ) also made decisions for 11 other western states .
And , while that sounds like a lot of land to give over development , geothermal power only uses a tiny fraction of each lease for power production .
So why are n’t more projects moving forward in California ?
The quick and simple answer is that leases and permits are simply not being issued .
Even when a lease is given , there are examples where after almost two years they are still waiting for a drilling permit to be issued .
This includes leases that are within an existing geothermal field .
Another problem is continued delays in decision - making .
At one geothermal site the delay is due to off - road vehicle users .
Despite completion of a full EIS , development at one new site in Southern California , the project is not proceeding because leases have yet to be issued , because of opposition to the project from recreational off - road vehicle users who like to drive their four - wheel - drive vehicles around the area .
The irony here is that
While these two examples might just seem to be the kind of problems typical when working on public lands , they are just the tip of the iceberg .
In a state where federal and state lands play a significant role , most of the public lands have effectively been off limits for decades because the land - use plans of federal agencies simply did n’t consider geothermal energy when they were prepared .
Before a lease can be issued on public lands the land - use plan for the area has to have adequately considered geothermal leasing and made a decision that the lands could be open to leasing .
Also , the land - use plan has to have an adequate and up - to - date environmental analysis ( EA or EIS ) supporting it .
Because BLM ( and the FS ) simply have not done their homework in the land - use plans prepared over the past 25 years , most areas in California have been de facto closed to geothermal leasing and development .
That is why in 2007 and 2008 the BLM and Forest Service prepared a Programmatic Geothermal EIS ( PGEIS ) to address this history of neglect .
Now , as part of their Record of Decision ( ROD ) on this document , the Department of the Interior is amending plans in California and other western states to either allow leasing or close lands to leasing on the basis of the results of their analysis .
For California , the ROD proposes to amend land - use plans in 11 California BLM planning areas to open 10 million acres to possible geothermal leasing .
At the same time , the ROD will close 5 million acres in these 11 BLM planning areas to geothermal leasing .
If someone cannot obtain a lease to develop a geothermal project , there is simply no incentive to explore for or develop new resources .
Now , the BLM has in place the plans and environmental documents necessary to make a decision if someone nominates BLM lands for competitive leasing .
But for the past two decades , 10 million acres of public land in California with geothermal potential were off - limits due to bureaucratic oversight .
Congress and the new administration have set some high goals for expanding renewable energy production , including geothermal energy .
What they need to address now is the mess of federal and state policies that while trying to support renewable energy projects , have actually stifled them .
Timely decisions regarding leasing and permitting must be enacted urgently as they are fundamental to achieving expanded geothermal energy production in California and the western USA .
Some of the companies in the geothermal and recovered energy power business in the western USA are Ormat Technologies Inc. ( NYSE : ORA ) , U.S. Geothermal Inc. ( AMEX : HTM ) , Raser Technologies , Inc. ( NYSE : RZ ) and Nevada Geothermal Power Inc. ( OTC : NGLPF )

Until now , parents of children with autism who have spoken up about their fears that their child ’s disorder came on the heels of vaccination have been given the status of heretic .
But it turns out that the increase in autism we have been witnessing over the last few decades could also be a result of the over - all increase in the body burden caused by mercury in our air and water , and by proxy the fish we eat , our vaccines and dental fillings , and now , in our high fructose corn syrup , a substance marketed and consumed most often by those most at risk : children .
It is a matter of record that our fish populations are accumulating mercury ; and as the top of their food chain , we too are accumulating the toxin .
The neurological effects of mercury have been widely documented .
On the EPA ’s website , for example , it lists the primary health effect of methylmercury on fetuses , infants , and children , as being impaired neurological development .
In 2004 , a study [ PDF ] led by Raymond F. Palmer of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio compared the rate of special education programs in Texas and the amount of mercury found in the environment and the results were alarming : “ On average , for each 1000 lb of environmental mercury released , there was a 43 % increase in the rate of special education services and a 61 % increase in the rate of autism . ”
He co-authored a second study [ PDF ] from February 2008 that took into account the proximity to sources of mercury output — like coal - fired utility plants , which account for 33 % of the 158 tons of mercury spewed into the atmosphere annually , municipal / medical incinerators , which account for 29 % , commercial / industrial boilers , which account for 18 % .
Lower on the list but still noteworthy are hazardous waste sites , cement factories , and the chlorine production plants — which is where the caustic soda tainted with mercury in HFCS is being produced .
This second study found that “ for every 10 miles from industrial or power plant sources , there was an associated decreased autism Incident Risk of 2.0 % and 1.4 % , respectively . ”
In other words , the more mercury in the environment of a child or woman of childbearing age , the more likely for the child to develop autism .
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
The reason that the news on Monday that HFCS contains mercury is so alarming is two fold :
First , the FDA had evidence of this in 2005 and did absolutely nothing — no testing , no warning the companies using the tainted HFCS to produce their ketchup , chocolate syrup , cereal bars and soda .
Therefore , more time has passed when mercury could bio-accumulate in our bodies , especially in populations at already at risk for heart disease , diabetes and obesity .
Second , there has been a previous association made between diet and autistic functionality — and specifically HFCS has been singled out as a cause for worsening the disorder .
This means that there has been a growing body of evidence relating mercury to autism for some time , in which HFCS is only a new development .
This is dark news , because it means that our FDA is no longer working for us , and that in this time when we might have a receptive ear in Washington , it is more important than ever to challenge the preconceived notions of how government works .
This could amount to one of the worst offenses by our government , which has been sitting on the evidence of mercury ’s relationship to our health for too long in the name of corporate welfare .
The parents of autistic children should be given more of a voice in this discussion .
In an article published on Salon.com in 2005 , Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. laid out the details on the correlation between autism and childhood vaccines .
It became clear to him that the parents of autistic children who blamed the vaccines for their child ’s disorder were onto something when he stumbled onto a report from a conference in 2000 called Simpsonwood , where high - level officials from the FDA and Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , the top vaccine specialist from the World Health Organization in Geneva , and representatives of every major vaccine manufacturer , including GlaxoSmithKline , Merck , Wyeth and Aventis Pasteur gathered to discuss a new study that linked a mercury - based preservative in vaccines to increasing rates of autism .
This group , instead of changing course , and giving value to the science before them , proceeded to cover up the data to save the vaccine companies ’ bottom line .
Now , we are faced with some hard truth about the consequences of our environmental choices beginning at the Industrial Revolution .
While thimerosal , the mercury - laden preservative used in some vaccinations , is being phased out , we should still be asking for a better assessment of our body burden of mercury .
With all that we know now , about what toxic pollution in the air and water do to our food and by proxy our bodies , will we face facts and begin the process of real , lasting change that the Obama adminstration has so far seemed a beacon for ?
The first step will be taking a hard look at environmental mercury , one of the most prevalent pollutants in our environment .
We have a mess on our hands , and we need to begin to repair the damage done before we can move forward healthfully .
How to Choose Between Experiential and Material Purchases
If you decided to spend $ 100 on your happiness , would you buy something experiential like a meal out or something material like an item of clothing ?
Research covered here recently suggested that for long - term happiness experiences tend to beat possessions .
But Leonardo Nicolao and colleagues at the University of Texas argue in the Journal of Consumer Research that this research does n’t tell us the whole picture ( Nicolao et al. , 2009 ) .
Nicolao and colleagues point out that the previous research by Van Boven and Gilovich ( 2003 ) only compared experiential and material purchases that went well , not those that went wrong .
What if the clothes turn out to be money down the drain or the meal out is a complete bust from beginning to end : what does that do to our happiness ?
When purchases go wrong
The researchers used three experiments to examine this question .
In the first two of these participants were randomly assigned to groups in which they recalled material and experiential purchases that had either turned out well , or that had turned out badly .
They were then asked how happy ( or otherwise ) these purchases had made them .
The results suggested that , just like Van Boven and Gilovich ’s research , experiential purchases ( e.g. a meal out ) beat material purchases ( e.g. clothes ) if each turned out well .
But , for some people whose scores were low on a measure of materialism , when the purchases turned out badly , it was the material goods that left them slightly happier .
In contrast the highly materialistic were left less happy when their material purchases went wrong .
In a third experiment participants actually made a small experiential versus a small material purchase and then their happiness over time was measured .
It was found that when participants made a material purchase that turned out badly it was easier for them to forget about it than an experiential purchase that went wrong .
Across three experiments , then , Nicolao and colleagues found evidence that when our experiential purchases go wrong we are likely to end up slightly less happy than if we had chosen a material purchase .
But , as in previous research , when our purchases go well we are likely to end up significantly happier if we choose an experiential rather than a material purchase .
Experiences still beat possessions
This study provides further support for the idea that experiential purchases like restaurant trips or theatre tickets are likely to beat material purchases like clothes or electronics for our long - term happiness .
Nicolao and colleagues show that this is at least partly because it takes us longer to adapt to experiential purchases than material purchases .
Experiences also beat possessions because they seem to :
Improve with time as we forget about all the boring moments and just recall the highlights .
Take on symbolic meanings , whereas those shoes are still just shoes .
Be very resistant to unfavourable comparisons : a wonderful moment in a restaurant is personally yours and difficult to compare , but all too soon your shoes are likely to look dated in comparison with the new fashions .
On the other hand this study does suggest that if our purchases go badly , there ’s probably little to choose between experiences and possessions , with the less materialistic left slightly happier with their material purchases .
This may be because unhappy experiences live longer in the mind than purchases that turn out badly .
Of course this study only compared material purchases with experiential purchases because , after all , this is the Journal of Consumer Research .
But what about comparing material purchases with totally free experiences like a walk in the park , an afternoon spent lolling by the river or chatting with friends ?
In these cash - strapped times it ’s worth remembering that free experiences may well make us happier than possessions , it ’s just that with less money we can’t hand the responsibility for our entertainment to others ( restaurants , theatres , films etc. ) but have to be more creative ourselves .

Credit for the roadside bombing which killed an Israeli soldier along the Gaza border earlier today has been claimed by the Jihad and Tawhid Brigades , an al - Qaeda linked group which has repeatedly clashed with Hamas .
Still , the Israeli military says that even though Hamas did n’t carry out the attack , it is still responsible for it because they guess they may have given consent to the group .
In its early retaliation , the Israeli government killed a nearby farmer and launched an air - strike which killed a Hamas member and wounded another civilian .
They also closed off the border crossings , preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the strip ’s 1.5 million reisdents , “ until further notice . ”
Indications are this is not the end of Israel ’s attacks , which are threatening to derail the ceasefire .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said today that the killings so far were “ not the response ” and that more attacks were yet to come .
The Israeli military has also reported been “ given the green light ” to respond harshly in the Gaza Strip .
Defense official Amos Gilad said the response would not be limited to closing off the border .

Advertisement A " shy " photographer in Indonesia is in great demand because of his resemblance to the new US President , Barack Obama .
Ilham Anas , 34 , is already a celebrity in Jakarta , where Mr Obama once lived , but his fame is spreading .
He has appeared on Indonesia 's premier TV talk show , done an advertisement as Mr Obama , and received other marketing offers from companies in the region .
The real Barack Obama went to school in Jakarta in the late 1960s , when his classmates knew him as Barry .
Mr Anas told Reuters news agency : " I was in the airport in Malaysia in transit and a man approached me and asked : ' Are you Obama ? ' .
I was very surprised when he asked to take a picture together and bought me a meal . "
Mr Anas 's increasing popularity arose after his colleagues , at a local teenage magazine , asked him to pose with a suit , tie and American flag , following Mr Obama 's election victory in November .
I see my resemblance to Obama as a blessing - I used to look at the mirror and I had a negative perception of myself
Ilham Anas Soon , they were taking photos and sending them to friends .
" The pictures spread very quickly on the internet .
It was phenomenal .
Then TV stations and an advertising agency got in touch with me , " he said .
Mr Anas was born and raised in Bandung , West Java .
He says he is happy to cash in but there are limits .
" I will take all the opportunities that come my way , as long as they do n't violate ethical codes and my personal values , " he told AFP news agency .
And he admits that all the attention has given him something of a boost .
" I 'm actually a shy person .
I do n't like being put in the spotlight .
" I see my resemblance to Obama as a blessing .
I used to look at the mirror and I had a negative perception of myself . "
Many Indonesians have a keen interest in Mr Obama , who lived in Jakarta for four years after his American mother , Ann Dunham , married Indonesian Lolo Soetoro following the end of her marriage to Mr Obama 's Kenyan father .

Plaintiffs from the California Supreme Court case regarding same - sex marriage stand in line to vote at a polling station in Berkeley on Election Day early Tuesday morning .
Contributing Writer
Although Alameda County voters decisively opposed it and campus groups repeatedly rallied against it , the majority of Californians supported Proposition 8 at the polls yesterday , eliminating same - sex marriage from the state constitution .
The results remained too close to call until early this morning , but at 1 a.m. , after a $ 70 million battle and four years of court cases , controversy and campaigning , the proposition passed with 52.6 percent of votes .
The proposition will reverse the California Supreme Court decision earlier this year that expanded marriage to include same - sex couples , instead defining marriage as only between a man and a woman .
Berkeley residents Jody Sokolower and her partner of 36 years , Karen Shain - two plaintiffs in the court case that allowed same - couples to marry - got up at the break of dawn to vote down the proposition .
At 11 p.m. , when they went to sleep , the proposition was still in limbo .
" We 're so happy about Obama , " Sokolower said after the presidential election results were released .
" If we lose on ( Proposition ) 8 , that 'll be really upsetting , but there 's always next time . "
The campaign for the proposition witnessed growing momentum in the weeks leading up to the election , said Chip White , spokesperson for the Yes on 8 campaign .
White , a UC Berkeley alumnus , said both sides spent more than $ 30 million on their respective campaigns , the highest dollar amount spent on any proposition on a social issue .
According to White , 100,000 volunteers campaigned with Yes on 8 .
Those against the proposition put forth an equally vigorous effort .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , known for his controversial move to issue marriage licenses to more than 4,000 same - sex couples in 2004 , was a major player in the campaign on college campuses .
" You cannot build a society unless you have a level playing field for everyone to participate , " Newsom said during a guest lecture at UC Berkeley last month .
Newsom , who also led a campus rally against the proposition , underscored the importance of ensuring fundamental human rights and setting an example for the rest of the nation , ideas echoed by members of the Vote Down 4 and 8 Coalition at UC Berkeley .
" As much as I think this is a step backwards , I think as Californians who believe in fairness and equality what we have accomplished is amazing , " said senior Phillip Alvarado , co-campus campaign manager of the coalition .
" We 've come together as a community , and this kind of work is unprecedented .
It has not happened before , not on this level . "
Josh Curtis , who is the president of the Berkeley College Republicans and voted for the proposition , said he believed the proposition 's success points to how most Californians view marriage .
" I think it 's pretty clear that the vast majority of Americans are for a traditional definition of marriage and I think that these results are just revealing that fact , " Curtis said .
But Sokolower said it was important to keep the defeat of same - sex marriage in perspective .
Although Californians passed the proposition this year , she said she hoped they would overturn it in the future .
" I do n't think this is over , " Sokolower said .
" I think this is an idea whose time has come , and I feel really confident that this is an era in which homophobia is going to fall . "
The Interior Department on Wednesday blocked a Bush administration plan to open parts of the Mountain West for oil shale development , announcing that it would first study the water , power and land - use issues that complicate one of the nation ’s most abundant but controversial untapped sources of energy .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar canceled shale development leases on federal land in Colorado , Utah and Wyoming and launched a second round of leases in the region limited to research purposes .
In doing so , he rebuked what he called former President George W. Bush ’s “ headlong rush ” to begin development .
“ Those who have fantasized that oil shale is a panacea for America ’s energy needs have been living in a fantasy land , ” he said .
The move marked the third time in a month that the Obama administration has frozen late - term Bush decisions that sought to spur domestic energy development over objections from environmentalists .

President Obama has repeatedly pledged to reduce dependence on foreign oil , an effort he frequently links to his plans to spend billions on renewable - energy research , enhanced electricity transmission , efficiency improvement and other “ green ” areas of the economic stimulus bill .
That spending focuses almost exclusively on electricity use in homes and commercial buildings , but more than two - thirds of the oil consumed by the U.S. is devoted to transportation .
Though Obama has called for accelerated efforts to develop electric cars , they are presently only a small fraction of all vehicles on the road .
That suggests the administration ’s energy initiatives , at least in the early stages , may not substantially reduce oil imports .
Glenn Vawter , executive director of the National Oil Shale Assn. , said Salazar ’s decision on shale leases was n’t a surprise .
But critics say the string of Interior announcements , which include canceling some oil leases near national parks and lengthening the public comments process for new offshore drilling , amount to reducing the effort to boost domestic oil production .

“ Despite the valuable progress being made in the development of new energy sources and technologies , there is still no viable substitute for oil , ” Karen Harbert , president and chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s Institute for 21st Century Energy , told a congressional hearing on offshore drilling Wednesday .
Interior Department aides noted that even Bush officials , testifying before Congress last year , estimated that oil shale would n’t be commercially viable until 2016 at earliest .
Salazar said the department was not “ anti-development . ”
“ We want to be thoughtful and deliberate as we move forward , ” he said .
He also said he expected plug - in electric vehicles to play a large role in the administration ’s energy independence plans .

Replacing Bush ’s leases with additional research leases , Salazar said , will allow the department to examine the unresolved issues of shale , major deposits of which are in Colorado and other mountain states .
Among the issues : how much power and water it would require to extract -- and where , in the often - parched West , the water would come from .
Some studies of commercial shale development have suggested that the technology would consume huge quantities of water and produce mountains of potentially toxic waste material .
Environmentalists celebrated Wednesday ’s announcement .
“ This is a huge step forward in protecting America ’s Western lands from oil shale development , which is nothing more than a dirty , expensive pipe dream , ” said Bobby McEnaney , lands advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council .

Holy #*%$ !
I 've just seen the Japanese intro for Street Fighter IV and it looks absolutely killer .
Screw objectivity , I 'm going to say right now that from my impressions of the Street Fighter IV arcade game and from what I 've played so far of the console release , Street IV could very well be the greatest fighting game ever made .
With Eurogamer 's review going live tomorrow ( Monday 16th February ) , I 'm taking a look back at the different Street Fighter games in their many different arcade transitions .
Hold onto your sticks people .
Street Fighter
Series :
( 1987 ) Street Fighter
SFI Mechanics :
Shotokan - the classic Hadoken , Shoryuken and Tatsumaki Senpukyaku moveset
Specials - the three examples listed above
The first ever Street Fighter appeared in arcades in 1987 and was directed and produced by Takashi Nishiyama and Hiroshi Matsumoto , who would later leave Capcom to work for SNK and produce some of Street Fighter 's biggest rivals - including Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters .
The original Street Fighter offered arcade patrons a fighter experience that was visually far more impressive than Yie Ar Kung Fu or Karate Champ , although the 2D animation , even compared to the first Street Fighter II , is choppy to say the least .
Players did n't have any choice in character selection ; Player 1 was Ryu and Player 2 was Ken ( if you 've briefly played Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix online you'd be forgiven for assuming this is a tradition Capcom never dropped ) .
If Player 2 won against Player 1 it was possible for them to complete the rest of the game as Ken .
Although considerably more fleshed out in later iterations , Ryu 's initial story did n't go much further than entering a mixed martial arts tournament to prove his strength ( and no doubt honour ) .
Humble beginnings .
No one would have ever expected Street Fighter to evolve into the Street Fighter IV we have today .
Before the first fight the player had the option of whether they wanted to start their world tour in Japan , the United States , China or England .
Each country housed two Street Fighting champions who had to be toppled in the classic best - of - three - rounds format before moving onto the next pair .
Seems us Brits have the poorest street - fighting output , with crude bouncer Birdie and the camp , club - wielding Eagle , each named after golf terms .
Thailand , however , the final fifth country after the other four have fallen , is home to the superlative Muay Thai Emperor Sagat and his protégé Adon .
Out of the twelve original Street Fighter cast , over half were brought back in later games .
Ryu , Ken and Sagat made obvious returns , and Birdie , Adon and Gen all resurfaced in the Street Fighter Alpha series .
Eagle , meanwhile , got a lucky break when he was exhumed for Capcom vs. SNK 2 .
However , generic ninja Genki and underground martial arts champion Joe will likely never be heading the bill for a comeback fight .
Character design has moved on considerably .
Similar to the barrel - breaking and car - crushing bonus games of Street Fighter II , Street Fighter preceded its older brother with board - and block - breaking bonus games spliced in - between the bouts .
Hearing the crowd boo Ryu after he fails to break a few flimsy boards raises a smile when you consider that some of his Marvel vs. Capcom Supers could probably level a house .
Seems his years of training really paid off .
Last year one of our number had a heated discussion with a fellow Street Fighter fan about the first Street Fighter 's control system .
He was convinced that the cabinet had a joystick and a pressure - sensitive punch and kick button , which , depending on how hard it was pressed , would result in either a light , medium or heavy attack .
Conversely his friend was adamant that the original Street Fighter had the same six - button interface as the subsequent Street Fighter II games .
Wait a minute , was n't Birdie black in Street Fighter Alpha ?
It turns out they were both right .
Street Fighter was sold in a regular six - button cabinet and a deluxe cabinet that utilised pressure - recognition technology .
Reports suggest that the pressure buttons were gimmicky at best , susceptible to breaking and made the game harder to play .
But we 'd wager that a pristine Street Fighter Deluxe cabinet will be a desirable piece for any Street Fighter memorabilia collector .
In gameplay terms , time has n't been kind to Street Fighter in the same way it has to Street Fighter II .
Everything feels imprecise with erratic animation and timing ; some bouts can be over in seconds .
The classic shotokan moveset of Fireball , Dragon Punch and Hurricane Kick are available to Ryu , even though Capcom left it for players to discover them by themselves rather than including the movelist on the cabinets .
The timing for these specials was less forgiving than Street Fighter II , but if you could pull them off most opponents could be downed in two or three hits .
Not even Super fireballs can do that these days .
It 's common knowledge among fighter fans that Ryu gave Sagat the scar on his chest with a fierce Dragon Punch at the end of the first Street Fighter tournament .
We do n't know how he lost the eye though - maybe there 's a Black Mamba fighter Capcom still has n't unveiled yet .
Those who managed to finish Sagat were rewarded with a message .
" There is always someone waiting in line to knock you off the top , be prepared to be challenged . "
Capcom 's future interpretation of this would change the fighter scene forever .
Battered by a crash in its stock price , the replacement of its CEO last year and an aggressive virtualisation market , VMWare has done the only thing it could do : release an open source virtualisation client .
Once the pre-eminent name in virtualisation software and with a share price in excess of $ 120 , VMWare is now a $ 20 - a- share player in a market that has more competition than the company seems able to handle .
As OStatic ’s SamDean points out , VMWare ’s problems come as the result of two things :
A new wave of open source virtualisation products ; and the free virtualisation tools bundled with operating systems such as Microsoft and Red Hat .
With free , good , alternatives to VMWare , the company is in a bit of a bind .
So , it has done what it had to do : compete with its own open source alternative .
The VMware View Open Client allows businesses to host virtualised desktops in the data center and allowing users to access their desktops from any device .
From the announcement :
VMware View enables IT organisations to safely host user desktops in the datacenter , while letting users access their personalised desktop environments from almost any device , at any time – all at a lower cost of ownership than traditional desktop environments .
Now , VMware is providing VMware View Open Client for partners , enabling them to use VMware View source code to optimize their products to deliver rich , personalized virtual desktops to users .
In addition , partners will be able to use the source code to help accelerate the development and delivery of solutions for enterprises to provision and manage thousands of virtual desktops simply , securely and at substantially lower operating costs .
The VMWare View Open Client software is licensed under the GPL and can be downloaded here .
BARA , Pakistan 
More than 70 United States military advisers and technical specialists are secretly working in Pakistan to help its armed forces battle Al Qaeda and the Taliban in the country ’s lawless tribal areas , American military officials said .
The Americans are mostly Army Special Forces soldiers who are training Pakistani Army and paramilitary troops , providing them with intelligence and advising on combat tactics , the officials said .
They do not conduct combat operations , the officials added .
They make up a secret task force , overseen by the United States Central Command and Special Operations Command .
It started last summer , with the support of Pakistan ’s government and military , in an effort to root out Qaeda and Taliban operations that threaten American troops in Afghanistan and are increasingly destabilizing Pakistan .
It is a much larger and more ambitious effort than either country has acknowledged .
Pakistani officials have vigorously protested American missile strikes in the tribal areas as a violation of sovereignty and have resisted efforts by Washington to put more troops on Pakistani soil .
President Asif Ali Zardari , who leads a weak civilian government , is trying to cope with soaring anti-Americanism among Pakistanis and a belief that he is too close to Washington .
Sarah Welch : Bachelor Rome Contestant Sues Over Fall ( VIDEO )
, former contestant on The Bachelor Rome , is suing over a catwalk fall from an October 2007 fashion show at the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood .
Welch , who was one of the final two contestants vying for a rose from Charlie O'Connell on season 7 of The Bachelor , claims she suffered “ great injuries to her body , shock and injuries to her nervous system , ” when she fell through a hole in the catwalk .
During an earlier demonstration by Shaolin monks , one of the monks did a front flip and landed a little too hard , creating the hole .
Welch walked onto the catwalk and fell through the hole and into the Mondrian pool below .
“ I had no idea that there was a hole there .
It was almost like falling through ice .
I was trying to get out and I remember there were pieces breaking around me and I could n’t , ” she told Inside Edition in 2007 .
Welch initially took the fall in stride , even joking with KABC - TV , " It is just a really funny mishap .
And I hope they 're enjoying watching it just as much as I am ! "
Welch is suing for negligence and is seeking unspecified damages .
View the Sarah Welch catwalk fall video below .
Early brick sized cellphones spanned the end of the 80s and beginning of the 90s when Nokia was still remembered as the manufacturer of jackboots for the Soviet army .
The distinction between carphones and portable cellular phones was blurred and even today the largest cellphone outlet in the UK is called the Carphone Warehouse .
Here is a nostalgic lineup of videos of some of these with 2 notable inclusions , the Nokia 9000 , which you could use to access a server from more effectively than an iPhone or Blackberry , in the early days of the web and the Iridium , whose demise is one of the few examples of technology regress : there is no longer a truly global cellphone network , but there used to be .

SYRACUSE , NY -- A 15 - year - old Corcoran High School student playing with a . 25 - caliber semi-automatic pistol shot himself in the face early this morning while while his girlfriend sat on his lap , Syracuse police said .
Police originally received a call at 1:15 a.m. for a self - inflicted stab wound to the face of a boy at 369 Midland Ave. , Sgt. Tom Connellan , speaking for city police , said .
The bleeding 15 - year - old , who police are not identifying because of his age , was being taken to an ambulance as police arrived , Connellan said .
The ambulance crew , however , said because of powder burns on the face , the wound appeared to be caused by a gunshot at close range .
The boy 's 16 - year - old girlfriend , however , told police the boy stabbed himself in the face and threw the knife away in the back yard , Connellan said .
She agreed to show police where the knife was tossed and while she was doing so police discovered a handgun , Connellan said .
When the handgun was found , the girlfriend changed her story and told police the boy did shoot himself , Connellan said .
Connellan gave the girl 's account of what happened :
The boy was sitting on a couch at the Midland Avenue address , which is the home of the boy 's cousin , and the girlfriend was sitting on his lap .
The boy pulled out a handgun and began to play with it .
When the girlfriend complained , the boy said that the gun 's safety was on .
The boy twice put the gun to his face twice and pulled the trigger with no result .
The girlfriend pushed the gun away when her boyfriend put it to his face the second time .
Then boy placed the gun to his face a third time , pulled the trigger and the gun fired , the girl told police .
Shaphina Kimbrough , 29 , the boy 's cousin , said she did not know the boy had a gun , Connellan said .
She said she was upset that a gun was brought into her home because she has young children .
She was asleep at the time of the shooting , Connellan said .
The boy was staying at his cousin's home because he was having problems with his mother , Connellan said .
The boy was taken to University Hospital , where he is in serious condition .
Police charged the boy as a juvenile through Family Court with criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment , both felonies .
Appearance tickets for the boy were given to the boy 's mother at the hospital , Connellan said .
The handgun has not been reported stolen and police are n't sure where he got the gun , Connellan said
Bacon Flavored Jelly Beans
So you 've tried the bacon gum balls , and you 've eaten a whopper with 15 portions of bacon on it , what 's next for the bacon addict in you ?
Well , I 'm glad you asked , because through many hours of in depth bacon investigation I 've come across the next revolutionary flavor of jelly beans that transcends bacon into candy rivaling the miracle of birth in beauty .
Bacon jelly beans are all the rage .
I 've tried the Harry Potter jelly beans from Jelly Belly 's but something tells me that a company that puts the effort into their product that they give you a bacon shaped case for them is a cut above the rest .
These bacon jelly beans come in 6 - 1/ 2 " by 1 - 1/2 " by 1 " bacon shaped tin and comes loaded with 60 jelly beans waiting to explode bacon flavor into your mouth .
These candies are a great alternative for people who love bacon but have cholesterol problems ; unfortunately if you are a diabetic with cholesterol problems you are pretty much screwed .
Wanna try them out ?

Don Tapscott is chairman of the think tank nGenera Insight and the author of 13 books on the impact of the Internet on society .
His latest book , Grown Up Digital : How the Net Generation is Changing your World , discusses the Obama campaign and its implications for democracy .
The views expressed are his own .
When President Obama announced last month that he ’ll ask ordinary Americans to help him change America , it did n’t take long for the influencers inside the Washington beltway to ring the alarm :
What happens if ordinary Americans actually come up with some new ideas to run government ?
Will things get out of control ?
Will they become bullies who will force Obama and Congressional lawmakers to bend to their will ?
To me , they sound a lot like the traditional marketers who are worried that they ’re losing control over their brand .
Both marketers and lawmakers are struggling to adjust to a digital world where consumers and voters now have powerful tools to talk back , and even influence the brand or the policy .
So let me give the Washington lawmakers the same message I have delivered to the marketers :
Let go .
You ca n’t control everything .
The genie has slipped out of the bottle and she ’s not coming back .
And I think this is a really good thing .
For far too long , we ’ve been living in what I ’ve called a broadcast democracy .
Voters only count during election time .
They have little or no influence in between elections , when the lawmakers and influencers are in charge and citizenry is inert .
The “ you vote , I rule ” model was all that was possible , until recently .
What the system has lacked until now are mechanisms enabling government to benefit from the wisdom and insight that a nation can collectively offer — on an ongoing basis .
I ’m not proposing some kind of direct democracy , where citizens can vote every night on the evening news or Web sites .
That would be tantamount to a digital mob .
What I am proposing is a way to allow citizens to contribute ideas to the decision - making process – to get them engaged in public life .
When citizens become active , good things can happen .
We all learn from each other .
Initiatives get catalyzed .
People become active in improving their communities , country and the world .
This is long overdue .
These days , the policy specialists and advisers on the public - sector payroll can barely keep pace with defining the problems , let alone craft the solutions .
Government can’t begin to amass the in - house expertise to deal with the myriad challenges that arise .
Governments need to create opportunities for sustained dialogue between voters and the elected .
Courtesy of the Internet , public officials can now solicit citizen input at almost no cost , by providing Web - based background information , online discussion , and feedback mechanisms .
Government can now involve citizens in setting the policy agenda , which can then be refined on an ongoing basis .
Such activity engages and mobilizes citizens , catalyzing real - life initiatives in communities and society as a whole .
When Obama launched Organizing for America , his dialogue with citizens , the idea was to channel the unprecedented grassroots campaign that propelled him to victory into the hard business of changing America .
Organizing for America will “ talk about and work on the pressing issues facing the country , ” said Obama ’s campaign manager David Plouffe .
Obama “ believes in grassroots politics , ” said Organizing for America ’s executive director Mitch Stewart .
“ He ’s going to be your partner .
He ’s going to listen . ”
The first test of the idea came at the weekend , when thousands of meetings of Obama supporters took place across the country .
What ’s not clear yet is how the president intends to use the Internet to tap into the public ’s thinking .
There are lots of Internet - enabled ways to engage America , from policy wikis , citizen juries , deliberative polling , ideation contests , and virtual town halls .
I call one of the most promising the digital brainstorm .
This is an online way to bring together policy officials and citizens in a real - time , moderated session , to exchange ideas and identify new policy issues and strategies and to mobilize the citizenry .
Here ’s how it would work .
The president would say , “ We ’re going to have a national discussion on revitalizing our cities .
It starts on Monday at noon and ends the same week on Friday at noon .
Anyone can participate through the Web 2.0 discussion community we ’ve set up .
If you do n’t have Internet access , I ’ve partnered with corporations , schools , libraries , community computing centers , and shopping malls to give you access .
We ’ll post background papers .
We ’ll organize the discussion by region and also by interest groups .
There ’ll be a business discussion , a discussion of public transit users , and so on .
As you participate in the discussion rate the ideas that you come across and the best ideas will rise to the top .
I ’ll participate daily and give my views .
At the end of the process we ’ll explore our options for further action . ”
The goal is to have a conversation in which people become engaged in political life ; think about issues ; get active in improving their communities ; and mobilize society for positive change .
Politicians and citizens alike would become more informed and learn from each other .
And collectively we would take a step away from broadcast and toward participatory democracy .
As an exercise in government 2.0 , it could show that power can be exercised through people , not over people .
I ’m currently working with government leaders in several countries to conduct brainstorms of all their citizens .
Interestingly , the main topic of choice is climate change , using a question such as “ How could our country more effectively contribute to the fight against global warming ? ” or “ How could we reduce carbon emissions in our country ? ”
If Obama really wants to change America , he should hold digital brainstorms for all Americans , and he should make sure the young people – the Net Geners who have grown up digital – are involved .
He ’ll need a social movement of young people to bring about real change .
This can only happen in public – not through backroom negotiations .
Only through open struggle and conflict can a real and lasting change take place .

A while ago while on vacation I spent a lazy Saturday morning channel - surfing .
One of the things I came across was Pooh ’s Heffalump Movie , and something about it immediately stuck with me : the iconic movement of its characters .
Pooh clumsily waddled , Piglet frantically scurried , Roo playfully hopped , Eeyore paced at a glacial speed , Tigger carelessly bounced on his tail , and Rabbit had a cocksure stride .
Without explicitly stating anything about the characters , these traits imbued them with an instant and very powerful sense of personality .
It ’s something videogames have been known to do as well , but not that frequently .
Of course any character trait can be memorable and evocative as body language is a pretty universal thing .
Generic personality quirks , though , tend to be tricky .
It ’s very easy for quirks to become caricatures , especially if they represent some sort of a cliche , e.g. , the gruff loner who always crosses his arms .
They also cover a large field with plenty of subtleties that are not always feasible to implement .
Then there ’s the issue of plugging them in : do they happen automatically , or are they random , or only initiated by the player ?
There ’s validity to all these approaches , but movement is unique because it ’s pretty much a guarantee .
Your characters will move , so why not use that ?
It worked wonders for Sly Cooper and his fast and soft gait , and for Altair with his weighty , coiled - spring like movements .
And hey , sometimes even cliches are preferable to no personality at all …
Supplemental :
A new post on Gamasutra has popped up that deals with body language a bit more in - depth , so I figured I ’d add a link to it .
ISTANBUL 
A prominent Kurdish lawmaker gave a speech in his native Kurdish in Turkey ’s Parliament on Tuesday , breaking taboos and also the law in Turkey , a country that has long repressed its Kurdish minority for fear it would try to secede .
Turkey ’s state television cut off the live broadcast of the official , Ahmet Turk , as he spoke to members of his political party , the Democratic Society Party , known by its Turkish initials , D.T.P .
It was the second time in recent history that a speech was delivered in Kurdish in Parliament .
In 1991 , Leyla Zana spoke in Kurdish , her native language , when she was sworn in as a deputy .
She had immunity as a lawmaker , but it was later stripped and she served 10 years in prison on other charges .
Turkey has a troubled past with its Kurds , who make up at least a fifth of its population .
The Turkish military fought a war with a Kurdish militant group , the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party , or P.K.K. , in the predominantly Kurdish southeast in the 1980s and 1990s .
The area was subsequently governed by martial law , and speaking Kurdish was prohibited .

Iggy Pop swings - and misses - in the Swiftcover advert
By Stephen Dowling
BBC News Magazine
Iggy Pop 's endorsement of car insurance has prompted accusations of selling out .
But does anyone really care any more ?
As the flailing , wild - eyed frontman of US garage - rock band The Stooges , Iggy Pop helped pioneer punk long before the Sex Pistols .
His solo career is approaching its fifth decade .
Live , he 's earned a reputation as one of rock 's most exciting performers , with a frame that 's not so much athletic as freakish .
So why is one of rock 's most iconic rebels now selling car insurance on TV ?
Will we ever be able to listen to his music in the same way again ?
Or are we now inured to the fact that at some point our cultural heroes are going to turn round and exhort us to buy , buy , buy ?
As the new face of insurers Swiftcover , Pop writhes and gyrates like a toddler after too much red cordial , declaring that what he 's really selling is n't car insurance but " time " , a confusion that will no doubt be cleared up when he cashes the cheque .
Some of Pop 's more faithful fans have not taken well to this .
An army of possibly now ex-supporters have vented their spleen on music message boards and blogs .
Posters featuring his ads have been defaced with the words " sell - out " , the ultimate insult .
Compromising integrity " Selling out " is a phrase that has come to haunt many a politician , public figure or entertainer .
It 's the perfect description to tar those seen to compromise their integrity in favour of money , power or mainstream acceptance .
John Lydon , the occasional frontman of punk pioneers The Sex Pistols , caused many an old punk to splutter at the television when he appeared plugging Country Life butter last year .
Comedian Denis Leary - who had become a cult star in the US with a rant - driven stream of black comedy - annoyed some of his fans with his endorsement of Holsten Pils lager .
And Sting has still not recovered from agreeing to front a smug promo for Jaguar .
But is this just a generational thing ?
Would fans of Pete Doherty take such exception seeing him selling cough medicine or train tickets ?
If Amy Winehouse was unveiled as the new face of a coffee brand , would the sales of her next album plummet ?
Bill Hicks : " If you do an advert then you are off the artistic register forever " Acerbic American comedian Bill Hicks summed up a hardcore view that chimed with an anti-consumerist niche in the 80s : " If you do an advert then you are off the artistic register forever . "
Hicks died of cancer , aged 32 , before even having the chance to tarnish this zero - tolerance stance by endorsing financial services , but that philosophy has n't died with him .
In the entertainment world , " sell - out " has also crystallised around an independent , anti-major label stance of bands born out of the punk and new wave scene of the late 1970s .
In the 1980s , amid the culture of conspicuous consumption , indie musicians regarded any overt attempts to be successful as compromising rigid ideals about artistic integrity .
These included avoiding being signed to a mainstream label and refusing to take part in activities seen as crass and overly commercial , like making expensive videos .
What makes us accuse our heroes of selling out ?
Why do we feel they have abused our support ?
For writer Zoe Williams , the Iggy Pop ads are not a concern because , crucially , she is not a fan - his insurance endorsement is n't interfering with any memories she has of buying Raw Power or going to see him in concert .
This is part of the mix - we have to some kind of relationship with the artist in question in order to be disappointed or betrayed .
But , she says : " If Morrissey was on an ad , that would appal me .
It 's not that he's as pure as the driven snow , but there 's a kind of integrity .
He 's a commercial refusenik . "
And , crucially , she 's a fan .
REBEL SELL John Lydon Country Life ( pictured ) Denis Leary Holsten Pils Lou Reed Honda scooters Black - Eyed Peas Pepsi Mitchell & Webb Apple Mac Journalist and author Andrew Mueller says we bring our own personal feelings to the art we love , and react badly to it being treated lightly .
" I think consumers object to their favourite songs being used in ads less out of any sense that the artistic integrity of the work is being tarnished , more out of a sense of ownership .
" We love songs because they remind us of someone / something , and it 's annoying when we find ourselves having no choice but to associate them with bathroom freshener . "
Those accused of " selling out " are sometimes also called " whores " .
Williams says : " Calling someone a prostitute is incredibly offensive because we feel sex is sacred .
I think art is similar . "
Williams was unhappy at the Mac and PC ads in 2007 starring Peep Show comedians David Mitchell and Robert Webb - arguing that comedians earn our trust with their routines and humour .
" Comedy is intimate ; it turns on qualities we share , not those we can only admire , " she wrote then .
To Williams , Webb and Mitchell have sold out because she identifies almost too readily with them .
" It 's a bunch of middle - class people with exactly my education and opportunities .
And they probably did n't get paid that much for it . "
This is art that has always been mixed with commerce
Michael Berube American academic Michael Berube tackled the subject in an essay called Cultural Criticism and the Politics of Selling Out .
He came to the subject with something more than just an academic interest - in the 80s he was a fan of hardcore US bands such as Husker Du , who were accused of selling out when they signed to a mid-size record label .
Many of their fans refused to listen to subsequent records .
With music , he says , " this is art that has always been mixed with commerce " .
But like many counter - cultures , the music scene that created artists like Pop began with an uncommercial edge that only gradually filtered into the mainstream .
" They had no idea this was ever going to be incredibly successful . "
Mr Berube may live in Pennsylvania but thanks to the internet he has seen the ads , and says they cause a serious " ick reaction " .
Would you buy car insurance from this man ?
The ads , Mr Berube says , feature cognitive dissonance - where something attempts to balance contradictory ideas .
" Here 's Iggy Pop , shirtless , haggard , and he 's concerned about putting his papers down too . "
He adds : " The line about ' selling time ' - it 's a guilty conscience .
And at the end he yells ' Get a life ' with the anarchist symbol .
Anyone who knows that symbol sees how jarring that is . "
He laughs .
" If I ran into Iggy Pop at an intersection , I would hope he had car insurance , though . "
Modern audiences may immune to the shock though .
" I wonder if people now do n't just expect it to be business as usual , " Mr Berube suggests .
Marketing analyst Craig Smith agrees .
" There are so many more commercial aspects to what any given celebrity does these days .
They 're promoted and marketed and advertised to an inch of their lives .
I do n't think people now are surprised to see their heroes appear in an ad . "
Artists develop , mature , their edges get softened , and they wake up one day fretting that they have n't saved enough for their retirement .
All the while , their fans often hang on to an idealistic memory .
But if an ad agency suddenly wants to attach their one - time rebel yell to car insurance , or holidays to Australia , should we judge them ?
As the recession bites and sales of music plummet , Pop 's decision may not look so out of place .
And the term sell out may lose some of its sting .

The mistake people are making is to think that these people are artists who had any integrity in the first place .
The popular music industry is what it says : an industry .
They are all only interested in money and popular music fans are their suckers .
Face the facts !
Kant for King , London I could n't care less whether it is considered a sell - out or not I find this particular advert just another example of a wide range of deeply irritating and / or inane examples currently being foisted onto our TV screeens .
They have been totally effective in only one way - putting me off even considering using or buying the product ( s ) concerned .
Iain , Leighton Buzzard I 'm sure Iggy Pop would advertise dustbin liners if the money was right .
Though i wish he'd keep his shirt on .
Watching his body and muscles contort the way they do on the telly is slightly off putting though !
Michael , Leamington Spa
This is compounded by the amount of times the advert is shown .
If you watch an evening of television on Sky , you 'll see Mr Pop at the start and end of every advert break .
I defy even an avid fan to appreciate the icon after such bombardment .
Oh , and of course I will never use the car insurance site because of their advert .
alex@centurymedia.co.uk , Exeter I 'm not so much worried about Iggy ' selling out ' as the awful advert he chose to do it in .
At least when Dylan was in a Victoria 's Secret ad it was nicely done ( and and attractive girls in ) .
I thought Iggy would have more taste !
Matt , Nottingham I am a member of some market research panels .
Months ago I received an invitation to a survey about advertising .
It was about the Iggy Pop ad .
I was so shocked to see him prancing around selling insurance that I completed that survey in a daze .
I clearly remember , though , my last reply in the " any further comments " box .
I said I was shocked and appalled at seeing Iggy Pop stooping so low as to sell out .
I still can't believe it , and I 'm not even a big fan !
EV , London , N4 Bill Hicks was right .
It 's OK if you 're a struggling actor but someone like Iggy Pop really does n't need the money .
Adverts like this only put me off products and artists .
Duncan Graham , Newcastle upon Tyne Who would n't want to earn a few extra hundred thousand for a few hours ' work ?
True fans should n't care - his music is still the same as it ever was .
If other ' fans ' are so put out then listen to some other musician who has n't chosen commercial success over musical passion ... if you can find one .
Bob , Oxford , UK Rather than criticise Iggy for " selling out " , perhaps we should respect him for taking 40 years longer than most other people .
Mark , Gloucester , UK Yes and No . Yes - he could 've chosen a more ethical product .
No - it 's not as heart breaking as seeing the wonderful Tommy Stinson playing Bass for Guns and Roses .
James , London , England I listen to The Stooges to escape from the tedious realities of buying car insurance and The Sex Pistols to escape from the depressing banality of toast .
Now , however , my escape is tainted by leakage from the real world .
Ben Hoyle , Wood Green
When it comes to people of stature like Iggy and Lydon they owe no - one an explanation .
They 've got the scars for their art - why not make some money ?
del , glasgow
He can sell whatever he likes as far as i'm concerned however could he please do it with a shirt on .
His advert gets switched off so there is no chance we would buy the car insurance .
If you need to use a semi - naked man can't it be one that does n't need ironing and no i'm not a 20 something i'm in my 40's .
Mrs G , Grays Essex England Lydon sold out years ago .
It is upsetting that he 's completely undermined the messages in his early recordings and has no doubt become what he set out to destroy .
I guess we all become middle aged and forget what we belieived in when we were teenagers .
I very much doubt that either Iggy or Lydon need the money as both the Pistols and the Stooges have been filling concert halls for the last few years on their nostalgia tours .
I splashed out to see both in London in the last couple of years and Iggy was miles better than his overweight cousins from London .
Those punk rock ' stars ' who have n't sold out probably do n't have sprawling 10 acre mansions in Los Angeles .
Good on them .
Mark Tombs , Bristol Also currently guilty are Ringo Star , Alice Cooper , Bruce Willis and others in those insuferable Norwich Union re-branding adverts .
Kerching !
Philip Jones , London
Yeah , it was a bit disconcerting at first to Iggy Pop advertising car insurance , but come on people - the guy is getting on at bit now and needs some financial security for his retirement - I certainly do n't hold that against him .
I might have taken a dimmer view if he had done this when he was younger however .
Jon Alsbury , London , UK Let 's ask Bob Dylan about his Victoria 's Secret advert ...
Candace , New Jersey , US
We hate it when our friends become successful .
As long as the person in question has n't previously been anti-corporate or is known for bashing those who do advertising , then it 's a person making a living .
Stop listening to their records if you please , but you have already brought them so the money is in their pockets and you are just depriving yourself .
Jim Emery , London
No one cares when commercial or " Professional " celebrities do this , we expect it .
If one of the girls from girls aloud appears in an advert for anything , no one would blink an eye .
Its when counter - culture personalities abandon the coutner culture and use their fame to hawk mainstream products that we disconnect .
Even then , it can be done ironically and reasonably without effect .
Anyone remember Lemmy from Motorhead playing a violin in an advert , or Alice Cooper having a cosy evening in with Ronnie Corbet ?
These two worked because they exploit the counter - culture nature of the stars to comic effect .
If an advert was just lemmy flogging home loans by trying to convince us it is METAL !
then we be sickened .
Iggy Pop has absolutely no connection to car insurance .
The only reason he is in the advert is because of his fame .
Thats what we object to .

The first trailer for Alan Moore ’s Tales of the Black Freighter ( the spinoff DVD featuring a subplot from the author ’s Watchmen ) reveals imagery and tone ripped straight from the original graphic novel .
Premiered at MTV.com ( above ) , the gothic horror tale describes one man ’s ill - fated battle of wits with a cursed ship crewed by deadly ( not to mention dead ) pirates .
The rapid - fire montage should give fans no reason to worry that someone tampered with the animated Black Freighter during the production process .
Set for a March 24 release , the Black Freighter DVD includes a re-creation of Watchmen ‘s " Under the Hood , " a fictional , autobiographical film about the story ’s original Night Owl , Hollis Mason .

Mayor Richard Daley said today Chicago has compiled a wish list of " shovel - ready projects " to spend federal economic stimulus funds on should Congress approve a plan .
Unlike hundreds of other cities , however , Daley said Chicago wo n't make its list public .
" Yes , we do , we have our list , we 've been talking to people .
We did not put that out publicly because once you start putting it out publicly , you know , the newspapers , the media is going to be ripping it apart , " Daley said .
" It 's very controversial .
Yes , we have ready projects from the Board of Education to the City Colleges to the Park District to the CTA and the city of Chicago .
Oh yes .
Us and New York decided not to do that .
We thought we could go directly into the federal bureaucracies and the different departments , " the mayor added .
Later , Daley was asked why he was n't being more transparent .
" Read some of your newspapers .
Heh heh , " he replied .
Whether you ’ve got a big back yard , some room on a windowsill or patio , or no inclination towards gardening at all , it ’s easy to get in on the Springtime bounty !
[ Creative Commons photo by Carl Tashian ]
Spring is getting close !
The bulbs from last year are peeking out of the ground , and I ’ve even spied a few things starting to bloom out back !
This week ’s Vegetable Husband newsletter mentioned that farms nearby are starting to plant for Spring , and it reminded me that it ’s time to get my own Spring garden going , too !
Here are some great resources to get you started .
What to Plant
Fruits and veggies that thrive each season varies some by zone .
There are bunches of delicious Springtime edibles you might want to try out .
If you have a yard , give these a try :
spinach
radishes
fava beans
peas
broccoli
Looking to start a container garden ?
These veggies and herbs do n’t need quite so much space to thrive , which means you can plant them in the ground or in pots :
scallions
peppers
salad greens
fresh herbs
Just take a peek at the seed packets to make sure you choose pots that give the plants ’ roots space to grow !
How Does Your Garden Grow ?
Now that you know what you want to harvest , it ’s time to get planting !
Your first impulse will probably be to head to the nearest garden center for pots , organic topsoil , and fertilizer .
Try checking your local thrift and salvage stores for second hand pots , if you ’re going the container garden route , rather than purchasing ones made from new materials .
Instead of paying for expensive organic fertilizers and top soil , you might consider feeding your garden with some nourishing , home grown compost !
If you ’ve got kids , try getting them involved !
What a great chance to spend some quality , outdoor time with those kiddos .
You want to be sure all those veggies get enough water , too .
Consider getting your own rain barrel irrigation system going .
It ’s easier than you think !
For you apartment - dwellers and other folks without yards , you can collect water from the tap that would have just gone down the drain while your shower heated up to keep your thirsty plants happy .
What if I Have a Black Thumb ?
Even if you ’re not into gardening , do n’t worry !
You can still get in on the Spring bounty without planting a single seed .
Local Harvest has a comprehensive list of everything from farms to CSAs and farmers markets .
Their site has a handy tool where you can search by zip code for all of your local produce needs !
The fundamental problem facing oil markets at present it this : while present supplies are sufficient to meet present weak demand , these sources of production face rapid decline .
The current low oil prices are not sufficient to support the long term investment in future supplies , conservation , and consumption efficiency that will be necessary to mitigate the impact of this decline .
Because of the time - lag between a sufficient price signal and oil reaching the market ( or demand being reduced ) , and because of the impact of the recent price collapse on producer psychology , volatility will rapidly incrase as the market 's price signal must make increasingly exaggerated moves to bring supply and demand into equillibrium .
I previously examined the interface between peaking oil supplies and oil price volatility as a predator - prey system .
With the rapid drop in oil prices , it ’s time to add another wrinkle to that story : widespread acceptance ( psychosis ? ) about the stability of high oil prices acted as a damper on oil price volatility .
Now that a collapse in oil prices is more than a mere theory , oil markets are poised for a long - term increase in price volatility .
Without ongoing investment to support present production levels , production decline rates will accelerate
There are two key issues here :
1 ) The market ’s price signals react over much shorter time - spans than new supplies or investments in conservation or efficiency can be brought to market .
Depending on the specifics , it can take anywhere from 2 to 10 + years to bring a new oil - field into full production .
Therefore , even when oil was at $ 147 / barrel , oil producers could n’t immediately realize profits from oil that would only cost $ 100 / barrel to produce .
The same is true with many efficiency and conservation measures — while the most elastic demand ( e.g. Summer driving vacations ) can be reduced rapidly , other conservation and efficiency efforts take much longer .
Electrified rail takes years to fund and build out , and the gradual upgrade of the fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet ( or the replacement with electric vehicles ) requires years of consistently high fuel prices or efficiency regulations that generally do n’t take effect until several years in the future .
2 ) Our recent market experience — a rapid crash in prices — undermines efforts at long - term investments in supplies .
At $ 150 / barrel , oil companies were willing to invest billions in new projects that , several years in the future , would bring production on line at a cost of $ 50 , $ 60 , or even $ 80 / barrel .
Because of the time - value of money , and because our energy futures markets are incapable of economically hedging entire oil megaprojects a decade or more into the future , oil companies needed to leave a large price cushion .
$ 150 / barrel oil did not justify a ten - year lead time to produce oil that would cost $ 140 / barrel , even under the assumption that oil would remain at $ 150 / barrel .
This cushion shrank some during the ( relatively ) steady increase in oil prices from 2001 – 2008 , and oil companies ’ willingness and ability to finance these projects increased .
But now that the price of oil has crashed from $ 150 to $ 40 / barrel , the prospect of a sudden drop in price is more than a mere possibility .
The result of this will be long - lasting : if oil prices again reach $ 150 / barrel , there will be much greater reluctance to invest in long - range projects to produce oil at even $ 50 or $ 60 / barrel .
Similarly , the cost and availability of financing such projects has been dramatically reduced by the credit crunch .
The result is that the more aggressive producers — those with the least cash and greatest incentive to take risks — are the least able to finance such projects .
Those with the greatest ability to undertake such projects — select oil majors and many national oil companies — are also the most conservative and least willing to risk embarking on long - term , expensive production projects .
Continually Increasing Price Volatility
The principle results of this time - lag and shift in producer - psychology is that price signals must become increasingly over - exaggerated to create the desired market effect .
The level of interest and willingness to invest in oil production that was spurred by 2008 ’s $ 100 + oil prices will not be regained if oil again hits $ 100 or $ 150 — it may be necessary for oil prices to hit $ 200 , $ 250 , or more to provide an adequate incentive for oil companies to invest in oil with a $ 50 + cost per barrel .
And , even when the price level necessary to spur sufficient investment is reached , the resulting production will not come on line immediately .
Instead , it will take several more years to reach the market .
During this time - lag period between sufficient price signal and new oil reaching the market ( or new demand being destroyed ) , prices will continue to move and push this market signal .
If oil at $ 100 / barrel is sufficient to incentivise investment in oil production to meet then - current demand , the market will continue to push the price signal past $ 100 / barrel , especially as geological depletion continues to grind and the incentives for geopolitical disruption continue to rise .
As a result of the price rise during this time - lag , more production investment decisions will be made , and more demand will be destroyed , than was actually necessary to reach an equilibrium point .
The result will be an inevitable overcorrection and price crash , restarting the price cycle .
With each successive boom and crash cycle , the market psychology will become increasingly resistant to a given move in the price - signal , and the degree to which the price signal must move to create an equivalent market effect will increase .
This will result in continually increasing price volatility as the market swings wildly to reconcile the ever moving targets with production and demand .
A Flubber Cobweb
The time - lag between market and fundamentals is exacerbated by inadequate futures markets and our own psychology .
On a general level , this is a common process in economics , described by the cobweb model :
This model shows a supply / demand spiral characteristic of a market searching for equilibrium in a steady - state environment — it is NOT characteristic of oil prices in a post - peak environment .
Rather , once oil production has peaked , the spiral will work in the opposite direction with increasingly divergent P and Q brackets .
Under peak oil theory , Q must gerally decline , even if there is significant noise present .
From a civilizational - perspective , I think there will be a great deal of information carried by what happens to P as Q approaches zero :
If P1 and P3 diverge or generally trend higher as Q approaches zero , this may show a sign of fundamental economic strength in the face of peak oil — perhaps indicating that the realized EROEI of alternative energy supplies is sufficient to maintain a global - industrial economy .
However , if P1 and P3 converge or generally trend lower as Q approaches zero , then I see this as the dimming of global - industrial system .
One important note : I do n’t think that these values carry meaning when measured simply in absolute dollar values — inflation , deflation , and other currency games introduce too much distortion .
Rather , I think a measure of the dollar price of oil as a percentage of median national and global incomes ( in dollars ) will carry much more meaning when measuring the divergence or convergence of P1 and P3 going forward .
Add in declining supply due to geological and geopolitical peak oil and increasing global population and oil price volatility will rapidly accelerate over the next decade .
Discussion Questions :
1 . How will this system interact with the global economy ( itself a key driver of demand and cyclic in nature ) ?
2 . Will oil price volatility be primarily characterized by increasing spread between price highs and lows , by a shortening of the period between highs and lows , or by some combination of the two ?
3 . This article suggests that oil price volatility will continually increase .
At the same time , I generally criticize other theories that argue for perpetual increase ( in population , GDP , resource consumption , etc. ) .
Clearly , at some point volatility must either ( 1 ) slow or decrease , or ( 2 ) reach a functional maximum at which point market signals are reduced to meaningless “ trading noise ” and the market function ceases to provide utility .
Which result , and why ?
In the spirit of Kurzweil ( link ) or Moore ’s Law ( link ) , does this process lead inevitably to the end of markets ?
Half in jest , what if the causal mechanism of the Maya 2012 hypothesis ( or insert your favorite apocalypse meme here ) is simply global markets grinding to a halt as prices cease to carry meaning and we can’t find a way to reverse the complexification that caused this ?
** In light of these three concluding questions , I hope that it is clear that I am not intending to argue some fundamental “ truth ” with regard to ever - increasing price volatility , but rather that I ’m using that argument to set up the three concluding questions ( which I consider much more interesting and important in the long - run ) .
Hearing that news was like getting socked in the stomach — my father had never mentioned wanting to end his life !
I panicked .
I knew I had to do something , but I had no idea what .
So I called a suicide hotline .
But they 're primarily for people who are contemplating taking their own lives .
The operator suggested trying to get my father into therapy .
Right away my mother started looking for therapists for Dad , but he was n't interested .
He told her he was fine .
And we wanted to believe him .
We thought , Maybe he lost control , but he 's fine now …right ?
Neither my mom nor I knew that we could have called the police that night and said Dad was trying to hurt himself , and that they would have escorted him to the emergency room for an evaluation .
I did n't even know that there are suicide prevention groups that exist for the loved ones of people at risk .
Still , over the next few months , my mother and I were in frequent contact about my father 's mental state .
During one conversation my dad came home , pulled the phone away from my mom and yelled , " Michelle , mind your own damn business . "
He sounded possessed .
I yelled back , " I 'm not giving up on you ! "
Then he hung up .
Later that week , on my birthday , September 24 , he called me back .
I had sent him a supportive e-mail the day after our fight , but I was still upset .
I asked , " Are you going to apologize for hanging up on me ? "
He shouted , " No ! " We hung up at the same time .
That was the last time I ever spoke to him .
I was relieved to hear , days later , that my dad had finally agreed to go into therapy .
But on September 29 , 2003 , I received an instant message from my brother , Adam .
He wrote , " Dad seems upset ; he 's pacing back and forth in the living room . "
I replied , " Where 's Mom ? " and Adam said she 'd gone to get Jaclyn , our youngest sister , at soccer practice .
Moments later Adam wrote , " Dad just left the house .
I do n't know what to do . "
I tried to be strong for him , writing back , " Everything is going to be OK . "
But I felt like I was standing at the top of a cliff , just waiting to fall .
Hours later my mom , sounding at her wit 's end , called to say Dad still had n't returned home .
At that moment , I knew he was dead .
The feeling was certain — so certain that I hung up , ordered flowers for my mom and booked a ticket home .
I know it sounds strange , but that evening I stopped being a bewildered daughter and began to see Dad as a person in such terrible pain that he needed relief , whatever the cost .
The next morning the phone rang at 7 A.M.
It was my mother .
Gasping between sobs , she said the police had found my dad 's body in his Suburban near the electrical company where he worked .
He 'd died from carbon monoxide poisoning .
Even though I expected the call , my mother 's words took my breath away .
I sat down and cried hysterically for 10 minutes .
Then I pulled myself together , grabbed my bag and headed for the airport .
As I flew from New York to Michigan , I remember looking out the window at the clouds .
It was a sunny , beautiful day , and I thought , I hope you 've found peace , Dad .
It would be a long time before I 'd find peace of my own .
Later that week my sister Wendy and I went to the police station to collect items from Dad 's car .
An officer gave us a bag filled with magazine clippings of me modeling that my father had kept in his work locker .
He 'd still been proud of me ; that made my heart swell .
Then the officer handed us an envelope Dad had left in his truck .
Inside were letters for all my siblings and my mom .
There was also a general letter to my cousins , aunts and uncles .
I frantically searched the envelope again .
There was nothing inside for me .

A great deal of putative middle - class wealth has evaporated in the current financial crisis .
Unless you cashed out and put the money in precious metals or in the mattress before the current financial crisis began , it is gone forever .
As for what remains , we are in the process of being further subordinated to huge commercial interests , and are already locked in to a severely declining standard of living .
It is increasingly unlikely that we are going to have a comfortable retirement with relative economic peace of mind .
It is increasingly likely that many of us will be wards of the state , dependent upon social security and Medicare .
Such as they will be , in a decade or so .
In this article I want to explain , with reference to a few simple economic factors , how this happened and why our remaining wealth is neither going to be restored nor grow — unless and until certain fundamental changes are made .
Specifically , we need to eliminate the Federal Reserve System .
This is one of those topics that gets you quickly dismissed in American politics as a complete nutburger , but it is my hope that I can explain this with reference to such familiar experience that it will become apparent why the Federal Reserve System is a key factor in our current predicament .
Middle - class wealth resides predominantly in college and retirement savings .
( I exclude homes because homes are a consumable good , not an investment ) .
These savings are incentivized through tax exemptions but at the price of restrictions on use and penalties on early withdrawal .
As a means of increasing future wealth , this program of " saving for our future " has now been proven to be largely ineffective , if not completely illusory .
Pre -crash investment wealth is not coming back , and any increase in nominal value will reflect inflation ( i.e. , a decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar ) rather than a real increase in value .
The government ’s polices guarantee that we will have no real investment growth for a very long time .
This will not change unless and until the Federal Reserve is eliminated .
You have noticed that , for a long time now , at least since the Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s , banks do not pay any real interest on your money , that the rates they offer rarely even approximate the annual CPI rate , let alone the real rate of inflation .
Dollars left sitting in a savings account or even in a timed deposit like a certificate of deposit , are actually just losing value .
This is because ( i ) by law , only U.S. dollars are legal tender within the United States , so that all other currencies are excluded , and ( ii ) the supply and cost of credit is controlled by the Federal Reserve .
The first factor is relevant because the Federal Reserve ’s power depends almost entirely on the fact that it is a private cartel that controls a legal monopoly over money .
Were all currencies , or even some moderate number of currencies of other nations or financial institutions acceptable as legal tender , the Reserve would face competition that would compel it to act more responsibly .
If every person could designate the form of legal tender in which he was to be paid , currencies that better preserved value would be favored over currencies that did not .
For example , a short time ago , when the dollar was quickly depreciating against the euro , there was a news story that merchants in New York City were putting signs in their windows for the European tourists flocking to the city because of the favorable exchange rates : " Euros accepted here . "
By accepting euros , the merchants were acquiring a currency that , relative to the dollar at that time , actually enhanced and preserved their purchasing power .
If every employee , every person could , day to day , state that he was accepting payment only in euros , or yen , or Swiss francs , or ( oh no ! ) gold and silver , the continual risk of flight from the dollar would impose discipline on the Reserve or , in the absence of the Reserve ( which in truth would then have little reason for existing since it could not reap the benefits of a legal monopoly ) , the Congress .
The Reserve has two powers pertinent here .
It can create credit by fiat ( more colloquially , " print money " ) , and it can set the rate at which it will extend this credit to other banks for use by those banks .
Essentially , banks are not willing to pay you anything , or much , for the use of your money because the banks can get boatloads from the Reserve and can get it dirt - cheap .
Right now , the federal funds rate is 0.25 % .
The Reserve is essentially giving it away for almost nothing .
Even a year ago , the rate was only 3.5 % .
The ability of banks to obtain cheap , seemingly unlimited credit from the Reserve devalues your money and , here ’s the key , actually prevents your money from participating in the making of money .
It prevents you from benefiting from being a capitalist with your own funds , however limited they may be .
You cannot grow your own wealth by making it available to productive enterprises .
The Reserve shunts you out of growth of your money through savings and investment because it can always provide vast sums of money more cheaply than investors .
The Reserve ’s control of this legal monopoly over legal tender and credit relegates you , permanently , to the status of a consumer .
By providing no financial incentive to save , and by actually penalizing saving through deflation in value of the dollar , the Reserve creates an incentive to spend all available funds as received .
This benefits commercial interests that cater to consumption , and the financial institutions that provide credit for that consumption , creating additional profits for those companies that would otherwise be lost if a portion of your discretionary income were saved and invested in production rather than spent on consumption or debt service for past consumption .
Okay , forget about saving .
What about the stock market ?
We do n’t have to save , we can " invest " our funds in stocks , and our " investment " can grow over time .
Right ?
That ’s why we ’ve all been diligently funding our IRAs and 401ks .
Thanks to the latest financial crisis , we now know the answer : No .
It ’s the same as with saving , because the Reserve ’s unlimited supply of cheap credit also makes stock irrelevant .
While this has long been the actual predictable result of the Reserve ’s operations , it is now apparent from the news on the nation ’s business pages .
From the time of the dot - com bust in the 1990s until the recent financial crisis , stocks were essentially going nowhere , simply oscillating within a range , and they have now lost substantial value .
In 2008 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.8 % ; the Standard and Poor ’s 500 Index fell 38.6 % ; and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 40.5 % .
The reality is that companies almost never issue public stock to raise capital for their businesses .
There are two powerful reasons for this .
First , companies can get credit from banks via the Reserve cheaper , easier and with lower transaction costs than they can get it from investors .
The Reserve undercuts investors in favor of financial institutions .
Secondly , the payment of interest on debt is a deductible expense for income tax purposes , while dividends ( payments on capital ) are not , so that the after - tax cost of debt is even less than nominal interest rate charged .
The tax advantage alone is a nearly insuperable incentive to fund business expansion with debt instead of equity .
The U.S. corporate income tax rate is a minimum of 34 % for taxable income in excess of $ 100,000 .
At this rate , the after - tax cost of paying a 10 % return on $ 10 million in capital is $ 1,515,152 ( $ 1,000,000 /.66 ) , and of paying a 10 % return on a $ 10 million debt is $ 660,000 ( $ 1 million — $ 340,000 tax benefit ) .
Combine the tax incentive for debt financing with cheap credit from the Reserve , and the economic system is overwhelmingly skewed in favor of minimizing capital investment and maximizing debt financing .
Note that the effect of these systems is to shunt profits away from investors in productive enterprises to the payment by productive enterprises of interest to financial institutions which , nota bene , themselves require little capital because of the nation ’s banking laws and Reserve ’s unlimited cheap credit .
This system is a bankers ’ dream come true because it maximizes the borrowing of money .
Unfortunately , the moral hazards of ( i ) such a near complete supplanting of capital and , ( ii ) ( thanks to the Reserve ’s legal monopoly ) interest rates untested by competitive market pressures and hence dissociated from reality , virtually guarantee an ultimate crash .
It is hard to imagine a system with a greater built - in predilection for boom and bust .
Please note one other effect of this system that ought to concern everyone besides lenders .
Dividends do not have to be paid when money is not available , and investors in common stock are not secured creditors .
Interest , on the other hand , does have to be paid , and banks have security interests on assets , and will foreclose if not paid .
Accordingly , a company that raises capital to finance its expansion and activities is better able to weather financial vicissitudes than one that has financed itself with debt .
Since debt must be paid , the effect is that , in a downturn , the company , to survive , must act quickly to reduce its labor costs .
As between the two forms of financing , debt financing guarantees that a company will seek to minimize its business losses by firing workers .
In other words , debt financing essentially guarantees that there will be greater and more rapid job losses in an economic downturn .
The moral of the story ?
If we get rid of the Reserve , we get rid of an institution with the power to undercut all investors and to provide cheap credit divorced from economic reality , and if we also get rid of the tax bias in favor of debt financing , then companies will have a more rational balance of capital and debt , investors may again be able to make money on their money , and companies will have a greater ability to hang on to workers , who they will need when business picks up again .
Back to those 401 k’s .
Since , thanks to the Reserve ’s low interest rates and our tax policy , companies essentially no longer raise money by selling stock publicly , there is a relatively fixed pool of public securities in which all persons seeking to invest may invest .
The investment demand far exceeds the supply .
As a result , stocks become " overvalued . "
That is , the price per share becomes primarily a function of the large demand , and the huge amount of capital seeking to invest in the same relatively fixed group of assets , rather than a rational reflection of the income stream from the shares or even their companies ’ liquidation values .
Before the current financial crisis , shares traded at multiples of earnings unheard of even two decades before .
In other words , courtesy of the Reserve and tax policy , ( i ) stocks are not a real economic growth opportunity , but are , instead , ( ii ) a demand bubble that will eventually burst , at a sizable loss disproportionate to the actual decline in the company ’s revenues or decline in liquidation value .
It should be apparent from the foregoing that the Reserve ’s current policy of reducing the federal funds rate to practically zero and the government ’s bailout of banks and other financial institutions by providing capital to offset their losses is an attempt to protect the preferred position of the banks .
It should be equally apparent that this policy will only deepen and prolong the crisis , by further shunting any and all other capital , including the savings of the middle class , from participation in economic growth and development .
The purported goal of shoring up the banks is to once again get credit flowing ( i.e. , generating continued profit opportunities for banks through even more borrowing ) , which supposedly thereby indirectly benefits the rest of us through business expansion and renewed personal consumption .
This is a trillion dollar trickle down theory to end all trickle down theories !
" Reaganomics " never dared to dream on this scale !
So long as the Reserve is running the show , your money will have no place to participate in and profit from the economic growth of this country .
Your place will be to spend your money to make profits for others , particularly banks .
There is simply no reason we should stand for this or play along .
We need an end to the Reserve as well as changes in tax policy to eliminate the economic disadvantage imposed upon capital relative to debt .
As I hope I have made clear , bringing back capital ( and eliminating debt ) permits everyone ’s savings to participate in real economic growth , instead of in illusory demand bubbles , enables businesses to better weather economic downturns and protects more jobs .
These elementary facts are ignored because our country ’s policy is to protect and benefit banks , through policies that maximize debt financing using monopoly money .
Hey Congress !
How about the rest of us ?
Remember us , the people you supposedly serve ?
Bring back capital !

Online games ' emphasis on combat has led many to paint them as male pursuits
Picture a typical player of a massively multiplayer game such as World of Warcraft and most people will imagine an overweight , solitary male .
But this stereotype has been challenged by a study investigating gender differences among gamers .
It found that the most hard - core players are female , that gamers are healthier than average , and that game playing is an increasingly social activity .
Despite gaming being seen as a male activity , female players now make up about 40 % of the gaming population .
The study looked at gender differences in more than 2,400 gamers playing EverQuest II .
What we think might be at play is that it's not that games are good for you , it 's that TV is bad for you
Dmitri Williams
The participants , who were recruited directly out of the game , completed a web - based questionnaire about their gaming habits and lifestyles .
They received an in - game item as a reward for taking part - a condition which has led to some questioning of the results .
In addition Sony Online Entertainment , Everquest 's creator , gave the US researchers access to information about the players ' in - game behaviours .
Gender bias
The results showed that , although more of the players were male , it was the female players who were the most dedicated players , spending more time each day playing the game than their male counterparts .
Lead researcher Scott Caplan of the University of Delaware said the result demonstrated how out - of - date stereotypes can be .
" In many cases , stereotypes reflect what I would call a ' cultural time lag ' , " he said .
" What we think about men and women and videogames may have been true 10 or 15 years ago , when there were mainly console video games or single - player games .
Attitudes to games may date from the early years of consoles , say researchers " But what were seeing now is that games become social , and as these online games become communities then the attraction for that kind of behaviour might increase for women , " said Prof Caplan .
" I think a lot of our stereotypes are based on the way computer games have been , rather than where they 're going . "
The pressure to conform to traditional gender roles might mean that some women are put off activities seen as " masculine " , whereas women who reject traditional gender roles might be more likely to play MMOs such as EverQuest II .
Perhaps in support of this the survey revealed an unusually high level of bisexuality among the women who took part in the study - over five times higher than the general population .
" These are not people who are following strict gender stereotypes , " said Prof Caplan .
" I think that the game itself is right now a very non-traditional activity for women , and so I think what you would find in this population are going to be people who are in other ways less traditional than the majority population . "
Consumer focus
Another unexpected finding was that the online game players - particularly the women - were healthier than the general population , though this was drawn from self - reported levels of exercise and body mass index .
Dmitri Williams , a researcher at the University of Southern California and a co-author on the study , said one possible explanation could be that playing computer games reduces the amount of time spent in front of the television .
Consoles such as the Wii have won a cross - gender audience " What we think might be at play is that it 's not that games are good for you , it 's that TV is bad for you , " he said .
" With television , what you get is an endless stream of commercials telling you to buy things and to consume things , and what we think we 're finding is that when you remove all that consumption impulse you are probably less driven to consume . "
In games such as EverQuest II , players spend their time completing quests and killing monsters , so it 's possible that such in - game activities might influence players in real - life , said Prof Williams .
" It could be that games inspire a more active lifestyle , instead of sitting in front of a TV . "
The study also found that men and women played computer games for different reasons , with men more likely to play to win and women more likely to play for social reasons .
Furthermore , a high proportion of women reported playing the game with their romantic partner , supporting the idea that game playing is becoming an increasingly sociable activity .
The researchers say that this trend is reflected in patterns of general computer and internet use .
" If you go back 20 years and talk about people using computers and the internet , I think the stereotype would have been of a young male , " said Prof Caplan .
" Nowadays , if you look at MySpace and Facebook and all of the social uses of the internet , the number of women who have it as part of their everyday life has gone up phenomenally , " he said .
" In the same way that the stereotype of a computer user has become more gender - neutral , I think we 'll see that with games too . "
