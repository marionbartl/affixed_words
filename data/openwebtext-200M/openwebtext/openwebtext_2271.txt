HOMEOWNERS know that in one field of life , nothing less than perfection is acceptable .
The rules of the lawn are very clear : no bare patches , Fido - induced brownouts , weeds , anemic blades or lusterless shades of green .
The quest for perfect grass is grueling enough that some might sell their souls to get it .
Deberoh Gruver did , and she could n’t be more delighted .
The Riverside teacher ’s lawn is perfect 365 days a year .
Instead of fighting the Inland Empire ’s blast - furnace heat and two dogs for control of her yard , she sits back and watches as passersby stop to behold the wonder of flawless turf .
“ People look at it , touch it , say , ‘ Wow , that is so pretty , ’ ” Gruver says .
But the price was steep .
She had to renounce her all - American belief in real grass .
Her lawn is fake .
And it set her back about $ 16,000 for front and back yards .
Worth every penny , she says .

Gruver is part of a burgeoning backlash against the hassle and expense of the traditional lawn .
A new generation of synthetic lawn , lush , soft and light - years from the AstroTurf of yesteryear , is fueling the rebellion -- and a compelling environmental case for going simulated green .
Synthetic grass saves on water , eliminates the need for toxic fertilizers and requires no polluting mower .
A bonus :
Some brands use recycled materials , including old Nike shoes .
“ We have doubled in size every year , and this year we ’ve tripled , ” says Dave Hartman , who runs EasyTurf ( www.easyturf.com), a distributor for FieldTurf , an artificial grass used by the Detroit Lions , Atlanta Falcons , New York Jets , San Diego Zoo and hundreds of colleges and high schools .
One of EasyTurf ’s first customers , Hartman was so enamored of the way his faux grass liberated him from mowing and watering and sent gophers packing that he joined the company .
In the four years since , 1,800 homeowners from Los Angeles to San Diego have made the switch to the company ’s facsimile lawns , he says .
Though the turf is expensive ( $ 10 a square foot ) , Hartman says the investment pays off by lowering water and maintenance bills .
Despite the convenience and eco-logic , artificial turf has to overcome entrenched cultural programming that dictates it ’s a civic duty to sow real grass .
Anything less borders on slackerhood , if not suburban treason .
Hartman says that attitude is changing , along with the stigma of early artificial turf , which had an image as a hard , leafless rug .
No one wants an obvious fake .
But one that passes for the real thing is another story .

“ It looks really real , ” says Susan Dominguez , a Murrieta resident who had FieldTurf installed in her backyard in February to keep maintenance down after her husband had a heart attack .
“ It has that just - mowed look .
I do n’t miss real grass at all .
We ’d do the front yard too if we could afford it . ”
The more lifelike synthetic comes from improvements in technology that have replaced abrasive , drain - poor nylon with a blend of polyethylene fibers , silica sand and recycled rubber called Nike Grind .
Instead of treating the process like carpeting and stuffing a pad under a thin rug , the new turf tries to replicate the dynamics between real earth and grass .
FieldTurf uses a base of decomposed rock for drainage .
That ’s topped by an infill of sand and rubber granules recycled from tires and ground - up athletic shoes .
The sand and rubber act like soil to hold the blades in place .
The surface is a nonabrasive material that performs like grass without the high maintenance costs .

Most of the recycled mix is old tires , notoriously hard to dispose of .
The process breaks down the rubber cryogenically , freezing and pulverizing it into rounded bits .
That ’s blended with the crumb rubber of athletic shoes , recycled by Nike .
The green potential of synthetic turf extends beyond recycling .
With 50 % to 70 % of residential water usage gulped by lawns and gardens , according to the nonprofit educational and advocacy group American Water Works Assn. , fake grass can put a big dent in water consumption .
Though xeriscaping and native plants are options , the reality is that some homeowners simply want a lawn , real or synthetic .
“ We could save on water and electricity to run the sprinkler system , ” says Gruver , whose yard has evolved from a lawn to a xeriscape to synthetic turf .
“ I ’m not a huge environmentalist , but we all need to do our part . ”
For the moment , it ’s not the ecoangle that ’s driving EasyTurf sales .
It ’s man ’s best lawn - wrecker .

“ It ’s difficult to maintain a beautiful lawn with dogs , ” Hartman says .
The synthetic turf does n’t stain , and it can be hosed down easily after nature has called .
Gruver ’s Rottweiler and Labrador retriever can’t mess up her new yard , or even dig it up .
But they like playing on it and still act as if it ’s grass , she says .
Except these former blade eaters are getting less lawn salad these days .
“ They tried to eat it , but nothing happens , ” she says .

How do old shoes become synthetic turf ?
At select sites , Nike collects used shoes as well as footwear returned by customers because of flaws .
The outsole rubber is separated and ground up , then mixed with rubber discarded from the manufacturing process at factories in Vietnam , Indonesia and China .
The resulting material , called Nike Grind , is then used to manufacture athletic fields that the company says contain the equivalent of about 75,000 pairs of shoe soles .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said he is the right man to steer the country through difficult economic times .
He blamed " international factors " for rising oil and food prices and housing market problems and said he was taking the right action to deal with them .
Asked if he should stay in his job he said : " There are many people who could take over but I think I can steer this economy through difficult times . "
" I have done it before and I can do it again , " he told the BBC .
Economic gloom Speaking later at his monthly Downing Street press conference Mr Brown said he had a record of handling the economy competently .
" I feel that I am in the right position to be able to sort out the problems that we have now , " he said .
" We will not hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to take the British economy through difficult times . "
The reason it 's going wrong are international factors that we are going to deal with
Gordon Brown
Prime Minister
' Bin tax ' plans played down by PM Brown vows to win over 42 days Send us your comments
He rejected as " defeatist " a suggestion there was little he could do to influence rising oil prices and other global trends .
" I actually believe that there is a great deal you can do .
Good economic decisions can help people through difficult times , " he added .
On Wednesday , Mr Brown set out his draft legislative programme for next year - a list of bills that he plans to bring into Parliament from November this year .
But the announcement was overshadowed by a raft of gloomy economic news and the governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King warning the " nice " decade was over .
By -election battle The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the government 's programme was an exercise in political survival after Labour 's local elections losses .
All parties are campaigning in Crewe and Nantwich ahead of the by - election on 22 May , which is seen as a key to Labour 's prospects of recovery , after its worst local election results in 40 years .
The prime minister is also under pressure to explain a surprise £ 2.7 bn tax cut package unveiled on Tuesday , after earlier insisting there was no cash for such a move .
In an interview with BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , he insisted the tax cuts were not a short - term " fix " to get him out of political trouble , as other countries were also pumping money into their economies to ward off recession .
He denied he had caved in to pressure from his own MPs angry at the abolition of the 10 p tax rate and said it was " absolute nonsense " to suggest , as former minister Stephen Byers did , that it showed he lacked a " strategic and principled " vision on tax and was just taking decisions for short - term advantage .
He also denied he had broken his own financial rules on only borrowing for investment , saying that applied to the entire economic cycle .
' World circumstances '
And he attempted to brush off criticism of his leadership style in memoirs by John Prescott and Cherie Blair , saying he did not listen to " innuendo and gossip " .
He told interviewer John Humphrys he believed he was still the right person to steer the country through tough economic times , as he had done in his previous role as chancellor .
" I have had experience in the last 11 years of building a strong economy .
I think few people would deny that we have had a good economy over the last 11 years .
" The reason it 's going wrong are international factors that we are going to deal with and I am probably best placed to deal with these issues because of what I know about dealing with other countries on oil and other issues and we are going to keep going . "
He said his priorities were oil prices , food prices , the housing market and " getting funds to business " .
The UK was better placed to deal with worldwide recession than in the previous downturn under a Conservative government in the early 1990s , because of Labour 's record on controlling inflation and maintaining high levels of employment , he added .
Mr Brown also rejected Conservative claims he had broken his own " sustainable investment " rule , which says debt must be kept below 40 % of GDP .
He said the government had met both this rule and the " only borrow to invest " golden rule over the most recent economic cycle , which he said had lasted from 1997 to 2007 .
" We are now in a new economic cycle , " he added .

In George Orwell ’s 1984 there is a memorable scene when the speaker from Oceania ’s Ministry of Truth is addressing a rally , the culmination of Hate Week against the enemy , Eurasia .
He receives a message mid-sentence , then smoothly shifts gears to deliver the remainder of his speech excoriating Eastasia .
The crowd responds enthusiastically , and the narrator , Winston , notes that , of course , Eastasia had always been the enemy .
The alliances in Orwell ’s nightmare world had shifted , but the concept of the enemy remained the same .
There always has to be an enemy .
So too the neoconservatives always need an enemy to justify the huge defense contracts that in turn spawn the think tanks and academic chairs in security studies that provide them with their sinecures .
A world without “ Islamofascism ” or another enemy lurking is a world without employment for the likes of Bill Kristol and John Bolton .
Post - 1992 Russia has given every indication that it desires to be a friend to the United States and that it has no desire to recreate the Cold War .
It allowed itself to be looted by the oligarchs , who presented themselves as the bearers of Western - style modernization with hardly a complaint .
It saw its place in the world shrink and its voice in international fora diminished .
President George W. Bush even famously looked Russian Premier Vladimir Putin in the eye in Crawford , Texas , in June 2001 and announced positively that he had gotten a “ sense of his soul . ”
But the neoconservatives were never on board the Russian project .
Their reading on Russia was that it was and always will be the enemy .
They would argue that Bush misjudged his guest and Russia was even then preparing to rebuild its empire .
The Great Decider is making up for his slip of the tongue now , threatening Russia even though it was on the receiving end of a foolish invasion launched by America ’s ally Georgia .
But now it is a much diminished U.S. that has no options in the Caucasus .
In speaking forcefully on an issue that he cannot influence , Bush is again the engineer of a foreign policy train wreck , a disaster potentially much more dangerous than Iraq .
The White House is inexplicably , and in support of no national interest of the United States , creating an enemy where one did not exist , an enemy , one might add , that is equipped with a nuclear arsenal and state - of - the art ballistic missiles that could destroy both the United States and Western Europe .
One might reasonably argue that the current international situation threatens a reversion to the uncertainty that prevailed during the Cold War .
Over the past several years the White House has done everything possible to turn a possible friend into an enemy who is now clearly convinced that there is no dealing with Washington on any kind of rational level .
From the Russian point of view , there has been nothing but provocation from the Bush administration , starting with its withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in December 2001 so that it could push forward with an unneeded missile defense system that mostly benefits defense contractors and their neocon friends .
More recently , the White House supported the creation of an independent Kosovo without any serious attempt to address Russian concerns .
And there is even worse coming from Bush heir presumptive Sen.
John McCain , who has declared that “ We are all Georgians , ” presumably meaning that we have all been attacked by Russia .
McCain is advised exclusively by neoconservatives on foreign policy , one of whom has received more than $ 1 million to lobby for Georgia .
McCain has called for expelling Moscow from the G - 8 and blocking its entry into the World Trade Organization , the type of economic isolation that was routinely employed against the Soviet Union .
Russia hears nothing good coming out of the United States .
The United States government and people have a great deal of difficulty in seeing themselves as others see them , perhaps an unfortunate downside to American exceptionalism .
What most non-Americans , including the Russians , have seen over the past seven years is a frequently corrupt and sometimes criminal regime in Washington that has twisted the truth , invaded some countries while bullying many others , and made the world a much more dangerous and unstable place than it was prior to 9/11 .
Can there be a more unsettling sight than either Bush or Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice smugly lecturing the world on how it should behave ?
There is no upside for Washington in confronting Moscow .
How Russia elects its leaders and governs itself is not America ’s concern , particularly as Vladimir Putin and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev enjoy overwhelming support from their own people .
Regarding Russia , the Bush administration has advanced two broad policies that are quite frankly incomprehensible .
Together they do little for the national security of the United States and do a great deal to make the Russians nervous .
First is the expansion of NATO .
NATO is a military alliance that no longer has any meaning .
It was created to restrain the Soviet Union through the threat of military force , a raison d’être that has not applied since 1992 , which is why a reluctant NATO , searching for a new role , bombed Serbia in 1999 and is currently in Afghanistan supporting overstretched U.S. forces .
Washington has attempted to obfuscate the question whether NATO should exist at all by arguing that the role of the alliance has changed , that it is no longer directed against Russia and is instead a source of stability for both Eastern and Western Europe , bringing newly democratized nations into the fold in a stable and sustainable fashion by integrating them into a purely defensive military structure where armies are answerable to the people .
Using that rationale , NATO has incorporated Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania  all former parts of the Soviet Union  as well as Slovenia , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Poland , Romania , Croatia , Albania , and Bulgaria .
It has also discussed adding Ukraine and Georgia , both of which border Russia and were also part of the old Soviet Union .
But Moscow does n’t buy that argument , first of all because it does n’t understand why a military alliance should be used as the instrument for what is essentially economic integration , which could be managed by the United States and European Union working together in more appropriate settings .
Russia is also keenly aware of the political agenda linked to the NATO expansion .
The United States and some Europeans have supported the various pastel revolutions that have swept across Eastern Europe .
This support has been both overt and covert , but it always has one objective : to replace pro-Russian parties and regimes with “ democratic ” alternatives that are more closely aligned with the West .
That the new regimes are frequently virtually indistinguishable from the ones they replace in terms of corruption , inefficiency , and failure to govern by the rule of law appears to be irrelevant .
The Russians , nervous about their own security , have watched this advance of governments unfriendly to them and their vital interests .
Is there any national interest reason why the United States should support the “ democratization ” of Eastern Europe ?
The short answer is “ no . ” Russia , as an energy giant and a major player on the world stage , is the only country in Eastern Europe that should truly matter to the United States , and our objective should be to establish the best possible relationship .
The willy - nilly NATO expansion policies in place do little more than heighten the sense of threat in Moscow , converting a strategically important country from a competitor into an enemy .
And then there is threat of the Iranian missiles that do not exist , might never exist , and could not threaten either Europe or the United States in the foreseeable future .
To counter those weapons , the U.S. will install “ defensive ” missiles in Poland , with a radar station in the Czech Republic .
Both Warsaw and Prague have been heavily bribed and pressured to accept the deployments , which are opposed by both the Czech and Polish people and most other Europeans .
The missiles serve no useful purpose against Tehran but could be used against Russia .
Anyone who is interested in missile technology and its capabilities knows that “ defensive ” and “ offensive ” are meaningless terms , as the weapons can be deployed in roles that support either function .
So why does Washington persist in demanding that an unwanted weapons system that has no purpose but to create fear in Moscow be put into operation ?
Perhaps Bill Kristol and John Bolton can provide an answer .
But the end result will quite likely be Cold War II , huge new defense contracts , and more fear - mongering talking points for the neocons .
Sometime in May 2003 , shortly after U.S. forces had taken Baghdad and President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier under the banner " Mission Accomplished , " an old friend remarked that he thought the war was going pretty well so far .
I shook my head and said I thought we were in for trouble .
I bet him that day that Iraq would be a mess in five years ' time , a mess being defined as " you 'll know it when you see it . "
I mentioned this bet to Bret Stephens three years later .
He 'd reviewed my book , " America at the Crossroads " in this ...
It is a scene that epitomises childhood : young siblings racing towards a heavy oak tree , hauling themselves on to the lower branches and scrambling up as high as they can get .
Yet millions of children are being deprived of such pleasure because their parents are nervous about exposing them to any risks , new research has revealed .
A major study by Play England , part of the National Children 's Bureau , found that half of all children have been stopped from climbing trees , 21 per cent have been banned from playing conkers and 17 per cent have been told they cannot take part in games of tag or chase .
Some parents are going to such extreme lengths to protect their children from danger that they have even said no to hide - and - seek .
' Children are not being allowed many of the freedoms that were taken for granted when we were children , ' said Adrian Voce , director of Play England .
' They are not enjoying the opportunities to play outside that most people would have thought of as normal when they were growing up . '
Voce argued that it was becoming a ' social norm ' for younger children to be allowed out only when accompanied by an adult .
' Logistically that is very difficult for parents to manage because of the time pressures on normal family life , ' he said .
' If you do n't want your children to play out alone and you have not got the time to take them out then they will spend more time on the computer . '
Voce pointed out how irrational some of these decisions were .
Last year , almost three times as many children were admitted to hospital after falling out of bed as those who had fallen from a tree .
The tendency to wrap children in cotton wool has transformed how they experience childhood .
According to the research , 70 per cent of adults had their biggest childhood adventures in outdoor spaces among trees , rivers and woods , compared with only 29 per cent of children today .
The majority of young people questioned said that their biggest adventures took place in playgrounds .
Voce said Play England was determined to spread the message that children ought to be taking risks and that it is ' not the end of the world if a child has an accident ' .
The latest study will be launched on Wednesday to coincide with Play Day , when hundreds of events will take place across the country to celebrate children 's right to play .
It will show that play providers also feel the opportunities for children to ' test and challenge themselves in play involving a level of risk ' have reduced over the past decade .
They blame overcautious health and safety officers and the fear of litigation if children have accidents .
Andrea Quaintmere , who manages Toffee Park Adventure Playground in London , admitted there were fears that parents would sue if children were injured .
But she said that should not stop workers ensuring children experienced lots of adventure .
' We need to educate parents who are worried about their kids having accidents and hurting themselves , ' said Quaintmere .
' Children can learn from small accidents .
Parents do get nervous and tell us " do n't let them do that " .
I try to remind them of their own childhood . '
As Quaintmere spoke , two nine - year - old girls , Chloe Bailey and Kiara Gomes , ran by .
' My favourite games are football and " it " , ' said Chloe , before going to build a camp with her friends .
' My mum says that climbing trees is too dangerous , ' said Kiara .
' But my dad lets me .
If I fall over and it hurts , I just get myself up and smile . '
The Play England study quotes a number of play providers who highlight the benefits to children of taking risks .
' Risk - taking increases the resilience of children , ' said one .
' It helps them make judgments , ' said another .
Some of those interviewed blamed the ' cotton wool ' culture for the fact that today 's children were playing it too safe , while others pointed to a lack of equipment or too much concrete in place of grass .
The research also lists examples of risky play that should be encouraged including fire - building , den-making , watersports , paintballing , boxing and climbing trees .
Justine Roberts , founder of Mumsnet.com , an online forum for mothers , said that parents only wanted to protect their children .
' It is the mums and dads that have to deal with the bruises and cuts , ' she said .
' But broadly speaking I think that we will have to be brave and allow our children to take physical risk because , within reason , that is the way that they learn .
' When you see your two - and - a - half year - old on a climbing frame your heart is in your mouth and that is normal but I think most parents realise that at some point their children have to take physical risks ; most recognise the benefits of learning through play .
We can be overprotective but it is impossible to wrap children in cotton wool . '
Is Charlie Crist , the bachelor Republican Governor of Florida , gay ?
And just to add to the weirdness , Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone ( who worked for Crist during his 2006 gubernatorial campaign ) is distributing a video showing Crist making out with a girlfriend .
Supposedly this shows that Crist is not gay .
Except , well , the purported girlfriend is married , and not to Crist .
Of course , now that he is getting married , does n’t that prove that he is n’t gay ?
No really !
Watchdog : Leaked photos show troops fly in squalor Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 22 , 2008

This A government watchdog has uncovered pictures that suggest US troops on their way to battlefields in Afghanistan travel in squalor while top military and government officials are cocooned in " comfort capsules " with reclining leather seats and flat - screen TVs .
Last week , the Project on Government Oversight asked for photos of the dilapidated airline seats ; it was n't long before pictures of torn , moldy , stained seats started rolling in .
POGO did not identify the source of its photos , but it said they were taken at Al Udeid Airbase in Afghanistan .
The watchdog , which focuses on exposing waste , fraud and abuse in the US government , recently worked with the Washington Post to expose an Air Force program to spend money earmarked for the War on Terror to upgrade luxury cabins used to ferry top officials .
Internal e-mails POGO obtained through a public records request showed " that Air Force generals frivolously blew hundreds of thousands in taxpayer dollars because they did n't like the color of seat belts , carpet , leather and wood used in work and living space units being developed for use on cargo planes , " the group says .
In its request for the photos , POGO said it was " aware " of deplorable conditions in troop transport seats and noted that a program aimed to " remedy the current deplorable state of these seats ... is moving too slowly , " as opposed to the plans to upgrade the cabins for top brass , which were known as Senior Leader Intransit Comfort Capsules .
The Post noted that the Air Force already provided top - notch arrangements for VIP travel before seeking the new cabins .
The Air Force already has two trailers , known as Silver Bullets , that can be loaded aboard large transports for use by top military and civilian officers , plus a fleet of about 100 planes specifically meant for VIP travel .
But McMahon , who is now the Air Force 's deputy chief of staff for logistics , installations and mission support , said the new program was started because the service ferried more " senior travelers " to distant regions after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and identified a " gap " in its capability .
The existing trailers already seem pretty cozy .
UK's Metro obtained some pictures of a modified Airstream trailer that took First Lady Laura Bush to Afghanistan recently .
" With wood panelling , plush grey carpet , comfy leather seats and , most importantly , thick window shades , Mrs Bush could forget she was anywhere near the War on Terror being played out below the clouds , " Miles Erwin wrote for Metro .
Northwest Airlines officials have ordered an ad aimed at McCain to be removed .
Northwest bans ad from airport
An advocacy group seeking to curtail the proliferation of nuclear weapons is crying foul after an ad aimed at presumptive GOP nominee John McCain was ordered removed from Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport .
The group , the Union of Concerned Scientists , took out ads in the Denver and Twin Cities airports aimed at both presidential candidates .
The MSP ad shows an overhead photograph of downtown Minneapolis and says , " When only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like Minneapolis ...
We do n't need 6,000 . "

But Northwest Airlines officials have ordered the ad removed .
" This is a private airline acting as a political censor , " said Elliott Negin , media director for the Union of Concerned Scientists .
The ad urges McCain to get serious about the nuclear threat .
The Denver ad , aimed at presumptive Democratic nominee Barack Obama , is similar .
Thousands of delegates , party dignitaries , members of the media and others are expected to pass through the airport on their way to the convention , to be held Sept. 1 - 4 at St. Paul 's Xcel Energy Center .
The airport ad is part of a broader advertising effort aimed at both conventions , Negin said , one that will include radio spots and smaller ads in bars and restaurants .
Negin said the UCS also bought ads on the sides of cabs in Boston and New York City during the 2004 conventions and received no complaints .
But Northwest — the official airline of the Republican National Convention — asked its advertising vendor , ClearChannel Outdoor , to remove the ad .
It had been up since Aug. 13 and was supposed to stay up for one month .
In e-mailed correspondence between Northwest and ClearChannel released by the UCS , Northwest regional director Kathleen Nelson asks for the ad to be removed .
" I just took a look and I can see how this would be offensive / scary to some ( the concept of our city in the crosshairs of a nuclear bomb ) and the strong anti-McCain message .
Can we remove it ? " she wrote .
In an e-mail to the Pioneer Press on Monday , Tammy Lee , Northwest 's vice president of corporate communications , said , " Out of an abundance of respect for both parties , we will not allow attack ads of either persuasion to be prominently displayed in our concourses .
Our customers and employees complained and we responded .
We will not be a party to petty political attacks on either side . "
Negin disputes that the ad is anti-McCain .
" We 'll agree that nukes are scary , and that 's why we think more people should be paying attention to ( the issue ) , " he said .
" To say that the ad is anti-McCain is ludicrous . "
Negin said the UCS does not endorse political candidates .
Northwest controls advertising in Concourse G , where Northwest flights originate and depart .
Peggie Hardie , general manager for Clear Channel Airports in Minneapolis , told the Associated Press that Clear Channel has asked the UCS to modify the ad and will accept a revised version if its concerns are met .
Negin said the UCS would be willing to discuss the ad with Hardie .
But he noted that Clear Channel had already accepted and posted the ad , and said the company should let it stay up .
Such an ad would n't have been allowed in other parts of the airport , where advertising is controlled by the Metropolitan Airports Commission .
Only commercial and other nonpolitical advertisements are allowed , MAC spokesman Patrick Hogan said .

The first warning sign was delivered in a phone call nine days ago , when John McCain 's new senior adviser , Steve Schmidt , held a conference call with worried senior Republican party figures .
Schmidt told them that they would soon see McCain go on the offensive against Barack Obama .
Some tough TV ads were coming , he warned .
It was no lie .
The first ad came barely 24 hours later .
Others followed , and soon the US presidential election erupted into its most vicious fight so far .
Both sides traded insults over patriotism , racism and allegations of becoming negative .
It dominated the front pages and cable news shows , and there is little sign that the storm will abate quickly .
Many pundits saw the move as a sign of desperation from a McCain campaign humbled by Obama 's triumphal world tour , behind in the polls and written off by some commentators .
But the truth is very different .
McCain 's aggressive strategy is a deliberate and well - thought - out ploy .
It was developed and implemented by a coterie of advisers brought in last month who are protégés of the Republican political guru Karl Rove .
Schmidt , who learnt his trade with Rove , heads the group and is now guiding the campaign .
The strategy is intended to turn McCain 's ailing presidential bid around and give it a firm focus : one mostly fixed on attacking Obama .
Schmidt and others believe they can do to Obama what the Republicans did to John Kerry in 2004 .
' They know how to win a presidential election .
If you can show a candidate 's basic flaws , that is one way to win , ' said Steve Mitchell , a Republican political adviser and chairman of Mitchell Research .
McCain 's new advisers believe they can define Obama in their own terms and leave him as damaged goods in the eyes of the electorate .
If that sounds like a hard - headed , unpleasant , negative strategy , that is probably because it is .
But Schmidt and his allies have also started to give Republicans the one thing that Obama had seemed to be monopolising - hope of winning .
Steve Schmidt is known as ' The Bullet ' .
Part of that is to do with his bald - headed appearance , but it is also as much to do with his hyper - aggressive political style .
He was promoted to run McCain 's campaign at the beginning of last month , after he and several other aides went to McCain and warned him that his presidential bid was in dire trouble .
McCain took the warning to heart and placed Schmidt in charge of the day - to - day running of his campaign operation .
It was a bold move , but Schmidt is one of the rising stars of Republican politics .
The New Jersey native cut his teeth under Rove and in the Bush White House .
He ran the 2004 Republican war room that was responsible for taking down Kerry .
He also worked hard on getting conservative judges through the process of appointment to the Supreme Court .
Then he guided the re-election campaign of California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , to victory .
Schmidt has been joined by other key figures from the Rove-era Bush White House .
They include the formidable figure of Nicole Wallace , a Bush campaign spokeswoman in 2004 , and Greg Jenkins , a former Fox TV journalist who once worked for Bush 's campaign .
The group has sought to tighten an operation that was floundering under its previous leadership .
They have also given it a sharply negative edge .
However , such a strategy is not without risk .
Much of McCain 's huge appeal to the middle ground relies on his popular reputation as a military hero and a decent man .
Excessive negative campaigning could hurt that valuable political commodity .
' This is a first for McCain .
This is a very different strategy to see in a McCain campaign , ' said political scientist Tim Hagle , a professor at the University of Iowa .
The tactics have certainly caused despair among some McCain allies .
Republican Senator Chuck Hagel , a close friend of McCain and former strategist , broke his silence to label recent attack ads comparing Obama with celebrities like Britney Spears as ' childish ' .
He also said another ad , which criticised Obama for not visiting wounded US soldiers , was ' inappropriate ' .
But such grousing is unlikely to worry the new team .
They are far more concerned in recovering from months of campaigning in which Obama has emerged as the clear favourite to triumph in November .
McCain is behind in most polls , lacks the glamour of Obama , faces an unenthusiastic Republican base and has much less money .
However , the team is tackling all those issues , not least with last week 's ads .
The first , dubbed ' Troops ' , aired last Saturday and attacked Obama as caring more about going to the gym than meeting the military .
In a move of marketing genius , it was first aired as part of a news story .
When it was finally shown in a paid - for slot - on a TV channel in Denver - it immediately became a talking point .
It was broadcast on TV , radio and newspaper websites .
Yet , in its first 24 hours , it only aired about six times as an ad .
The same happened with the second ad , ' Celeb ' .
Although Spears and Paris Hilton appeared only for a brief second , their inclusion guaranteed massive media coverage .
But this ad also revealed the Karl Rove - style thinking behind McCain 's campaign .
It is a truism of Rovian political tactics - inherited by Schmidt - that you attack an opponent 's strength .
For Obama , that is his charisma and ability to generate huge crowds of enthusiastic people .
The ad tried to turn that into a disadvantage .
It was a tactic that worked superbly against Kerry in 2004 , when the Republican war room - led by Schmidt - undermined Kerry 's record as a Vietnam war hero .
There are also signs that the McCain campaign might be tapping into feelings about the often fawning coverage of Obama .
US late - night talk shows are starting to mock Obama 's campaign .
David Letterman recently delivered one of his trademark ' Top 10 ' lists on the subject of signs that Obama had become overconfident .
They varied from ' Had head measured for Mount Rushmore ' to ' Offered McCain a job in gift shop at Obama presidential library ' .
The Daily Show's Jon Stewart joked that Obama 's trip to Israel was so that he could visit his birthplace in Bethlehem .
Indeed , within the McCain camp itself the nickname they have given Obama is ' The One ' .
Away from the jokes , there is also a belief that some hard realities , and even harder tactics , could burst the bubble of good press that has surrounded the Obama campaign since he beat Hillary Clinton to the Democratic nomination .
Many Republicans believe that the controversy surrounding the Rev Jeremiah Wright , Obama 's former pastor , will return to haunt him .
That would inject race into the campaign in ways that were hinted at last week .
When McCain 's camp recently accused Obama of playing the race card , it was the first time the subject of his skin colour had directly come up .
Many Republican strategists believe that McCain is most likely to benefit from that .
' The more race comes into the debate , the less likely it is that Obama will win , ' said Mitchell .
That contention is not proven .
But prominently airing the Wright issue in the final month of the campaign would surely test that theory .
McCain 's camp is unlikely to bring up the Wright issue , but there are many Republican surrogates who will probably do that job enthusiastically .
Again , the echoes of the campaign that derailed Kerry are troubling for Democrats .
' Come October , Wright 's name recognition is going to be 99 per cent , ' said Mitchell .
That could be true .
US elections are often dogged by predictions of an ' October surprise ' , but in 2008 the ' surprise ' against Obama may turn out to be very predictable .
Yet Barack Obama is no John Kerry .
Obama 's campaign has run a ruthlessly efficient response team to the McCain attacks .
They have set up websites that address many of the criticisms and Obama has not hesitated to fight back , often within hours or even minutes of the latest assault .
In 2004 Kerry was often accused of dithering before responding .
In 2008 Obama and his team do the opposite .
But last week 's attacks did rattle the Obama camp and led to some strange pronouncements .
Robert Gibbs , a senior aide , retreated from Obama 's assertion that Republicans were pointing out his race .
' Barack Obama in no way believes that the McCain campaign is using race as an issue , ' he said .
That contradicted Obama 's own comments , where he explicitly stated that his opponents were using his background to attack him .
' What they 're saying is ... he does n't look like the other Presidents on the currency , ' Obama said repeatedly on recent campaign stops in Missouri .
That outbreak of disunity adds to nagging doubts over Obama 's performance in the polls .
He has enjoyed several months of positive press coverage , whereas McCain has been ignored or ridiculed for a series of gaffes .
But Obama 's lead is still narrow .
In the RCP National Average of polls , he is ahead by just 2.6 points .
The picture is similar in key battleground states like Colorado , Ohio and Virginia , where he is ahead by only a few points .
McCain is actually ahead in other vital states , like Florida and Missouri .
' It is surprisingly close , ' said Tim Hagle .
' Some people , especially in the media , think that Obama is now like Hillary Clinton at the start of her campaign .
That all she had to do was just turn up .
Well , we know how that turned out . '
“ If the typical Gore event was 20 people in a living room writing six - figure checks , ” Gorenberg told me , “ and the Kerry event was 2,000 people in a hotel ballroom writing four - figure checks , this year for Obama we have stadium rallies of 20,000 people who pay absolutely nothing , and then go home and contribute a few dollars online . ”
Obama himself shrewdly capitalizes on both the turnout and the connectivity of his stadium crowds by routinely asking them to hold up their cell phones and punch in a five - digit number to text their contact information to the campaign — to win their commitment right there on the spot .
It ’s possible to track the network effects in the growing fund - raising numbers that seem to arrive in ever larger denominations : $ 25 million … $ 30 million … $ 35 million … in February , the staggering $ 55 million — nearly $ 2 million a day .
In a sense , Obama represents a triumph of campaign - finance reform .
He has not , of course , gotten the money out of politics , as many proponents of reform may have wished , and he will likely forgo public financing if he becomes the nominee .
But he has realized the reformers ’ other big goal of ending the system whereby a handful of rich donors control the political process .
He has done this not by limiting money but by adding much , much more of it — democratizing the system by flooding it with so many new contributors that their combined effect dilutes the old guard to the point that it scarcely poses any threat .
Goren­berg says he ’s still often asked who the biggest fund - raisers are .
He replies that it is no longer possible to tell .
“ Any one of them could wind up being huge , ” he says , “ because it no longer matters how big a check you can write ; it matters how motivated you are to reach out to others . ”
There is some irony in the fact that the architect of the most recent campaign - finance law also happens to be the Republican presidential nominee .
John McCain likely views all that has happened with considerable trepidation .
Contrary to the widespread assumption at the time the McCain - Feingold Act became law ( The Atlantic published an article on the legislation titled “ The Democratic Party Suicide Bill ” ) , it has not hurt the Democratic Party .
Neither has it clearly benefited Republicans ; McCain in particular has little to show for it .
He raised $ 15 million in March , only $ 4 million of it over the Internet .
His small - donor base is virtually nonexistent .
When challenged about his staunch support for the Iraq War , McCain likes to say that he’d be willing to sacrifice the White House for principle .
Nobody asks about campaign - finance reform .
But that , and not Iraq , may wind up being the principled stand that does him in .
Meanwhile , the Obama machine rolls on , to the delight of its early stakeholders .
“ They ’ve gone from zero to 700 employees in a year and raised $ 200 million , ” Steve Spinner says of the campaign .
“ That ’s a super - high - growth , fast - charging operation . ”
It ’s also one whose growth curve is coming into sharper focus .
The Obama campaign has not yet assumed a place in Silicon Valley lore alongside Apple , Google , and Facebook .
But a few more months could change that .
The hottest start - up in the Valley right now wo n’t make anybody rich , but it might put the next president in the White House .

Some say that 9/11 could n’t have been an “ inside job ” because a coverup would be impossible ; someone with inside knowledge would blow the whistle on such a horrible and criminal operation .
The Tuskegee Syphilis experiment is one example of policy and decision makers in US federal , state and local governments conspiring to commit and cover up crimes against humanity ; the “ experiment ” was in progress , and kept quiet , for 40 years .
In the “ Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male ” , the US Public Health Service ( PHS ) decided to use 399 Black men who had syphilis as experimental subjects in a study of racial differences in “ late stage ” syphilis , which can cause incredible suffering and even death .
These human beings were used as research subjects without their knowledge or consent , in exchange for free medical exams , meals and burial insurance ( on condition the PHS would be able to conduct an autopsy ) .
According to the Centers for Disease Control , “ The late stages of syphilis can develop in about 15 % of people who have not been treated for syphilis , and can appear 10 – 20 years after infection was first acquired .
In the late stages of syphilis , the disease may subsequently damage the internal organs , including the brain , nerves , eyes , heart , blood vessels , liver , bones , and joints .
Signs and symptoms of the late stage of syphilis include difficulty coordinating muscle movements , paralysis , numbness , gradual blindness , and dementia .
This damage may be serious enough to cause death . ”
It was known at the time that syphilis could cause extraordinary suffering and even death , and the disease was epidemic in Alabama , where the study took place .
As the name of the study indicates , those directing it had no intention of providing treatment , despite their representations that treatment would be part of the study , and despite Alabama law requiring diagnosed “ venereal ” disease to be promptly treated .
The PHS began to administer penicillin in 1943 , but it was not given to the Tuskegee victims .
According to the CDC , it was “ the treatment of choice ” by 1945 .
According to Tuskegee University , “ Beginning in 1952 , the PHS began utilizing local health departments to track study participants who had left Macon County .
Until the end of the study in the 1970s , local health departments [ conspired ] with the PHS to keep the study subjects from receiving treatment . ”
Victims who questioned whether they had syphilis were lied to ; those who found out they had syphilis and demanded treatment were given placebos instead , or treatment at levels thought insufficient to cure the disease .
During the time the experiment was being conducted , papers were published in scientific journals which acknowledged the syphilis was being left untreated , and ignored the ethical implications .
In 1966 , after PHS researcher Peter Buxtun discovered the experiment was being conducted , he wrote a letter to the director of the Division of Venereal Diseases , William Brown , but nothing was changed .
He wrote a second letter to Brown in 1968 ; this letter also addressed the ramifications of the study in the context of the growing civil rights movement and racial unrest .
Brown showed the letter to the Centers for Disease Conrol ( CDC ) , which convened a panel discussion of the issue ; they reviewed the study and decided it should continue to the end .
The study was intended to last 40 years , and it was continued from 1932 to 1972 , when Buxtun shared what he knew with an Associated Press reporter .
The story broke on the front page of the Washington Evening Star July 25 , 1972 , and was headline news nationwide the next day and in the following weeks .
Public outrage and disgust was widespread , the study was ended and reforms were enacted .
A $ 1.8 billion class action lawsuit was filed ; it was settled out of court for $ 10 million without wrongdoing being admitted by the federal government , and in 1997 Bill Clinton formally apologized for the US federal government ’s role .
It is not known how many people were infected with syphilis by the Tuskegee victims due to the conspirators at PHS and local health departments preventing them from receiving diagnosis and treatment .
Tuskegee shows us that people in positions of authority in US federal , state and local governments and the scientific community are capable of conspiracy and committing crimes against humanity , and that many people were aware of what was going on and did nothing about it .
At least 3 papers were openly published on this “ experiment ” in scientific journals in the 50’s and 60’s , even while the victims were suffering and dying , and being deceived and prevented from receiving penicillin , the proven safe and effective treatment that was in widespread use .
These journals were not accessible by the general public , and no medical student or professional who read these articles blew the whistle .
At the time , many whites did n’t consider black people to be fully human ; as shocking as it may seem now , readers of the articles may have believed it was important research , or that the lives and well - being of the “ research subjects ” were unimportant , regardless .
Indeed , in 1976 historian James Jones interviewed PHS Director John Heller and quotes him as saying , " The men 's status did not warrant ethical debate .
They were subjects , not patients ; clinical material , not sick people . "
Heller was director of the Venereal Diseases unit of the PHS from 1943 to 1948 and was instrumental in the experiment ’s continuation .
The quote appears in Jones ’ book “ Bad blood : The Tuskegee syphilis experiment : A tragedy of race and medicine ” , considered the definitive book on the subject .
No apology was offered by anyone involved in the study ( an African - American doctor and nurse were part of it as well ) ; many of them were angry that the US government did not defend their actions .
The Tuskegee experiment gives insight to the psychology of individuals and societies .
It is revealing of how cover -ups work and how they can be maintained , and also how they can be exposed , winning needed reforms , if not true justice .
Given what ’s known about Tuskegee , who can say with confidence that 9/11 could not have been an inside job because it would be impossible to cover up ; someone involved would have “ talked ” already ?
Tuskegee did not become known because someone who was involved in the plot blew the whistle ; Buxtun learned of the ongoing study from co-workers , and less than a year after he was hired in 1965 he had written his first internal letter protesting the study .
Is there an on - going cover up of what really happened on 9/11 ?
A number of people have already blown the whistle on corruption , “ negligence ” , obstruction , dereliction of duty , “ incompetence ” , malfeasance , “ careerism ” and cover up related to the “ failures ” to prevent 9/11 .
More whistleblowers may yet come forward , including actual participants .
Numerous whistleblowers have already gone public with things they witnessed that seriously contradict the Official 9/11 Conspiracy Theory put out by the Bush Administration and the 9/11 Commission .
However , Congress seems to be doing little or nothing with their testimony , while they continue to enable the crimes of the Bush Administration .
Whistleblowers have been intimidated , harassed , fired and threatened , while “ incompetents ” who failed to do their job and facilitated the attacks have been given raises , bonuses and even more responsibility .
Beginning on September 11 , White House staff were put on Cipro , the Anthrax antibiotic .
The first Anthrax letters were mailed to the New York Post and and Tom Brokaw at NBC a week after 9/11 happened ; October 9 , Senators Patrick Leahy and Tom Daschle received Anthrax letters .
The Bush Administration had wanted the PATRIOT
Act passed in a week , and Daschle and Leahy were blocking passage of the PATRIOT
Act so it could be adequately reviewed .
Also in early October Anthrax was discovered at The Sun , a newspaper in Boca Raton , FL , but the letter was reportedly never found .
In the resulting climate of fear , uncertainty and hysteria about potential terror attacks , the PATRIOT Act was passed overwhelmingly .
The Anthrax was discovered to be of the US military Aames strain , and highly refined and weaponized .
When the FBI traced it back to Fort Detrick , MD , the remaining stockpiles were destroyed and ever since the FBI and DOJ have been stonewalling Congress and the public on the status of its investigation .
July 31 , 2008 it was reported that Fort Detrick / USAMRID Anthrax scientist Bruce Ivins had killed himself ; he had been under investigation and made aware that he would soon be indicted .
This is an acknowledgment from the US government that the Anthrax was from Fort Detrick , and the attacks were a “ false - flag ” terror attack ( the letters were written to create the appearance of being from “ Islamofascists ” ) .
It ’s also raising a lot of new questions : see Anthrax Suspect Was Committed to a Psychiatric Hospital Shortly Before His Death and Government Tries to Bury Anthrax Story .
For months after 9/11 , the White House insisted there was no need to investigate 9/11 - they claimed it Bin Laden and Al Qaeda were responsible and had caught the US by surprise , but offered no evidence , or valid explanations for the CIA , FBI and NORAD failures .
Colin Powell promised a White Paper detailing the evidence of Bin Laden / Al Qaeda responsibility ; to date , nothing has been released .
The FBI even said June 2006 that it “ has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 ” .
In 2002 , after months of deflection , stonewalling and obstruction , including personal attempts by both Bush and Cheney to prevent any investigation into 9/11 , the White House conceded to an investigation that would be limited to “ intelligence failures ” .
This was the Senate - House Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry into what the NSA , FBI , CIA and other agencies knew prior to 9/11 .
Click here for their declassified report with 28 redacted pages , which Senator Bob Graham says contains evidence of Saudi funding and other assistance to the alleged hijackers .
During the course of their inquiry someone , reportedly in Congress , leaked that the NSA had intercepted messages in Arabic between Al Qaeda operatives on September 10 that said “ tomorrow is zero hour ” and “ the match begins tomorrow ” , that these messages were n’t translated until September 12 , and that there were 30 other pre-9/11 intercepts that referred to an imminent attack .
If true the September 10 intercepts were n’t translated until the day after 9/11 , by itself it may be seen to be evidence merely of incompetence , laziness and / or information and work overload .
When considered in the context of 30 other warning signs it seems more likely a case for criminal negligence could be built .
When considered with other facts about 9/11 , it seems more likely it ’s evidence of intentional obstruction , part of a larger plan by supervisors and policy makers with undisclosed interests and extra-Constitutional loyalties .
A plan to facilitate the appearance , to patriotic professionals within the various intelligence , investigative , law enforcement and defense agencies , and to Congress , the media and the general public , that the 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by “ Islamofascists ” .
In reality , the alleged hijackers may have only been patsies in a plot by “ elites ” to create the appearance of a “ clash of civilizations ” as a pretext for launching an endless “ war on terror ” , subverting the Constitution and empowering secretive “ unitary executive ” government not accountable to the People or Congress , engaging in imperialist wars for geo-strategic resources , suppressing dissent and setting up a national security - surveillance state in the US .
The intelligence and national security environment in which the 30 messages were intercepted has been referred to as the “ summer of threat ” when “ the system was blinking red ” and DCI George Tenet was “ running around with his hair on fire ” .
Warnings had been received for years about Bin Laden and Al Qaeda planning attacks in the US , including using planes as missiles , and the warning signs were increasing in 2001 .
From January 20 to September 10 , Bush was briefed on Al Qaeda over 40 times by Tenet , many of them urgently warning of an impending attack .
The FAA issued 52 warnings mentioning Bin Laden or Al Qaeda between April 2001 and September 10 , and the 9/11 Commission left this out of their book ; it was released the year after the book ’s publication , as a separate “ monograph ” .
The speculation about whether 9/11 was “ allowed ” or “ made ” to happen by parties other than Bin Laden and Al Qaeda , by people that are in the US government and have influence over the US government , is further fueled by such things as the fact that the CIA was aware of plans to strike in the US and was monitoring the alleged hijackers and people connected with them , as was the FBI .
The results of 38 + SEC , and separate FBI investigations , into pre-9/11 insider trading and other foreknowledge have never been made public .
The suspected insider trading and evidence of foreknowledge on the part of powerful people included a single purchase in early September 2001 of $ 5 billion in US Treasury Notes ; traditionally a more secure investment during times of economic and social turmoil .
The 9/11 Commission , composed exclusively of establishment insiders with financial , professional and / or political conflicts of interest , largely ignored the multiple war games and other exercises surrounding 9/11 , some of which mimicked the 9/11 attacks and involved the insertion of false radar blips , while others had sent fighters up to Canada and Alaska , making them unavailable to respond .
The Commission Report painted the standard air defense procedures as slow and laborious , requiring many phone calls and authorizations up and down a chain of command to get anything done .
They ignored and the distorted the fact that standard FAA / NORAD operating procedures before 9/11 required them to scramble jet fighters within minutes , to respond to any flight that went off - course .
See this March 12 , 2001 Archive.org of Chapter 10 of the FAA ’s manual , which dealt with “ Emergency Determinations ” , saying , “ c . If the words " Mayday " or " Pan - Pan " are not used and you are in doubt that a situation constitutes an emergency or potential emergency , handle it as though it were an emergency . ”
The Commission also did n’t mention that in June of 2001 , standard procedures were changed to require the authorization of the Secretary of Defense ; in cases where lethal force might be required , as was certainly a possibility the morning of September 11 .
This was Donald Rumsfeld , and like many principals in the military and Bush Administration , he was behaving strangely in response to the emergencies that morning , and was out of the loop while people were trying to contact him .
At 8:14 am , Flight 11 ’s radio button was repeatedly pushed , and it went off course at 8:20 am .
Things escalated from there ; soon 4 flights would be off course , with their transponders off and the pilots not responding to radio communications , although the alleged hijackers reportedly used the radio by “ accident ” , providing further evidence of hijacking .
The Commission unquestioningly accepted DOD officials statements that the exercises enhanced the response of NORAD that morning , even though they listened to taped conversations between the FAA and NORAD personnel indicating confusion caused by the war games ; statements such as “ is this real world or exercise ? ”
On the other hand , the 9/11 Commission ignored or distorted the testimony of these whistleblowers :

Myth :
Only women with a family history of breast cancer are at risk .
Reality : Roughly 70 % of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no identifiable risk factors for the disease .
But the family - history risks are these :
If a first - degree relative ( a parent , sibling , or child ) has had or has breast cancer , your risk of developing the disease approximately doubles .
Having two first - degree relatives with the disease increases your risk even more .
2. Myth : Wearing an underwire bra increases your risk of getting breast cancer .
Image zoom
( GETTY IMAGES ) Reality : Claims that underwire bras compress the lymphatic system of the breast , causing toxins to accumulate and cause breast cancer , have been widely debunked as unscientific .
The consensus is that neither the type of bra you wear nor the tightness of your underwear or other clothing has any connection to breast cancer risk .
3. Myth : Most breast lumps are cancerous .
Reality : Roughly 80 % of lumps in women 's breasts are caused by benign ( noncancerous ) changes , cysts , or other conditions .
Doctors encourage women to report any changes at all , however , because catching breast cancer early is so beneficial .
Your doctor may recommend a mammogram , ultrasound , or biopsy to determine whether a lump is cancerous .
4. Myth : Exposing a tumor to air during surgery causes cancer to spread .
Reality : Surgery does n't cause breast cancer and it does n't cause breast cancer to spread , as far as scientists can tell from the research so far .
Your doctor may find out during surgery that your cancer is more widespread than previously thought , however .
And some animal studies have shown that removing the primary tumor sometimes enables metastatic cancers to grow , but only temporarily ; this has not been demonstrated in humans .

JUBA , Sudan ( Reuters ) - Cholera has seen a resurgence in southern Sudan , where 20 have died over the weekend following heavy rains that drove hundreds of thousands from their homes , a local official said on Monday .
Cholera , which has been in decline in southern Sudan until recent rains , has infected almost 6,000 people in the region and killed at least 44 this year in other parts of the semi-autonomous region .
“ Twenty people so far died of a disease believed to be cholera over the weekend and many others are now admitted in Aweil hospital , ” said Tong Aken Ngor a member of parliament for the Aweil area of Bahr al - Ghazal state in southern Sudan .
Ngor said some 250,000 people had been made homeless due to heavy rains that caused flooding and destroyed houses in the area .
Ngor said many people in the flooded areas had little food or shelter and called for urgent international help .
Southern Sudan is emerging from a civil war after a peace treaty signed in 2005 that created an autonomous government for the region .
Cholera is a water - borne disease which causes vomiting and acute diarrhea and can rapidly lead to death from dehydration if not treated .
A cholera outbreak in 2006 killed 700 people and affected around 25,000 .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's the first time I 've seen Wall Street 's toughest analyst look rattled .
I 'm sitting ringside at the WWE's Great American Bash at New York 's Nassau Coliseum with Meredith Whitney - the Oppenheimer & Co. analyst renowned for her smackdowns of America 's biggest banks .
Though she and I are there to see her husband , pro wrestling star John Layfield ( " JBL " ) , the evening 's most compelling match turns out to be not Layfield 's but a brutal - looking showdown between rivals Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels .
Midway through the bout , Michaels appears to suffer a bloody cut near his eye and begins stumbling around the ring as if he 's just been lobotomized .
I 'm more bemused than worried - every match thus far has ended with the vanquished looking broken and semiconscious .
Whitney , however , is shielding her eyes .
Maybe it 's because her husband once sustained a cracked vertebrae during a match , but she 's absolutely convinced that this time around , the semichoreographed mayhem in the WWE ring has taken a sickeningly painful turn .
" No , I 'm telling you , it 's real , " Whitney says of Michaels 's injuries , which included ( or so Jericho would claim ) a detached retina .
Or maybe not : " He 's fine , " WWE vice president Gary Davis would later tell me .
Good thing for investors that Whitney takes a more skeptical approach to banks than to pro wrestling .
In less than a year she has transformed herself from a Wall Street backbencher - someone once known less for her research than for her marriage to Layfield and her stint as a stock commentator on Fox News - into the most influential stock analyst in America .
And certainly the most bearish .
Whitney 's rise to prominence began last October when she dropped jaws from New York to London with her audacious ( yet spot on ) prediction that Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) would be forced to cut its dividend to prop up its leaky balance sheet .
She followed that call with forecasts of more losses and write - downs at the likes of Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) , and UBS , as well as some insightful tangents on how the implosion of the bond insurers would threaten banks ' bottom lines .
Sometimes she seems steps ahead of management .
On a Merrill Lynch conference call in mid-July , she asked CEO John
Thain why the company was n't unloading damaged assets and boosting capital .
Thain demurred , but less than two weeks later , Merrill ( MER , Fortune 500 ) did just that .
It agreed to sell more than $ 30 billion of CDOs ( collateralized debt obligations ) for 22 cents on the dollar and sold stock to raise $ 8.5 billion in fresh capital .
Whereas her peers keep searching for some sort of light at the end of the tunnel , Whitney thinks the tunnel is about to collapse .
Bank stock investors will get crushed if they jump back in now , she contends , because the banks are facing much , much bigger credit losses than what they 've reported so far .
Moreover , Whitney is convinced that the economy is about to sink into an " early 1980s - style " recession that will devastate the 10 % of the population that became overextended during the housing boom .
" It feels like I 'm at the epicenter of the biggest financial crisis in history , " says Whitney .
This is n't ego talking .
" She definitely moves markets , " says Gus Scacco , an institutional fund manager for AG Asset Management .
An executive with a top hedge fund goes so far as to compare Whitney 's influence to that of former Goldman Sachs chief strategist Abby Joseph Cohen in the late 1990s .
" It 's gotten to the point , " the executive says , " where Meredith ca n't opine or write anymore without moving stocks . "
Whitney 's insights have n't always translated into lucrative investment picks .
Based on the performance of her buy and sell recommendations relative to her industry peer group - what analyst tracker Starmine refers to as an analyst's " industry excess return " - Whitney 's stock picking ranked 1,205th out of 1,919 equity analysts last year and 919th out of 1,917 through the first half of 2008 .
That said , evaluating Whitney solely on the timing of her buys and sells misses the point .
It 's not just that she 's bearish on the entire banking industry .
What makes
Whitney so interesting is the brutality of her arguments and the evidence she summons in making them .
Whitney warned last year - and continues to warn today - that the " incestuous " relationship between the banks and the credit - rating agencies during the real estate bubble will have a long - lasting impact on banks ' ability to recover .
With Moody's and Standard & Poor 's now trying to make up for past wrongs , the pace of downgrades on mortgage securities shows no sign of slowing :
There were $ 85 billion in mortgage securities downgraded in the third quarter of 2007 , $ 237 billion in the fourth quarter , $ 739 billion in the first quarter of this year , and $ 841 billion in the second quarter of 2008 .
This is a problem , because every time their portfolios are hit by significant credit downgrades , banks are forced to improve their capital ratios .
Often that means issuing reams of new stock , which leads to serious dilution , something shareholders at Citi , Merrill Lynch , and Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) can unhappily attest to .
" You 're going to have this stealth pressure on bank balance sheets until you start to see the ratio of downgrades to upgrades change , " says Whitney .
" It 's something people do n't talk about . "
Obviously the financial companies she covers are n't thrilled with all the dire talk .
Whitney got an earful from Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) , she says , when she downgraded the stock to " underperform " in July .
Investors are n't always thrilled either .
She says she 's received one death threat and hundreds of abusive e-mails and phone calls .
But at least now there 's a grudging respect for her work .
" What do you do when your biggest tormentor keeps being right ? " one ex-Citigroup executive asks when queried about Whitney .
" You got to give it to her - she figured it out . "
There is no clear - cut answer yet on whether being upbeat can keep you healthy or cure anything .
But there is evidence suggesting a connection .
You might call Maarten van der Weijden the anti-Lance Armstrong .
Last week , the Dutch Olympic long - distance swimming champion and cancer survivor told the British newspaper The Telegraph that he did n't want to be compared to the American cycling star .
" Armstrong says that positive thinking and doing a lot of sports can save you .
I do n't agree , " said van der Weijden .
" I even think it 's dangerous because it implies that if you are not a positive thinker all the time you lose ...
The doctors saved me .
I am just lucky . "
Van der Weijden 's comments cut to the heart of an ongoing debate in the medical community .
Can patients really improve their chances of survival by staying upbeat and happy ?
Experts say the American public has largely accepted this as fact .
But , scientifically speaking , questions remain regarding whether this works , how it would work , and what such a connection would mean for patients who do n't get better .
Appeal and promise
There certainly is an appeal to believing that you have some level of control over a debilitating illness .
" I think it 's part of the American spirit , " said James Coyne , director of the behavioral oncology program at the Abramson Cancer Center and professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
" There 's this idea that you can succeed and conquer anything , even illness , on the basis of your character . "
And studies showing a possible connection between positive thinking and health are frequently in the news .
For instance , work by researchers at Ben-Gurion University in Israel suggested that women who 've faced several life challenges , such as a death in the family or divorce , are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than peers who 've had more stable , happy lives .
The results were detailed in the Aug. 21 issue of the journal BMC Cancer .
The same study also found that women with cancer were more likely to report that , prior to diagnosis , they had been anxious or depressed and that bad things had happened in their lives .
Ronit Peled , one of the Ben- Gurion University researchers , said this was evidence for a relationship between emotional well - being and the risk of contracting cancer .
" The main message from my point of view is that young women who have severe life events at a young age should be considered a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly , " she said .
" But general feelings of happiness and optimism in one 's life can play a protective role . "
Coyne said the public often takes news like this to mean that positive thinking has been unequivocally proven to be good for your health .
But the truth is a little more complicated .
How do you feel ?
In reality , there is no clear - cut answer yet on whether being upbeat can keep you healthy or cure anything , Peled and Coyne both said .
Research on the subject is divided between studies like Peled 's and studies like the one Coyne did , detailed in December 2007 in the journal Cancer , which found that emotional well - being was n't an accurate predictor of whether or not patients with neck and head cancer survived .
Coyne is particularly skeptical of positive thinking 's power over cancer .
" The problem with cancer is that it 's so complex .
By the time you 're diagnosed it may have been building for decades , " he said .
For other diseases , though , the scientific outlook is sunnier .
Coyne said there 's evidence that mood can predict whether someone who has had one heart attack will have another .
And he said there is a biological explanation for why this might be possible .
Little research has been done on the biological basis of positive thinking as a therapeutic treatment for illness , but Coyne said scientists know the brain and the immune system communicate .
Given that scientists also know the immune system plays a role in inflammation of the arteries , which can play a role in heart attack , it 's reasonable to think that heart attacks could be tied back to things going on in the brain .
Good , bad
However , when Coyne and other researchers tried to intercede and treat depression among heart attack patients , they found the patient 's moods improved , but the rates of second heart attack did n't .
Ironically , Coyne said , the most evidence for emotion affecting health actually favors negative emotions , not positive ones .
For instance , he said , we know anger and depression are correlated with having a second heart attack , however , what 's unproven is whether being positive can reduce the risk .
Another way emotion could affect health , even for complicated illnesses such as cancer , is by affecting the patient 's willingness to stick to the treatment plan .
" It could be an indirect effect , " said Anne Harrington , chair of Harvard University 's history of science program and author of " The Cure Within : A History of Mind - Body Medicine " ( W.W. Norton , 2008 ) .
" If a person is positive , he or she is more likely to show up for all the treatments to have a better diet to exercise .
And if you 're deeply depressed you sleep badly and that 's bad for your health . "
But Harrington and Coyne echoed the concerns of Maarten van der Weijden , saying that findings about emotions and health should n't be used to pressure patients into feeling a certain way .
In fact , Harrington said , that could hurt the patient more than if they 'd been left alone .
" Misinterpretations of this research can make people afraid to have the feelings they have , " she said .
" I have a colleague who 's studied this and it's very clear from his work that it 's just as stressful to keep up a performance of positivity as it is to [ keep up ] a bad mood .
It 's very stressful to be inauthentically upbeat all the time . "

I 'm the first to admit a deep fascination in seeing a man cum , and boy could some of these men cum , but part of that fascination is seeing the build up to their orgasm , not just the mechanical spurting .
Personally I like to see it when they know they 've just reached the point of no return and the way it makes them tense up in preparation for the first spurt , or the effect it has on them when a hand suddenly cups their balls .
If there is more than female present , the way that they both ( or all ) know he is going to orgasm and gather round to watch .
So , to my mind , if this film cut down on the number of pumpings and allowed just a little more time to be devoted to his few seconds of pure pleasure as he approached the inevitable , it would have been a lot more horny .
For me , anyways ....

There ’s a lot of chattering going on about this recent discovery of Bigfoot , especially due to the promises about the upcoming “ DNA evidence and photo evidence ” releases , expected later today .
The announcement was made by the Web site SearchingForBigfoot.com , which actually claims to have a real specimen .
According to researchers Mathew Whitton , Tom Biscardi and Rick Dyer , the creature is 7 feet and 7 inches tall , weights close to 500 pounds and presents features from both human and ape .
Also , other details are offered on the Web site : the Bigfoot has reddish hair , black - gray eyes and its footprint measures almost 27 inches long and almost 6 inches across .
I believe this will be another hoax because the same person Mr. Tom Biscardi has been linked to other hoaxes .
Will soon find out today during a news conference later today .
What if this is the real deal ?
Are there other Bigfoot ’s ?
This could be specie that we may uncover as being of greater population than we expected .
We the people ... The Constitution of The United States of America spells out in the first line where the power of our great democracy lies .
Unfortunately we the people have allowed the power to slip away to special interest , lobbyist , corporations and career politicians .
It is time to reclaim our democracy from the people that are destroying it .
Thomas Jefferson said that " All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent " - now is the time for all people to be heard .
The framers of our democracy did not intend our representatives be career politicians .
They foresaw the danger in this .
The constitution states that " The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year . " -
The framers intent was for our democracy to be governed by everyday people not career politicians for obvious reasons .
Legislators would meet enact laws and go back to their chosen profession .
Career politicians will do and say anything to keep their power .
Power corrupts even those with the best intentions .
Individually we find that we are powerless against corporate media or Big Oil or Washington .
Our choices are limited .
Our effectiveness diminished .
This is not by accident .
Unions , social gatherings , clubs that all flourished before the 1960s have all been destroyed by those who find you & me to be a threat .
Without direct action , republican democracy is truly disempowering : our only means of influence are to beg the Very Serious And Important Intermediary - the congressman , the governor , the president , etc. - to do something on our behalf .
We all know how well that has worked out .
Today people will tell you that protests are ineffective .
And they are .
But real change does not come from the ballot box .
Great social change like the eight hour work day , child labor laws , a woman 's right to vote , civil rights , etc. , etc. all came about through blood & sweat & great effort .
The Establishment wants us to focus all of our energy on elections because elections are the controlled space whereby popular ferment can be contained by rules , regulations , etc .
But there are many different methods of direct action - ie .
taking matters into our own hands - that can wield a tremendous amount of power .
The only effective action left to take now in order to stop the gears and levers of this lemming - like perpetual motion machine of destruction is --- to do nothing .
That 's right , nothing .
To go on strike .
It is one thing to endure abuses and to carry on in spite of them .
It is quite another thing to carry on to the point of abetting the abuse .
We need to move the discussion of our nation 's health to the emergency room .
We need to tell the doctors of the body politic that the treatment is n't working - and that until it changes radically for the better , neither are we .
It does not matter if we vote Democrat , Republican or Independent .
We have seen Congress change power 3 times since 2000 .
Each time we were promised that the ways of old were over .
We were told that the new party in power would return the power to the people and get rid of the status quo in Washington DC .
We were promised solutions to the health care crisis , social security crisis , taxation , inflation and the deficit .
In fact these were the same problems we spoke about in the 1960's .
They are still not fixed .
WHY ?
Because the special interest , lobbyist and corporations have a strangle hold on our career politicians .
The special interest , lobbyist , and corporations do not care which party is in power because there are enough career politicians in both parties willing to take their money and perks to look the other way .
Taking the day off , not buying anything .
That part is easy .
What 's the hard part ?
Spreading the word , getting the message out , reminding The People that they have the power to shut it down .
Yet what you need is not marches , demonstrations , rallies or wide associations ; all of them are important .
What you need is direct action .
The sooner people understand that , the sooner we 'll begin to change things .
-- Arthur Scargill
General strikes shut down the normal operations of a city , state , or nation for a period of time .
These strikes aim to force action on a single issue or broader set of concerns .
The strike targets key issues facing the American public , issues that have not been addressed in any meaningful way by any branch of government .
Unions , corporations , & the major parties have failed to deal with pressing matters of war & peace , income inequality , crime & punishment & the meaning of citizenship itself , it has fallen to the American people to set things right !
Public protest is an important part of democracy , just like a free press , a judiciary , and congress .
A general strike does NOT have to be violent .
It is a matter of CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE , NOT VIOLENCE .
You are NOT going to school .
You are NOT going to WORK .
You are NOT shopping .
You do NOT have to be violent to NOT do those things .
March legally .
Protest legally .
Our causes are many but it 's time to make our voices as one .
The CIA issues an official denial of the allegations in Ron Suskind ’s new book that the White House ordered then - Director George Tenet to forge documents intended to link al Qaeda to Saddam Hussein : “ To assert , as Suskind does , that the White House would request such a document , and that the Agency would accept such a task , says something about him and nothing about us . ”
The blast was so strong it injured five outside the mine Most of the miners trapped after a gas explosion at a pit in Ukraine have been found alive , officials say .
A total of 24 miners have now been brought to the surface and are being treated in hospital for burns and for other injuries .
However , another 12 are believed to be still trapped underground amid fears that the mine , in the eastern Donetsk region , may soon be flooded .
One miner was found dead at a depth of 750 m ( 2,460 feet ) .
Explosions are frequent in Ukraine 's mines .
Three blasts in the region late last year killed more than 100 men .
Safety work The Karl Marx mine in Yenakiyevo , 60 km ( 37 miles ) north - east of the regional capital Donetsk , had officially been closed because of safety fears .
The miners were carrying out safety improvements when the latest explosion occurred on Sunday , 1,000 m below the surface of the 110 - year - old mine .

The first two survivors and the victim were found at 750 m more than 24 hours after the accident .
The other 34 miners were much deeper , about 1,000 m down .
Rescuers had to negotiate a narrow shaft and the work was drawn out .
The blast had been so powerful that five people outside the mine were injured , leading some to fear there would be few , if any , survivors .
But First Deputy Prime Minister Olexander Turchinov , the most senior government official at the site , urged caution on the remaining rescue work , saying that water could flood the mine at any time .
Families of the missing men were gathered outside the complex , awaiting news .
Accidents are common in Ukraine 's creaking mine network .
Work was suspended at 20 mines in the region following an explosion on 23 May that killed 11 people .

What are these ?
by
So , first to be clear about some things :
First : Lists :
What I mean is the popular - offer / subject - line - grabber technique of 100 Best Ways to “ X ” or 10 Reasons You Should n’t “ X . ”
Second : George Carlin .
If you do n’t know him , read about him on Wikipedia .
Third : Offers can be blog posts , article headlines , whitepaper headlines , Webinar topics , email subject lines and so on .
So , I am listening to the radio , and the host is talking about George Carlin , who passed away this year due to heart failure .
Here is how he described Carlin : “ George Carlin is known primarily for his ‘ seven dirty words act ’ … ” The “ seven dirty words act ” is of course George Carlin ’s “ Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television . ”
OK , so do the math .
This dude did stand - up comedy and movies for 40 to 50 years .
He was known as being funnier than hell .
At the end of the day , Carlin will always be remembered by the ultimate list headline : “ Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television . ”
The seven words take one minute to list , and the monologue was one act in an entire career .
Yet it is what everyone turns to when they describe Carlin ’s career .
George Carlin proves one thing :
You cannot stop the use of lists for marketing success .
You can only hope to contain it .
Ironically , as I was thinking about this offer , I figured that I should do some research on it , and , lucky me , some of my favorite bloggers have some great posts on the subject :
One thing is true :
With the blogosphere and the multitude of people trying to capture eyeballs , the list technique has never been more prevalent .
But the bottom line is that it still works .
Then there ’s this comment from MacStansbury in the “ 7 Reasons ” article :
“ It ’s getting so bad with the lists , I ’m almost to the point I do n’t want to read a post if there ’s a list .
Of course , I ’m still writing posts like that , because it works ! ”
Why does it work for approaching B2B buyers ?
B2B buyers have no time and want their information from people whom they trust or that they believe are thought leaders .
The list approach conveys the following to a B2B buyer :
Easy to Read :
The list format gives a feeling that your offer will be “ to the point ” and can be consumed quickly and easily .
Authority and Thought Leadership : Making a list is authoritative and definitive .
The most important factor is that the list technique still works , and B2B marketers should take notice .
Also take notice that if you have n’t been doing it , everyone else has , so you have to still be creative and think outside the box on how you present a list .
George Carlin would be proud .

OTTAWA , June 18 ( Reuters ) - The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Wednesday it would cut the use of electronic stun guns made by U.S. - based Taser International Inc. TASR.O .
The Mounties made the announcement shortly after the federal force ’s watchdog issued a stinging report which slammed police for using Tasers -- also known as conducted energy weapons ( CEW ) -- too often .
The watchdog recommended that Tasers only be used on suspects who posed a serious threat .
“ We will act on the recommendations as quickly as possible to provide clearer direction to our members , to further restrict situations in which the CEW can be deployed , and to develop and implement measures to enhance accountability , ” the RCMP said in a statement .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
The sponsor of a proposal to rein in aggressive celebrity photographers is meeting resistance from Los Angeles ' top cop , who says the law is not needed when celebrities just behave .
Photographers swarm a car carrying Britney Spears after a Los Angeles court appearance in October 2007 .
City Councilman Dennis
Zine wants to require photographers to stay a safe distance from celebrities .
His proposed ordinance is nicknamed the " Britney Law " for the hordes of paparazzi that swarm around pop star Britney Spears , sometimes costing the city thousands of dollars for escorts and other enforcement .
" They act like a pack of wolves stalking their prey , creating havoc in the streets , and are nuisances to innocent bystanders , " Zine said at a task force hearing he convened Thursday .
Watch how paparazzi spy on Hollywood stars »
The proposal gained exposure last month when officials from around Southern California asked former independent counsel Kenneth Starr -- whose investigation of former President Clinton spawned its own share of tabloid headlines -- to help craft a law that would protect celebrities without infringing on freedom of the press .
iReport.com : Share your celeb stories and photos
Critics of the plan include Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton , who argues that it would be difficult to enforce .
He also says existing laws can keep unruly packs of photographers in check .
The chief said the city 's tabloid darlings could help by providing photographers less to work with .
" If celebrities behave themselves , that solves about 90 percent of the problem , " Bratton said .
" Britney , the last couple of days , has started wearing clothes again .
The paparazzi are leaving town because she 's not as interesting when she 's not running around without her underwear on . "
He said actress Lindsay Lohan " evidently found a new love life , so she 's probably in New York hanging out " and that " God knows " where billionaire heiress Paris Hilton had been .
" She 's thankfully disappeared from the scene , " Bratton said .
At the hearing , members of the paparazzi also said the law would be impossible to enforce .
" Unless every celebrity has a chaperone of a police officer with a 6 - foot tape measure , how are you going to enforce it ? " said photographer Nick Stern .
Those attending included musician John Mayer , actor Eric Roberts , sheriff 's officials , representatives of the Screen Actors Guild and officials from West Hollywood , Beverly Hills and Malibu .
CNN 's Kareen Wynter contributed to this report .

How does Washington plan to resolve our energy problems and control atmospheric temperatures ?
Well , how do they fix anything ?
By proposing a gargantuan boondoggle .
A “ cap and trade ” bill , one that will supposedly cut 66 percent of our emissions by 2050 , is being debated in Congress this week .
To begin with , proponents of America ’s Climate Security
Act have been misleading the public by claiming that cap and trade is a “ market - based ” solution .
In truth , cap and trade does to the market what “ American Idol ” does to music .
The idea sounds harmless : government caps emissions , and corporations trade the allotted credits among themselves .
Some of the credits will be auctioned off by government .
The Wall Street Journal estimates these auctions will net $ 6.7 trillion for government coffers by 2050 .
And those de facto taxes will not be paid by disreputable energy CEOs and their greasy lobbyist henchmen .
They will be paid by you .
Environmental special interest groups — willing to do absolutely anything for the environment with your money — will be lining up at the trough to gobble up billions of dollars in pork offered by the Joe Lieberman - and John Warner - sponsored legislation .
One bill has around $ 190 billion allocated to training for “ green - collar jobs ” to replace those obnoxious people who produce energy you can actually afford .
More than $ 500 billion is earmarked for “ wildlife adaptation . ”
Another $ 342 billion would be spent on international aid — because Lord knows we do n’t need it here — and billions more for mass transit , nuclear plants , kickbacks to Indian tribes and corporations , assistance to those having trouble paying energy bills ( wonder why ? ) and other knickknacks .
OK , so despite the enormous costs , we ’re positive the cap and trade will work , right ?
The European Union has a cap and trade scheme in place .
It ’s generally regarded as a complete failure .
The price of credits has plummeted , and countries were unsuccessful in meeting the emissions cap set by the Kyoto Protocol .
So , naturally , proponents refer to the EU cap and trade scheme as a “ test run ” or a program only in its delicate “ infancy . ”
It just was n’t executed properly .
If smarter folks like Warner and Barbara Boxer could get hold of this hyper - complex initiative , boy , we ’re bound to see results .
The Kyoto agreement , incidentally , aspires to slash 175 millions tons of COb by 2012 , which , according to professor Roger Pielke of the University of Colorado , would save six and a half days of carbon emission in total .
If delaying six days has been so difficult in Europe , what kind of economic toll would a 66 percent cut have on our economy ?
( The Bush administration has released a study offering a rosier picture .
But since when do we care what it has to say , right ? )
Naturally , numerous senators have employed the end - of - world scenario of catastrophic global warming . . .
I mean climate change . . . to sell the cap and trade .
But of course , few mention a recent study by the U.N. ’s World Meteorological Organization — the organization behind the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — explaining there has been no warming the past decade .
Scientists explain there could be numerous causes for this temporary slowdown .
It ’s all very complicated .
What the layman can easily comprehend , however , is that climate is unpredictable , difficult to accurately model and impossible to control .
What we also know is that both John McCain and Barack Obama support some cap and trade scheme .
Fossil fuels — which provide 85 percent of our energy — are so yesterday , these guys will legislate it away by 2050 whether a viable replacement exists or not .
Years ago , we might have referred to the rationing of energy credits and massive social engineering as “ socialism . ”
Now we just call it bipartisan consensus .

Advertisement A UK - built solar - powered plane has set an unofficial world endurance record for a flight by an unmanned aircraft .
The Zephyr - 6 , as it is known , stayed aloft for more than three days , running through the night on batteries it had recharged in sunlight .
The flight was a demonstration for the US military , which is looking for new types of technology to support its troops on the ground .
Craft like Zephyr might make ideal platforms for reconnaissance .
They could also be used to relay battlefield communications .
Chris Kelleher , from UK defence and research firm QinetiQ , said Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) offer advantages over traditional aircraft and even satellites .
" The principal advantage is persistence - that you would be there all the time , " he told BBC News .
" A satellite goes over the same part of the Earth twice a day - and one of those is at night - so it 's only really getting a snapshot of activity .
Zephyr would be watching all day . "
Deployment close
The latest flight was conducted at the US Army 's Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona .
The Zephyr flew non -stop for 82 hours , 37 minutes .
That time beats the current official world record for unmanned flight set by the US robot plane Global Hawk - of 30 hours , 24 minutes - and even Zephyr 's own previous best of 54 hours achieved last year .
However , the Yuma mark remains " unofficial " because QinetiQ did not involve the FAI ( Federation Aeronautique Internationale ) , the world air sports federation , which sanctions all record attempts .
The US Department of Defense funded the demonstration flight under its Joint Capability Technology Demonstration ( JCTD ) programme .
This programme is designed to advance the technologies American commanders would most like to see in the field .
" We think Zephyr is very close to an operational system - within the next two years is what we 're aiming for , " Mr Kelleher said .
" We have one more step of improvements ; we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months ; and we want to push the performance . "
Energy density
The trial , which took place between 28 and 31 July , also included the participation of the UK Ministry of Defence .
The 30kg Zephyr was guided by remote control to an operating altitude in excess of 18 km ( 60,000 ft ) , and then flown on autopilot and via satellite communication .
It tested a communications payload weighing approximately 2kg .
Zephyr should be in commanders ' hands within two years
At first sight , the propeller - driven Zephyr looks to be just another model aircraft , and it is even launched by hand .
But this " pilotless " vehicle with its 18 - metre wingspan incorporates world - leading technologies .
Its structure uses ultra- lightweight carbon - fibre material ; and the plane flies on solar power generated by amorphous silicon solar arrays no thicker than sheets of paper .
These are glued over the aircraft 's wings .
To get through the night , the propellers are powered from lithium - sulphur batteries which are topped up during the day .
" A lot of effort has gone into power storage and light - weighting the systems , " explained Mr Kelleher .
" Lithium sulphur is more than double the energy density of the best alternative technology which is lithium polymer batteries .
" They are an exceptional performer .
We 've worked with the Sion Corporation .
They 've had them in development for years .
We 're actually the first application in the world for them . "
Vulture venture Zephyr has demonstrated that it can cope with extremes of temperature - from the blistering 45 C heat found at ground level in Arizona 's Sonoran Desert , to the minus 70 C chill experienced at altitudes of more than 18 km ( 60,000ft ) .
The engineers from the Farnborough - based company are now collaborating with the American aerospace giant Boeing on a defence project codenamed Vulture .
This would see the biggest plane in history take to the sky , powered by the sun and capable of carrying a 450 - kilo ( 1,000 lb ) payload .
US commanders say the design must be able to maintain its position over a particular spot on the Earth 's surface uninterrupted for five years .
QinetiQ is also developing UAV technology for civilian uses .
It has been working recently with Aberystwyth University on field monitoring trials , plotting areas of ground that may or may not need fertiliser applications .
Lightweight plane ( 30-34kg/70lb ) is launched by hand Coms or surveillance payload of about 2kg ( 4.5 lb )
Flies autonomously and can climb to more than 18 km ( 60,000 ft )

What are these ?
And so one day a few weeks ago , I found myself being slid inside an MRI at UCLA , with headphones over my ears and video goggles over my eyes .
I quickly realized that Joshua Freedman and his team had chosen stimuli that matched my preoccupations .
One of the first video images they showed me was Jimmy Carter speaking in defense of his decision to meet with Hamas leaders .
Then there was President Bush talking about oil , and Hillary Clinton talking about health care , which caused me to realize that if you have n’t lain supine in a claustrophobia - inducing magnetized tunnel while watching Hillary Clinton talk about health care one inch from your eyeballs , well , you just have n’t lived .
The Clinton video was followed by scenes from The Wire and The Sopranos .
Kind of like a palate cleanser .
Then came a series of photographs : John McCain , Edie Falco , Golda Meir , Barack Obama , and David Ben-Gurion .
One sequence consisted of Osama bin Laden , Daniel Pearl , my 7 - year - old son , and my wife .
Then another sequence : Obama , Hillary , Yasir Arafat , Bruce Springsteen , a poster for Fiddler on the Roof , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , George W. Bush , Bob Dylan , me , David Bradley ( the man who owns this magazine ) , and Ronald Reagan .
I spent an hour inside the MRI and emerged irritated , with a clanging headache .
“ You have a good - looking brain ! ” Iacoboni said , smiling .
For some reason , the news that my brain did not contain any tumors , Pat Buchanan–shaped or otherwise , failed to improve my mood .
I was worried , of course , about my reactions to several of the stimuli .
I asked Freedman what would happen if the photograph of David Bradley activated my insula , the region of the brain associated with revulsion .
“ We ’ll reinterpret the findings , ” he said .
OK , but what if the sight of Golda Meir provoked feelings of sexual arousal ?
What if the sight of David Ben-Gurion provoked feelings of sexual arousal ?
What if it turned out that I actually feel disgust at the sight of Bruce Springsteen ?
To think of all the money I ’ve wasted on concert tickets and T - shirts .
Most worrisome , of course , was the matter of my wife .
Inappropriate activations could have lasting consequences .
The preliminary findings began to arrive a few days later , in a series of e-mails from Iacoboni .
“ Carter : big amygdala response on both sides !
Jeff , do you fear this guy ? ”
The Sopranos video sequence , he said , activated a “ nice response in the fusiform face area , a visual area processing faces , but an especially big ventral striatum response , which is a brain area that gets active for rewarding stimuli .
We now know you really like The Sopranos . ”
I did n’t need a million - dollar machine to tell me that .
But it turns out that my ventral striatum likes The Wire even more .
Iacoboni and Freedman saw intense movement in my extrastriate visual areas and among my mirror neurons .
When we spoke later , Iacoboni explained that the mirror - neuron activity suggests that I “ identify with the characters to such a degree ” that I ’m “ almost pretending to do the things they ’re doing on the screen , being a homicide detective .
When people watch a movie they love , they ’re truly living the things taking place on the screen through their mirror neurons . ”
Then it was on to the question about my political leanings .
Film of Obama , Iacoboni said , showed some mirroring , which suggests empathy , and a small amount of activity in the medial orbito - frontal cortex , which is a source of positive emotion .
My brain likes Obama , apparently .
My reaction to Bush could not be measured , because I fidgeted each time he appeared on screen .
“ You ca n’t lie still when you see Bush , ” Iacoboni said .
I stayed still for McCain , who stimulated “ big mirroring , ” indicating empathy , and some amount of ventral - striatum activity , an overall positive response .
Images of Hillary stimulated activity in the dorso - lateral prefrontal cortex , which is a region of the brain involved in cognitive control .
“ You may be trying to suppress unwanted emotions , ” he said .
What those emotions are , he could n’t say .
“ There ’s a lot of conflict in your mind about Hillary . ”
And my reaction to David Bradley , the man who signs my paychecks ?
“ You activated a fronto - parietal network in the right cerebral hemisphere that has been implicated in self - recognition in many experiments , ” Iacoboni said .
With the Large Hadron Collider almost ready to turn on , it 's time to prepare ourselves for what it might find .
( The real experts , of course , have been preparing themselves for this for many years ! )
Chad Orzel was asked what we should expect from the LHC , and I thought it would be fun to give my own take .
So here are my judgments for the likelihoods that we will discover various different things at the LHC -- to be more precise , let 's say " the chance that , five years after the first physics data are taken , most particle physicists will agree that the LHC has discovered this particular thing . "
( Percentages do not add up to 100 % , as they are in no way exclusive ; there 's nothing wrong with discovering both supersymmetry and the Higgs boson . )
I 'm pretty sure that I 've never proposed a new theory that could be directly tested at the LHC , so I can be completely unbiased , as there 's no way that this experiment is winning any Nobels for me .
On the other hand , honest particle phenomenologists might be aware of pro- or con- arguments for various of these scenarios that I 'm not familiar with , so feel free to chime in in the comments .
( Other predictions are easy enough to come by , but none with our trademark penchant for unrealistically precise quantification . )
The Higgs Boson : 95 % .
The Higgs is the only particle in the Standard Model of Particle Physics which has n't yet been detected , so it 's certainly a prime target for the LHC ( if the Tevatron does n't sneak in and find it first ) .
And it 's a boson , which improves CERN 's chances .
There is almost a guarantee that the Higgs exists , or at least some sort of Higgs - like particle that plays that role ; there is an electroweak symmetry , and it is broken by something , and that something should be associated with particle - like excitations .
But there 's not really a guarantee that the LHC will find it .
It should find it , at least in the simplest models ; but the simplest models are n't always right .
If the LHC does n't find the Higgs in five years , it will place very strong constraints on model building , but I doubt that it will be too hard to come up with models that are still consistent .
( The Superconducting Super Collider , on the other hand , almost certainly would have found the Higgs by now . )
Supersymmetry : 60 % .
Of all the proposals for physics beyond the Standard Model , supersymmetry is the most popular , and the most likely to show up at the LHC .
But that does n't make it really likely .
We 've been theorizing about SUSY for so long that a lot of people tend to act like it 's already been discovered -- but it has n't .
On the contrary , the allowed parameter space has been considerably whittled down by a variety of experiments .
String theory predicts SUSY , but from that point of view there 's no reason why it should n't be hidden up at the Planck scale , which is 10 ^ 15 times higher in energy than what the LHC will reach .
On the other hand , SUSY can help explain why the Higgs scale is so much lower than the Planck scale -- the hierarchy problem -- if and only if it is broken at a low enough scale to be detectable at the LHC .
But there are no guarantees , so I 'm remaining cautious .
Large Extra Dimensions : 1 % . The idea of extra dimensions of space was re-invigorated in the 1990's by the discovery by Arkani- Hamed , Dimopolous and Dvali that hidden dimensions could be as large as a millimeter across , if the ordinary particles we know and love were confined to a three - dimensional brane .
It 's a fantastic idea , with definite experimental consequences : for one thing , you could be making gravitons at the LHC , which would escape into the extra dimensions .
But it 's a long shot ; the models are already quite constrained , and seem to require a good amount of fine - tuning to hold together .
Warped Extra Dimensions : 10 % .
Soon after branes became popular , Randall and Sundrum put a crucial new spin on the idea : by letting the extra dimensions have a substantial spatial curvature , you could actually explain fine - tunings rather than simply converting them into different fine - tunings .
This model has intriguing connections with string theory , and its own set of experimental predictions ( one of the world 's experts is a co-blogger ) .
I would not be terribly surprised if some version of the Randall - Sundrum proposal turned out to be relevant at the LHC .
Black Holes : 0.1 % .
One of the intriguing aspect of brane - world models is that gravity can become strong well below the Planck scale -- even at LHC energies .
Which means that if you collide particles together in just the right way , you could make a black hole !
Sadly , " just the right way " seems to be asking for a lot -- it seems unlikely that black holes will be produced , even if gravity does become strong .
( And if you do produce them , they will quickly evaporate away . )
Fortunately , the relevant models make plenty of other predictions ; the black - hole business was always an amusing sidelight , never the best way to test any particular theory .
Stable Black Holes That Eat Up the Earth , Destroying All Living Organisms in the Process : 10 ^ - 25 % .
So you 're saying there 's a chance ?
Evidence for or against String Theory : 0.5 % .
Our current understanding of string theory does n't tell us which LHC - accessible models are or are not compatible with the theory ; it may very well be true that they all are .
But sometimes a surprising experimental result will put theorists on the right track , so who knows ?
Dark Matter : 15 % .
A remarkable feature of dark matter is that you can relate the strength of its interactions to the abundance it has today -- and to get the right abundance , the interaction strength should be right there at the electroweak scale , where the LHC will be looking .
( At least , if the dark matter is thermally produced , and a dozen other caveats . )
But even if it 's there , it might not be easy to find -- by construction , the dark matter is electrically neutral and does n't interact very much .
So we have a chance , but it will be difficult to say for sure that we 've discovered dark matter at the LHC even if the accelerator produces it .
Dark Energy : 0.1 % .
In contrast to dark matter , none of the energy scales characteristic of dark energy have anything to do with the LHC .
There 's no reason to expect that we will learn anything about it .
But again , maybe that 's because we have n't hit upon the right model .
It 's certainly possible that we will learn something about fundamental physics ( e.g. supersymmetry or extra dimensions ) that eventually leads to a breakthrough in our understanding of dark energy .
Strong Dynamics : 5 % . Quantum Chromodynamics ( QCD ) , the theory that explains the strong nuclear force as arising from strongly - interacting gluons coupled to quarks , is a crucial part of the Standard Model .
An underappreciated feature of QCD is that the dynamics of quarks breaks the electroweak symmetry even without the Higgs boson -- unfortunately , the numbers do n't work out for it to be the primary mechanism .
However , an interesting alternative to the standard idea of a Higgs boson is to imagine a new " QCD - like " force that operates at even higher energies ; one venerable idea along these lines is known as technicolor .
For a long time now technicolor theories have been struggling to remain compatible with various experimental bounds ; but theorists are clever , and they keep coming up with new ideas .
I would n't be completely surprised if a new strongly - interacting force was discovered at the LHC , although it 's a bit of a long shot .
New Massive Gauge Bosons : 2 % . Another Standard - Model - like thing that could show up is a massive gauge boson from a spontaneously broken symmetry ( or more than one ) , similar to the W and Z bosons of the weak interactions -- you will hear about searches for Z - prime bosons or W - prime bosons .
As far as I know they do n't solve any pressing problems , but lots of things in the universe do n't solve any problems , and nevertheless exist .
New Quarks or Leptons : 2 % . The final Standard - Model - like thing we could find is a new " generation " of fermions ( matter particles ) -- strongly - interacting quarks and non-strongly - interacting leptons .
We do n't expect to , for the following indirect reason : each generation includes a neutrino , and neutrinos tend to be fairly light , and the existence of new light fermions is strongly constrained both by particle physics experiments and by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis .
( If there are more light particles , the energy density of the universe is just a bit larger at any fixed temperature , and the universe therefore expands faster , and you therefore make a bit [ strike ] less [ / strike ] more Helium .
[ Should n't post late at night -- see below . ] )
Preons : 1 % . Historically , when we smash particles together at high energies , we find out that they were made of even smaller particles .
The possibility that quarks and leptons are made of smaller constituents -- preons -- has certainly been taken very seriously , although none of the models has really caught on .
Mysterious Missing Energy : 15 % .
Particles that are long - lived , neutral , and weakly interacting -- including dark matter particles and gravitons -- can only be found indirectly at a collider like the LHC .
You are smashing things together , and if the total energy of the resulting particles you detect is less than that of the initial particles you smashed , you know that some invisible particles must have escaped as " missing energy . "
But what ?
If you have a specific theory , you can match carefully to the expected dependence on the initial energy , the angle of scattering , and so forth .
But if you do n't ... it will be hard to figure out what is going on .
Baryon - Number Violation : 0.2 % .
As Mark is explaining , there are more baryons than anti-baryons in the universe , and most of us think that the asymmetry must have been dynamically generated somehow .
Therefore , some process must be able to change the number of baryons -- but we 've never observed such a process .
And we probably wo n't ; in most models , violation of baryon number is far too rare to be visible at the LHC .
But there is certainly no consensus about how baryogenesis happened , so we should keep an eye out .
Magnetic Monopoles , Strangelets , Q - Balls , Solitons : 1 % .
These are n't really new particles , but composite objects of one form or another .
Even if they exist in nature , the violent inner chambers of a particle collider might not be the best environment in which to make them .
Unparticles : 0.5 % .
One of the most recent hot topics in particle theory , unparticles are a suggestion from Howard Georgi that you could detect what looks like a fractional number of new particles , if there were a set of fields with perfect scale invariance ( no masses or other parameters to judge their " size " ) .
It 's undeniably clever , although the connection to reality still seems a bit tenuous .
( Although . )
Antimatter : 100 % .
We detected antimatter long ago !
In 1932 , to be precise .
It is no longer a mystery .
God : 10 ^ - 20 % .
More likely than stable black holes , but still a long shot .
Something that Has Never Been Predicted : 50 % .
Here is my favorite thing to root for .
Particle theorists have been coming up with new models for so long without being surprised by new experimental results , some of them have forgotten what it 's like .
Nature has a way of throwing us curve balls -- which is not only something to be anticipated , it 's something to be very grateful for .
Surprises are how we learn things .
Something that Has Been Predicted , but Not Listed Above : 2 % . I certainly have n't included every idea ever proposed ; if some model that not many people took seriously turns out to be right , someone will have some excellent gloating opportunities .
This month 's Scientific American Mind unpacks the neurology of orgasm .
It summarizes some very intriguing and also controversial research .
For example , brain scans seem to show that orgasms are n't just about heightened arousal but also the silencing of the brain 's " center of vigilance " to lose all inhibitions .
From Scientific American Mind :
To find out whether orgasm looks similar in the female brain ( as it does in the male brain ) , ( University of Groningen neuroscientist Gert ) Holstege 's team asked the male partners of 12 women to stimulate their partner 's clitoris –the site whose excitation most easily leads to orgasm–until she climaxed , again inside a PET scanner .
Not surprisingly , the team reported in 2006 , clitoral stimulation by itself led to activation in areas of the brain involved in receiving and perceiving sensory signals from that part of the body and in describing a body sensation –for instance , labeling it " sexual . "
But when a woman reached orgasm , something unexpected happened : much of her brain went silent .
Some of the most muted neurons sat in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex , which may govern self - control over basic desires such as sex .
Decreased activity there , the researchers suggest , might correspond to a release of tension and inhibition .
The scientists also saw a dip in excitation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex , which has an apparent role in moral reasoning and social judgment–a change that may be tied to a suspension of judgment and reflection .
Brain activity fell in the amygdala , too , suggesting a depression of vigilance similar to that seen in men , who generally showed far less deactivation in their brain during orgasm than their female counterparts did .
" Fear and anxiety need to be avoided at all costs if a woman wishes to have an orgasm ; we knew that , but now we can see it happening in the depths of the brain , " Holstege says .
He went so far as to declare at the 2005 meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Development : " At the moment of orgasm , women do not have any emotional feelings . "

On Monday , the Bush administration proposed a policy that threatens to weaken the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) to the point of extinction .
This comes as no surprise .
Like the war in Iraq , removing the fetters of environmental protection has been an administrational goal since 2001 .
Unlike the war in Iraq , this time Bush and his cronies could very well succeed .
Targeting the ESA ’s consultation process , the policy changes boil down to this : only when a federal agency feels their intended actions could bring about harm must they consult an outside agency like the Fish and Wildlife Service .
Currently , all of these decisions are subject to an independent scientific review .
If the ambiguity of that policy makes you uncomfortable then please raise your hand because it scares the crap out of me .
First off , our current administration has been , if anything , consistent in its attempt to sidestep environmental policy over the past seven years .
Consider this , Bush ’s administration has only added about 60 species to the endangered species list .
That is about 10 - percent of what was listed under the Clinton administration , and only about 3 - percent of what the Reagan administration listed .
Even George Bush ’s dad added around 200 species to the list !
Wait , it gets better .
This whole process is incredibly sneaky .
These suggested changes are not even subject to Congressional approval .
Outside of that , the Interior Department is only allowing comments on the proposal for 30 days , and in an attempt to reduce public outcry they are not accepting any comments via email – snail mail only !
If this sounds sketch , it should .
With the proposed changes , for example , agencies wo n’t even be required to assess how their projects will contribute to global warming , or the effect of those emissions on species and habitat .
And that ’s just the tip of the iceberg .
Of course , we wo n’t have many of those around if these changes are allowed .
Fact is , this proposal is obscene and another wicked example of the Bush administration circumventing the law .
And do n’t let them fool you …the consequences are grand , such that we ourselves might might make the endangered list .

Keg Folly : College President Resigns Over Photo
The president of an Iowa college was shown holding a keg over a woman 's mouth .
Aug. 29 , 2008  --
A keg of beer might not be expensive , but a photo of an Iowa college president holding one over a young woman 's open mouth cost him his job .
Less than a week before classes start at Iowa Central Community College , officials there are preparing for administrators to oversee the school while the search for a new leader gets under way .
Robert Paxton , the president of ICCC for 13 years , resigned Thursday following a report in the Des Moines Register that he was photographed shirtless , while holding a small Coors Light keg over a woman 's mouth .
The photo , showing Paxton with a group of young women and one man , was taken aboard a boat on Iowa 's West Lake Okoboji , according to the Register , which received the photo from an area resident .
It is unclear whether or not the people pictured with Paxton , 52 , were students at ICCC , but the evidence was damning enough for the popular president to resign from his job .
Chuck Peterson , a retired vice president at ICCC , and now the assistant to the president , said Paxton will get a severance package of $ 400,000 -- $ 200,000 in January 2009 , and the other half in January 2010 .
He 'll also retain full family health care coverage until he is eligible for Medicare .
He left behind a $ 156,000 annual salary , $ 27,960 annually for the purchase of an annuity , a $ 13,200 annual allowance for his personal vehicle , plus mileage reimbursement for every mile driven out of town , and a $ 7,250 personal expense account .
Peterson described Paxton as popular with the students and very involved on campus , located in Fort Dodge , about 90 miles northwest of Des Moines .
" Our college doubled in enrollment since he came here , " Peterson said .
" He has a significant , strong relationship with the community . "
Peterson said he saw his former boss today , and " he 's taking it very hard . "
A woman who answered the phone at Paxton 's house today promptly hung up .
It is not clear whether Paxton is married .
Paxton initially denied his presence on the boat to the Des Moines Register , but later said it was he in the photo and told the newspaper that he did nothing improper .
The Register also reported that Paxton had said the tap on the keg was n't open when he held it up and that his 19 - year - old son , arrested early the next morning on drunken driving charges , was n't drinking .
Former ICCC student Chris Bacon found out about the photo when it was text - messaged to him by a student .
Paxton was Bacon 's faculty advisor his freshman year .
" To be completely honest , I was n't completely surprised , " said Bacon , who graduated in the fall .
Though Paxton told the Register that he seldom drinks alcohol , Bacon said there were previous stories about the former president drinking in public , though never to excess , and not with students .
" People were saying they were n't surprised , which is not a good thing , " Bacon said , who added that that reaction makes him question the president 's previous interactions with other students .
Bacon noted that the photo was taken on a personal trip and off college grounds .
" But he is the president of a college , " he said .
" I do n't think that 's appropriate behavior . "
While the search is on for a new president , Peterson will serve as the liaison between the college 's board of trustees and the administration .
" We 've had a terrible two days , " Peterson said .
" I had one person say to me it seemed like a funeral on campus yesterday . "
In 2002 , Paxton was indicted by a district court grand jury on charges of felonious misconduct in office , falsifying public documents and tampering with records during an investigation into ICCC students ' records being altered .
The charges were dismissed later that year after Paxton agreed to accept responsibility for the incident .

In the beginning there was Adobe Photoshop , an awesomely potent -- but famously pricey and complex - - digital darkroom .
Simpler photo editors , such as Adobe 's Photoshop Elements and Corel 's Paint Shop Pro , now run around $ 80 - - not bad , but still an investment .
And none of the programs has evolved much to serve millions of shutterbugs seeking simple , easily accessible tools for images shared online via Facebook , Flickr , Picasa , and the like .
Enter a new breed of photo editors that not only leverage the Web but live on it -- browser - based services you can use on any PC with an Internet connection .
These Web tools let you directly edit images on photo - sharing sites and social networks , so it 's easy to tweak images you 've posted to the Web without downloading them again ; the editors also work with photos stored on your PC 's hard drive .
As with most Web services , the typical price for browser - based editors is unbeatable : $ 0.00 .
There are several catches , though .
No online image editor delivers the wealth of features and precision editing tools that Photoshop Elements and Paint Shop have had for years ; most do n't even let you print your pictures .
Some of these Web - based editors are sluggish , clunky to use , or both .
And unlike traditional desktop software , the services work only when the Web itself works -- a point that was driven home in July , when Amazon 's widely used S3 storage platform suffered an outage that knocked out several online editors .
At their best , though , Web image editors deliver surprisingly strong tools , with decent performance and usability .
For this review , I explored half a dozen services : FlauntR , FotoFlexer , Photoshop Express , Picnik , Picture2 Life , and Splashup .
They all offer basic editing features , including cropping , resizing , and color - adjustment capabilities , plus at least a few fancier effects ( for example , the ability to apply Warholesque pop-art colors or warp subjects into cartoony caricatures ) .
All allow you to work directly with images posted on at least three major photo - sharing sites ( see the features chart ) .
None charges fees of any sort except Picnik , which reserves a few features for a Premium edition that costs $ 25 a year .
( FotoFlexer , Picture2 Life , and the free version of Picnik carry ads ; FlauntR , Photoshop Express , and Splashup do n't . )
FotoFlexer and Picnik were clear standouts -- and Picnik 's uncommonly well - done interface gave it the edge .
When you need to quickly tweak a picture on a photo site ( or on a PC with no desktop image editing application ) , it 's productive and fun to go Picniking .
Some of the capabilities and limitations of each service are illustrated in our slide show .

The gold standard , Ludwig von Mises wrote , ' requires nothing else than that the government abstain from deliberately sabotaging it . ' [ p. 421 ]
Much to the detriment of civilization , governments have undermined and debased the gold standard throughout much of history .
With the aid of a state - sympathetic class of intellectuals , most educated people now regard monetary gold as a quaint contrivance of a bygone age -- to the extent they give the issue any thought at all .
Any suggestion that we adopt an authentic gold standard as a permanent solution to financial crises , dollar depreciation , and senseless wars is dismissed by the intelligentsia as hopelessly naive .
Of course we need the Fed , they tell us .
Of course we need the power inherent in an instantly ' accommodating ' currency .
That 's why Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act .
That 's why we were able to send so many conscripted youths to Churchill in World War parts I & II .
That 's why we were able to keep prices from falling and assist the overvalued British pound during the 1920s [ pp. 48 - 49 ] .
That 's why we ultimately outlawed real money in favor of political paper , so government could be unrestrained financially in dealing with any problem anywhere .
Funding government through taxation is never enough because the victims might retaliate .
What 's needed is what we have : the arcane subterfuge of a cloistered cartel .
What 's needed is a central bank quietly mulcting the masses while it feeds the world 's power - holders .
That way nobody revolts .
Not only do n't they revolt , not only do n't they pick up a $ 7 book that would explain what the hell 's going on , they take Friedman 's cue that leviathan and its bank will protect us against the horrors of depression .
The Fed is simply one of many government mechanisms for making freedom work .
Without it we'd be thrown back into the dark ages of the 19th century .
That it happens to engage ' all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction , ' is not a problem for political insiders .
War 's paymaster
The Greek philosopher Heraclitus wrote , ' You can not step into the same river twice . '
But then , Heraclitus had n't met George W. Bush , who 's itching to step into another calamitous war .
Foreign military adventures are costly in many ways , but the government 's printing press sees to it that Americans do n't get billed for the damages until well after the bombing gets underway .
And even then we do n't actually see a bill because the costs have worked their way into the things we buy .
The central bank / fiat money combination is an ingenious method of funding wars .
Americans find very little troubling about a bloodbath conducted thousands of miles from home that 's promoted as noble and given to them ' free . '
Later , as the people grouse about higher prices , government can continue to pose as their savior by ordering its helicopter to make a quick pass over Main Street and stringing up a few choice speculators and corporate CEOs .
The Fed is the perfect tool of tyranny , almost .
' Almost , ' because there 's a problem , one annoying protestor quietly calling attention to its egregious ways : government 's perennial enemy , gold .
Government has banned it , hoarded it , and publicly downplays its significance .
But the more money government prints , the more it cheats dollar holders , and the greater the demand for gold on world markets .
Prior to FDR 's confiscation order of 1933 , twenty dollars ( roughly ) would buy an ounce of gold .
By mid-March of this year , an ounce of gold was selling for over a thousand dollars .
Gold dropped in price but has now started to climb again and is currently over $ 925 .
Some analysts expect gold to match the Dow , and if the Fed sticks with stagflation rather than deflation or high inflation , the gold price could realistically reach $ 10,000 .
In any case , we 're talking about a devastating government crime .
And we 're the ones being devastated .
Want to wreck liberty or what little of it exists ?
Become president , pick a fight , and inflate the currency to pay for it .
Gary North :
It was the abandonment of the gold standard that made modern barbarism affordable .
[ Emphasis added ]
What did North say ?
He said this :
It was the abandonment of the gold standard that made modern barbarism affordable .
Remember it , and remember why it 's true .
Gold does n't emerge from a printing press .
Gold can not be mass produced to fund an ' energetic presidency . '
That 's why governments have no use for it .
In the case of World War I , the barbarism the gold standard could have prevented to a significant degree amounted to over 40 million casualties , including 19.7 million civilian and military deaths combined .
But that , of course , was only the beginning of the blood - soaked twentieth century -- a period in which state funding was and still is unrestrained by the ' barbarous relic . '
The combination of war and inflation is the surest way to advance statism , nor was the American Revolution and its inflation one of history 's sterling exceptions .
Read the excellent study by Leonard L. Richards , Shays 's Rebellion : The American Revolution 's Final Battle .
Inflation led to rebellion , which led to widespread misrepresentation of the rebellion 's cause , which led to the Constitutional Convention to strengthen the central state .
( My review of Richards ' book is here . )
Sound money safeguards
It 's very difficult to inflate sound money because sound money , by its nature , is difficult to create .
It emerges in trade as a highly marketable commodity , but one that 's also relatively scarce .
Sound money starves the state but not the economy as long as prices are allowed to fluctuate .
Yet there was once some confusion about gold 's character .
As Mises wrote :
When in the ' fifties of the nineteenth century gold production increased considerably in California and Australia , people attacked the gold standard as inflationary .
. .
But later these criticisms subsided .
The gold standard was no longer denounced as inflationary but on the contrary as deflationary . [ p. 416 ]
It was considered insufficiently ' elastic ' ( deflationary ) even during the period 1896 - 1914 , when gold discoveries in Alaska and South Africa spurred an annual inflation rate of two percent [ see note 1 ] .
But clearly , the objections to a gold standard were not so much based on its alleged inflationary or deflationary tendencies but on the fact that the market controlled its supply , rather than politicians and their pals in the fractional reserve banking racket .
Quoting Mises again :
It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments .
Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights . [ p. 414 ]
But constitutions and bills of rights are the products of government and are subject to government 's shifting interpretations .
We should never let politicians or central bankers ' interpret ' anything for us , especially money .
An authentic gold standard would be entirely removed from state influence , and for that reason would afford much - needed protection against government assaults on our liberty .
Many of us had been wait­ing for tougher talk from Barack Oba­ma about John McCain and the Bush pres­i­den­cy .
At the Demo­c­ra­t­ic con­ven­tion , Oba­ma began to deliv­er – but it was n’t stark enough .
When have we ever had a president publicly reject the Geneva Conventions and endorse torture as a matter of national policy ?
I recent­ly vis­it­ed Aus­tralia and New Zealand , and it made me real­ize that we need myth­ic lan­guage – the kind that comes from oral cul­tures reliant on hand­ed - down leg­ends – to cap­ture what has hap­pened these past eight years .
Like the Abo­rig­ines ’ dream­time sto­ries , we need some­thing more pow­er­ful than ​ “ the failed poli­cies of the Bush admin­is­tra­tion . ”
I pro­pose ​ “ The Stolen Years . ”
It began , of course , with the stolen elec­tion in 2000 .
But just think how much has been stolen from us : our moral­i­ty and , indeed , our sense of humanity .
These are not just pol­i­cy fail­ures .
This has been a spir­i­tu­al pil­lag­ing of any sense that the Unit­ed States can ever aspire to , or rep­re­sent , high­er prin­ci­ples ; that our nation is , or can be , a democ­ra­cy , how­ev­er flawed ; that the gov­ern­ment cares about cit­i­zens oth­er than the real­ly rich .
The Bush admin­is­tra­tion has seized all we hold dear and ground it into the dirt with its boot heels .
Most impor­tant has been the nation ’s sense of its own moral­i­ty .
Few of us are delud­ed that the U.S. gov­ern­ment was , before the Bush régime , a bea­con of moral rec­ti­tude and social jus­tice .
The Unit­ed States has over­thrown many gov­ern­ments , most­ly in secret , and sup­port­ed repres­sive rulers .
But when have our lead­ers pub­licly and adamant­ly reject­ed the Gene­va Con­ven­tions and endorsed tor­ture as a mat­ter of nation­al pol­i­cy ?
It ’s one thing for there to be a gap between nation­al prin­ci­ples and gov­ern­ment prac­tices , and quite anoth­er for a pres­i­dent to deride those prin­ci­ples as no longer essen­tial to the nation ’s moral compass .
Also stolen from us has been a faith in the rule of law , the notion that the U.S. Con­sti­tu­tion is a foun­da­tion­al doc­u­ment whose prin­ci­ples must be adhered to .
The law­less­ness and bar­barism of Guan­tá­namo – where peo­ple have been impris­oned for years with­out tri­als , or denied the right to know the spe­cif­ic accu­sa­tions against them , where peo­ple have been tor­tured – has leeched from us any sense that our judi­cial sys­tem is any bet­ter than , say , the secret Star Cham­bers of the Tudor and Stu­art monarchs .
After rev­e­la­tions in the ​ ’70s about the FBI ’s sur­veil­lance of artists , civ­il rights , fem­i­nist and anti­war activists , there was a nation­al out­cry .
As a result , Con­gress restrict­ed domes­tic spy­ing on Amer­i­can cit­i­zens .
Bush ’s war­rant­less wire­tap sur­veil­lance pro­gram , how­ev­er , stole that basic right to not be spied on by our government .
With Bush ’s sug­ges­tion that cli­mate change was some imag­i­nary hoax , with his thwart­ing of stem cell research , and with his FDA ’s neg­li­gence in apply­ing strict test­ing to a host of prod­ucts , he robbed the coun­try of eight years of cut­ting - edge research on the envi­ron­men­tal and med­ical chal­lenges – if not emer­gen­cies – that face us .
Of course , what Bush most want­ed to sack was any notion that the gov­ern­ment could help or sup­port its cit­i­zens .
His goal was famous­ly artic­u­lat­ed by right - winger Grover Norquist : to ​ “ cut gov­ern­ment … down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub . ”
The after­math of Hur­ri­cane Kat­ri­na gave us heart - wrench­ing images of what this meant : peo­ple strand­ed on their roofs , wav­ing des­per­ate­ly for help ; peo­ple forced to live in swel­ter­ing filth in con­ven­tion cen­ters ; peo­ple left to rot .
The ide­ol­o­gy stole any ves­ti­gial notions of a com­mon good in which we might all have an inter­est – and to which we should all con­tribute , espe­cial­ly those of us more priv­i­leged than others .
While pres­i­dents have often lied to us – the secret bomb­ing of Cam­bo­dia , Iran - Con­tra , ​ “ I nev­er had sex­u­al rela­tions with that woman ” – none has mount­ed such a full bore , cyn­i­cal , Sovi­et - style pro­pa­gan­da cam­paign against its own peo­ple as George ​ “ WMDs ” and ​ “ Mis­sion Accom­plished ” Bush .
Such pro­pa­gan­da efforts were espe­cial­ly aimed at women .
While Lau­ra Bush went to Afghanistan to show her con­cern for gen­der oppres­sion , her hus­band was busi­ly clos­ing the White House Office for Women ’s Ini­tia­tives and Out­reach , remov­ing infor­ma­tion about issues like pay equi­ty and child­care from the Labor Department ’s web­site , and post­ing bogus infor­ma­tion – such as the dis­cred­it­ed claim about a link between hav­ing an abor­tion and get­ting breast can­cer – on the Nation­al Can­cer Institute ’s website .
These are not failed poli­cies .
This is Grand Theft Auto – of who we are , and what we could become .
Pro­gres­sives and lib­er­als should have ​ “ The Stolen Years ” as our mantra , and say ​“ nev­er again . ”
Over the weekend , the GOP removed Didi Lima , its communications director in Clark County , Nevada .
Both the Republicans ' spokesperson for the most populous county in the state and co-chair for John McCain 's Nevada Hispanic Leadership Team , Lima on Thursday failed to exercise what Conway earlier deemed " less deafness and more deftness in dealing with a different looking candidate . "
As USA Today reported :
" We do n't want ( Hispanics ) to become the new African - American community , " Lima told The Associated Press .
" And that 's what the Democratic Party is going to do to them , create more programs and give them handouts , food stamps and checks for this and checks for that .
We do n't want that . "
" I 'm very much afraid that the Democratic Party is going to do the same thing that they did with the African - American culture and make them all dependent on the government and we do n't want that , " she said .
Lima 's departure follows on the heels of the resignation last week of Fernando C. de Baca .
Chairman of the Republican Party in Bernalillo County , New Mexico 's most populous county , de Baca predicted John McCain would do well in his state :
" The truth is that Hispanics came here as conquerors .
African - Americans came here as slaves .
Hispanics consider themselves above blacks .
They wo n't vote for a black president . "
As the national and state polls clearly show , de Baca is wrong .
Obama has enjoyed leads as large as 40 points among Hispanic voters nationwide .
And for now , the battleground state of New Mexico is leaning his way .
Sadly , Lima and de Baca 's missteps in the Southwest are hardly isolated events for the Republican Party in this year 's election .
On Thursday , Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachman cited an article blaming " blacks " and " other minorities " for the Wall Street financial crisis .
In Virginia , Congressman Virgil Goode , who previously hurled anti-Muslim slurs at his Minnesota colleague Keith Ellison , is airing ads depicting his lily - white Democratic opponent as dark - skinned and bearded .
Meanwhile , Fort Hill , South Carolina mayor Danny Funderburk forwarded an email proclaiming Barack Obama the anti-Christ because he was " just curious " if it was true .
And it 's not even October yet .
As I wrote last year ( " The Party of Hate " ) , " the only message seemingly uniting Republicans is disdain - of immigrants , of blacks , of gay Americans and above all , Muslims . "
Alas , Kellyanne Conway 's diversity training for Republicans was just a smokescreen for the Party of Hate .

If you are reading this article , then most likely you heard about how Barack Obama changed his stance this weekend on whether or not we should open new areas to drill for oil offshore .
He now says that we should allow for some more drilling to occur if this drilling is part of a larger package of legislation that would move the United States ’ energy needs toward a cleaner , greener , and more self - sufficient future .
Republicans and Democrats are both already on the attack , ready to get horizontal with Obama and start throwing punches and snarky , clever , hissy - fit accusations about his failure to stand up for what he believes in , or tell him that he ’s no better than any other lying “ win - at - all cost ” politician , or that he has no core beliefs and is just a celebrity who goes the way that the wind ( or polls ) blow .
Instead of crying foul , everyone– Republicans , Independents , and Liberals ( and journalists ! ) alike should be happy .
Instead , we all have been unknowingly trained to do the most illogical thing possible : let the media make us think that when politicians change their mind ( or god forbid think ! ) , or in this case think win-win , that they should be persecuted as liars , fakes , and spineless .
As Mark Halperin and John Harris so astutely explain in their book , The Way to Win : Taking the White House in 2008 , most Americans have been conditioned to prefer a president that is “ strong and wrong ” to one that is “ weak and right . ”
Seems like Obama should have read the book , right ?
Wrong !
Is there anyone reading this article who can tell me about a legislative accomplishment passed by Congress in the past 10 years that is memorable for how terrific it has been ?
I sure can’t .
I can only think of bills and initiatives that for some reason or another have not worked out so well , or that have been minor accomplishments .
We should want a president , whether it ’s Barack Obama or John McCain , who understands that he or she is n’t going to pass some sweeping legislation that “ fixes ” health care , triggers a giant “ boom ” in environmentalism and green initiatives , makes our education system “ sounder ” , or produces a perfect or “ ideal ” resolution to the wars abroad that currently involve and do not involve the U.S. Instead , we should cheer a president who does not steer away from his or her core beliefs , but at the same time makes room to find situations that are win-win .
I ’m not applauding mediocrity .
I ’m simply suggesting that having a president , Republican or Democrat ( or better yet from a third party ) who acts without a “ It ’s my way , or the highway ” Patrick Swayze attitude might help Congress to actually pass more meaningful legislation .
Good ahead , label me a centrist and a sell - out , tell me that these kinds of compromising presidents usually fail .
I ’d rather see that the U.S. government accomplishes something that creates positive changes in the long - run , or passes legislation that turns out to not be so great , rather than doing nothing at all and cursing the darkness .
I ’m still optimistic .
And Paul Krugman , if you are reading this article , your opinions on why partisanship is good are puny and resentful : not very good for making progress , buddy .
So do I personally think that drilling is a good idea ?
No .
But do I think drilling might help bring more possibilities in the U.S. to have wind , solar , and hydro power if drilling is allowed with them in a legislation package ?
Yes .
I hope it ’s windy and sunny on that oil rig .

When she was arrested in Afghanistan last month , Aafia Siddique allegedly had in her possession maps of New York , a list of potential targets that included the Statue of Liberty , Times Square , the subway system and the animal disease center on Plum Island , detailed chemical , biological and radiological weapon information that has been seen only in a handful of terrorist cases , as well as a thumb drive packed with emails , ABC News has learned .
That haul of information has led multiple government sources to describe Siddique , a 36 year - old MIT graduate , as a potential " treasure trove " of information on terrorist supporters , sympathizers or ' sleepers ' in the United States and overseas .
" She is the most significant capture in five years , " said former CIA officer John Kiriakou , who said she lives up to her reputation as an alleged terrorist ' Mata Hari . '
And there is an eagerness to see what , if anything , she can add to the thin trickle of fresh information on the activities of terrorists and terrorist supporters in Afghanistan and Pakistan , as well as what if any risk she might pose to national security .
Only a " handful " of captured alleged Al Qaeda associates have had the kind of detailed information on weapons of mass destruction that Siddique , who attended MIT as an undergraduate and earned her PhD in neuroscience at Brandeis , had in her handbag , multiple current and former US intelligence and law enforcement officials told ABC News .
" She is a very dangerous person , no doubt about it , " said a senior US counter terrorism official .
" This is a major haul , a major capture for the FBI , " said Kiriakou .
" To find someone who has such rich information , computer hard drives , e-mails , that is really a major capture . "
US authorities are analyzing Siddique 's saliva , hair , and fingernail scrapings to determine , if possible , what evidence they can find of any exposure to chemical , biological or radiological materials with potential use in weapons of mass destruction , sources said .
" Her education troubled us .
We know that she 's extremely bright .
She 's radicalized .
We knew that she had been planning , or at least involved in the planning , of a wide variety of different operations , whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons , whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the President , " said Kiriakou .
" We knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody . "
When nabbed by a team of Afghanistan National Police officers on July 17th , she also had in her possession a one gigabyte digital media storage device - a thumb drive - whose contents included a large trail of emails that authorities are now poring over , sources said .
Those e-mails , a source involved in the investigation said , are between " what she described as ' units ' and what we would call ' cells ' . "
In her papers she had maps and information concerning potential targets in New York City that sources say included the subway , Times Square and the Statute of Liberty , ABC News has learned .
She also carried excerpts from " The Anarchist 's Arsenal " and " documents detailing United States military assets " , according to the federal complaint against her filed July 31st in Manhattan .
ABC News sources said that she also had information indicating the possibility of " an attack " on Plum Island Disease Center , a secure US government facility off the tip of Long Island , New York where research into foot and mouth disease , swine fever and other animal pathogens is conducted by the Department of Agriculture and security is provided by the Department of Homeland Security .
" We 're proud of our role as America 's first line of defense against foreign animal diseases , " the facility 's website notes .
" We 're equally proud of our safety record .
Not once in our nearly 50 years of operation has an animal pathogen escaped from the island . "
The remote possibility of smuggling a pathogen off isolated Plum Island was the subject of the bestseller Plum Island by Nelson DeMille .
But a terrorist attack on the isolated island would not spread disease , according to homeland security officials familiar with the research activities there .
Interest in Siddique is in itself not new .
On May 26th , 2004 she became the first woman wanted by the federal government in connection with Al Qaeda when then Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller asked the public 's help in finding her and six men suspected of links to Al Qaeda .
At that same time they warned , in advance of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions , that Al Qaeda was preparing to " hit the United States hard " that summer .
By then Siddique had been linked to an " ill conceived " and perhaps amateurish plot to " kill all living US presidents " , according to sources from three federal agencies .
And she had already vanished from public view for about 16 months .
She has also been twice married ; once to a nephew of 9 - 11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed .
Her name reportedly rolled from KSM 's lips when he was captured and interrogated by US intelligence officers .
She has also been linked to Adnan El Shukrijumah , a pilot and suspected al Qaeda member also on the Ashcroft - Mueller list .
Shukrijumah , Ashcroft noted , had once lived in Florida , had left the United States and had later attempted to re-enter the country using a variety of passports .
" We know that he has been involved in terrorist planning with senior al Qaeda leaders overseas and has scouted sites across America that might be vulnerable to terrorist attack , " Ashcroft added .
By the time of Siddique 's capture last month , she had become something of a cause celebre among some human rights activists who believe she was " disappeared " five years ago by the Pakistani government , perhaps at the request of the United States .
At a federal court hearing in Manhattan on Monday , the number of supporters who showed up required the US Marshals to move the Magistrate 's Court proceeding to a larger courtroom and also open an overflow courtroom where spectators could listen to and watch the proceedings on closed circuit TV .
They saw Siddique slumped over in a wheelchair , the result of having been shot twice with a nine millimeter side arm after she allegedly grabbed a US Army Warrant Officer 's M - 4 Carbine and opened fire as a team of FBI agents , US Army officers including the Warrant Officer and a Captain , and interpreters prepared to interrogate her on July 18th , the day following her arrest , according the federal complaint .
" The Warrant Officer saw and heard Siddique fire at least two shots as Interpreter 1 tried to wrestle the gun from her .
No one was hit .
The Warrant Officer heard Siddique exclaim ' Allah Akbar ! '
Another interpreter ( Interpreter 2 ) heard Siddique yell in English ' Get the f --- out of here , ' as she fired the rifle , " the complaint stated .
" Her medical condition is that , she was shot in the abdomen .
There are stitches that run from the breast plate area down to the belly button area ... layers and layers of tissue have been sewn , sutured .
We have heard reports that she has lost a kidney ; we do n't know if those are accurate but we are concerned about that .
There has been intestinal damage , part of the intestines , we understand , have been removed , " according to Elaine Whitman Sharpe , one of a team of three attorneys present for Siddique .
Pakistani officials present at the hearing said they had " no information " on the allegations that Siddique had been secretly held prisoner and " no information " to offer on the allegations that their government may have assisted in that capture .
Her friends and family say the young woman , a mother of three , is innocent and being persecuted by the US .
There is some dissent in the intelligence community on Siddique 's potential value and some have characterized her as mentally unbalanced and operationally insignificant .
But in an intelligence and law enforcement community that has exhausted the useful information from high value prisoners it has had in custody for as long as six years and has watched the stream of new intelligence go from a torrent to a trickle , she is seen by many as having at least the potential of holding valuable current intelligence about members and associates of Al Qaeda both overseas and in the United States .

President Bush will leave his successor with a record - high budget deficit of $ 482 billion , according to an administration estimate released Monday .
White House officials blamed the slowing economy and a $ 150 - billion bipartisan stimulus package for the worsening picture for the 2009 fiscal year , but Democrats cited the president ’s tax cuts and fiscal management over his eight years in office .
“ The important point to remember is that near - term deficits are both temporary and manageable if , and only if , we keep spending in check , the tax burden low and the economy growing , ” said Jim Nussle , director of the Office of Management and Budget , which released the budget report -- the last of Bush ’s presidency .
Nussle argued that although it would be the highest deficit in history , it was manageable as a percentage of the country ’s economic output -- roughly 3.3 % of the gross domestic product .
And he said the deficit for fiscal 2008 , at $ 389 billion , would be somewhat less than anticipated .

“ The best way to compare a deficit is by your ability in the economy to manage that deficit , ” Nussle told reporters in a White House briefing .
“ We have a plan to address that deficit and bring it down , which I think is a responsible one . ”
The budget office ’s report also predicted that the country ’s gross domestic product would grow by 1.6 % in 2008 , down from February ’s projection of 2.7 % .
The lower figure was attributed to higher - than - expected prices for oil and other commodities , problems in the credit markets and the continuing difficulties in the housing market .
Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed the revised deficit figures on Bush ’s large tax cuts and freewheeling spending .
“ If we gave Olympic medals for fiscal irresponsibility , President Bush would take the gold , the silver and the bronze , because he ’s got the three highest record deficits ever , ” said Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - S.D. ) , chairman of the Senate Budget Committee .
“ He sets records in every single category : 2009 would be the gold ; 2004 the silver ; 2008 the bronze . ”

Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. ( D - S.C. ) noted that Bush inherited a budget surplus from his Democratic predecessor , so the blame for the poor fiscal performance rests with him .
“ Mr. Bush came to office with the biggest surpluses in history and he will leave office with the biggest deficit in history .
That ’s the bottom line , ” said Spratt , chairman of the House Budget Committee .
Nussle defended the president , noting that he faced unexpected challenges after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
“ He had an underfunded military , in fact was running a deficit when it came to our ability to respond to homeland security and international intelligence and making sure that our country was protected , ” Nussle said .
“ So while mathematically there may have been a surplus , there were many underlying deficits that the president had to deal with that became manifest on Sept. 11 and beyond . ”

Conrad complained that Bush has long refused to acknowledge the role that his tax cuts have played in the deficit projections .
He also accused Bush of using deceptive budget practices , including funding much of the Iraq war off the regular budget .
“ This president has burgeoned the debt and the deficit by doing two things : running up spending dramatically and dramatically reducing the revenue in a way that was completely imprudent , that has saddled this country with record deficit and debt , ” Conrad said .
But Republicans , who lost their majority in Congress two years ago in part because of voters ’ dismay over the country ’s burgeoning fiscal problems , warned that a second stimulus package sought by Democrats would only make the problem worse .
“ Today ’s announcement is a cautionary tale for the next president and Congress that we cannot spend our way out of the economic downturn , ” said Sen.
Judd Gregg of New Hampshire , the top Republican on the Senate budget panel .

“ Skyrocketing energy bills have hit families and businesses hard , and while tax rebate checks have been issued to help address the lag in economic growth , the extra $ 2,200 families must pay in higher gas and oil bills this year alone have long since absorbed any impact the stimulus payments were meant to have to spur economic growth . ”

In the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , former Mayor Rudy Giuliani has begun drumming up business , positioning his law firm to advise corporate clients on how to profit from the government ’s $ 700 billion bailout .
Bracewell & Giuliani LLP announced it has formed a corporate task force to advise “ financial institutions , private investment funds , institutional investors and other market participants ” on the costly package .
“ Our team of former government officials and experienced attorneys in the fields of legislation , enforcement and finance are equipped to guide institutions in this quickly evolving and complex environment , ” Giuliani said .
A firm spokeswoman declined to provide any further details and referred to the announcement .
Bracewell is n’t the only group poised to profit if a deal is reached for the federal government to bail out the struggling financial system by buying up billions in bad mortgages and other toxic assets .

From the start , Ms. Wojcicki has been a passionate advocate for Google ’s day care efforts , though there is some dispute about how much decision - making authority she has .
Parents who know her point out that the company ’s day care approach is very much aligned with her views ; for its part , a Google spokesman insists that “ these decisions were not made by her ; they were made by the executive management team . ”
Google ’s first facility , called the Kinderplex , was run by the Childrens ’ Creative Learning Centers , or C.C.L.C. , which , according to its Web site , offers “ learning in a play - based , developmentally appropriate environment that incorporates a variety of activities and multicultural aspects in a thematic style . ”
That sounds perfect for Silicon Valley , does n’t it ?
One of C.C.L.C. ’s longtime Silicon Valley clients , Electronic Arts , sent me an e-mail statement telling me how happy it has been with C.C.L.C. ’s services .
According to Google , there were numerous complains about C.C.L.C. , but the Google parents I spoke to disagree .
They say that at the Kinderplex , child - teacher ratios were low , teachers were first - rate , the facility was clean and upbeat , and the food  organic , naturally  was terrific .
But at least one parent was n’t happy : Ms. Wojcicki .
She is a proponent of a preschool philosophy called Reggio Emilia , the hot kiddie philosophy of the moment , which stresses even small children ’s ability to chart their own learning paths .
A year after the Kinderplex opened , Google opened its second day care center , called the Woods , which Google ran itself .
The Woods was an expensive undertaking ; in terms of the square footage per child , the aesthetics of its toys , and the college degrees of its teachers , it put the Kinderplex to shame .
It also used the Reggio Emilia philosophy .
With the Woods open , Google decided to upgrade the Kinderplex to match the salaries and the teacher - student ratios of the Woods .
Google now had 200 day care spots  and such wonderful day care at that !
 and was promoting this new perk as a recruiting tool .
The company was growing like crazy  its work force now numbers 19,000  its young employees were starting to have babies , and well , you can just picture what happened next .
The wait list ballooned insanely , finally reaching over 700 people .
New employees who arrived at Google thinking they were getting in - house day care were stunned to discover that it could take up to two years to land a coveted spot .
Meanwhile , someone at Google woke up one day and realized that the company was subsidizing each child to the tune of $ 37,000 a year  which nobody had noticed up until then  compared with the $ 12,000 - a- year average subsidy of other big Silicon Valley companies like Cisco Systems and Oracle .
Faced with this dilemma , Google decided that the way to solve the dual problems of a too - long wait list and a too - large subsidy was  are you sitting down for this ?
 to get rid of C.C.L.C. and make the Kinderplex more like the Woods !
( Google says it was always planning to replace C.C.L.C. )
Given that decision , the only possible way to reduce the subsidy was to raise prices through the roof .

Chris Matthews , former Eugene McCarthy Democrat and Obama fawner , is seriously frustrated by the messiness of democracy — as Donald Rumsfeld would have it — and lashes out the 9/11 truth movement and Alex Jones in this clip .
For Chris , it is fine and dandy if the public screams for the candidates selected by the CFR and the bankers , but when it is 9/11 truth , well that ’s something else entirely .
Demonstrating he is completely clueless , Matthews , in a futile attempt to discredit 9/11 truth because it dares interrupt his show , says the truth movement believes George Bush sat in the White House with a plunger on September 11 and blew up the WTC , thus revealing he knows absolutely nothing about the issue .
Of course , if he did and was fair , he would n’t be on MSNBC and would still be a Capitol Hill cop on the beat or more likely anchored to a desk , the first patronage job he held , that is before he threw off any funny ideas about being a Goldwater Republican and started calling himself a McCarthy Democrat now all spazzy over the banker ’s choice , Barack Obama .

Marlboro Sponsors Children ’s School Uniforms
It is pretty common to seen uniform ad placement on participants in most sports and public events , but it might come as a bit of a shock to see a group of kids walking to school with advertisements all over their uniforms .
In KunMing Province , China , that is exactly what you are likely to see , as around 525 students have been issued sharp new orange uniforms covered in advertisements .
Students in Asia are required to wear school uniforms and it was obviously an opportunity companies like Vodafone , Shell , Ferrari , and even cigarette company Marlboro , just could n’t pass on .
The parents were shocked to see that their children now looked like they were part of a Formula
One pit crew , but in China there is little the parents can say or do about the situation .
The kids do n’t seem to mind the logo placements and even if they did get a little stressed out , they now know which brand of cigarette will help calm their nerves .

Oregon Tech To Be Powered Entirely By Geothermal Energy
August 7th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
College students are demanding sustainability efforts in their schools , and now universities are stepping up to the plate .
This past Tuesday , the Oregon Institute of Technology outlined a plan to build a $ 7.6 million geothermal power plant on campus .
The plant will become the sole power source for the school in a few years , making Oregon Tech the only university to be powered completely by geothermal energy .
Since Klamath Falls , the home of Oregon Tech , sits near a fault line , heat and energy can be easily taken out of the earth .
And Oregon
Tech is n’t the only institution to take advantage of the abundant geothermal energy in the area .
The city of Klamath Falls operates a geothermal heating utility , using the energy to heat buildings , melt snow on the streets , and more .
Raser Technologies , a company located in the city , has plans to build a geothermal plant in the city , and is looking into developing surrounding areas as well .
With Florida Gulf Coast University ’s giant solar array recently in the news — and now Oregon Tech ’s geothermal project — maybe we ’ll be seeing some of the biggest renewable energy projects coming out of universities in the near future .

Breaking News : The Suit is Back !
April 2005
" Suits make a corporate comeback , " says the New York Times .
Why does this sound familiar ?
Maybe because the suit was also back in February , September 2004 , June 2004 , March 2004 , September 2003 , November 2002 , April 2002 , and February 2002 .
Why do the media keep running stories saying suits are back ?
Because PR firms tell them to .
One of the most surprising things I discovered during my brief business career was the existence of the PR industry , lurking like a huge , quiet submarine beneath the news .
Of the stories you read in traditional media that are n't about politics , crimes , or disasters , more than half probably come from PR firms .
I know because I spent years hunting such " press hits . "
Our startup spent its entire marketing budget on PR : at a time when we were assembling our own computers to save money , we were paying a PR firm $ 16,000 a month .
And they were worth it .
PR is the news equivalent of search engine optimization ; instead of buying ads , which readers ignore , you get yourself inserted directly into the stories . [ 1 ]
Our PR firm was one of the best in the business .
In 18 months , they got press hits in over 60 different publications .
And we were n't the only ones they did great things for .
In 1997 I got a call from another startup founder considering hiring them to promote his company .
I told him they were PR gods , worth every penny of their outrageous fees .
But I remember thinking his company 's name was odd .
Why call an auction site " eBay " ?
Symbiosis
PR is not dishonest .
Not quite .
In fact , the reason the best PR firms are so effective is precisely that they are n't dishonest .
They give reporters genuinely valuable information .
A good PR firm wo n't bug reporters just because the client tells them to ; they 've worked hard to build their credibility with reporters , and they do n't want to destroy it by feeding them mere propaganda .
If anyone is dishonest , it 's the reporters .
The main reason PR firms exist is that reporters are lazy .
Or , to put it more nicely , overworked .
Really they ought to be out there digging up stories for themselves .
But it 's so tempting to sit in their offices and let PR firms bring the stories to them .
After all , they know good PR firms wo n't lie to them .
A good flatterer does n't lie , but tells his victim selective truths ( what a nice color your eyes are ) .
Good PR firms use the same strategy : they give reporters stories that are true , but whose truth favors their clients .
For example , our PR firm often pitched stories about how the Web let small merchants compete with big ones .
This was perfectly true .
But the reason reporters ended up writing stories about this particular truth , rather than some other one , was that small merchants were our target market , and we were paying the piper .
Different publications vary greatly in their reliance on PR firms .
At the bottom of the heap are the trade press , who make most of their money from advertising and would give the magazines away for free if advertisers would let them . [ 2 ]
The average trade publication is a bunch of ads , glued together by just enough articles to make it look like a magazine .
They 're so desperate for " content " that some will print your press releases almost verbatim , if you take the trouble to write them to read like articles .
At the other extreme are publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal .
Their reporters do go out and find their own stories , at least some of the time .
They 'll listen to PR firms , but briefly and skeptically .
We managed to get press hits in almost every publication we wanted , but we never managed to crack the print edition of the Times . [ 3 ]
The weak point of the top reporters is not laziness , but vanity .
You do n't pitch stories to them .
You have to approach them as if you were a specimen under their all - seeing microscope , and make it seem as if the story you want them to run is something they thought of themselves .
Our greatest PR coup was a two - part one .
We estimated , based on some fairly informal math , that there were about 5000 stores on the Web .
We got one paper to print this number , which seemed neutral enough .
But once this " fact " was out there in print , we could quote it to other publications , and claim that with 1000 users we had 20 % of the online store market .
This was roughly true .
We really did have the biggest share of the online store market , and 5000 was our best guess at its size .
But the way the story appeared in the press sounded a lot more definite .
Reporters like definitive statements .
For example , many of the stories about Jeremy Jaynes 's conviction say that he was one of the 10 worst spammers .
This " fact " originated in Spamhaus 's ROKSO list , which I think even Spamhaus would admit is a rough guess at the top spammers .
The first stories about Jaynes cited this source , but now it 's simply repeated as if it were part of the indictment . [ 4 ]
All you can say with certainty about Jaynes is that he was a fairly big spammer .
But reporters do n't want to print vague stuff like " fairly big . "
They want statements with punch , like " top ten . "
And PR firms give them what they want .
Wearing suits , we 're told , will make us 3.6 percent more productive .
Buzz
Where the work of PR firms really does get deliberately misleading is in the generation of " buzz . "
They usually feed the same story to several different publications at once .
And when readers see similar stories in multiple places , they think there is some important trend afoot .
Which is exactly what they 're supposed to think .
When Windows 95 was launched , people waited outside stores at midnight to buy the first copies .
None of them would have been there without PR firms , who generated such a buzz in the news media that it became self - reinforcing , like a nuclear chain reaction .
I doubt PR firms realize it yet , but the Web makes it possible to track them at work .
If you search for the obvious phrases , you turn up several efforts over the years to place stories about the return of the suit .
For example , the Reuters article that got picked up by USA Today in September 2004 .
" The suit is back , " it begins .
Trend articles like this are almost always the work of PR firms .
Once you know how to read them , it 's straightforward to figure out who the client is .
With trend stories , PR firms usually line up one or more " experts " to talk about the industry generally .
In this case we get three : the NPD Group , the creative director of GQ , and a research director at Smith Barney . [ 5 ]
When you get to the end of the experts , look for the client .
And bingo , there it is : The Men's Wearhouse .
Not surprising , considering The Men's Wearhouse was at that moment running ads saying " The Suit is Back . "
Talk about a successful press hit -- a wire service article whose first sentence is your own ad copy .
The secret to finding other press hits from a given pitch is to realize that they all started from the same document back at the PR firm .
Search for a few key phrases and the names of the clients and the experts , and you 'll turn up other variants of this story .
Casual fridays are out and dress codes are in writes Diane E. Lewis in The Boston Globe .
In a remarkable coincidence , Ms. Lewis 's industry contacts also include the creative director of GQ .
Ripped jeans and T - shirts are out , writes Mary Kathleen Flynn in US News & World Report .
And she too knows the creative director of GQ .
Men 's suits are back writes Nicole Ford in Sexbuzz .
Com ( " the ultimate men's entertainment magazine " ) .
Dressing down loses appeal as men suit up at the office writes Tenisha Mercer of The Detroit News .
Now that so many news articles are online , I suspect you could find a similar pattern for most trend stories placed by PR firms .
I propose we call this new sport " PR diving , " and I 'm sure there are far more striking examples out there than this clump of five stories .
Online
After spending years chasing them , it 's now second nature to me to recognize press hits for what they are .
But before we hired a PR firm I had no idea where articles in the mainstream media came from .
I could tell a lot of them were crap , but I did n't realize why .
Remember the exercises in critical reading you did in school , where you had to look at a piece of writing and step back and ask whether the author was telling the whole truth ?
If you really want to be a critical reader , it turns out you have to step back one step further , and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth , but why he 's writing about this subject at all .
Online , the answer tends to be a lot simpler .
Most people who publish online write what they write for the simple reason that they want to .
You can't see the fingerprints of PR firms all over the articles , as you can in so many print publications -- which is one of the reasons , though they may not consciously realize it , that readers trust bloggers more than Business Week .
I was talking recently to a friend who works for a big newspaper .
He thought the print media were in serious trouble , and that they were still mostly in denial about it .
" They think the decline is cyclic , " he said .
" Actually it 's structural . "
In other words , the readers are leaving , and they 're not coming back .
Why ?
I think the main reason is that the writing online is more honest .
Imagine how incongruous the New York Times article about suits would sound if you read it in a blog :
The urge to look corporate -- sleek , commanding , prudent , yet with just a touch of hubris on your well - cut sleeve -- is an unexpected development in a time of business disgrace .
The problem with this article is not just that it originated in a PR firm .
The whole tone is bogus .
This is the tone of someone writing down to their audience .
Whatever its flaws , the writing you find online is authentic .
It 's not mystery meat cooked up out of scraps of pitch letters and press releases , and pressed into molds of zippy journalese .
It 's people writing what they think .
I did n't realize , till there was an alternative , just how artificial most of the writing in the mainstream media was .
I 'm not saying I used to believe what I read in Time and Newsweek .
Since high school , at least , I 've thought of magazines like that more as guides to what ordinary people were being told to think than as sources of information .
But I did n't realize till the last few years that writing for publication did n't have to mean writing that way .
I did n't realize you could write as candidly and informally as you would if you were writing to a friend .
Readers are n't the only ones who 've noticed the change .
The PR industry has too .
A hilarious article on the site of the PR Society of America gets to the heart of the matter : Bloggers are sensitive about becoming mouthpieces for other organizations and companies , which is the reason they began blogging in the first place .
PR people fear bloggers for the same reason readers like them .
And that means there may be a struggle ahead .
As this new kind of writing draws readers away from traditional media , we should be prepared for whatever PR mutates into to compensate .
When I think how hard PR firms work to score press hits in the traditional media , I can't imagine they 'll work any less hard to feed stories to bloggers , if they can figure out how .
Notes
[ 1 ] PR has at least one beneficial feature : it favors small companies .
If PR did n't work , the only alternative would be to advertise , and only big companies can afford that .
[ 2 ] Advertisers pay less for ads in free publications , because they assume readers ignore something they get for free .
This is why so many trade publications nominally have a cover price and yet give away free subscriptions with such abandon .
[ 3 ] Different sections of the Times vary so much in their standards that they 're practically different papers .
Whoever fed the style section reporter this story about suits coming back would have been sent packing by the regular news reporters .
[ 4 ]
The most striking example I know of this type is the " fact " that the Internet worm of 1988 infected 6000 computers .
I was there when it was cooked up , and this was the recipe : someone guessed that there were about 60,000 computers attached to the Internet , and that the worm might have infected ten percent of them .
Actually no one knows how many computers the worm infected , because the remedy was to reboot them , and this destroyed all traces .
But people like numbers .
And so this one is now replicated all over the Internet , like a little worm of its own .
[ 5 ] Not all were necessarily supplied by the PR firm .
Reporters sometimes call a few additional sources on their own , like someone adding a few fresh vegetables to a can of soup .
Thanks to Ingrid Basset , Trevor Blackwell , Sarah Harlin , Jessica Livingston , Jackie McDonough , Robert Morris , and Aaron Swartz ( who also found the PRSA article ) for reading drafts of this .
Correction : Earlier versions used a recent Business
Week article mentioning del.icio.us as an example of a press hit , but Joshua Schachter tells me it was spontaneous .
I so want this to be true

I love the idea of a younger John McCain yanking some dude out of his chair .
It would almost give me reason to like the guy , assuming the cause of the outburst was justified …
One of John McCain ’s Republican colleagues says he saw the presumed GOP presidential nominee roughly grab an associate of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and lift him out of his chair during a diplomatic mission to the Central American nation in 1987 [… ]
“ McCain was down at the end of the table and we were talking to the head of the guerrilla group here at this end of the table and I do n’t know what attracted my attention , ” [ Thad ] Cochran ( R - Miss . ) said in an interview with the Sun Herald in Biloxi , Miss .
“ But I saw some kind of quick movement at the bottom of the table and I looked down there and John had reached over and grabbed this guy by the shirt collar and had snatched him up like he was throwing him up out of the chair to tell him what he thought about him or whatever … ”
Man , I ’d love to know what that guy said to set off McCain , a guy with a temper that reportedly gets the better of him .
This “ Angry Johnny ” schtick is nothing new , because back when he was running against Bush in 2000 , Mac ’s temper was also an issue , so much that the Washington Post and The Arizona Republic felt it necessary to bring up .
In a front page article and separate editorial Sunday , The Arizona Republic said it wanted the nation to know about the “ volcanic ” temper McCain has unleashed on several top state officials .
It ’s apparently always been issue for Mac and something that we can’t help but discuss again during this race :
That temper has followed him throughout his life , McCain acknowledges .
He recalls in his writings how , as a toddler , he sometimes held his breath and fainted during moments of fury .
As the son of a naval officer who was on his way to becoming a four - star admiral , McCain found himself frequently uprooted and enrolled in new schools , where , as an underappreciated outsider , he developed “ a little bit of a chip on my shoulder , ” as he recalled this month .
During a campaign stop at Episcopal High School in Alexandria , the most famous graduate of the Class of 1954 opened a window on what swirled inside him during his school years .
“ I was always the new kid and was accustomed to proving myself quickly at each new school as someone not to be challenged lightly , ” he told students .
“ As a young man , I would respond aggressively and sometimes irresponsibly to anyone who I perceived to have questioned my sense of honor and self - respect .
Those responses often got me in a fair amount of trouble earlier in life . ”
He defied authority , ridiculed other students , sometimes fought .
The nicknames hung on him at Episcopal mocked his hair - trigger feistiness : “ Punk ” and “ McNasty . ”
Hoping to emulate his father and grandfather , also an admiral , he went on to the Naval Academy , where his pattern of unruliness and defiance continued , landing him near the bottom of his class .
“ I acted like a jerk , ” McCain wrote of the period before he righted himself to become a naval aviator , a Vietnam POW and eventually a career politician .
It is tough to know what set him off during this alleged incident in Nicaragua , but we can , however , be reasonably assured that the dude did not call his wife a “ cunt ” or a a “ trollup ” since that type of stuff is A - OK with Johnny Mac .
But talk about a muscular foreign policy …
So What Was The NES Select Button For ?
Note from racketboy :
You can definitely tell when Fastbilly1 is passionate about a topic … .
This time he shares his thoughts and research of an oft - overlooked component of the Nintendo Entertainment Systems , the Select Button .
Often it is shoved to the side , disregarded , or the target of outright hatred .
Many gamers do not believe it is useful and many more have never cared to think about it .
That little button , often right in the middle of the controller , called select always gets a “ bad rap . ”
Well being that I am currently on a NES kick I decided I would attempt to dispel some of the misguided hate toward this controller oddity .
The following is a list of games in which I have found that the select button is used ( be it in the Menu or in the game ) .
It is not a complete list but I think it is enough to finally put to rest the statement that the button is completely useless .
Whether or not it still need ’s to be on controllers apart from the NES is a whole other topic altogether .
I would like to remind everyone that this is not a definitive list and may possibly have factually inaccuracies .
If you have any comments or wish to add or correct , please comment .
This is mostly US NES games , if you have information for Japanese or European only releases I would love to hear them .

Integrity Bank of Alpharetta , Ga. , on Friday became the 10th United States bank to fail so far this year , hurt by the very business it was built on  real estate lending .
Regions Bank of Birmingham , Ala. , is assuming all of Integrity Bank ’s $ 974 million in insured and uninsured deposits in 23,000 accounts , and about $ 34.4 million of the bank ’s $ 1.1 billion in assets .
The remainder of Integrity ’s assets are being retained by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
The agency said it estimated that Integrity ’s failure would cost its deposit insurance fund $ 250 million to $ 350 million .
Integrity Bank , which opened for business in November 2000 , specialized in real estate lending in the Atlanta area with a self - described “ faith - based culture . ”
Throughout the early part of the decade when the housing market was booming , Integrity Bank grew into a billion - dollar publicly traded company  but when the real estate market started faltering , the bank struggled .

President Bush flies into London today for the last time as US leader .
In an exclusive and wide - ranging interview with Ned Temko on the eve of his visit , he defends his legacy , issues a stern warning to Iran ... and reveals his plans for a freedom institute devoted to ' universal values '
For a political leader who has rivalled Gordon Brown 's vertiginous nosedive in the opinion polls in the past year , president George W Bush looked remarkably untroubled by self - doubt as he crossed Europe last week .
The focus back home has shifted to the battle between Barack Obama and John McCain to succeed him .
But Bush , on his last European tour as American President , is determined to prosecute his foreign policy agenda for his final seven months in the White House .
Dealing aggressively with Iran , and its continuing nuclear aspirations , is top of the list .
Stabilising and rebuilding Iraq , staying the course in Afghanistan and building a ' unity ' alliance with key European leaders to achieve these goals are the other themes of the farewell trip .
At street level , the president 's visit to Slovenia , Germany , Italy , France and now Britain has sometimes had an almost surreal quality .
It is not just the politicians and pundits who seem to have begun shifting their gaze to a post - Bush era .
Despite a small scattering of demonstrations , with a further protest expected in London , there has been little of the fire and fury that greeted him at the height of the controversy over the Iraq invasion .
On the road to Fiumicino airport in Rome , where as in other capitals on his itinerary the police had far outnumbered any demonstrators , one taxi driver remarked : ' Bush has been very bad for my country . '
But when asked what he had against the US President , it was not climate change policy , Iraq or Guantánamo Bay : ' It 's the traffic ! '
Bush 's focus , as he made clear in a lengthy Observer interview before his arrival in London today for talks with Brown , has been on forging a broader relationship with Europe that moves on from the days of his close partnership with Tony Blair .
A united front is deemed vital to deal with what he sees as the West 's single most pressing policy challenge - heading off Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .
' All options , ' Bush has stated repeatedly , remain ' on the table ' if diplomacy fails to get Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to abandon Iran 's uranium enrichment programme .
On his way to London , Bush was pressing broadly sympathetic leaders in Berlin , Rome and Paris on that issue , as well as on the need to beef up allied support for the battle against the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan .
He may be on his way out next January , conceivably to be replaced by a Democratic candidate fiercely critical of his foreign - policy approach .
But Rome 's closed thoroughfares , the small army of secret - service agents and the motorcade waiting to speed Bush to a meeting with the Pope after the Observer interview offered a reminder that he still holds the most powerful political office in the world .
Bush has no regrets about how he has used that power .
Asked what he thinks his legacy might be , he says he is happy to await the verdict of history .
But he cannot resist also offering his own , suggesting ' the liberation of 50 million people from the clutches of barbaric regimes is noteworthy , at a minimum ' .
As the jacketless president expanded on his foreign policy strategy in the garden of the palatial 17th - century US ambassador 's residence on a Rome hilltop , he was keen to shift the focus away from the prospect of American military action against Iran .
His interest , he said , was in ' results ' - in demonstrating sufficient Western steel , through toughened economic and financial sanctions , to resolve the Iran issue diplomatically .
The real ' options on the table ' that should worry the world lay elsewhere - in the likelihood of moves by Iran 's Arab neighbours to develop nuclear weapons of their own .
He said the ' time is now ' for the outside world to put in place ' diplomacy with consequences ' to bring Iran 's uranium - enrichment activities to an end , not least because he believed that a new group of European leaders had ' gone beyond the Iraq period ' and were engaged with the US in multilateral efforts on a range of other issues .
In London , however , Iraq inevitably will be back on the agenda .
Today will begin for the President and the First Lady , Laura Bush , when they meet the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle , and will end with dinner with the Browns .
But tomorrow - after breakfast with an international Middle East envoy named Tony Blair - he will have formal Downing Street talks with Brown and discuss a ' timetable ' for British troop withdrawals from Iraq .
Asked in the Rome interview about popular opposition in Britain to the war and his presidency , he replied : ' Do I care ?
Only to the extent that it affects people 's view of the citizens I represent .
Do I care about my personal standing ?
Not really .'
He remained , he said , convinced that Iraq , and the world , was a better place without Saddam Hussein .
And he said that while ' Presidents do n't get to do re-dos ' on issues such as Saddam 's lack of weapons of mass destruction , there was one lesson from the run-up to the Iraq war that he felt was hugely relevant to the standoff in Iran .
' We did n't realise , nor did anyone else , ' Bush said , ' that Saddam Hussein felt like he needed to play like he had weapons of mass destruction .
It may have been , however , that in his mind all this was just a bluff ... that the world was n't serious . '
An aid agency has accused Greece of creating a " humanitarian crisis " for hundreds of illegal migrants detained on the Mediterranean island of Lesbos .
Medecins Sans Frontieres says about 800 migrants are living in overcrowded rooms in the detention centre without proper sanitation or medical care .
Greece has not commented but has previously said it is doing all it can to cope with a huge refugee influx .
It says nearly 10,000 would - be migrants were found on its shores last year .
The total was three times higher than the previous year , the government said .
Last week a separate humanitarian group , Medecins du Monde , accused Greece of neglecting 140 war refugees who had been evicted from their reception centre on the Aegean island of Patmos .
' Stagnant water '
Medecins Sans Frontieres said the migrants in the Lesbos centre were mostly from Africa and Afghanistan .
Yiorgos Karayiannis , head of the organisation 's migrant assistance programme for the country , told Reuters news agency the migrants were only allowed out for half an hour every two days and had to endure rooms clogged with stagnant water .
Mr Karayiannis said : " The situation is horrible from a medical point of view .
This is an urgent humanitarian crisis . "
He said MSF had been working at the centre for two months providing medical assistance and had seen a rise in migrant numbers from about 150 in June to about 800 now .
Last week , Medecins du Monde said 140 war refugees from the Palestinian territories , Afghanistan and Somalia were living rough on the streets of Patmos after being evicted .
They had been living in a cramped discotheque , but the government had not kept up with the rent , the charity said .
Greece has only six detention centres for illegal migrants and says it does not have sufficient resources to handle the influx .
Athens says illegal immigration is a pan-European problem and accuses Greece 's EU partners of not doing enough to support it on the front line .
A former Bush speechwriter and conservative columnist on Sarah Palin :
“ I think she has pretty thoroughly — and probably irretrievably — proven that she is not up to the job of being president of the United States , ” David Frum , a former speechwriter for President Bush who is now a conservative columnist , said in an interview .
“ If she does n’t perform well , then people see it .
“ And this is a moment of real high anxiety , a little bit like 9/11 , when people look to Washington for comfort and leadership and want to know that people in charge know what they are doing . ”

THEY rarely ring a bell at the bottom of bear markets .
Investors who thought they had heard a tinkling sound when Bear Stearns , a failing American investment bank , was bundled into JPMorgan Chase in March have been disappointed .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now weaker than it was in the spring ( see chart ) .
The American stockmarket had its worst month since 2002 in June and is now down more than 20 % from its peak , the definition of a bear market .
It is not alone .
According to Standard & Poor 's , a rating agency , the value of global stockmarkets fell by $ 3 trillion during the month , thanks in particular to a 10 % decline in emerging markets .
Share prices are suffering because of the outlook for four forces that impel stockmarkets : economic growth , profits growth , interest rates and inflation ( see article ) .
At the moment , the first two seem to be slowing while the last two are rising .
That is the worst possible combination .
Soaring oil and food prices are stoking inflation .
Oil closed at another peak of $ 144.14 a barrel on July 2nd , because of disappointing data on American crude reserves , and lingering fears that sabre - rattling between Israel and Iran might lead to conflict in the Persian Gulf .
High commodity prices have also acted as a terms - of - trade shock for consuming countries — the things they buy from abroad cost more compared with the things they export .
That has made them poorer .
The past six months could be seen as a dreary exercise in sharing out the pain .
Will workers suffer by seeing their wages rise more slowly than inflation ?
Will companies have to compensate their workers by raising wages , sacrificing their profit margins ?
Will central banks treat high commodity prices as a blip , and leave real interest rates low , penalising savers ?
Or will they raise interest rates and risk pushing the economy into recession ?
None of these choices is palatable .
All this has been made worse by the credit crunch .
True , the rescue of Bear Stearns seemed to avert the implosion of the financial system .
Credit spreads , which measure the excess interest rate paid by riskier borrowers , have fallen from their March peaks , although they have recently been rising again .
However , the crunch continues to chew its way through the system .
Its effects can be seen in the sharp falls in mortgage approvals in both America and Britain .
And it can also be seen in data produced by the Federal Reserve which show that loans made by banks ( their assets , in the jargon ) have fallen over the past three months .
This tightening in credit has taken so long to show up in the numbers because of the way that banks were operating before the summer of 2007 .
First , they had pushed much of their lending business off - balance - sheet , so that loans were bought by specialist entities like structured - investment vehicles ( SIVs ) and conduits .
When the market for subprime loans collapsed , a lot of these loans came back on to the banks ' balance - sheets .
Second , banks had made back - up commitments to businesses to lend money if needed .
With the collapse in other debt markets ( such as asset - backed commercial paper ) , corporate borrowers cashed in those chips .
Much as they would have wished otherwise , banks found their loan books expanding .
Now , chastened by the huge amounts of capital they have had to raise to strengthen their balance - sheets , banks are being more careful .
According to Ian Harnett of Absolute Strategy Research , a consultancy , the availability of credit in Europe for both consumers and companies is now at its lowest level since 2003 .
The problem for financial markets is that the virtuous circle which pushed asset prices higher in the middle of this decade may be turning vicious .
Banks lend money against the collateral of assets , most notably in the form of housing .
As house prices increase , the collateral rises in value and the banks are willing to lend more .
That enables buyers to bid up prices even further .
But when banks stop lending , buyers are unable to purchase assets .
Some investors are forced to sell to pay off loans .
The value of collateral falls , making banks even more reluctant to lend .
Markets freeze up , as neither buyers nor sellers have the confidence to do business .
As house prices fall in America , Britain , Ireland and Spain , the wealth effect kicks in .
George Magnus , a strategist at UBS , cites the examples of Finland and Sweden in the early 1990s .
As house prices fell , personal - savings rates jumped by 12 - 14 percentage points .
A similar move in America or Britain would have a devastating effect on consumer demand , and thus on GDP growth over the next couple of years .
As yet , there has been more of an effect on consumer sentiment than actual retail sales , although individual retailers ( such as Britain 's Marks & Spencer ) are suffering .
As for companies , with consumers depressed and banks unwilling to lend , why should they invest ?
They may still see exports as a source of economic growth , but that works only for some firms in individual countries , not for those in the world as a whole .
So the market 's sorrows have come in battalions , not single spies .
Investors might have coped with the credit crunch if it were not for the high commodity prices , and vice versa .
They do not know whether to fear inflation or recession more , but they know that both at once will be unpleasant .
It looks like a lengthy period of gloom is in store for the stockmarkets .
Meanwhile , the best investors can do is hope , Micawber - like , that something will turn up .
A collapse in oil prices would help .
DIGG THIS
I ’m fully aware that Paulson and Bernanke have some nefarious scheme in mind to reverse the thrilling defeat of their criminal bailout package , a package shot down by independent members of Congress on both sides .
But reflect for a few minutes on what it means that the House did this .
It was a revolutionary act in the best sense of that term .
The entire establishment was united in favor of what was surely the most horrible and outrageous bill to ever come before Congress .
The Fed , the Treasury , leadership of the Democrats and Republicans , the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times , all the major think tanks , most talking heads , the wealthiest corporations , important academics — in short , the whole of the power elite — were united in favor of this awful thing that proposed the following : Americans were to be stripped of their earnings and their future to prop up failed enterprises .
Forget back - door socialism : this was right through the front door .
The consequences would have been dreadful and very scary .
It was to be the first of many bailouts , since of course it cannot and would not work .
Bad debts ca n’t be made good by legislation .
This means that more money would be necessary , as the middle class was sucked dry by the vampire state for years to come .
Deeper and deeper economic depression — a repeat of the 30s — was certain .
Best to put a stop to this now .
The administration might have tried to do its wicked deeds through executive order rather than asking Congress .
But there are two problems here .
One is that they would n’t be able to share the blame when the plan flops .
The other is economic .
The Fed and Treasury are actually very worried that they are incapable of injecting more credit into a banking structure averse to lending right now .
They would rather have the congress authorize the money directly and run up the debt .
In any case , no matter how you look at it , the defeat of the bill is a victory for freedom .
The defeat of the power elite is essential for liberty to thrive .
For the free market to function , we need the government / corporate cabal to lose its capacity to get its way in every area of life .
They need to feel fear .
They need to lose security .
They need to have a sense of uncertainty as to whether their every wish is our command .
The House defeat of the bailout is a magnificent rebuke in that sense .
But does it mean that the economy is going to tank and we will all suffer ?
On the contrary , it could mean that we can begin an economic recovery from the Fed - generated bubble that should have and would have burst years ago but for artificial props by the Fed .
If the stock prices of these troubled institutions can fall to where they need to be , they can be taken over , and their assets used productively and traded by the market .
Once this deleveraging takes place , we will be ready for a new round of economic growth .
You have to understand how ridiculous this whole debate looks to anyone who understands the price system .
Let ’s change the example from houses to apples to see how silly it is to suggest that falling prices can be made to rise .
Let ’s say that the Fed created an apple hysteria that drove the price from $ 3 per pound to $ 10 .
Stores loaded up and even used them as collateral for expansion .
Suddenly the price collapsed to $ 5 and finally to $ 2 .
Now government takes notice .
What can government do to deal with the problem ?
It can try to boost the price of apples by forcing stores to raise their prices .
But what about consumers ?
They wo n’t buy at $ 10 .
So the apples sit and rot .
Maybe government should buy them all or force consumers to buy them .
Also perhaps stores will just not buy any more at all .
Government could force them to .
But it ca n’t force them to stay in business .
People can always walk away .
So perhaps government can just buy the stores , all in the interest of keeping the price of apples up .
But it will have to buy the apple - leveraged stores at a much higher price than the market would offer , so this is a bad economic deal on the face of it .
The tangles can get ever more complicated and billions and trillions can be spent .
You can put everyone in a prison camp and force people at the point of a gun to buy and sell apples at $ 10 .
But in the end , the problem is still the same : the price of apples wants to fall .
Nothing government does changes that one fact .
To attempt to change it is like trying to change gravity .
Of course , the government ’s central bank can raise all prices through inflation to the point that apples do in fact cost $ 10 , but this is purely cosmetic .
In fact , in real terms , the price of apples is still $ 2 .
It is a pointless and destructive activity to try changing this .
You only cause massive damage in the attempt .
More great things happened after the bailout failed .
Commodity prices including oil fell dramatically .
This is a magnificent thing .
Right now , consumers are not threatened by the possible failure of another paper - addicted investment - banking house .
Consumers are threatened by ever - higher prices for all goods .
If we are in a recession , especially if it lasts and lasts , low prices are precisely what we need to start economic recovery again .
It is not entirely clear why prices fall .
It could be the worldwide economic slowdown .
It could be that the markets are beginning to doubt the capacity of the Fed to actually achieve the hyperinflation that it wants , since banks have become quite risk averse .
In any case , we need ever - lower prices on all things , including gas and groceries — and , yes , houses .
This is the basis for economic recovery .
The failure of the bailout bill was the precondition for economic recovery .
It should make believers in liberty realize that we can change history , that tyranny is not our fate , that the leviathan state can be beaten back .
Recently we have urged readers to look to books on money and banking .
Now it is time to look at books like the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude by 17th - century French writer tienne de La Botie .
It was his view that the state is the least plausible institution on earth , one that would be overthrown in a day but for propaganda and ideological error .
He explained all this in his book , introduced by Murray Rothbard .
We just so happen to have a new edition out .
Yesterday was one of the worst days in decades for the power elite .
It was one of the best for liberty .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
“ It does not matter how sharp you sharpen a buzz saw that is set at the wrong angle .
It will not cut straight . ” ~ Cornelius Van Til .
When the best and the brightest investors in the world lose $ 500 billion in one year in one market segment — mortgages — this raises a question :
What can the rest of us do to keep from losing our shirts ?
Add to this another $ 500 billion in losses to non-bank firms as a result of the credit crunch .
This total — a trillion dollars — is the estimate of the International Monetary Fund .
Are the losses winding down ?
Hardly .
“ It just keeps spreading from one asset to another , so it ’s hard to know when these writedowns will stop , ” said Makeem Asif , an analyst at KBC Financial Products in London .
“ The U.S. economy needs to stabilize first .
But even then , Europe could lag and recover later .
There ’s still a lot more downside . ”
The extent of the losses in some of the largest banks and financial institutions is only now coming to light .
When you think that Citicorp , America ’s largest bank , has lost over $ 55 billion in the last year as a result of subprime mortgage losses , you begin to get a sense that all is not well .
Merrill Lynch lost $ 52 billion .
UBS , the Swiss bank , lost $ 44 billion .
On and on the list goes .
For a list of which organizations have lost how much money , click here .
Recently , I read a book by Charles R. Morris .
It is titled , The Trillion Dollar Meltdown .
It was published a few months ago .
He had foreseen the breakdown of the capital markets in early 2007 , and he had begun writing a book about this .
The problem was , the credit crisis of August 2007 speeded up the timetable .
He was trying to get the book out , and events were unfolding so fast that he was having trouble completing the manuscript .
The book is a good summary of the basics of the capital markets crisis .
It explains how the expansion of fiat money under Greenspan led to a series of extremely bad investment decisions .
These highly leveraged investments now threaten to unwind erratically and unpredictably .
On pages 130 and 131 , he provides a breakdown of the problem areas .
He is way too conservative .
For residential mortgages , he projects a loss of $ 450 billion .
That loss is already at $ 500 billion , and from the looks of it , there is at least another $ 500 billion to go .
I believe another trillion dollars of losses will be generated over the next three years .
Then there is corporate debt .
The estimated loss here he puts at $ 345 billion .
For other forms of collateralized debt , which is heavily leveraged , he estimates $ 215 billion of losses .
His total of $ 1 trillion today now seems extremely conservative .
We are already there , according to the IMF .
I think that in any updated edition of the book , he is going to have to increase this estimate by at least 50 % , and that is because he is a fairly conventional , fairly conservative fellow .
I think he should increase the estimate by at least 100 % .
I may be too conservative .
THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST
The American stock market has taken the news of these losses and has shrugged it off .
The market is down only about 20 % or less since October 2007 .
Investors seem to think that a trillion dollars of losses imposed on the economy by decisions made by the best and the brightest can be shrugged off .
The best and the brightest who still make the decisions on the allocation of American capital do n’t think the errors of their intellectual and career peers amount to all that much .
They are incorrect .
The extent to which they are incorrect will be played out over the next three or four years .
The estimated loss in the mortgage market is $ 500 billion .
The losses are not yet finished .
The subprime losses seem to be slowing , but no one has suggested that all of the losses are behind us .
They say the worst of the losses are behind us , but not all of them .
So , month by month , we can be sure that the financial press will report that another bank or another financial institution has lost another billion dollars or $ 2 billion or $ 5 billion .
We will be assured , once again , that the worst is behind us .
Next on the daisy chain of disaster are the Alt - A mortgage loans .
These loans are the loans that are considered one notch above the subprime loans .
There are at least $ 500 billion of Alt - A loans .
The total is probably even larger .
Also beginning to disintegrate is what are known as pay - option ARMs .
I have discussed this before .
These are what used to be called backward - walking mortgages .
The borrower is not required to make a monthly payment that covers the repayment of principal , interest , and insurance .
It may cover only a third of the payment on the principal .
Then , without warning , the borrower is notified by the lender that the loan has re-set , and his new monthly payment is three times higher than his previous monthly payment .
At this point , he begins to fall behind on his monthly payments .
At present , 48 % of all those notified that their payments have increased are behind on their mortgage payments .
But this is only the early stage of the re-sets .
The re-sets will be going on for the next five years .
They will escalate sharply through 2009 all the way through 2011 .
This market is in the range of $ 600 billion .
About 60 % of these loans were made in California .
So , you think that California real estate is a disaster zone this year .
Come back in three years and see what is going on .
The unraveling of all of these mortgage loans caught the lenders by surprise .
Despite numerous warnings in the contrarian newsletter field , the best and the brightest in the richest and most successful financial institutions and banks in the United States encouraged these loans in 2004 and 2005 .
Alan Greenspan publicly encouraged these loans .
The smart money was unbelievably stupid money .
They stuck their own investors into disasters .
They sucked large European banks into disasters .
The man who saw this most clearly and wrote about it constantly for seven years was Dr. Kurt Richebächer .
He wrote from 2001 to 2007 that Greenspan ’s easy money policies would produce the worst recession since the Great Depression .
He was convinced that fiat money was leading the best and the brightest of American financial experts into making loans that would inevitably blow up in their faces .
Of course , that means that the loans will blow up in our faces .
Every month , his newsletter warned that this mania for debt could not be sustained for much longer .
The problem is , he kept saying this , but nothing happened .
People dismissed him as someone who was old - fashioned .
He died in August of 2007 , the month that his predictions began to come true .
That was the month that the credit markets of the West froze up .
WHAT WENT WRONG ?
I do not call these people the best and the brightest out of a sense of skepticism .
I am not skeptical about their intelligence .
I am skeptical about the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve System , which led the best and the brightest into a series of investments that have collapsed .
The reason why these people made such catastrophic errors is because they were lured into believing that fiat money issued by the Federal Reserve System , which produced below - market rates of interest , in fact pointed to a new era .
This new era would bring endless capital appreciation and endless economic growth without a major recession and without major financial losses to the institutions that invested in terms of the false economic signals that the Federal Reserve System was issuing .
The problem was not the lack of intelligence of these renowned experts in finance .
Their problem was that they had never heard of Austrian School economics .
They did not believe , as Austrian School economists have believed for 90 years , that central bank policies of monetary inflation produce a boom , and that this boom will always be followed by a bust .
They believed , as textbook writers in the field of economics and finance have universally preached , that the decision - makers at the Federal Reserve System are the best and the brightest people in the history of finance .
The textbooks are completely favorable to the Federal Reserve System .
So , Maestro Greenspan had no critics in Congress other than Ron Paul , a physician , and Jim Bunning , a former baseball pitcher .
They were right .
Greenspan was wrong .
So far , the economy has lost a trillion dollars in capital just from the subprime loan fallout .
The media have begun to speak about the losses that are going to take place on the other mortgage instruments collapse .
They are not yet talking about the economic setback from the recession which is also a product of Greenspan ’s policies of monetary expansion .
The best and the brightest are like very sharp buzz saws .
It does n’t matter how sharp they are ; they cut crooked .
EXTREME COMPLEXITY
One of the most important insights of Austrian School economics is the fact that the free market is extraordinarily complex .
It is so complex that no single individual , no committee , and no computer program can account for more than a tiny fraction of the factors that drive a modern economy .
The Nobel Prize - winning economist , Friedrich Hayek , made this the central point of his writings from 1948 until 1985 .
He died in 1992 .
In his Nobel Prize speech , he focused on this aspect of the market .
The market has enormous quantities of relevant knowledge , but it is only through the private property social order and the free interplay of pricing that society can become the beneficiary of the knowledge of the masses of individuals .
Hayek ’s outlook , like Austrian School economics generally , was hostile to the concept of central economic planning .
There is no possible way that a committee of salaried bureaucrats can plan an entire economy .
The best and the brightest , no matter how good and no matter how bright , cannot possibly match the knowledge that is produced by all participants in the society who are deciding day by day what to buy , what to hold , and what to sell .
Think of the famous lyric of the great country western song , “ The Gambler . ”
You ’ve got to know when to hold ’em ; know when to fold ’em ; know when to walk away ; know when to run .
This is exactly what we ’ve got to know .
This is exactly what the central planning agency has to know .
But it cannot possibly know this .
There are too many decision - makers , who own too much property , who face too many different local situations , for any central planner to come close to understanding what drives the economy , moment by moment , let alone far into the future .
The best and the brightest in the investment world do their best to figure out when to buy , hold , and sell .
If they are deliberately misinformed by the rate of interest , because the Federal Reserve is tampering with the rate of interest , the best and the brightest will drive the economy off the road .
This is what has happened .
What about the rest of us ?
We are not graduates of the best business schools .
We did not get recruited by large New York banks at the age of 25 .
We have not spent 30 years monitoring specific markets .
We do not share information with other people who are equally well - trained , and equally experienced , who work in the same large multinational bank .
How are we expected to allocate our capital when the best and the brightest lose $ 500 billion by investing in subprime loans that no one in his right mind should have invested a dollar in ?
It is only the best and the brightest who can be suckered by the Federal Reserve so completely as to invest in anything as stupid as subprime loans .
It took extremely smart people , using extremely detailed computer programs , designed by brilliant experts in mathematics , to make investment decisions as utterly wrongheaded as these people made in the mortgage industry .
We have barely begun to see the extent of the stupidity of these loans .
Decisions made by the salaried bureaucrats employed by the Federal Reserve System , because these decisions affect the decisions made by the best and the brightest , have a leverage effect .
I do n’t just mean leverage in terms of debt , although that is extremely significant .
I mean leverage in terms of concentrating bad information in one location : the federal funds rate .
Then the misinformation spreads rapidly through the financial sector , which is a good old boys network , run by people who graduated from the same expensive graduate schools , who spend time talking with people just like themselves .
This is true leverage .
It compounds ignorance .
It spreads ignorance rapidly through the entire financial section because nobody stands at the information gateway and says : “ Stop ! ”
There is not much leverage of this kind in a free market .
Decision - making is decentralized .
It is also highly competitive .
People with different views put their money where their mouths are .
Also , in a society without fractional reserve banking and central banking , there is no pyramiding of money on top of a small base of government debt .
In a society in which everyone is allowed to buy and sell with gold coins , and everyone can go down to his bank and trade his passbook savings account entries for gold coins , there is not much financial leverage .
Debt is limited , and the sources of money are decentralized .
So , a mistake made by one lender will not be made by competing lenders .
There are always mistakes , but the mistakes are offset by profits generated by lenders who accurately forecasted the state of the market .
We do not live in such a world .
That world has been systematically taken away from us since the creation of the Bank of England in 1694 .
A steady movement of politics and education away from decentralization and personal responsibility has destroyed the levers of power that used to be held by consumers and depositors in banks .
Everything has moved in the direction of the centralization of power , the centralization of decision - making , the centralization of credit .
The great winners have been the best and the brightest in the largest financial institutions .
But these winners are now being publicly exposed as incomparable losers .
The trouble is , we lose with them .
A WAY OUT ?
Everyone is looking for a way out of the unraveling of the mortgage market .
This unraveling is now spreading to other segments of the credit markets .
There is a crisis in municipal bonds .
Banks are tightening credit requirements for business loans , consumer loans , and even credit card loans .
This is much needed , but it is like locking the barn door after the horses have escaped .
Bernanke drones on endlessly in his testimony before Congress about how the Federal Reserve is now overseeing new systems to monitor credit .
Too late .
His predecessor , Mr. Greenspan , should have imposed these new , supposedly stringent controls in 1987 .
He did n’t .
Instead , he inflated .
The economy recovered , and the world cheered for the Maestro .
Now the economy is going over a cliff .
The Maestro is retired .
Bernanke is in charge .
He will take the blame .
There is going to be plenty of blame .
The general public knows nothing of this .
The general public simply trusts the people who are in charge .
The general public thinks that The best and the brightest really are running the show .
The best and the brightest are running the show .
That is the problem .
A tiny handful of investors have figured out that something is radically wrong with the capital markets of the United States , and maybe the entire world .
This was what Dr. Richebächer said for at least seven years .
These little people , who read the obscure e-mail letters , and who visit obscure blog sites , have a better sense of the nature of the looming crisis than the best than the brightest have .
The best and the brightest keep telling us that the worst is behind us .
People who read the newsletters snicker .
Month after month , the people who read the newsletters turn out to be correct .
CONCLUSION
We are told by the best and the brightest economists that deficits do n’t matter .
We have been told by the best and the brightest political scientists who write the textbooks that , with respect to national debt , “ we owe it to ourselves . ”
I loan you $ 500 , but we owe it to ourselves .
Americans are taxed 15 % of their wages to fund Social Security ’s so - called trust fund , which is filled with non-marketable IOUs from the U.S. Treasury .
Voters shrug it off .
“ Who cares ?
We owe it to ourselves . ”
On Thursday , August 21 , 400 theaters in the United States are going to show a movie produced by Bill Bonner ’s Agora organization .
It is called “ I.O.U.S.A . ”
After the showing of the movie , there is going to be a live discussion with Warren Buffett and other experts in finances .
What this movie shows is that deficits do matter .
Deficits across the board matter .
We live in an economy that is entirely founded on debt , and we now face a national debt is growing so rapidly that there is going to be a default .
For a list of theaters nationally that will be showing this movie , click here .

Global Warming May Up Kidney Stone Risk : Study
While new research points to a link , some experts say bigger worries exist .
July 15 , 2008  --
For four years , Sue May of Valdosta , Ga. , lived with the pain of four minuscule fragments of stone - hard minerals in her kidney .
And according to May , now 64 , an experience with kidney stones is just as painful as it sounds .
" You feel horrible , " May says .
" When you have this , it 's a constant infection , and a lot of pain that goes along with it .
" Sometimes it felt like someone had drilled through my back and into my kidney . "
May eventually underwent a 2 ½ - hour procedure to rid herself of the stones .
Today she feels much better -- but relief came at a price .
The surgery alone cost $ 20,000 .
Now , a study released Monday suggests that as global warming causes temperatures to rise , Americans living in certain areas of the country may suffer from as many as 30 percent more kidney stones by the year 2050 -- and treatment costs for the condition could spike by hundreds of millions of dollars each year .
The findings are published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We 're quite confident that kidney stone prevalence is related to climate , " says lead study author Tom Brikowski , associate professor of geology at the University of Texas at Dallas .
" We 're certain that warming will continue and we 're certain that it 's going to accelerate , " he says .
" We can certainly say that it 's going to be a significant effect . "
But some health and environment experts wonder whether the finding will be lost in the shuffle when compared with other , arguably more frightening aspects of global warming .
Does Kidney Stone Risk Rise With the Mercury ?
Brikowski , whose wife is a veterinarian , says he first suspected that heat might be related to kidney stone formation after his wife noted an increase in kidney stones in the animals she treated during a long drought .
He says the spike in kidney stones reported in troops deployed to Middle Eastern deserts offered further evidence of the connection .
In his study , Brikowski says fluid loss through excess sweating explains the link between hot climate and kidney stones .
More water loss through perspiration means more concentrated urine -- and more concentrated urine means a higher risk of kidney stones .
Of course , there are many reasons for kidney stones .
As for May , her kidney stones were not caused by warm weather ; they were the result of a heart catheter infection that had spread throughout her body , eventually infecting her kidneys and causing the stones to form .
Still , some researchers who study the potential health effects of global warming say the new research offers intriguing clues to yet another connection between climate change and human health .
" I have not seen any other studies before that looked specifically at kidney stones and climate change , but it is a finding that would be consistent with dehydration across the population if people were exposed more frequently to larger heat waves , " says Dr. Jonathan Patz , a professor in the department of population health sciences and the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
Public May Shrug Off the Stones
But considering the myriad of frightening predictions that accompany most any discussion on the impacts of global warming on human health -- from monster hurricanes to famine to the unchecked spread of infectious diseases -- kidney stones may seem somewhat tame .
" I do n't think you can compare it to something globally like malaria , which kills 2 million people per year , most of whom are children , " he says .
And he adds that singling out kidney stones as yet another consequence of global warming could be the wrong approach when it comes to communicating effectively with the public .
" When you focus on the health effects of climate change , it might be wrong to pick out single outcomes and be overly focused on those , " he says .
It is a point with which Kristi Ebi agrees .
" The study is suggestive of the idea that kidney stones are a risk that people have not considered in the past , " says Ebi , lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report and an independent consultant on the health effects of global climate change .
She says that she would have liked for the research to include some sense of whether these additional cases of kidney stones would be preventable .
" For a lot of health issues , at some point people just tune it out , " Ebi says .
" There seem to be these phases we go through .
We hear that this causes cancer and that causes cancer .
At one point , the public says 'everything causes cancer , and I 'm not going to worry about it . '
This is not effective risk communication . "
Brikowski acknowledges that this research is still in its primary phases , and that the exact toll of global warming in the form of kidney stones begs for further elucidation .
Still , he notes , this connection may well just scratch the surface of many other human health effects brought about by widespread climate change .
And with these new revelations , he says , health and climate experts will likely begin working more closely to assess these impacts .
" We 're going to see more of these unusual collaborations , " he says .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
At least nine climbers were reported dead on Sunday on K - 2 , the world ’s second highest mountain , after an avalanche struck them on a steep gully at a height of nearly 27,000 feet , just below the summit .
Those who perished included South Koreans and Nepalese , the Pakistani television station ARY reported .
Serbian , Norwegian , Dutch and French climbers were also believed to be among those who might have died , according to ARY .
Other climbers are feared to be missing .
The death toll appears to be the largest ever on K - 2 .
The accident occurred when a chunk of ice from an ice pillar snapped on Friday , breaking fixed ropes on the area of the peak , just below the summit , known as the Bottleneck , according to expedition organizers .
A team of South Korean climbers were on their way down from the summit , according to Ghulam Mohammad , the owner of Blue Sky Travels and Tours .
He said five members of the Korean team perished and two Nepalese died .
The nationalities of the others who died was not clear .
Several expeditions were on the mountain over the weekend , and some reports said about a dozen climbers were stranded at Bottleneck , a region known as the “ Death Zone ” because bodies begin degenerating from lack of oxygen .
Climbers stuck above Bottleneck would be unable to descend because of the broken ropes , according to expedition organizers .
Guards Go Stiff at Local Army Base
I have heard stories about local police departments using empty parked cruisers to scare drivers into obeying the speed limit , but this is the first I have heard of an Army base pulling the same trick .
Locals in TaoYuan Province , Taiwan , noticed that the guards around a local Army base always seemed to stand in the same position without moving .
Curious , some locals went in closer to inspect the soldiers and were shocked at what they found .
The soldiers were actually dummies dressed up as soldiers and armed with fake rifles .
As the news spread , many locals began visiting the Army base to see the fake soldiers .
An official from the base explained that the reason they assigned fake soldiers to posts was due to a manpower shortage .
They figured the fake soldiers would be sufficient in scaring away any attackers .
The Army base has now removed the dummy soldiers after being harshly criticized for the “ ridiculous act ” .

Long controversial for its aggressive evangelism aimed at those with a troubled past -- ex-convicts and drug addicts among them -- the Anaheim - based Christian motorcycle gang known as the Set Free Soldiers found itself in deeper trouble Wednesday when its leader and half a dozen members were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder .
The arrests , which followed a double stabbing in a brawl with the Hells Angels at a Newport Beach bar July 27 , was the latest brush with the law for the group of black - leather - clad bikers , which has straddled the line between Christian outreach group and outlaw motorcycle gang .
By late Wednesday , authorities had arrested 10 members of the Set Free Soldiers and the Hells Angels during raids in Anaheim , Costa Mesa and Rancho Santa Margarita that started at 5 a.m. , said Sgt. Evan Sailor of the Newport Beach Police Department .
The operation involved more than 150 officers , including SWAT teams and federal drug enforcement agents .

Seven members of the Set Free Soldiers , including leader Phil Aguilar , 60 , have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder and are each being held on $ 1 - million bail , police said .
Three members of the Hells Angels are also in custody , including John Phillip Lloyd , a 41 - year - old Costa Mesa man charged with assault with a deadly weapon .
The other two were arrested on drug charges .
Others are still being sought on arrest warrants .
The arrests stemmed from a 15 - person brawl at the Newport Beach bar Blackie ’s by the Sea , where Set Free members allegedly stabbed two Hells Angels members .

During the brawl , the Hells Angels also allegedly struck one of the Set Free in the head with a pool ball .
On its website , which appeared to have been taken down Wednesday evening , Set Free Soldiers call themselves “ a group of men who love Jesus and love to ride hard . ”
“ We are not your normal motorcycle club , ” the statement reads .
“ Some say we are too good for the bad guys , and too bad for the good guys . ”
Aguilar , a Harley - riding ex-convict and former drug addict who served time for child abuse in the 1970s , converted to Christianity in prison .
He became the founding pastor of Set Free Worldwide Ministries in 1982 .
But he and his ministry have been highly controversial .

His MySpace.com page describes Aguilar as pastor or “ the Chief ” of the group .
Next to his photo is the statement : “ Sinner or Saint you be the judge ! ”
Police said that through its ministry , the gang recruited people discharged from parole , state prison and county jails and has an outreach program for convicted felons .
Although Set Free has been praised for its streetwise approach , its detractors say it is an autocratic organization that exerts too much control over its members by confiscating their belongings and forcing them to break off relationships with friends and families .
Law enforcement officials and former members say that the group has devolved into a motorcycle gang like any other , and that it has ties to the Mongols , an outlaw biker gang that has engaged in warfare with the Hells Angels .

Set Free chapters in the Midwest have provided security at Mongol funerals , said Steve Cook , an Independence , Mo. , police officer and president of the Midwest Outlaw Motorcycle Gang Investigators Assn .
“ It is an outlaw club , ” Cook said .
“ Their supposed Christian affiliation does n’t change my opinion . ”
A former Set Free member said Aguilar has performed Mongol weddings and officiated at their funerals .
The man , who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation , said he left the group about five years ago when Aguilar began taking the church in a new direction and started recruiting tattooed bikers .
Some members carry guns , he said .
“ Phil always wanted to be somebody in the outlaw biker world , and he ’s been hiding behind the cross for a long time , ” the former member said .
“ When he began recruiting members , he figured the badder they were the better . ”

Members of other Christian motorcycle groups said they are afraid Set Free ’s troubles will give them all a bad name .
“ It puts all of us Christian bikers in a negative light , that all of a sudden we ’re gangs too , ” said Radawn McKinney , vice president of a motorcycle ministry based in Orange .
“ We ’re not all thugs and do n’t have gang behavior .
We have to go out and do God ’s work . ”
Despite Set Free ’s hard - core reputation -- its website features videos of members in fistfights -- some who have worked with the group were surprised at the gravity of the charges .
Sandie Moore , 52 , a retired nurse who lives in Fountain Valley , said Wednesday ’s arrests shocked her .
She said she had worked with Aguilar ’s group on charity events for organizations such as the Children ’s Hospital of Orange County , where they had provided security .

“ What I saw today is far , far , far from how I know them , ” Moore said .
“ I ca n’t believe they are being portrayed as thugs .
I think maybe some of them who have n’t corrected their ways got rowdy , but their behavior is totally contrary to how they acted in front of me . ”
Carol Cantiberos , 47 , of Buena Park , a Set Free member who lived at one of its group homes in Anaheim for three weeks and goes to its church services every Saturday , said Aguilar and the gang helped her stay sober for the last 86 days .
“ He does n’t ask you about your history or what you ’ve done bad ; he just accepts you with open arms , ” she said .
“ I do n’t believe he would do anything unless he was protecting himself , because he ’s turned around . ”
But news of the raid was no surprise to Rose Lambie , 65 , who lives three houses down from one of the four South Archer Street homes in Anaheim that were targeted .
Aguilar owns several houses in the 300 block of South Archer .

Aguilar , she said , is well - known and the gang had “ taken over the neighborhood in a lot of ways . ”
She said the gang has a history of intimidating neighbors , who had met with one another and with police to raise concerns about their behavior .
Ronald Enroth , a sociology professor at Westmont College in Santa Barbara who featured Set Free in his 1992 book “ Churches That Abuse , ” said the group is a “ control - centered , authoritarian organization ” that has displayed cult - like behavior , even as it cozied up to mainstream evangelical groups and Aguilar appeared on Trinity Broadcasting Network programs .
“ They feel they ’re reaching a kind of person the larger religious community can’t reach , ” Enroth said .
“ A lot of people on the margins of society may have been helped , but they are not always aware of the tentacles that an organization like this can have on their lives . ”

Hezbollah explains ‘ Arab Spring ’ to residents of West Beirut
Now that the Beijing games have wound up , we can get on to a sporting event with real significance : a Neocon Olympics to decide the most grossly wrong , stupid prediction by a Neocon pundit post - Iraq .
Of course , it ’s a very rich field .
Being totally wrong about absolutely everything is the Neocons ’ job , and they ’ve been working overtime on it .
Their proudest moment had to be in the lead - up to the Iraq war when Kenneth Adelman assured America that democratizing Iraq would be “ a cakewalk . ”
Indeed , early Neocons like Adelman and Richard Perle ( who predicted that Iraq would settle down “ at the first whiff of gunpowder ” ) set the bar for disastrously wrong predictions so high that some have suggested that the trophy be retired in their honor .
But doing that would mean shutting out all the more recent Neocon predictions .
Their little mistakes may not have cost as many trillions of dollars and thousands of lives as Adelman and Perle ’s , but give them time .
They ’re doing their best to push us into more disastrous wars , and with team spirit like theirs , they may yet succeed .
Here are the top contenders :
1. “ The Arab Spring Is Happening Now ” by Abe Greenwald , Pajamas Media .
There are many unintentionally funny aspects of this April 13 , 2008 , article , such as the fact that two of the countries Greenwald cites approvingly , Turkey and Pakistan , are n’t Arab at all .
But as with all good comedy , it ’s the timing that makes this article such a winner .
To see the joke , you have to remember that Neocons have been predicting an “ Arab Spring ” for years , in which democracy , once we ’d introduced it to Iraq , would spread like a weed all over the Middle East .
Greenwald acknowledges that he and his friends were wrong to claim that “ spring ” would happen in 2005 , but , he assures his gullible readers , they were just a little premature .
It ’s coming right now , he gushes , that blessed spring — it ’s just a little late .
Democracy is busting out all over , especially in Lebanon !
The article ’s subhead cited Lebanon ’s “ Cedar Revolution ” as a sure sign of spring — the first Arab robin of the Arab spring , as it were — and the story featured a photo of a Lebanese woman wearing face paint in the shape of the Lebanese national flag .
Now the punch line :
Less than four weeks after the article appeared , the pro-Syrian Shia militia Hezbollah took over West Beirut , the wealthy seaside district that harbored most of the overpublicized “ Cedar Revolution ” demonstrators who were the basis of Greenwald ’s prediction .
What made the takeover particularly demoralizing for the Neocons , who regard Iran - backed Hezbollah as Hitler - by - proxy , is that none of the local militias offered more than token resistance .
Hezbollah literally walked through Beirut to the sea without meeting resistance , destroyed a TV station that had broadcast hostile stories , and , after its demands were met , walked back out again .
The Arab Spring was indefinitely postponed ; the Arab groundhog had seen his shadow .
Of course , this was n’t about “ democracy , ” nor was it the disaster the Neocons claimed it was .
Hezbollah represents the Lebanese Shia , the poorest and most despised ethnic group in the country .
Their victory is n’t necessarily bad news unless you ’re dishonest enough to pretend that the wealthy West Beirut elite that shows up to those “ Cedar Revolution ” rallies that get so much Western press really represent “ democracy . ”
They did n’t care much about democracy when it was the Shia who were being excluded for generations from the Lebanese polity , and they do n’t care about it now .
Their goal is to maintain their privileged position ; no more , no less .
What Hezbollah ’s victory meant was that a new power , hostile ( for very good reason ) to Israel and the United States , had triumphed — and that Neocon prognostications had been wrong again .
And not just wrong , but comically wrong — so ludicrously wrong that in any other country in the world , someone guilty of such a disastrous misreading would be banned for life from the press .
Not here , though ; Greenwald continues to make stunningly foolish pronouncements every week .
Punishment is reserved for those , like weapons inspector Scott Ritter , who dare to be right when all the Neocon pundits are wrong .
For being right about the fact that Iraq had no WMDs , Ritter was subjected by Pajamas Media to a classic right - wing character assassination , “ Scott Ritter : Anti-War Problem Child . ”
That hit piece appeared on May 3 , three weeks after Greenwald predicted the coming of the Arab Spring and three days before Hezbollah took over West Beirut .
2. “ Hail Mauritania ! ” by James Kirchick , Weekly Standard .
Kirchick may not be the most famous Neocon , but in one obscure column he encapsulated their key trait : arrogant predictions , based on total ignorance , which prove to be disastrously wrong .
Iraq , of course , is the classic example .
On May 7 , 2007 , Kirchick wrote a cheery , optimistic column called ( believe it or not ) “ Hail Mauritania , ” in which he gushed that democracy had “ bloomed ” in this “ remote corner of the Arab world ” because they ’d held “ democratic elections . ”
Then history supplied the punch line :
Three months later , on Aug. 6 , the Mauritanian army overthrew the winner of that glorious election , and democracy had suddenly un -bloomed .
To date , Kirchick has not commented on that unexpected and irksome twist .
Kirchick was n’t just unlucky in his prediction ; it was absurd from the start .
Nobody who knew anything about Mauritania could have imagined that simply because the local elite had cynically embraced the facade of American - style elections , the country would suddenly transform into a peaceful democracy .
Only willful ignorance could sustain that notion .
Obama is right ; these people really are “ proud to be ignorant . ”
In fact , they ’re desperate to remain ignorant , especially about the fact that elections , in themselves , mean very little .
Weekly Standard ’s dream for Georgia
Fetishizing elections as good in themselves is a common Neocon fallacy .
They ’re a long way from understanding what Iraq expert Nir Rosen meant when he warned after the 2006 elections in Iraq ( another false dawn that had the Neocons crowing until their cheers were drowned out by IEDs going off ) that “ democracy is more than just a formal process , it is a culture . ”
Pundits like Kirchick actually believe that by stepping into a polling booth , residents of an impoverished tribal country like Mauritania will be magically transformed into responsible citizens on the Western model .
To maintain this illusion , one must be willfully ignorant — though I suspect that took little effort on Kirchick ’s part .
For example , in “ Hail Mauritania , ” he identifies one candidate , Ahmed Ould Daddah , as “ a prominent economist , ” but does n’t mention that Ahmed also happens to be the half - brother of Moktar Ould Daddah , the dictator who ruled Mauritania in pure authoritarian style from 1961 until he was ousted in a 1978 coup .
Coups are in fact the standard method of changing administrations in Mauritania , and it is not at all clear that this bloodless coup was any less “ democratic ” than the grotesque , graft - fueled circus that is a U.S. presidential election .
It was soon clear that to the Mauritanians , nothing untoward had occurred .
The BBC noted that two - thirds of the country ’s legislature quickly backed the coup , and another BBC report noted that the population took the coup “ in its stride . ”
With wonderful hubris , Kirchick insisted that “ publicizing the good news out of Mauritania should be an urgent task of the State Department . ”
I wonder if he feels the same way about me publicizing the fact that democracy , as he calls these farcical elections , lasted exactly three months .
Of course , the real question with any Neocon writing about Mauritania is , why does he even pretend to care ?
To state the obvious : Nobody at the Weekly Standard cares about Mauritania , any more than they care about the Iraqis they ’ve “ helped ” by killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and by destroying Iraq ’s infrastructure .
Neocons do n’t give a damn about any of these people .
They simply want all Muslims neutralized ; it ’s all one to them whether it ’s done by democratizing them or destroying their countries .
And Mauritania is so obscure it does n’t even need to be neutralized .
It matters only because it offers another “ hopeful sign ” to be applied to Iraq , the real topic .
Kirchick makes this very clear :
The Mauritanians ’ success — notably , on their own terms and with little foreign intervention — at establishing the basis of a democratic society in a country that formally outlawed slavery only in 1980 , should serve as a challenge to those who claim that democracy is bound to fail in the Arab and Muslim world .
Now Iraqis and others can look to the west coast of Africa for an example of Arab liberalism in action .
Of course , it ’s ridiculous to imagine that Iraqis would look to a backwater like Mauritania for inspiration ; it would be like scolding a Parisian with , “ Why ca n’t you be more like Albania ? ”
But the most bizarre and typical feature of Kirchick ’s argument is his faith , or pretended faith , in democratic forms : elections , laws , rules — as if those rituals would magically transform any society that recites them .
Thus , he seems to believe that because Mauritania outlawed slavery in 1980 , slavery no longer exists there .
If he ’d done even a little research on the country , he ’d realize that slavery has been officially outlawed there many times but continues to flourish .
Sheer , shameless ignorance : that ’s what makes “ Hail Mauritania ! ” such a strong contender .
If Neocons risked learning anything about the countries they discuss , they might start to feel rudimentary empathy for the people subjected to their shock therapies .
This toxic mix of ignorance and callousness is perfectly exemplified by the third nominee :
3 . “ The Pain Game : A Military Response to Russia ’s Aggression ? ” Stuart Koehl , Weekly Standard .
Quite a title , eh ? “ The Pain Game . ”
That really says it all .
The author is supposedly talking about how a Georgian insurgency could “ pain ” the Russian army in this Aug. 14 , 2008 , piece , but he may as well be cheering the unimaginable pain that such a course would inflict on the Georgian population .
It ’s that childish callousness that makes this such a classic of Neocon prognostication : “ Why do n’t you Georgians start a guerrilla war against the Russians ?
It ’d be fun ! ”
Fun , that is , for Koehl , in his living room .
Koehl ’s advice to the Georgians is almost unbelievable in its stupidity .
Like a typical Tom Clancy fan , he reduces the problem to hardware , starting with a long , loving list of the armored vehicles the Russians are using , followed by a list of U.S. weapons that will supposedly neutralize these vehicles .
Then , getting really excited , he fantasizes in true Clancy style about how a few cool new weapons can force Russia out :
Freed from aerial observation and the threat of air attack , Georgian forces could move dismounted over the mountains more readily than Russian mechanized forces can move along the roads .
Which means that the Georgians would be free to set up ambushes to block further Russian advances and to interdict their lines of communication .
We can provide the wherewithal for them to do this .
First , we need to give the Georgians anti-tank mines , and not just any kind , but our latest “ smart ” off - route mines like the XM93 Wide Area Mine ( WAM ) .
These do n’t have to be placed directly on the roads , but can be put off to the side , where built - in sensors can detect armored vehicles and launch explosive formed penetrator ( RFP ) warheads at them .
What ’s most dismally typical of Neocon thinking here is the mad nonchalance with which this suburban hobbyist urges Georgia to let itself in for the sort of slaughter that has been going on in Chechnya for years .
The Chechens have lost a substantial part of their total population in a losing insurgency .
And the Russians did n’t defeat the Chechens by tinkering with this or that weapons system ; they went in and kidnapped , tortured and killed all the young males they even suspected of being insurgents , just like we ’re doing in Iraq .
That ’s how this kind of ugly war is fought .
So prescribing guerrilla warfare means telling the Georgians to start a process that will lead to the death of most of their families .
That ’s what insurgency means .
And why not ?
For Koehl , the Georgians are not real , so their suffering is no problem at all .
In fact , it ’s a public - relations gold mine .
Nothing delights the Neocons as much as photos of bombed - out Georgian villagers .
This is why being wrong carries no penalty in Neocon circles : because luring Georgia or Iraq — or , for that matter , the United States — into bloody stalemates works out even better than promoting sane , successful military operations .
From the Neocon perspective , Iraq is a success : another Muslim country neutralized , reduced to chaos .
The costs , to the United States and to Iraq ’s people , simply do n’t matter .
The “ cakewalk ” prediction was either a necessary lie , or simple stupidity — because it ’s very difficult , with these people , to tell where “ stupid ” stops and “ evil ” begins .
Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia may have been a catastrophe for Georgia , but it was a success for the Neocons , scaring the rubes back home into another generation ’s worth of gullible russophobia .
And , as Koehl openly fantasizes , it would be even better if Georgia could be suckered into a Chechen - style insurgency , tying up the Russians and supplying years of wonderful refugee photos for stateside PR use .
So why be right , when you can neutralize whole chunks of the world by being wrong ?
By that standard , I ’d have to give my vote to contender # 3 , Koehl ’s attempt to lure Georgia into a savage Chechen - style guerrilla war .
If we were judging mere ignorance , Kirchick ’s silly take on Mauritania would get the prize ; if we were awarding consistency , Abe Greenwald , who has been wrong about everything for years , would get the nod .
But Koehl is not just wrong and ignorant — he ’s doing his best to lure a whole people into self - destruction .
And by Neocon standards , that makes him a real winner .

“ Certain songs , ” Craig Finn sang on The Hold Steady Almost Killed Me , “ they get scratched into our souls . ”
That ’s the basis of “ Certain Songs : ” a look at the songs that have done just that .
These are n’t necessarily our favorite songs or the songs that we think are the best , but rather songs that — every single time we hear them — instantly transport us back to a place and time in which that song is forever intertwined .
This is one of the reasons we so hate the RIAA ’s attempted stranglehold on the dissemination of music : you never know where that next certain song is going to come from .
Sometimes the things that totally change your life happen so randomly as to be almost impossible .
Probably usually , actually , which is why you can never think too much about them .
In any event , the first great thing to happen to me as an “ adult , ” was getting involved with KFSR , the Fresno State radio station .
And it happened because Tim made friends with a guy while we were both a Fresno City College .
At the time , Tim and I had only been out of high school for a few months , and we were going to City — or at least I was — because there was really no plan for adulthood besides drinking as much beer and buying as many records and seeing as many concerts as was humanly possible before actual responsibilities started creeping in .
The guy ’s name was Tom Hall , and at some point in early 1981 , he basically said to Tim and I , “ hey , there ’s a radio station at Fresno State that ’s going on the air really soon , you guys have good taste in music , you should be DJs there . ”
Why Tom was recruiting for Fresno State ’s radio station while he was at Fresno City is now lost to the mists of time .
Why he thought that I was a good choice now even seems weirder .
After all , Tom Hall — a sardonic lover of both Bruce Springsteen and Sid Vicious , perpetually in shades and with a thirst for beer that exceeded my own — was one of the first hipster cool people I ’d ever met , and I was the exact opposite : a unchecked bundle of nervous energy that never seemed to know where he was going .
At the time though , I did n’t question it , because I ’d always wanted to be a DJ .
Maybe not the loftiest of goals , to be sure , but , what the hell , achieving any goal is always good , no ?
Nevertheless , it still was n’t so much a plan as it was something fun to try while I was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life .
In any event , Tom helped Tim & I solve the small problem of not being actual Fresno State students by having us sign up for an extension class , and suddenly , I was a DJ at KFSR , spinning records for an unseen audience that numbered in the , well , 0s , actually .
Here ’s the thing about KFSR in 1981 : it was n’t so much on the air .
I seem to recall it was on something called “ carrier current ” and / or on a closed circuit hardwire to the dorms and the Student Union .
Which , actually , was a load of shit : the only place — besides the studio , of course — where you could hear KFSR for sure was the KFSR Office , down the hall .
Which was always closed by the time each week I actually did a shift .
So I was literally broadcasting to absolutely nobody .
While that might seem discouraging to you , it turned out to be a good thing .
Why ?
For a couple of reasons .
First off , it meant that I could learn the craft of being a DJ in private : the process of cueing records , talking over intros , playing drops , making segues , back announcing , making observations , telling stories , jokes , etc .
By the time that KFSR went on the air on October 30 , 1982 , the only thing I was nervous about was the performance — the mechanics of being a radio DJ were old hat .
This was important , and one of the reasons that I was able to engage an audience from the start .
It was also one of the reasons I got a lot of airshifts : the powers that be did n’t have to worry .
I was never “ polished ” on the air — I ’m too scattered — but I always sounded like I knew what I was talking about .
That ’s because I ’d been immersed in the station ’s music for well over a year and half .
Which was the other good thing about broadcasting to nobody : I could learn all about “ alternative ” music by actually listening to it instead of just reading about it .
By this time , Fresno ’s commercial rock station , KKDJ , which started out free - form and promising , had succumbed to the consultants , tightened their playlists and rebranded as “ Kiss - Ass “ Kick - Ass Rock ‘n Roll ! ! ”
It was the first time I was surrounded with a whole bunch of cool music that I could listen to prior to paying for it .
So I got to learn about a whole bunch of artists , and dig deep into a whole bunch of albums , kicking back and listening to the songs at volumes hardly allowed at home .
Which is where “ Into You Like A Train ” comes in .
Out of all of the music that came out in 1981 / early 1982 , that ’s the song that instantly transports me back to the old KFSR studio .
( Though I also have a pretty good memory of always playing the original 45 of X’s “ White Girl , ” too . )
Looking back , those years seem to be a bit of a fallow period , musically : the original punk rush had come and gone , and the great American underground ( partially catalyzed by stations like KFSR ) lay in the future .
So there were only a few absolute stone cold classic records from that period , and the one that sounded the best in the KFSR studio was the second Psychedelic Furs album , Talk Talk Talk .
That ’s the album where they balanced the two - guitar drone that dominated their debut with the pop ambition that eventually irrevelantized them .
Like X’s Wild Gift , which also came out in 1981 , it was the rare sophomore record that made good the all of the promise shown in a lionized debut , and positioned them for future domination .
If you ’ve never heard it , or resisted them because of the silly name , stop reading this right now and buy it .
Talk Talk
Talk still holds up today , and “ Into You Like A Train ” was a roaring fucksong that faded in from eternity with a fuzzy haze of pounding drums and Duncan Kilborn ’s squealing sax to start the second side of the record .
The music was deep and wide and huge , and with Richard Butler ’s perfectly melodic raspy vocals on top , sounded absolutely amazing at the KFSR studio .
Which , of course , was just a pair of standard - issue speakers — nothing special — but I think that I was also already imagining what it would be like to play that song for an actual audience of listeners .
Which almost never happened — it took longer than anticipated to to actually get KFSR on the air .
So long , in fact , that Tom Hall was actually gone by the time that it did ;
Tim was finally a full - fledged student at Fresno State , and I had nearly decided to go to college out of town .
It had become obvious to me in early 1982 that KFSR was never , ever going to go on the air , and I figured that , at 19 , I had to start doing something / anything , and since things were weird at home — what with my parents getting a divorce and everything — the best thing to do was to flee Fresno entirely .
But just after I made that decision , I happened to run into KFSR ’s Station Manager & Music Director at the Fresno Fashion Fair mall , and they assured me that it was absolutely going to be on the air that year .
They ’d gotten the money , so it was just a matter of time .
It was a relief : I was n’t really ready ( or mature enough ) to leave Fresno , and by that time , I ’d figured out that I was going to actually be pretty good on the radio , so I stuck around , and started actually planning something for my life : to become a Radio - Television undergraduate at Fresno State University .
Oh , and be a DJ on an actual radio station playing actual songs for actual people .
Songs like “ Into You Like a Train . ”
Aug. 1 , 2008 -- Suffering from sleep apnea may do more than just spoil a good night 's sleep .
A new study shows that people with severe sleep apnea may be up to three times more likely to die prematurely , and that risk increases if the sleep disorder is left untreated .
Sleep apnea is a common sleeping disorder that causes frequent pauses in breathing during sleep and is often accompanied by snoring .
About 6 % of adults in the U.S. suffer from moderate to severe forms of the condition , and 17 % have less severe forms .
In the study , researchers followed more than 1,500 adults for 18 years who had been screened for sleep apnea at the start of the study .
The results showed that about 19 % of those with severe sleep apnea died during the follow - up period compared with only 4 % of those without sleep apnea .
Researchers found the risk of premature death increased as the severity of sleep apnea increased , but findings suggested protection from risk of death with proper treatment of sleep apnea , such as the use of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) to keep airways open during sleep and prevent pauses in breathing .
When those who used CPAP regularly to treat their sleep apnea were excluded from the analysis , the risk of death was 3.8 times greater for those with for untreated sleep apnea .
" I was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with CPAP , " researcher Terry Young , PhD , professor of epidemiology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , says in a news release .
" Our findings suggest -- but cannot prove -- that people diagnosed with sleep apnea should be treated , and if CPAP is the prescribed treatment , regular use may prevent premature death . "
En algunas ocasiones a los ciudadanos les molesta pagar impuestos porque no obtienen nada a cambio de forma inmediata , pero obtienen la tranquilidad de haber cumplido con sus pagos anuales , evitando así problemas futuros .
El dinero de los impuestos va directamente a los gastos públicos aunque muchas personas se quejan de que algunas estructuras o espacios públicos están deteriorados y no existe ningún ente que les aporte solucion .
Es por ello que muchas personas evaden los impuestos y aún así disfrutan de algunos servicios que otorga el estado , según muchas personas este dinero toma una dirección oscura y se refleja en los pocos beneficios o arreglos de la comunidad .
Razones para pagar impuestos
Es la forma de obligar al estado de llevar un control y utilizar ese dinero para adquirir los recursos necesarios para sostener los gastos públicos , los impuestos tienen una clasificación importante , si no se hacen en ese sentido no existiría la forma de justificar su cobro .
En algunos lugares consideran que son impuestos sin sentido alguno y que solo causan daños económicos al que lo paga , pero son necesarios , es importante tener un conocimiento claro del porqué es necesario pagar dichos impuestos , de lo contrario puede acarrear una responsabilidad física o moral .
Existen leyes que obligan a las personas a pagar sus impuestos , aunque no todas estén de acuerdo y hagan hasta lo imposible para evitarlo , es justo aquí cuando entra en función todos los mecanismo y leyes establecidas por el país para obligar a los responsables de pagar lo necesario y cumplir con su responsabilidad social y moral .
¿ Por qué el estado obliga a las personas a pagar impuestos ?
En cualquier parte del mundo estamos obligados a pagar impuestos por ser la fuente de ingreso más importante , para sustentar los gastos públicos , aunque en algunos países estos no sean utilizados para tales fines .
El monto del impuesto dependerá principalmente del poder adquisitivo o la ganancia de cada persona , por ejemplo , el pago de impuesto de un cerrajero profesional independiente no es igual al monto que debe pagar una empresa de cerrajeros .
Por otro lado , estamos obligados a pagar impuestos para los momentos de crisis de nuestro estado y disfrutar de servicios más eficientes , en momentos de altibajos económicos entra en juego las leyes de política fiscal combinada con política económica .
Lo que debería motivar a los habitantes de cualquier comunidad a pagar los impuestos es principalmente la satisfacción de contribuir con su comunidad , mejorando así cada uno de sus espacios , lamentablemente en muchos lugares no existe esta cultura .
Asimismo , el pago de impuesto , muchos habitantes lo ven como un acto de corrupción por parte del estado ya que existen organizaciones que no ofrece las mejoras que el estado necesita , sobretodo en temas de infraestructura .
Por ende se crea un ambiente de desconfianza entre los ciudadanos y los entes gubernamentales , muchos los evaden y otros cancelan los impuestos por temor a cancelar diferentes multas e incluso algunas sanciones incluyen prisión .

Ted Kennedy ’s surprise speech tonight was not long , and the senator certainly looked frail , but none of this diminished the emotion and power of Kennedy passing the torch to Barack Obama .
After a tribute video to him was played , Kennedy began , “ My fellow Democrats , my fellow Americans , it is so wonderful to be here .
And nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight . ”
Kennedy spoke about the need for change , “ I have come here tonight to stand with you to change America , to restore its future , to rise to our best ideals and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States . ”
Kennedy also spoke about his pet issue , health care , “ This is the cause of my life .
New hope that we will break the old gridlock and guarantee that every American North , South , East and West , young , old will have decent health care as a fundamental right and not a privilege . ”
He also talked about the change that Obama offers , “ Barack Obama will close the book on the old politics of race , gender and group against group and straight against gay .
The hope rises anew , and the dream lives on ! ”

He also promised to be around in January to take his seat in the Senate , “ Together we have known success and seen setbacks … but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world .
I pledge to you that I will be there next January on the floor of the Senate . ”
The speech tonight was not necessarily about what was being said , but it was made powerful by who was saying it .
All I can say is that if the most respected man in the Senate and a legend among Democrats can’t motivate and rally his party , then the cause is lost .
While watching it , I had the sense that we were watching a great fighter in his epic battle .
This speech was a direct reflection of the attitude and spirit of Ted Kennedy .
He is still looking forward , and dreaming of what America could be , instead of pining for what was .

In fact , by just observing the code of other developers we can learn a lot from them ; we can find interesting ideas and improve the quality of our work .
As you know , we , at Smashing Magazine , are quite curious folks .
We are truly interested in unusual design approaches and creative solutions .
Therefore we are regularly looking for them and once we found them , we analyze them , try to understand them and try to figure out both advantages and disadvantages of the technique we have found .
And in this post we want to share some of them with you .
You may want to take a look at related articles :
We would like to start with 5 advanced elegant coding solutions and ask you if you are interested in this series and would like to have more similar articles .
Please let us know what you think in the comments to this post .
Now let ’s dive in .
You should probably have some CSS - knowledge already before starting reading this article .
1. Sliding vertical navigation + overlay
Over the last years we have discovered a strong trend toward sliding horizontal menus ( also known as Coda Slider effect ) .
In particular , they are often used in corporate designs where a product and its features are supposed to have the dominant position in the design layout .
Kobe uses a similar yet different approach .
The navigation options at the top of the site are slightly animated yet creating an appropriate atmosphere .
Once one of the sections is clicked , the main content area slides vertically — first the background image , then the content .
If the content area also has some navigation options , they are slided vertically as well .
In this situation it might be a slightly better design decision to use horizontal navigation instead to make it easier for visitors to distinguish between the primary and secondary navigation .
All content blocks are not loaded on demand via Ajax , but loaded up front when the page is loaded .
All content blocks are loaded in the very beginning .
Although the page seems to be animated , Flash is used sparsely — essentially , the design is a pure CSS + JavaScript - based solution .
The main problem of the design is , however , that it ’s just impossible to navigate the site if JavaScript is disabled .
In fact , navigation options are not visible at all .
As professional , you should always keep gradual degradation in mind .
How is it done ?
For the main horizontal navigation at the top of the site , kobe use CSS sprites .
All navigation options are packed in one single image ; the displayed chunk of the sprite is selected via background - position - attribute as usual .
The sprite itself is a transparent .gif .
The position of animated sparks is defined using JavaScript — depending on the currently selected navigation option and using absolute positioning .
The main content area consists of the background image and an overlay - layer which displays related information and ( sometimes ) further navigation options .
All overlay - layers ( for all navigation options ) are loaded together with the main page and are not displayed unless an appropriate navigation option is selected .
The sliding is created with the SlidePanel - component of the jQuery library .
The overlay image is semi- transparent and is positioned absolutely within the main content block upon the background image ( using the z - index - attribute ) .
The background image for each navigation section is defined via CSS for each overlay - layer .
A very similar overlay - approach is used to present the description of a project in Ivan Aleksić ’s portfolio ( see above ) .
Initially the visitors see only thumbnails of the projects done so far .
When one of the thumbnails is hovered , further information is displayed in an overlay beyond the thumbnail .
This overlay always uses the space that was previously occupied by the hovered thumbnail and the one below it .
The tiny arrow at the right of the site always allows users to jump to the top of the page .
2. Neighbors navigation
EllisLab uses an interesting design approach to present the members of its team .
Instead of listing each of them one after another , with small thumbnail and brief description , they use simple yet intuitive primary and secondary navigation menus placed next to each other .
And to make sure that visitors are convinced that the team takes its work very seriously , quite esoteric cartoons are additionally placed next to the menus .
Both primary and secondary navigation menus use arrows and slight color indications to highlight where users are at the moment .
Notice that the menus are not just placed next to each other , but divided via a sharp vertical line .
Besides , the secondary menu is placed few pixels below the upper border of the left one , and thus indicates the hierarchy in the navigation .
The whole content area is divided into two main parts — the primary navigation at the left , and the content block at the right .
The latter contains the secondary navigation and a sub-area for description on the right hand - side ( see screenshot below ) .
The background - images for the content block are defined via CSS and are applied via IDs .
A semi-transparent background image is used for the description block on the right - hand side of the content block .
The rest is pure CSS and ( X ) HTML .
Simple yet elegant solution .
3. Panel block
Over last months it seems to have become a common practice to focus the design of a site on its main objective and display the unnecessary details on demand .
For instance , Wishingline presents contact information and links to social networking profiles in a semi- transparent panel .
This panel is opened when the user clicks on some specific link and is not displayed until then .
Notice that different services are highlighted differently — designers use both link colors and icons to precisely communicate links to external services .
Usually it ’s not the best decision to use multiple link colors for similar tasks , but in this case it works fairly well .
All “ social ” data is hidden in the panel — probably to not overcrowd the design with vivid symbols and icons which simply do not fit to the initial design .
This design approach has advantage of offering clean layout and disadvantage of hiding secondary navigation options .
The trade - off is , as always , designer ’s decision , but in this case both options would probably work equally well .
How does it work ?
The panel itself has a semi- transparent background and is given a fixed position in the layout using absolute positioning and the z - index - attribute .
Hence , it does n’t change when the font - size is changed or the browser window is resized .
That ’s not necessarily a good thing , however , one can live with that .
To create a panel designers use two containers put next to each other and positioned absolutely .
The first one has a transparent pointer as the background image and is placed next to “ click to view ” - link .
The second container with a border - background - image is placed next to the first one , creating the illusion of a “ bubble ” panel .
The single elements ( links to social networking profiles ) in the second div-container are marked up using a definition list < dl > .
Notice that designers also use a traditional UI element at the bottom of the panel to indicate that the panel can be closed .
It would actually make more sense to place this button at the right - hand side at the top of the panel since this is the place where most users would expect the button to appear .
Antonio Lupetti uses a similar approach to display all options for RSS - feed - subscription .
It would actually make sense to remove dots for the “ Feed RSS ” - link using outline : 0 ; - assignment ( notice that one should be careful when using the outline property , since it is really useful to navigate through the page using keyboard ) .
There is a variety of ways to design tag clouds .
Styled according to its weight , tags in tag clouds reveal the importance of a topic or site quality via an assigned visual weight ( often color and font size ) .
However , there is one important thing which “ normal ” tag clouds fail to do : they convey the big picture , but ca n’t reveal meaningful data , information in terms of how popular these tags are .
Jeff Croft uses a different approach for tags — tag chart list reveals not only most popular tags , but also how popular these tags are .
Apart from the actual tags “ most popular tags ” - section shows how often the tag was used and also displays a vertical bar which indicates its popularity compared to other tags .
Notice that Jeff Croft uses three levels of visual communication ( position of the tag in the list , vertical bar and the number on the right - hand side ) — visual redundancy is often not superflous ( as usually assumed ) and useful to help readers understand the context in which data is presented .
Once some tag is hovered , the corresponding block - level - element is highlighted using a lighter background color .
Notice that both bar and the figure are highlighted as well .
How is it achieved ?
Jeff Croft uses an unordered list ; each list item contains three block - level - elements : a link to the tag , a span - element ( span.count ) displaying the figure on the right - hand side and a span - element ( span.index ) displaying the bar ( span -elements are inline - level - elements , of course , but they are declared to block - level - elements in Jeff Croft ’s stylesheet ) .
Tag links are aligned to the left using relative positioning , the figures on the right hand - side are pushed to the right using absolute positioning within relative positioning ( standard approach also known as Making the Absolute , Relative ) .
The bar is initially assigned the width of 100 % for every tag .
When the page is being loaded the width of the element is changed ( probably via PHP Python on the fly ) using style = “ width : xx % ” - assignment .
Styling is defined in CSS , of course .
The position of the bar is , again , defined using absolute positioning within the absolutely positioned list item - element .
The hover - state is defined using li:hover .index , li:hover .count and li:hover - definitions .
It ’s worth mentioning that Jeff Croff uses an accessible design approach : if no visual elements can be displayed , the index - element displays the percentage value of the popularity of the tag ; otherwise this text is removed using the text - indent - attribute with CSS .
Notice that this solution is also flexible .
For instance , if the sidebar will be expanded for some reason , the tags chart list will be expanded automatically since percentage values are used .
That ’s efficient .
5 . Clever archive navigation
Designing archive navigation is n’t an easy task , particularly because designers do n’t want to slam visitors with too much information and users often just want to quickly get the information they are looking for in the first place .
Chris Shiflett uses an interesting approach to present a user - friendly , simple and compact archive navigation .
Jon Gibbins , Jon Tan and Chris Shiflett combined both levels of navigation — year and month navigation — within a compact two - lines - block .
The current selection is clearly visually highlighted using colors and arrows .
Available navigation options are clear as well .
Once a visitor has decided to browse through the navigation section she has to select the year and the month ; however , this can be done quickly since the the month selection is updated automatically when a new year is chosen .
The markup and JavaScript are quite straight - forward : the designer uses unordered lists and definitions lists to markup the year as well a special class to indicate currently chosen year and month .
When some year is clicked , a new layer under the year navigation is displayed — there visitors can also define the month they are interested in .
There seems to be a bug since in the very beginning when the page is being loaded , all navigation options for all years are displayed .
It ’s a simple yet useful idea to present the archive navigation on each archive page , so the user can easily navigate through all posts without going to the archive - page and then to the post again .
Please also notice the month navigation at the bottom of every archive page .
Maybe it would actually make more sense to present the full archive navigation at the bottom of the page as well .
The Olympic opening ceremony was reportedly watched by " 15 percent of the world 's population . "
Needless to say , it was a heck of a weekend for NBC , which paid close to $ 900 million for U.S. broadcasting rights .
Despite the fact that some Olympic programming will be delayed and many viewers have turned to non-legit sources for live , streaming content , NBC will still probably turn a tidy profit from the Olympics – the network says it already sold $ 1 billion in ads for the events .
But one area where NBC may have lost :
The teen demographic .
Only 46 percent of teens surveyed by Harris Interactive showed any interest in watching the Olympics .
And if teens are indeed abstaining , it 's not because they think that the Olympics are a crass , greedy commercial enterprise – in fact , 71 percent of those polled " were likely to agree that the games are about more than merely medals and marketing , " according to Harris Interactive .
So why wo n't they watch ?
Because it 's not convenient for them .
" Teens want quick - hitting videos , " says Bill Carter , a partner at youth marketing agency Fuse Marketing .
" They do n't want the lead - up and they do n't want the analysis .
They just want the video .
And I 'm optimistic that NBC is doing delivering this better than they have before .
Although , to watch the [ mens freestyle swimming ] relay this morning , I still had to download 11 minutes of video , and fast forward through the first 6 minutes to get to the race . "
But for the sake of an argument , let 's say NBC does lose teen Olympic viewers now – are they off the Olympics for good ?
The reason why marketers go silly - nuts over the teen demographic is that if they can hook teens on a certain product , they could be customers for life ( depending on the company and product ) .
Teens who choose a political affiliation , for example , are likely to stick with it .
So if teens do n't buy into the Olympics craze now , will they get excited about it later in life ?
" I think NBC is just as likely – if not more likely – to get a 14 - to 17 - year - old to watch a 2.5 minute Olympic video online than to have that kid watch a live event at 10:45 p .m.
Eastern , " says Carter .
" NBC is doing a better job than they 've done over the last two Olympics of delivering short videos that last no longer than a few minutes . "

Wayne Madsen has an executive level NSA staff person on record saying that significant sentiment exists within the NSA to kill troublesome bloggers and journalists .
When somebody within your own government calls you out , do you show up ?
How do you handle it ?
Wayne Madsen , always spoiling for a fight with Bush and Cheney , or the chance to show off his undies to minimum wage airport TSA workers , has an executive level NSA staff person on record saying that significant sentiment exists within the NSA to kill troublesome bloggers and journalists .
The NSA executive staffer was , apparently , not the source of the sentiment , but this individual did pass along the context and the precise wording of the “ junior G- man ” working in the NSA .
Prominent names listed in the NSA database of troublemakers ?
1. Bill Gertz 2 . James Bamford 3 . Vernon Loeb 4 . Jim Risen 5 . Dr. John C. K. Daly 6 . Wayne Madsen 7 . Seymour Hersh
These were all the names Madsen published , but there are , of course , many others .
Possibly you , gentle reader .
If not now , probably later .
As much as Madsen hates Daily Kos , I would think that if Kos was in the database , he would have published his name , too .
Markos Moulitsas Zuniga — a name that should just roll off the Hebroid - Russian tongue of George Soros , and frequently does — is he NOT in the NSA ’s database of journalists and bloggers to be put out of Cheney ’s misery ?

Republicans blamed Pelosi 's scathing speech near the close of Monday 's debate — which attacked Bush 's economic policies and a " right - wing ideology of anything goes , no supervision , no discipline , no regulation " of financial markets — for the vote 's failure .
" We could have gotten there today had it not been for the partisan speech that the speaker gave on the floor of the House , " Minority Leader John Boehner said .
Pelosi's words , the Ohio Republican said , " poisoned our conference , caused a number of members that we thought we could get , to go south . "
Rep. Roy Blunt , R - Mo. , the whip , estimated that Pelosi 's speech changed the minds of a dozen Republicans who might otherwise have supported the plan .

Barney Frank , D - Mass. , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said that was a remarkable accusation by Republicans against Republicans .
" Because somebody hurt their feelings , they decided to punish the country , " he said .
Monday 's action had been preceded by unusually aggressive White House lobbying , with Bush making calls to lawmakers until shortly before the vote .
Bush and a host of leading congressional figures had implored the lawmakers to pass the legislation despite howls of protest from their constituents back home .

Daschle criticizes anthrax investigation , saying FBI should provide more information Associated Press
Published : Sunday August 3 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON -- Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , whose office was a target of the anthrax attacks in 2001 , said Sunday the suicide of the government 's main suspect does not mean the case is over .
Daschle said the FBI has not given him any new updates .
He also raised questions about the quality of the investigation , noting that the government recently paid out almost $ 6 million to a former Army scientist , Steven Hatfill , who accused authorities of unfairly targeting him in the anthrax case .
" From the very beginning I 've had real concerns about the quality of the investigation , " Daschle said in a broadcast interview .
" Given the fact that they already paid somebody else $ 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation . "
Five people died and 17 others were sickened when anthrax - laced letters began showing up at congressional offices , newsrooms and post offices soon after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The case re-emerged in the news this past week as investigators prepared to charge a government scientist Bruce Ivins in the case .
Ivins died Tuesday in what has been ruled a suicide .
" Unfortunately , it does n't bring anything to closure , " Daschle said .
" This probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts . "
He said he did not know if the investigation involving Ivins " is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be .
We do n't know and they are n't telling us . "
Tom Ridge , Bush 's Homeland Security secretary at the time of the anthrax attacks , said he did not know what evidence the FBI had uncovered against Ivins .
" But I know that they were relentless , relentless , both domestically and overseas , both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network , but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two , " Ridge said .
Daschle appeared on " Fox News Sunday , " while Ridge was on " This Week " on ABC .
Steve Friedl 's Unixwiz.net Tech Tips An Illustrated Guide to the Kaminsky DNS Vulnerability
The big security news of Summer 2008 has been Dan Kaminsky 's discovery of a serious vulnerability in DNS .
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to redirect network clients to alternate servers of his own choosing , presumably for ill ends .
This all led to a mad dash to patch DNS servers worldwide , and though there have been many writeups of just how the vulnerability manifests itself , we felt the need for one in far more detail .
Hence , one of our Illustrated Guides .
This paper covers how DNS works : first at a high level , then by picking apart an individual packet exchange field by field .
Next , we 'll use this knowledge to see how weaknesses in common implementations can lead to cache poisoning .
By fully understanding the issues at play , the reader may be better equipped to mitigate the risks in his or her own environment .
We hope everybody who runs a DNS server patches soon .
Terminology
Before we see how DNS operates , we need to define a few terms to know who the players are , software - wise .
This will be review for many , and in some cases we leave out side details that an expert would find fault with .
Omitted details wo n't matter for an understanding of this issue .
zone
Think of this as a " domain " : a collection of hostnames / IP pairs all managed together .
Our servers operate unixwiz.net , and all the DNS records that go with it — www.unixwiz.net, mvp.unixwiz.net , cs.unixwiz.net , etc. — are all part of the unixwiz .
net zone .
The subtle distinction comes with subdomains : sometimes they are part of the main zone , sometimes they are a separate zone , but none of that matters for this paper .
Nameserver
This is server software that answers DNS questions , such as " What is the IP address for www.unixwiz.net? " .
Sometimes a nameserver knows the answer directly ( if it 's " authoritative " for the zone ) , other times it has to go out to the internet and ask around to find the answer ( if it 's a recursive nameserver ) .
There is wide variety of software that performs this service : BIND , PowerDNS , djbdns , and many others .
They all answer the same questions more or less the same way , though the minor differences matter some for this paper .
Authoritative Nameserver
For every zone , somebody has to maintain a file of the hostnames and IP address associations ( " linux.unixwiz.net is 64.170.162.98 " , and so on ) .
This is generally an administrative function performed by a human , and in most cases one machine has this file .
It 's the zone master .
Zones with multiple public nameservers make administrative arrangements to transfer the zone data automatically to additional slave nameservers , all of which are authoritative as far as the outside world is concerned .
The distinction between master and slave is unimportant for this paper .
Resolver
This is the client part of the DNS client / server system : it asks the questions about hostnames .
The resolver is usually a small library compiled into each program that requires DNS services , and it knows just enough to send questions to a nearby nameserver .
On Linux / UNIX systems , the location of the servers - to - ask is found in the file / etc / resolv.conf , and on Windows it 's part of the Network Connections setup in the control panel .
This usually consists of a list of IP addresses , each of which expects to find a nameserver on the other end .
Resolvers are usually very small and dumb , relying on the servers to do the heavy lifting .
Recursive Nameserver
This is a nameserver that 's willing to go out on the internet and find the results for zones it 's not authoritative for , as a service to its clients .
Not all nameservers are configured to provide recursive service , or are limited to just trusted clients ( say , an ISP may provide nameservice only to its customers ) .
Resource Record
Though most think of DNS as providing hostname - to - IP mapping , there are actually other kinds of questions we can ask of a nameserver , and this highlights the notion that DNS is really a database of " resource records " .
The most common type is an IP Address ( an " A " record ) , but other records exist too : NS ( nameserver ) , MX ( mail exchanger ) , SOA ( Start of Authority ) , and so on .
Delegation
When a nameserver does n't have the contents of a zone , but knows how to find the owner , it 's said to delegate service of that zone to another nameserver .
Informally , it 's a pass - the - buck mechanism : " I know the zone you 're asking about , go ask ( hostname ) for the details " .
Following a simple DNS query
With a few key terms defined , we 'll review how a simple recursive query works in the absence of any bugs or shenanigans ; this forms the background of where the exploits can later be applied .
Though the DNS packet itself has many fields ( each of which is important ) , we 're omitting that detail for now in order to understand the high level flow of a full query , from top to bottom .
Visualizing how delegation bounces requests from one server to another is vital to understanding the vulnerability will be exploited later .
We can't really tell by looking at the query itself what prompted the query in the first place .
In the logo of this section , we see that the user attempted to ping our webserver , and the ping program asked the nameserver to perform this name - to - IP lookup .
But it could have just as easily been a user entering http://www.unixwiz.net in a browser address bar .
But it 's not important to know why the name 's being looked up , only to know how it looks up .
1 The client ( noted as " User 's PC " ) makes a request for www.unixwiz.net, and it's routed to the nameserver provided by the user 's ISP .
It requests the A record , which represents an IP address .
The ISP 's nameserver knows that it's not authoritative for unixwiz.net , so it can't look it up in its local zone database .
It also does n't find the name it its cache of recently - seen data , so it knows it has to go out to the internet to find it for us .
2
All recursive nameservers are preconfigured with a list of 13 root servers , a selection of which looks like : Root hints A.ROOT - SERVERS .NET .
IN A 198.41.0.4 B.ROOT - SERVERS.NET .
IN A 192.228.79.201 C.ROOT -SERVERS.NET .
IN A 192.33.4.12 ...
M.ROOT - SERVERS.NET .
IN A 202.12.27.33
Thankfully these IP addresses do n't change very often .
The nameserver picks one at random and sends off the query for the A record of www.unixwiz.net; here it 's going to b.root - servers.net 3
The root server does n't know anything about unixwiz.net , but is happy to send me the way of the Global Top Level Domain ( GTLD ) servers responsible for the .net domain .
This is in the form of NS records of servers more qualified to answer our query : " Go ask these guys - here 's a list " .
. NET referrals /* Authority section */ NET .
IN NS A.GTLD - SERVERS .NET .

Though technically we asked only for the NS records , the root servers also give us the IP address of each : this is known as " glue " and is provided to save us from having to look it up .
4
With the helpful referral from the root servers , this nameserver chooses one of the authoritative servers at random — here , c.gtld-servers.net — and sends off the same query : " I was told to ask you : what 's the A record for www.unixwiz.net? " .
5
The GTLD server does n't know the specific answer to our query , but it does know how to get us closer .
Like the root servers , it sends back a referral ( a set of NS records ) that are likely to have what we seek .
unixwiz.net referral /* Authority section */ unixwiz.net .
IN NS cs.unixwiz.net .
IN NS linux.unixwiz.net .
/* Additional section - " glue " records */ cs.unixwiz.net .
IN A 8.7.25.94 linux.unixwiz.net .
IN A 64.170.162.98 6
Once again the recursive nameserver is following a chain of referrals on the client 's behalf , and it picks one of the nameservers at random and sends off a third query ( the same as the other two ) .
7
Unlike the other answers , that merely passed the buck onto other nameservers , this one actually has what we were looking for : it provides the A record for www.unixwiz.net.
In addition , the response includes a flag saying " This is an authoritative response " , indicating it came from the source of truth for this domain .
8
Now with answer in hand , the ISP 's recursive nameserver hands that answer back to the client , and that satisfies the entire query .
The recursive nameserver also files away this answer into its own cache in case this or some other client makes the same query later .
But we 'll note that the reply to the client does n't include the " authoritative " indicator .
Even though it received one from cs.unixwiz.net , the recursive nameserver can't pretend to the client that it 's actually the source of authority , so it 's considered a non-authoritative answer .
This procedure goes on under the hood trillions of time every day over the internet .
DNS is quite fast , so the eight - packet handshake ( for this particular query ) routinely completes in just a split second .
This reveals the distributed nature of DNS : no one machine knows everything , but they do know how to find each other via delegation .
As a side note , nothing prevents any nameserver from hosting any zone , including those it does n't really own .
A bad guy could set up a nameserver and configure an authoritative zone for BankOfSteve.com , but it has no effect because no higher - level nameserver ever delegates to it .
What 's in a DNS packet ?
With a grasp of the high - level exchanges we dig a bit deeper into what 's inside a DNS packet : the details are required to understand cache poisoning and this recent vulnerability .
There 's a lot of detail here , but fortunately many of the fields are n't important for an understanding of these issues .
The illustration on the right shows the overall structure of a single packet of DNS data , and it can reflect a question packet or an answer packet .
We 've highlighted some of the fields that are most related to this exploit .
Source / Destination IP address
These reflect the IP addresses of the machines that sent and should receive the packet .
It 's possible to forge the source address , but pointless to forge the destination .
Analog in the real world : on an envelope sent in the US Mail , you can put anything you want as the return address — the source address — but if you lie about the recipient , it 's not going to go where you want .
Source / Destination port numbers DNS servers listen on port 53 / udp for queries from the outside world , so the first packet of any exchange always includes 53 as the UDP destination port .
The source port varies considerably ( though not enough , as we 'll find shortly ) : sometimes it 's also port 53 /udp , sometimes it 's a fixed port chosen at random by the operating system , and sometimes it 's just a random port that changes every time .
As far as DNS functionality is concerned , the source port does n't really matter as long as the replies get routed to it properly .
But this turns out to be the crux of the problem at hand .
Query ID
This is a unique identifier created in the query packet that 's left intact by the server sending the reply : it allows the server making the request to associate the answer with the question .
A nameserver might have many queries outstanding at one time — even multiple queries to the same server — so this Query ID helps match the answers with the awaiting questions .
This is also sometimes called the Transaction ID ( TXID ) .
QR ( Query / Response )
Set to 0 for a query by a client , 1 for a response from a server .
Opcode
Set by client to 0 for a standard query ; the other types are n't used in our examples .
AA ( Authoritative Answer )
Set to 1 in a server response if this answer is Authoritative , 0 if not .
TC ( Truncated )
Set to 1 in a server response if the answer can't fit in the 512 - byte limit of a UDP packet response ; this means the client will need to try again with a TCP query , which does n't have the same limits .
RD ( Recursion Desired )
The client sets this to 1 if it wishes that the server will perform the entire lookup of the name recursively , or 0 if it just wants the best information the server has and the client will continue with the iterative query on its own .
Not all nameservers will honor a recursive request ( root servers , for instance , wo n't ever perform recursive queries ) .
RA ( Recursion Available )
The server sets this to indicate that it will ( 1 ) or wo n't ( 0 ) support recursion .
Z — reserved
This is reserved and must be zero rcode Response code from the server : indicates success or failure Question record count
The client fills in the next section with a single " question " record that specifies what it 's looking for : it includes the name ( www.unixwiz.net), the type ( A , NS , MX , etc. ) , and the class ( virtually always IN=Internet ) .
The server repeats the question in the response packet , so the question count is almost always 1 .
Answer / authority / additional record count
Set by the server , these provide various kinds of answers to the query from the client : we 'll dig into these answers shortly .
DNS Question / Answer data
This is the area that holds the question / answer data referenced by the count fields above .
These will be discussed in great detail later .
We 'll see these in action as we disassemble our sample query shortly .
Resource Record Types
Ultimately , DNS is a kind of distributed database , and each query or response includes a name , a type , and ( for a response ) a value .
The resource types represent different purposes , and no understanding of DNS is complete without knowing about them .
There are dozens of resource record types , though only a few are in common usage .
The rest are experimental , obsolete , or serve obscure purposes that rarely come up in practice .
Common DNS Resource Record Types Type Description A
This is an IP Address record , and is the most obvious type of data supported by DNS .
Indeed ; many users have no idea that DNS deals with anything other than IP addresses .
NS
This describes a Nameserver record responsible for the domain asked about .
MX
The MX record encodes the name of a Mail Exchanger , a system responsible for handling email for the given domain .
Multiple MX records can be provided for a domain ( they included way to specify priority ) .
Email server software is the main consumer of MX resource records .
Curiously , the mail exchanger for a domain does n't have to be part of that domain ; it 's common for the mailserver at a large hosting operation to be primary MX for thousands of customer domains .
SOA
The Start of Authorities record describes some key data about the zone as defined by the zone administrator ( on the domain master machine ) .
It includes things such as the contact address for the admin , and the amount of time that slave nameservers should hang onto the zone in case the master is unreachable .
CNAME
The Canonical Name , more commonly known as an Alias , this allows providing an alternate name for a resource .
TXT A generic
Text record that provides descriptive data about domain .
These are essentially comments , though some applications use them for programmatic purposes .
It 's generally ( but not universally ) allowed that one name can have multiple resource records , even more than one of the same type .
A common example would be a machine having multiple IP addresses , both of which are entered in DNS :
www.example.com.
IN A 192.168.1.3 www.example.com.
IN A 192.168.7.149
Here , the name www.example.com has two IP address records associated with it , and both will be returned in answer to an A query for this name .
Note that the order of the addresses as they appear in the file are not maintained in the responses : they 're usually shuffled .
We 'll note that the IN token means the IN ternet class , and this is virtually the only class you 'll ever see in practice .
Others ( such as Chaos or Hesiod ) are defined but are for specialized and mostly obsolete purposes .
Drilling down to a real query
Recalling our query exchange above , we 're going to study steps 4 through 7 in some detail : they are most representative of the DNS name - resolution process without adding duplicative steps .
Ultimately , DNS is a kind of distributed database , and it can look up much more than just an IP address : there are multiple resource record types involved in a query , and one can't understand the packet structure without knowing their distinctions .
We 'll note that not every detail is predictable even when the protocol is fully understood : nameservers have some latitude in how they accomplish a resolution , so a few alternatives are available .
We 're just choosing one common path through this process .
In this example , we 're using the nameserver of our own ISP — dnsr1.sbcglobal.net — ( referred to as dnsr1 ) as the local recursive nameserver , and we 'll find a few things in common for all of them .
Contrived Data !
In this example we 're showing a hypothetical packet trace for our own ISP 's recursive nameserver , but this is a made - up example .
We certainly have no way to actually sniff the real traffic coming and going from their server , but we 'll note that as of this writing , AT&T had patched this server to avoid this vulnerability .
In every case , the Question section is the same : " What is the A record for www.unixwiz.net ? " .
This question is also repeated in the answer — mainly as a convenience — so it 's seen in common in every packet we look at .
? " .
This question is also repeated in the answer — mainly as a convenience — so it 's seen in common in every packet we look at .
The ISP 's nameserver usually sets the RD=1 flag ( Recursion Desired ) on the odd chance that the other end is willing to do the heavy lifting and go find this answer for us .
Most top - level nameservers are unwilling to do this , so they give us the best information they have and set RA=0 flag ( Recursion Unavailable ) to let us know that we have to do the work ourselves .

Most top - level nameservers are unwilling to do this , so they give us the best information they have and set flag ( Recursion Unavailable ) to let us know that we have to do the work ourselves .
In this example , the source UDP port number for all queries from our ISP 's nameserver is the same .
It 's a common practice for nameserver software to request a random port from the operating system at startup , then use it for every query .
We observe that the Query ID increments by one each time it sends a new query .
So with this information in hand , let 's walk through the steps in detail and see how our " simple " query is actually resolved .
2&3 In this step our ISP 's nameserver queried a root server for www.unixwiz.net, and it replied with a list of global top - level domain servers that knew about the .net hierarchy .
From this delegation , the ISP 's nameserver chose one at random ( c.gtld-servers.net ) , as shown in step 4 . ( not illustrated ) 4
client to server
The dnsr1 server at our ISP grabs one of the GTLD nameservers received from a root server ( in step 3 ) and fires off a second query .
This is essentially the same as the first ; the Question is about the A record www.unixwiz.net.
Because this is a query — not a response — the answer / authorities / additional records fields are blank ( as shown with a count of zero ) .
The Query ID value was taken as the next ID available from this server 's internal counter .
5
server to client
The GTLD server we asked does n't know the specific answer to our question , but it knows where to ask : it responds with a series of NS records that should know how to handle our request .
They show up in the Authorities section as cs.unixwiz.net and linux.unixwiz.net .
We 're given hostnames of the nameservers we ought to contact , but real network connections are only made by IP address : how do we look these up ?
Avoiding what would clearly be a chicken - and - egg problem , the GTLD nameserver provides not only the hostnames of the authoritative servers , but their IP addresses too .
These are provided as A records in the " Additional Records " section , and are known as " glue data " .
Because this nameserver can't give us the final answer , it sets the AA=0 flag ( Authoritative Answer ) to zero , indicating that somebody else knows the real story and we have to keep asking around .
But a related note : dnsr1 is a very busy nameserver , having perhaps hundreds of queries outstanding every second .
How does it know that this reply packet is a response to that specific pending request ?
The answer is : by matching on the Query ID .
Inbound DNS packets that do n't have a waiting Query ID are ignored .
The TTL is a Time To Live , discussed later .
6
client to server
In step 5 we received two nameservers that are purported to know more about the unixwiz .
net domain , so one more query is created that asks the same question — again ! — of these just - learned nameservers .
This request is really no different from the previous queries , though it does increment the Query ID by one before sending it off .
The idea is that we keep following these delegations until we actually get a real answer , not a referral .
7
server to client
And at last the answer comes !
Unlike the previous replies , this one has answer count=1 , and it carries an A record with the IP address to satisfy our query .
In addition , this response has the AA=1 flag set , which indicates that it's an authoritative answer ( aka " from the horse 's mouth " ) .
If an answer is provided but with AA=0 , we assume it 's from the server 's cache .
The answer also includes the authority and glue information , but this time all we 're really interested in is the answer itself .
And the nameserver used the Query ID of 43562 to match this reply to the pending request .
As noted previously , these transactions typically occur very rapidly across the internet , and the user is normally unaware that so much is going on under the hood on his behalf .
But local performance is further enhanced by use of a local cache in the recursive nameservers : this is an important part of the domain - name system , and gets us one step closer to our security issue .
What 's in the cache ?
In the DNS lookups we 've seen so far , the ISP 's resolving nameserver has gone out and fully resolved each name from scratch , relying on no prior knowledge except the built - in root hints .
But in practice this full road trip is not necessary : once we get an authoritative answer for a given name , we can save it in a local cache to use to satisfy future queries directly .
The more clients serviced by a nameserver , the more benefit of the cache : the work of the full name resolutions is spread out over the whole client base .
It may well require quite a bit of memory in the nameserver , but the amounts of RAM required are peanuts compared with the benefits .
The Time - To - Live
When a DNS answer is stored in the local cache , it can't keep it forever : this could lead to terribly stale data that effectively breaks the domains involved .
Fortunately , the recursive nameserver does n't have the burden of guessing how long to cache things : the administrator of the zone specifies this information for every resource record .
This is known as a Time To Live ( TTL ) , and it 's a lifetime measured in seconds .
A TTL can be a short as a few minutes , or as long as a week or more : this is entirely determined by the administrator of the zone .
In our final Step - 7 answer above ( with snippet to the right ) , we see the TTL of one hour for the A record in www.unixwiz.net.
All client requests for this resource record in the next hour will be satisfied immediately , from the cache .
But once it expires , it 's removed from cache and the next request will force a full lookup from scratch .
But it 's not just the A record that 's cached ; all the other authority data ( the NS data plus associated glue A records ) arrive with their own TTLs , and are also cached .
This means that a full lookup for a single resource record could well fill the cache with a half dozen associated records or more .
Poisoning the cache
With a good understanding of a properly - functioning DNS , it 's time to see where things break .
Cache poisoning is where the bad guy manages to inject bogus data into a recursive nameserver 's cache , causing it to give out that bad information to unsuspecting local clients .
It 's not so simple as just sending random DNS packets to a nameserver , as DNS only accepts responses to pending queries ; unexpected responses are simply ignored .
This is not " phishing "
Though DNS cache poisoning has similar end results to phishing — getting a user to believe a bad site is genuine — it 's not the same thing .
With phishing , a bogus URL is used to reference the malicious server , but it 's disguised to look like the real hostname ( usually with a bit of clever HTML or CSS ) .
An attentive user can usually detect this misdirection by examining the URLs or hostnames carefully .
With DNS cache poisoning , the very nature of DNS itself has been subverted such that hostname - to - IP lookups can no longer be trusted .
The hostnames being visited are genuine , but they 're being routed to the bad server : this can't be detected by inspection of links or HTML source code .
How does a nameserver know that any response packet is " expected " ?
The response arrives on the same UDP port we sent it from : otherwise the network stack would not deliver it to the waiting nameserver process ( it 's dropped instead ) .
The Question section ( which is duplicated in the reply ) matches the Question in the pending query .
section ( which is duplicated in the reply ) matches the Question in the pending query .
The Query ID matches the pending query
matches the pending query The Authority and Additional sections represent names that are within the same domain as the question : this is known as " bailiwick checking " .
This prevents ns.unixwiz.net from replying with not only the IP address of www.unixwiz.net, but also fraudulent information about ( say ) BankOfSteve.com .
If all of these conditions are satisfied , a nameserver will accept a packet as a genuine response to a query , and use the results found inside .
This includes caching answers , as well as valid authority and additional data found there too .
But if the bad guy can predict and forge a DNS response packet that 's just right , he can cause all kinds of shenanigans for the victims .
The bad guy normally first chooses his victim by finding a nameserver he believes vulnerable to poisoning : all of the clients of that DNS server get to unwittingly ride the victim train as well .
Then he finds a target domain , one he wishes to take over .
His intent is to fool the victims into visiting his own malicious website instead of the real deal : by getting www.goodsite.com to resolve to the bad guy 's IP address , the user 's traffic visits the bad guy 's website instead of the good one .
We noted that unexpected packets were simply dropped , so a bad guy need not get everything right every time : sending many packets attempting to guess some of the key parameters is likely to prove fruitful with enough attempts .
Guessing the Query ID
In old nameservers ( and in our detailed packet trace example ) , the Query ID simply increments by one on each outgoing request , and this makes it easy to guess what the next one will be as long as an interloper can see a single query .
We probably can't directly ask the nameserver for its query ID , but we can provoke it into telling us :
Bad guy asks the victim nameserver to look up a name in a zone for a nameserver he controls ( perhaps test.badguy.com ) .
He might query the server directly , if it permits recursion from his location , or he might convince a user to lookup a name — perhaps by including the test hostname on a web page .
Victim nameserver receives the request and makes the usual rounds to resolve the name starting at the root servers .
Here , we 've put the root and GTLD servers in the same category to separate them from the bad guy 's nameserver .
Eventually , the victim nameserver will be directed to the bad guy 's nameserver : after all , it 's authoritative for badguy.com .
Bad guy monitors this lookup of test .
badguy.com by sniffing the IP traffic going to his own machine , or perhaps even with a custom modification to the nameserver software , and from this discovers the source port and Query ID used .
Aha !
At this point he knows the last query ID and source port used by the victim nameserver .
But the thoughtful might wonder : so what ?
This has n't poisoned anything yet , and there 's no need to engage in DNS shenanigans for badguy.com anyway .
After all , the bad guy is already authoritative for his own zone .
True enough , but this was only the first step : the next one engages in DNS shenanigans for other domains .
Shenanigans , Version 1
With the ability to easily predict a query ID , and since our victim nameserver always sends queries from the same UDP port , it should be easy enough to cause some trouble .
In this illustration , we 'll attempt to poison a particular nameserver with a fraudulent IP for a legitimate banking website , www.BankOfSteve.com.
The bad guy 's intention is to get all of the ISP 's customers to visit his own malicious site instead of the real one operated by the Bank .
Step 1 — Bad guy sends a DNS query to the victim nameserver for the hostname it wishes to hijack .
This example assumes that the victim nameserver allows recursive queries from the outside world .
— Bad guy sends a DNS query to the victim nameserver for the hostname it wishes to hijack .
This example assumes that the victim nameserver allows recursive queries from the outside world .
Step 2a — Knowing that the victim will shortly be asking ns1. bankofsteve.com ( as directed from the root / GTLD servers ) for an IP address , the bad guy starts flooding the victim with forged DNS reply packets .
All purport to be from ns1.bankofsteve.com , but include the answer with the IP of badguy 's fraudulent webserver .
— Knowing that the victim will shortly be asking ( as directed from the root / GTLD servers ) for an IP address , the bad guy starts flooding the victim with forged DNS reply packets .
All purport to be from ns1.bankofsteve.com , but include the answer with the IP of badguy 's fraudulent webserver .
Steps 2 b & 3 — Root / GTLD servers provide referral to ns1.bankofsteve.com .
This may be multiple queries , but we 're showing just one for simplicity .
— Root / GTLD servers provide referral to .
This may be multiple queries , but we 're showing just one for simplicity .
Step 4 — victim nameserver asks ns1.bankofsteve.com for the IP address of www.bankofsteve.com , and it uses query ID 1001 ( one higher than the previous query ) .
— victim nameserver asks for the IP address of , and it uses query ID 1001 ( one higher than the previous query ) .
Step 5 — the real nameserver provides a legitimate response to this query , with QID=1001 .
But if the bad guy has successfully matched the query ID in the step 2a flood , this legal reply arrives too late and is ignored .
Oops .
— the real nameserver provides a legitimate response to this query , with QID=1001 .
But if the bad guy has successfully matched the query ID in the step flood , this legal reply arrives too late and is ignored .
Oops .
Step 6 — With the bogus IP address ( of the bad guy 's webserver ) in cache it provides this poisoned answer to the requesting DNS client .
Boom .
— With the bogus IP address ( of the bad guy 's webserver ) in cache it provides this poisoned answer to the requesting DNS client . .
Step 7 ( not illustrated ) — future DNS clients asking for www.bankofsteve.com will receive the same fraudulent answer .
The rule is : first good answer wins .
Most of the forged answers are dropped because the Query ID does n't match , but if just one in the flurry of fake responses gets it right , the nameserver will accept the answer as genuine .
And because that satisfies the request , the real answer that arrives later is dropped , because the query is no longer pending .
In any case , once the bad guy gets the answer from the victim 's nameserver , the matter is closed , and he can stop flooding the victim .
We 'll note that even though this illustrates trying to beat just the reply from ns1.
bankofsteve.com , our forged DNS traffic could actually match the query ID of any of the prior steps .
This includes matching an earlier reply from the root server or the GTLD ( .com ) server : if the query ID matches , our fake authoritative wins , and pollutes the cache .
This is a race , but only the attacker knows it 's playing .
The name can't already be in the cache
If www.bankofsteve.com is already in the victim nameserver 's cache , all of the external queries are avoided , and there 's simply no way to poison it in this manner .
If the bad guy still wants to poison that particular hostname , he has to wait for it to expire from cache ( as determined by the TTL ) .
The bad guy has to guess the query ID
This is made easy with ( now - obsolete ) nameservers that increment the Query ID by one each time — even a busy nameserver has a fairly small range to guess from .
The bad guy has to be faster than the real nameserver
If the victim nameserver and the real nameserver are topologically close ( network wise ) , then the steps 2/3 and 4/5 may complete so quickly that the bad guy has a too - small window to exploit .
Mitigations
Is it random ?
Older nameservers used a terrible random number algorithm that allowed a bad guy to predict the next Query ID given an existing one , and this was used by attackers to commit cache poisoning .
Modern software uses real random number algorithms that do n't fall for this .
An obvious mitigation here is to randomize the Query ID .
With sequential Query IDs , the bad guy has a fairly limited range of guesses required once he observes a single current Query ID .
If he sees QID=999 , then he may flood with QIDs 1000 - 1029 in an attempt to make at least one match .
Experience has shown this is an easy window to beat .
But if the nameserver chooses random Query IDs , then the attacker has the full 16 - bit pool to choose from — that 's 64 k values — and this is a much harder target to hit in the narrow window of time while the victim is going through the routine resolution steps .
Though forging 20 packets in routine name - resolution time is straightforward enough , doing so with thousands of packets is a much more substantial challenge .
So true randomization of Query IDs raises the bar quite a bit .
Dan 's Shenanigans
So far we 've seen how to poison a single record , but this has less impact than expected : it 's just one record , and many properties require multiple hostnames to operate , and it 's harder to hack them all .
Dan Kaminsky found an approach that 's dramatically more effective than this , and it caused quite a furor in the security community .
The general approach is the same as the simple approach shown above , but the key difference is the nature of the forged payload .
In the simple example , our intention was to poison the final answer , the A record with the IP address , but what Dan discovered is that we can go up one level and hijack the authority records instead .
Before undertaking the attack , the bad guy configures a nameserver that 's authoritative for the bankofsteve.com zone , including whatever resource records he likes : A records , MX for email , etc .
There 's nothing stopping anybody from configuring his own nameserver to be authoritative for any domain , but it 's pointless because the root servers wo n't point to it : it 's got answers , but nobody ever asks it a question .
Step 1 — bad guy client requests a random name within the target domain ( www12345678.bankofsteve.com ) , something unlikely to be in cache even if other lookups for this domain have been done recently .
— bad guy client requests a within the target domain ( ) , something unlikely to be in cache even if other lookups for this domain have been done recently .
Step 2a —
As before , the bad guy sends a stream of forged packets to the victim , but instead of A records as part of an Answer , it instead delegates to another nameserver via Authority records .
" I do n't know the answer , but you can ask over there " .
The authority data may well contain the " real " bankofsteve.com nameserver hostnames , but the glue points those nameservers at badguy IPs .
This is the crucial poisoning , because a Query ID match means that the victim believes that badguy 's nameservers are authoritative for bankofsteve.com .
The bad guy now owns the entire zone .
Curiously , the rest of the steps do n't matter : the point of this process was to fake out the victim into thinking that badguy runs the domain in question , and that would have been successful in this step .
Once one of the victim 's queries has been poisoned — it could be any in the chain — all the rest are directed to badguy 's servers .
This is a devastating attack : by owning the entire target domain , the bad guy controls essentially everything with respect to that resolving nameserver .
He can redirect web visitors to his own servers ( imagine redirecting google.com ) , he can route email to his own servers via serving up bogus MX records .
The bad guy will typically set a very high TTL in the poisoning responses so that the victim will keep the bogus data in cache as long as possible .
Flurry of queries
Our example has shown a single query being hijacked , but this is unlikely to be successful : because of Query ID randomization , it 's not likely that that the bad guy will manage to get a hit in the short time required to match on 64 k IDs .
Instead , the bad guy issues a flurry of queries , each for a different random name under the main domain .
The first request caused the nameserver to perform the usual root - first resolution , but it eventually caches the valid ns1.bankofsteve.com values .
Subsequent queries within this domain go directly to that nameserver , skipping the root steps .
But the next request for a different random name ( which certainly wo n't be in cache ) causes an immediate query to the valid ns1 server .
The bad guy then throws a flood of forged data at the victim about that second random name , though the odds here are still pretty long .
Just for the sake of discussion , let 's assume that the bad guy can generate 50 forged replies for each random name query before the real reply arrives from the real nameserver .
This appears to be a very small chance , but when repeated over and over — and run from automated tools — success by the bad guy is likely .
It 's been reported that success can commonly be achieved in 10 seconds .
Going for the top
Our examples have all focused on hijacking an end domain , but the same techniques can do the same thing up a level : taking over .
COM , .NET , or the like .
By poisoning the Authority records for .COM and the like , the victim nameserver will route all DNS lookups to the bad guy 's nameservers .
This effectively hijacks all names under that top level , including domains he did n't actually request .
This gives a great deal of flexibility even though it may well require substantial computing and network resources to serve the flood of requests that this hijacking must generate .
What 's the fix ?
This all sounds awful : how does one fix this ?
As has been alluded to several times , it 's the small space — just 16 bits — of the Query ID that makes this attack possible .
Though certainly one might wish to increase that ID to something larger ( perhaps 32 bits ) , it 's simply not possible do that in the short term because it would break DNS on the internet : the fields are what they are , and they can't be changed casually .
DJB Was Right
One nameserver is notable for having gotten both the query - id and source - port randomness right from the start : DJBDNS by the legendary Daniel J. Bernstein .
Though long a lightning rod for controversy , he 's clearly walked the walk on security : there 's been just one minor security vulnerability in DJBDNS .
But an additional source of randomness is required nevertheless , and that 's been done by randomizing the source port .
Rather than use just a single UDP port , which is trivial to discover , a much larger range of ports is allocated by the nameserver and then used randomly when making outbound queries .
As one would imagine , the nameserver would keep track of which source port was used for each query : replies arriving on the wrong port would be discarded just as if the Query ID failed to match .
Microsoft 's updated DNS server is said to preallocate 2,500 UDP ports to use for these random queries , and for discussion we 'll round this down to an even power of two : 2 11 = 2,048 .
This yields this much larger transaction space :
Increasing the search space from 64 k to 134M provides far better odds for the good guys .
We presume that each nameserver provides a way of setting how large of a pool to use for these source ports , as well as a way of excluding certain port numbers known to be required for other purposes .
Summary
This has been an exceptionally serious vulnerability because it undermines the very faith in DNS : this is at the core of the internet .
Most experts believe that if you can't trust DNS , all else is lost , and we 're of this same mind .
There is far more detail about this vulnerability than we can present here , and we 'll urge the reader to consult other resources ( especially Dan 's presentation ) .
But we can include a few ( ahem ) random notes about this matter that did n't seem to fit in elsewhere , and seem important and / or interesting enough to include in this paper .
Patch your servers :
Tools exist to make exploit - in - a - box available to even low - skilled bad guys .
: Tools exist to make exploit - in - a - box available to even low - skilled bad guys .
Authoritative - only nameservers are not vulnerable because they have no cache to poison , but we'd be surprised if no small number of " auth only " nameservers actually provided recursive service to at least some clients .
clients .
A nameserver need not be directly visible to the Internet to be exploitable .
By convincing a user to visit a particular web page , it can trigger a chain of events that reliably lead to poisoning .
Even patched servers may still be vulnerable if an intervening firewall performs Port Address Translation in a way that un-randomizes the source ports .
It 's been suggested that DNSSEC or IP v6 are solutions to this problem , but this is only in theory .
Both of these technologies have to be fully rolled out to be effective , and this is likely years away , at best .
The Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) is only a partial protection against being redirected to malicious websites .
Putting up a fake BankOfSteve.com website will have the wrong SSL certificate name ( which is a warning to the user who 's paying attention ) , but the great majority of users skip right through those warnings .
But the bad guy can subvert even SSL : since many Certificate Authorities validate a user 's control over a domain by sending email , hijacking a mailserver by attacking the cert vendor 's resolving DNS , this may well mean that an attacker can obtain a fully - valid certificate for the target domain .
This is very scary .

Autoline Detroit Podcast
Uh-oh .
In the pell - mell race to develop lithium - ion batteries for plug-ins , EV's and hybrids , has any automaker taken a hard look at where all that lithium is going to come from ?
Guess what ?
Not only are global lithium supplies pretty tight , prices are about to skyrocket .
Today , the United States imports almost all of its lithium .
We get most of it from Chile , then Argentina , and a little bit from Canada and Zimbabwe .
The only producer in America is actually a German company , Metallgesellschaft , which has a mine in Nevada .
Yet , even though we import most of our lithium , the United States is the world 's largest processor of the material .
John McElroy is host of the TV program " Autoline Detroit " .
Every week he brings his unique insights as an auto industry insider to Autoblog readers .
Follow the jump to continue reading this week 's editorial .
But a lot of others want to get in on the game .
China , no surprise , is emerging as a major player .
It 's buying all the lithium it can from Australia .
China does have some lithium sources of its own , but they 're mainly in Tibet .
( Say !
Do you think that 's another reason why they 're so hard - core about keeping Tibet within the People 's Republic ? )
Right now , all lithium producers around the world are running flat out , and plans are afoot to ramp up production dramatically .
But while there 's a lot of lithium in planet Earth , I 'm told that it 's kind of like oil shale : it 's there , but it 's not cheap or easy to get .
And there are other competing demands for using lithium , like in producing ceramic , glass and aluminum .
And for air conditioning systems .
It 's even used by the pharmaceutical industry for treating depression .
Now the auto industry wants to start using huge amounts of it .
" Demand will soon outstrip supply .
We 're going to see prices spike , " Christian M. Lastoskie , Ph.D. , of the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering , at the University of Michigan , tells me .
You'd think that such a valuable material would get recycled a lot , but that 's not the case .
Today , only 3 % to 4 % is recycled , and while that will probably increase , it wo n't increase a lot .
Recycling lithium takes a lot of energy , so much so that recycled lithium costs five to six times more than getting it from virgin material .
That could prompt battery researchers to search out other alternatives for advanced batteries , but so far not much has happened .
" Everyone searching for alternatives keeps coming back to lithium because it offers so many advantages in weight and storage capacity , " says Lastoskie .
It sure looks like the auto industry is locking itself into a future that depends on a precious resource , which is in tight supply , and that has to be imported .
I 'm just asking folks , but in our rush to get better fuel economy are we about to replace one form of dependency for another ?

CreditCards.com compiled this state - by - state listing of credit card debt collection statutes of limitations by individually researching each state ’s laws and court rulings .
We ’ve linked to the law where it is available ; additional notes below .
Credit card debt statute of limitations , by state
Notes
The chart shows the time limit on revolving credit accounts such as credit card agreements .
Most state laws and codes do not refer specifically to “ credit cards ” or “ credit card agreements . ”
Instead , the statutes tend to use general terms such as “ written contracts ” or “ open accounts . ”
State laws are subject to change .
Judges deciding specific cases may interpret state laws differently ; those court rulings may then be overturned .
Judges also may rule on which state ’s law should apply — the one where the consumer resides , or where the card issuer is located .
While the federal Truth In Lending Act defines credit cards as “ open - end credit plans , ” that ’s irrelevant to the discussion of state statutes of limitation .
State laws are concerned with contracts and agreements , and how long they may be enforced .
The most recent full update of the chart was in March 2013 , with minor updates in October 2013 , May 2014 , May 2015 , August 2017 and November 2017 .
The chart was also re-checked for accuracy in March 2020 .

See “ How to tell when credit card debt legally expires ” for tips on sorting out whether your debt is too old to be legally collectible .
What a statute of limitations is , how it works
Creditors and debt collectors have a limited time window in which to sue debtors for nonpayment of credit card bills .
That limit is set by a state ’s statute of limitations .
These laws exist to protect people from claims being brought after evidence has disappeared .
Anyone with unpaid credit card debt should know their state ’s statute .
“ In most states , the statute of limitations period on debts is between three and 10 years ; in some states , the period is longer , ” according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) .
Debts that have lingered longer than the statutes allow are often referred to as “ time - barred debts . ”
Time - barred debt
“ If a debt collector sues you to collect a time - barred debt , you can have the suit dismissed by letting the court or judge know the debt is , indeed , time - barred , ” according to the FTC .
Debt collectors and consumer advocates , however , caution that the statute of limitations ( SOL ) does not prevent debt collectors from attempting to collect on debts .
They just cannot successfully sue to collect the debts — assuming the debtor shows up in court to assert his or her rights .
“ Debt does n’t go away just because it goes beyond a time threshold . ”
“ Debt does n’t go away just because it goes beyond a time threshold , ” said Mark Schiffman , vice president of public affairs at ACA International , the collection industry ’s largest trade group .
Mary Spector , an associate law professor at Southern Methodist University ’s Dedman School of Law in Dallas , says many consumers ignore court notices about old debts and end up losing cases that might otherwise be thrown out of court because the statute of limitations has run out .
“ In Texas , it ’s usually up to the defendant to show that the debt is time - barred under the statute of limitations , ” Spector says .
Her advice :
Do n’t ignore the court papers and get a consumer lawyer to represent you .
Credit card debt :
Which state ’s law applies ?
Nearly all the top credit card issuers name the state whose laws should apply to their card agreements .
Here ’s what they say :
Issuer State Years credit card debt is collectible in court American Express Utah 6 Chase Delaware 3 Bank of America North Carolina 3 Citi South Dakota 6 Capital One Virginia * 3 ** Discover Delaware 3 US Bank *** *** Wells Fargo South Dakota 6 USAA Nevada 4 Barclays Delaware 3 * Capital
One says Virginia law rules , unless the cardholder ’s state has a longer statute .
** 5 years if creditor produces signed account agreement and documentation of interest rate and repayment terms .
*** US Bank ’s terms and conditions agreement specifies which state law should apply to arbitration , but not for other matters , such as unpaid debt .
Court rulings may take precedence
To construct the chart above , CreditCards.com examined statutes and judicial opinions and consulted legal experts to cover all 50 states and the District of Columbia .
In most states , the statute of limitation is clear .
In some , however , we could find no definitive answer because of ambiguities in state law or conflicts between the law and court rulings .
The uncertainty over when credit card debt expires arises because state laws governing contracts are interpreted by the courts when they are applied to individual circumstances , and those interpretations may change over time .
That was the case in Georgia in January 2008 , when a Georgia Court of Appeals ruled ( in Hill v. American Express ) that the statute of limitations on an unpaid credit card debt was six years .
The Georgia code sets the limit on open - ended accounts at four years , but the appeals court applied the law for written contracts to card debt in this case .
Another 2008 Court of Appeals ruling ( in Phoenix Recovery Group , Inc. v. Mehta ) affirmed the Hill ruling and settled the law in the state , according to the Georgia Department of Law .
In other states , it remains difficult to predict how courts will rule when faced with a question about expiring credit card debt .
Kentucky specifies a five - year expiration period for oral contracts and 15 years for written contracts .
The period that will apply to card debt is unclear ; some courts in other states have held that credit card agreements , because they can be changed unilaterally by the card issuer , do not qualify as written contracts .
Legal experts said they are unaware of precedent - setting rulings within Kentucky on the question , leaving courts to weigh the circumstances and documents of each case individually .
Federal law
The Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act , the federal law that governs how and when debt collectors can contact consumers and collect on unpaid bills , dictates where legal action on debts can be filed .
According to Section 811 of the law , debt collectors may file suit in the jurisdiction where the “ consumer signed the contract ” or where the consumer lives .
Some credit card agreements may stipulate that the laws governing the home state of the issuer , not the consumer , determine the terms and major provisions of the contract .
That means that if the credit card holder lives in Maine , but the issuer is based in Delaware , the Delaware statute of limitations may apply .
Do not confuse the statute of limitations with the length of time that a debt may remain on a credit report .
A bankruptcy , for instance , will remain on a credit report for 10 years regardless of the statute of limitations .
If a creditor successfully wins a judgment for payment of a debt , that information can remain on a credit report for seven years .
When does the clock start to tick ?
It may vary by state , but generally the statute of limitations begins when a credit card account becomes delinquent — the date of the last payment .
However , in some states the clock begins to tick six months after the last payment .
To determine the deadline to file suit on the debt , add the number of years of the statute of limitations to the start time .
Re-aging debt
Consumers should be aware of a practice called re-aging of old debts .
The clock on the statute of limitations may start anew if a consumer makes a payment — even a small amount — on a debt that has exceeded or is approaching the end of the statute of limitations .
Acknowledging an old debt may also extend the time limit on potential debt collection lawsuits .
Consumer advocates now advise debtors not to acknowledge old debts or debts they do n’t recognize as their own to avoid inadvertently resetting the clock on the statute of limitations .
“ Any new activity on it could re-age it and make it more collectable , ” says Lauren Saunders , managing attorney for the National Consumer Law Center , a consumer rights group .
“ You ’re better off ignoring a call about an ancient debt .
It ’s best to send them a letter saying I do n’t recognize this or please verify it . ”
No , he did n't assemble it by whacking a large wrench against a pile of parts either .
But this guy is a serious engineer , cooking up an auto - fire paintball sentry gun .
And although this is n't necessarily gameplay footage , you can watch as some poor test subject wearing a BMX helmet gets pounded in several tests .
So I 'm gonna say its germane because , shit , it 's Sunday , and sentries are a treasured friend / loathsome foe in Team Fortress 2 , Perfect Dark , and other games .
And this is PC gaming , if getting shot to shit by a PC is a game .

Politico and The Denver Post hosted a morning breakfast panel Tuesday , August 26 , 2008 , featuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . | Robert A. Reeder Pelosi says polls shortchange Obama
DENVER — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) told convention - goers Tuesday morning that polls are underestimating the strength of Barack Obama , contending he will defeat John McCain with the support of new or intermittent voters , who are not generally polled .
“ I ’m very comfortable with those polls , ” Pelosi said at a rooftop breakfast panel near the Democratic National Convention .
“ I think he is trouncing him .
I want more of a spread , of course — I want it all . ”

Pelosi paused to chuckle along with the crowd , then added : “ We will get much more in the House and the Senate , and we have to have a Democratic president — nothing less is at stake than our economy , our Constitution , our budget , our reputation in the world , ending this war — the list goes on . ”
“ We cannot be diverted to the silliness that the McCain campaign — of course they want to talk about Paris Hilton , ” Pelosi told the panel , presented by Yahoo News , Politico and The Denver Post .
“ Would they want to talk about why they have the worst record of job creation in America ? ”

The speaker said Obama and the other Democratic presidential candidates “ have attracted millions of more voters — first - voters voters and many more voters who have n’t voted in a long time .
“ Many of them are not even reachable by these pollsters , ” Pelosi said .
“ These are polls of likely voters .
Likely voters are people who have voted in the last two elections , and they are likely to vote again .
They are not the universe of people who will vote on Nov. 4 . ”
Pelosi said the key is to “ deliver clarity of message about what the choice is , and deliver force on the ground . ”
“ We will own the ground Election Day , ” she said .
Pelosi , the chairman of the convention , was one of the few speakers at Monday ’s opening session to be tough on John McCain .
Other speakers were criticized on blogs and on cable television for giving the presumptive Republican nominee a pass .
“ I was n’t taking any hits at John McCain — I was just speaking truth about his record , ” she said .
“ When they talk about John McCain having experience , he has the experience of being wrong — on the war in Iraq , on children ’s health , on energy independence , on tax cuts — you name it . ”
Pelosi said she sees McCain ’s initial inability to name the number of houses he owns as “ emblematic of the differences between Democrats and Republicans . ”
“ Democrats have wealth , too — we salute wealth , ” she said .
" But let me tell you this :
This election is about the economy .
It always is , and it ’s a question of who has the leverage .
And for eight years , the wealthiest 1 percent has had the leverage . ”
The speaker said Democrats are tough on national security but were rightly skeptical of the real threat from Iraq .
“ Think of me as a lioness — you threaten my cubs , you have a problem , ” she said .
Pelosi said that if Obama is elected , the first 100 days of his administration would be “ a period of civility and reaching out to Republicans . ”
President Bush , she said , “ was very isolated — he does n’t want to work in a bipartisan way .
Barack Obama does . ”
Pelosi also said she see a new emphasis on fiscal discipline , transparency and honest in government .
Pelosi said a bill to make health insurance available to 10 million children , which Democrats have tried repeatedly to pass , “ will be one of the first bills we would put on the president ’s desk . ”
She said that with — “ God willing ” — a President Obama , the country also would speed the withdrawal from Iraq .
Pelosi said : “ That ’s not a full 100 - days agenda .
It ’s more like 100 hours . ”
On the Democrats ’ domestic agenda , she said she wants listeners to think of four words : “ Science , science , science and science . ”
“ I think that could take up the 100 days , ” she said .
Pelosi also vowed that Democrats would continue to use its investigative power to hold the Bush administration accountable : “ This is n’t over — we have Karl Rove to deal with . ”
But she said that having the “ exercise ” of trying to impeach President Bush would be “ viewed as a political act ” and would not be effective .
Pelosi praised Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) for what she called his “ courageous ” appearance at the convention , followed by Obama 's wife , the evening 's keynote speaker .
“ Just when you had seen it all … the beautiful , beautiful presentation by Michelle Obama . ”
Pelosi declined to compare McCain to a popular culture figure , as his campaign has compared Obama to Paris Hilton .
“ I ’ll leave that to the popular culture folks , ” she said .

A POINT OF VIEW
Many innocent people are on the DNA database
We hear thousands of platitudes in daily life , and many are uttered to steer us away from scrutinising questionable practices , writes Katharine Whitehorn .
The great writer and journalist G.K. Chesterton once wrote that he had spent all his life finding out that platitudes were true .
And maybe some of them are , though quite a few are ambiguous .
" Ne 'er cast a clout till May is out " - no -one seems to be sure whether it 's until the May tree is in bloom , or the month of May is over .
But some platitudes are all wrong - " No smoke without fire " for instance , as any teacher smeared for life by a spiteful child knows only too well .
If your DNA 's on the police database and shows up at a crime scene , you 're a suspect right away even if you just delivered a pizza to the victim
Hear Radio 4's A Point of View
And there is one platitude going around which is seriously damaging .
Whenever doubts about nationwide computerised health records or DNA banks or ID cards or biometric passports come up , someone will smugly say : " If you 've done nothing wrong you 've nothing to worry about . "
Oh no ?
What about the news item in last week 's papers that the police have kept the DNA records of 40,000 children who are innocent ?
And at the end of July some research by the Human Genetics Commission , funded by the Home Office , led to the Telegraph headline : " One million innocent Britons ' criminalised ' says damning report . "
If your DNA 's on the police database and shows up at a crime scene , you 're a suspect right away even if you just delivered a pizza to the victim .
The database apparently contains the genetic records of four million people and insurance companies are already sniffing round it like hungry wolves , to exclude anyone with a dodgy heritage .
DNA 's been used on the whole more to prove innocence than guilt so far - but the idea that if you 've done nothing wrong you can't still be stitched up by a crook or a lazy cop or even a simple mistake in the original input is nonsense .
Security issue
And what about identity theft , which is rife ?
The more there is on record , the more vulnerable you are - people go through your dustbins to pick out discarded bank details , credit card numbers , official communications .
I ought to shred everything , I know , but I tend to tip the contents of the cat tray over sensitive material instead .
It 's risky even to fill in those spaces at the beginning of your diary for telephone number , passport number , car registration and so on .
I used to do that - until I had my handbag pulled off my shoulder with the diary in it , and my keys - so the thief knew exactly which car and which house to go for .
Nowadays I put nothing in except my blood group and an emergency number to ring .
Dixon could be trusted but what about computer security Gordon Brown , attacked on the security issue generally , reassured the world that it was all OK because they were now going in for - among other things - biometrics - and it took only a week for Ben Goldacre , in his Bad Science column in the Guardian , to show exactly how , and how easily , these can be faked too .
And the new " secure passport " ?
Someone had easily faked one of those in only 24 hours .
When some civil servant sent a disc containing the details of every single recipient of child benefit through the post and it failed to arrive - heaven knows who has it now - some of us thought that had put paid to the ID idea for good .
But no .
When it comes to the usefulness of personal records , there 's another aspect to it .
When a freedom of information act came in America , it did n't take long before officialdom realised that the best way to keep its secrets was to record them in such massive detail that the man who started a search at age twenty would have died of old age before he found what he wanted .
So even when the millions of records are legitimate , as from criminal convictions , if there are too many of them , they may well be just too many to trawl through effectively , whether it's the " too many crooks " platitude or " hide a leaf in a forest " .
Anyway , what about this " done nothing wrong " platitude ?
We 're so set about with prohibitions and rules nowadays that it 's quite hard to get through a month , let alone a lifetime , without doing something illegal , and you do n't have to have done anything all that serious to have broken some sort of law .
Identity thieves
Even the most harmless of us have probably at least once gone over the speed limit .
And if we paid a fine there 'll be something on the record .
I am dead against people using mobile phones while driving - but when you 're two hours late and totally stationary in a traffic jam ?
Health and safety rules spring up like mushrooms and are all too easy to break by accident - ask any restaurateur and there 's all this extraordinary stuff about people being drilled with fascist intensity about what they put in their dustbins .
I can never make out from the news reports whether they 're in trouble for having too much rubbish or too little , and I daresay they can't either .
Perhaps the expert identity thieves who go through dustbins could be hired by the council to sort this out .
A bewildering array of institutions keep personal data about us My husband 's favourite military maxim was " if you hit anything call it the target " .
Unfortunately today 's governments seem to think that if they 've called anything a target they 've hit it - that if there 's a rule about something , then it 's all fixed .
Their trouble is that they do n't read enough thrillers .
If they did , they 'd realise that anything cops can do crooks can do too - that it 's extremely difficult , once you 've gathered information , to make sure it is n't used by the bad guys .
Donald Westlake 's book Bad News has an intricate plot about a woman calling herself Little Feather claiming to be the last descendant of a native American tribe which owns a multimillion dollar casino .
Her accomplice has to break into a house to steal a hair off someone 's hairbrush for her to produce as her own DNA .
Soon after I 'd read that , I went through the closest airport security check I 've ever encountered , for a domestic flight from , of all places , Newport News , Virginia .
They wiped our cases with a special rag that could detect whether we'd had traces of explosives on our hands when we zipped them up .
And I thought that I would undergo all this rather more willingly if I did n't know that any Westlake crook could find a way round it in five minutes .
Knowledge is power
And as for computer security - sometimes protected by little more than a password , for heaven 's sake - remember the episode of Morse where the crook had spent his time in prison becoming an ace geek , and managed to falsify the police computer records to give Morse himself a disgraceful past ?
The day was only saved by looking up the good old newspaper records of the Oxford Times .
" Knowledge is power " - that 's another platitude , and the more private stuff governments find out about us , keep it , use it , deduce things from it , the more power they have over us .
There was a good reason why people tore up their identity cards with joy at the end of the war - they saw them as a symbol of a Big Brother state .
A good reason , too , why the pass laws in South Africa were so detested - admittedly they carried a worse element , since only those with the right pass could work in particular areas , but anything which allows the police to pull you in just for not having it on you is alarming ( and I speak as one who is on her third diary this year and her last pair of glasses ) .
I daresay some of these massive inroads into our private particulars can be used to good effect on occasion - that not all of us will suffer from misinformation or the confusion of two records or petty corruption or massive incompetence or machines simply not working .
But anyone who really believes that information kept by officialdom will only ever be used for our good should remember the reply given by the Duke of Wellington to a man who said " Mr Jones , I believe ? " and was told " if you believe that you 'll believe anything " .
A selection of your comments appears below .
You are very right .
Saying the old , " if you have nothing to hide , .. " platitude is a cover for taking away your rights .
We have to remember that the may function of any government is to suppress dissent and to remove freedoms by regulating all actions and therefore , thoughts .
Orwell was right , just a little premature .
But I suspect the future will be much worse than he imagined .
When the president of the USA can say that the constitution is " just a goddamn piece of paper " and get away with it , we are already lost .
James Smith , João Pessoa , Brazil
The whole thing would be farcical if it was n't that we 're slowly becoming more and more of a police state .
I hope that when it comes to the crunch , it will be millions who refuse to have anything to do with ID cards , not thousands .
As for airport security , most of what the public sees is purely for show and achieves very little .
It 's inconsistent between airports and sometimes checks appear to be performed based on the mood of the personnel on the day .
Dave , Cambridge , UK
It is a long time since I read such nonsense , which seems to have very little fact provided to back up the assertions made .
It is scare mongering of the worst kind .
Is the author a " Daily Mail " reader ?
Big Farang , St Albans DNA is no different to fingerprints .
If the police find fingerprints all over a crime scene they will check to see who they belong to and why they were there , so they can eliminate all the innocent parties .
Merely planting a hair at a crime scene wo n't be enough to send someone to jail , because DNA is only a small part in the investigation process , which needs to prove means , motive and opportunity .
The idea that a super - criminal could commit a crime , erase all trace of their presence , and then replace that evidence with convincing evidence of another person being there , is quite frankly laughable .
Thomas , Maidstone , UK My ( least ) favourite platitude is the one that warns us that we must be protected from the " Tyranny of the Majority " .
A moment 's reflection shows that the mathematical alternative to " Tyranny of the Majority " is " Tyranny of Some Minority " .
Reading through all these infringements of our privacy and our liberty , does anyone believe that they would be approved by a majority of The People , voting in a referendum ?
Of course not .
But The People are not permitted to vote on it in a referendum , lest there be a " Tyranny of the Majority " .
So we are instead tyrannised by a tiny minority of professional politicians and bureaucrats who want to collect as much information as they can about us .
Stephen ,
What a load of rubbish .
The article is epitomised by the statement " If your DNA is on the police database and it is found at a crime scene , then you 're a suspect even if you 've just delivered a pizza " .
I 'm afraid to say that you 're a suspect if they find your DNA or not , just for being at a crime scene .
The DNA is irrelevant in such a case !
And , unfortunately , the article is flawed in so many similar ways .
Barry , Wirral
What a sad , sad state of affairs this country and its people have gotten itself into .
Much to say , but I 'll just say that the TV program " Big Brother " has been used to indoctrinate us in to thinking it's ok to spy on people and attempts to make less of the real big brother which is coming your way soon .
I 'm off .
Will the last person to leave , please turn off the CTV cameras ...

What are these ?
UPDATED
ABC News ’ behavior surrounding one of its biggest “ scoops ” is already an object lesson of what ’s wrong with American journalism .
The news organization has proved unwilling — so far , at any rate — to come clean about how it was manipulated in the 2001 ( and later ) investigation into the anthrax attacks in the US following September 11 .
The network ’s hyperventilating broadcasts of leaked , false allegations purportedly tying the anthrax to Saddam Hussein ’s Iraqi regime — see Glenn Greenwald ’s meticulous examination of the coverage — was bad enough .
What the organization is doing now is journalistically unforgivable .
Pressthink ’s Jay Rosen and I , among many others who care about the journalism craft , believe ABC has some big , vital questions to answer .
Here are three :
1. Sources who are granted confidentiality give up their rights when they
lie or mislead the reporter .
Were you lied to or misled by your sources
when you reported several times in 2001 that anthrax found in domestic
attacks came from Iraq or showed signs of Iraqi involvement ?
2 . It now appears that the attacks were of domestic origin and the anthrax
came from within U.S. government facilities .
This leads us to ask you : who
were the “ four well - placed and separate sources ” who falsely told ABC News
that tests conducted at Fort Detrick had found the presence of bentonite in
the anthrax sent to Sen .
Tom Daschle , causing ABC
News to connect the
attacks to Iraq in multiple reports over a five day period in October , 2001 ?
3 . A substantially false story that helps make the case for war by raising
fears about enemies abroad attacking the United States is released into
public debate because of faulty reporting done by ABC News .
How that
happened and who was responsible is itself a major story of public
interest .
What is ABC News doing to re-report these events , to figure out
what went wrong and to correct the record for the American people who were
misled ?
Salon ’s Greenwald has a batch of other questions in his follow - up piece today .
They are all important .
But Jay and I believe the above three go to the heart of what ABC did , or did n’t do , in its journalism during those frightening days after the 9/11 attacks .
We hope that lots of people will respectfully ask these questions , too .
( If you do a posting , please send either Jay or me a note — here ’s my email — or post a link in the comments on our respective blogs . )
Unnamed sources are bad enough , but sometimes they ’re necessary .
My opinion about unnamed sources who use journalists to spread lies is simple .
I would blow the whistle , period .
This kind of behavior is beyond the pale .
So is ABC ’s behavior , in not telling us what happened .
Would blowing the whistle on lying sources lead to fewer sources ?
It might .
Sometimes people do n’t know they ’re lying , when higher - ups tell them to do the leaking with misinformation fed to the sources in the first place .
But the over - reliance on unnamed sources stains the journalistic craft in any case , and situations like this one encourage the public to believe absolutely nothing that relies on such sources ( not a bad policy , actually , but dangerous in the cases where the sources are telling reporters about truly terrible behavior ) .
Even before the latest twists in the anthrax case , ABC News was deeply tarnished by its terrible journalism in 2001 and its protection of liars who may well be criminals .
Every day that passes takes ABC further into the kind of scandal territory that , at some point , it cannot overcome .
UPDATE
Others who have weighed in on this issue ( some before this posting and others it was published ) include :
Kevin Drumm of the Washington Monthly , who wrote ( and with more hope I ’ve managed to summon up , given how long ABC has been aware of the problems with its story ) :
At a guess , Brian Ross is re-reporting this story as we speak .
I ’d be shocked if he were doing anything else — and I ’d say that part of that re-reporting ought to include a full explanation of exactly who was peddling the bentonite lie in the first place , and why they were doing it .
At the New Republic , John Judis called for a congressional investigation .
This will inevitably turn into a circus , given Congreess ’ inability to do much but blather , but perhaps it would help at the margins .
Dan Kennedy , longtime media critic , agrees that “ ABC has some explaining to do . ”
He makes the useful point that if ABC ’s sources acted in good faith , however implausible that may sound ( and I think the chances of good faith there are vanishingly small ) , then they should not be outed .
The test , which began as a crude physical inspection , has become more sophisticated over the years .
In the 1970s and ’ 80s , the test was performed by a buccal smear  the scraping of cells from the inside of the mouth  and the sample studied for chromosomal material .
Over the past 40 years , dozens of female athletes tested in this manner have tested “ positively ” for maleness .
That ’s because these tests do n’t measure “ maleness ” or “ femaleness . ”
They measure  and not always reliably  the presence of a Y chromosome , or Y chromosomal material , which no small number of females have .
The condition , known as androgen insensitivity , occurs in about 1 in 20,000 individuals .
Basically , a woman may have a Y chromosome , but her body does not respond to the genetic information that it contains .
Some women with androgen insensitivity live their lives unaware that they have it .
By any measure , though ( except the measure of the Olympic test ) , they are women .
In 1996 , eight female athletes at the Atlanta Games tested positively .
Seven of these women were found to have some degree of androgen insensitivity , and one an enzyme defect .
All were subsequently allowed to return to competition .

Ten years later , however , Santhi Soundarajan , a runner from India , was stripped of her silver medal in the 800 meters at the Asian Games for “ failing ” a sex test .
An Indian athletics official told The Associated Press that Soundarajan had “ abnormal chromosomes . ”
She was ridiculed in the press , and her career was destroyed .
In the wake of her global humiliation , she attempted suicide .
You might think that gender testing at the Olympics is conducted to weed out transsexual women , who might be perceived to have some sort of physical advantage over natal females .
Yet this is not the case .
Since 2004 , the International Olympic Committee has allowed transsexuals to compete as long as they have had sex- reassignment surgery and have gone through a minimum of two years of post - operative hormone replacement therapy .
( As for the advantages that people born male supposedly have in competing against people born female , the combination of surgery and hormones appears to eliminate it entirely .
Studies show that postoperative transsexual women perform at or near the baseline for female athletes in general . )

Although the fighting over South Ossetia is not over , and fighting for another Georgian enclave , Abkhazia , looks like developing , it is perhaps not too early to learn some tentative lessons from the crisis .
1 . Do not punch a bear on the nose unless it is tied down .
Did President Saakashvili miscalculate ?
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili must have thought that Russia would not react strongly when he sent his forces in on the eve of the Olympic games to regain control of a territory he had insisted must remain part of Georgia , albeit with some form of autonomy .
Yet Russia was always likely to respond .
It already had forces there , leading the peacekeeping force agreed back in the easier days of 1992 between President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and President Edward Shevardnadze of Georgia , himself the former Soviet foreign minister who helped bring the Cold War to an end .
Russia has been supporting the separatists in South Ossetia and handed out Russian passports to the population , thereby enabling it to claim that it was defending its own citizens .
The result of what many see as his miscalculation is that President Saakashvili might well lose any hope of reasserting Georgian power in the enclave .
2 . Russia is in a determined mood , to say the least .
Russia , as it has so often done in the past , sees itself being encircled .
In a revealing interview with former BBC Moscow correspondent Tim Whewell earlier this year , an adviser to the then President Vladimir Putin , Gleb Pavlosky , said that the Russian leadership had concluded after the Orange Revolution in Ukraine that " this is what we faced in Moscow , that they would try to export this to us , that we should prepare for this situation and very quickly strengthen our political system ... "
What applied after Ukraine moved towards the West also applied as Georgia did the same .
Moscow wanted to prevent any such internal revolution in Russia itself and therefore saw Ukraine and Georgia as hostile influences .
It is not clear how far Russia wants to push this , but given that it says it wants to re-establish order in South Ossetia , that probably means a permanent presence , with no return to a Georgian government role .
Diplomats think it unlikely that Russia will invade Georgia ' proper ' .
3 . Remember Kosovo .
Russia was mightily displeased when the West supported the separation of Kosovo from Serbia and warned of consequences .
This might be one of them .
Of course , Russia has not argued in this crisis that it is simply doing what the West did in Kosovo - that would undermine its own argument that states should not be broken up without agreement .
But everyone knows that underneath , Kosovo is not far from its mind .
4 . Georgia is unlikely to join Nato anytime soon .
Georgia and Ukraine were denied membership of Nato in April , although they were allowed to develop an action plan that could lead to membership one day .
The Americans argued for both countries to be accepted , but the Germans and others countered that the region was too unstable for these countries to join at the moment and that in particular Georgia , a state with a border dispute , should not be given formal Nato support .
5 . Vladmir Putin is still in charge .
It was Mr Putin , prime minister not president these days , who went to Beijing for the Olympic opening ceremony and who then rushed to the crisis region to take control of the Russian response .
His language was uncompromising - Russia was right to intervene , he stated .
6 . Do not allow a cuckoo to police the nest .
Mr Shevardnadze 's decision in 1992 to allow Russia into South Ossetia as part of the peacekeeping force enabled a later and very different Russian government from the one led by Boris Yeltsin to gradually extend its influence and control .
It was not hard for Russia to justify its intervention .
It simply stated that its citizens were not only at risk but under attack .
7 . The West still does not know how to deal with Russia .
Some of the old Cold War arguments are resurfacing , with no consensus about what to do .
There are the neo-conservatives , led by US Vice - President Dick Cheney ( and supported by Republican presidential candidate John McCain ) who see Georgia ( and Ukraine ) as flag bearers for freedom which must be supported .
In due course , they argue , Russia will be forced to change , just as the old Soviet Union was .
Against that is the argument , expressed to the BBC for example on Sunday by the former British Foreign Secretary Lord Owen , that it is " absurd " to treat Russia like the Soviet Union and that Georgia made a miscalculation in South Ossetia for which it is now paying .
8 . Are borders in Europe to be sacrosanct for ever ?
It has been one of the rules of post - war Europe - borders cannot be changed except by agreement , as say in Czechoslovakia .
Perhaps this rule has been applied too inflexibly .
Yet governments like that of Georgia are reluctant to give up any territory , even when the local population is so clearly hostile and might be in that state simply as a result of some past arbitrary decision .
It was the Soviet Union that created a semi-autonomous region of South Ossetia in Georgia in 1922 .
Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 .
Will this lead to trouble one day ?
9 . August is good month in which to reflect on alliances .
In August 1914 , the First World War broke out following the assassination in June of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo .
It did so because alliances had been formed in Europe which came into play inexorably .
Russia supported Serbia , Germany supported Austria , France supported Russia and Britain came in when Belgium was invaded .
Alliances must not be entered into lightly or unadvisedly .
If Georgia had been in Nato , what would have happened ?

What are these ?
Mr. McCain ’s record on Iraq is far worse than Mrs. Clinton’s .
He did n’t just cast a vote but was a drumbeater for the propaganda Mr. McClellan cites , including the neocon fantasies of a newly democratic Middle East .
On “ Hardball ” and “ Meet the Press ” in March 2003 , Mr. McCain invoked that argument , along with the promise that Americans would be “ welcomed as liberators , ” to assert the war would be “ one of the best things that ’s happened to America . ”
To cover up these poor judgments now  and questionable actions , including his public boosting of Ahmad Chalabi , then a lobbying client of the current McCain campaign guru , Charles Black  Mr. McCain is hoping that the “ liberal media ” will once again be complicit enablers .
We ’ll see .
He ’s also counting on the press to let him blur his record by accentuating his subsequent criticism of the war ’s execution  as if the war ’s execution ( also criticized by countless Democrats ) , not its conception , was the fatal error .
His other tactic is to try to create a smoke screen by smearing Barack Obama as unpatriotic .
Mr. McCain has suggested that the Democratic front - runner is the Hamas candidate and has piled on to Mr. Bush ’s effort to slur Mr. Obama as an apostle of “ appeasement . ”
A campaign ad presented Mr. McCain as “ the American president Americans have been waiting for ” ( not to be confused , presumably , with the un-American president Al Qaeda has been waiting for ) .
Now Mr. McCain is chastising Mr. Obama for not having visited Iraq since 2006  a questionable strategy , you ’d think , given that Mr. McCain ’s own propagandistic visit to a “ safe ” Baghdad market is one of his biggest embarrassments .
Then again , in his frantic efforts to explain why he sided with Mr. Bush to oppose an expanded G.I. bill that the Senate passed by 75 to 22 , Mr. McCain has attacked Mr. Obama for not enlisting in the military .
Besides making Mr. McCain look ever angrier next to his serene opponent , this eruption raises the question of why he chose double - standard partisanship over principle by not applying this criterion to the blunderers who took us into Iraq .
Unlike Mr. Obama , who was 7 years old in 1968 , Mr. Bush and company could have served in Vietnam as Mr. McCain did .
The McCain campaign may have no choice but to double down on Iraq  what other issue does the candidate have ?
 but it ca n’t count on smear tactics or journalistic and public amnesia to indefinitely enforce the McCain narrative .
As the McClellan circus shows , unexpected bombshells will keep intervening  detonating not only on the ground in Iraq but also in Washington , where more Bush alumni with reputations to salvage may yet run for cover about what went down in 2002 - 3 .
As F. Scott Fitzgerald would have it , we will be borne back ceaselessly into the past .
Or so we will be as long as Americans continue to die in Iraq and as long as politicians like Mr. Bush , Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton refuse to accept responsibility for their roles , major and minor , in abetting this national tragedy .
Anyone who has a blog has probably seen blog spam ; comments to the blog that simply try to entice people to go to some other site .
Most of the time the site being advertised is simply trying to boost its search engine rankings to generate more ad revenue .
The more links there are to a site , the more popular the search engines figure it is , and the higher up in the search results it ends up .
Blog spam , therefore , is frequently thought to be a good way to boost the search engine rankings .
In some cases this turns malicious .
Some sites engage in wholesale intellectual property theft to boost their rankings .
A few of weeks ago , however , I started noticing something far more insidious .
I moderate all comments to my blog .
This is something I started years ago to keep the blog somewhat family friendly , and to avoid propagating malicious content .
Recently I also completely disabled trackbacks to avoid boosting the search engine rankings for sites that steal my work .
This means I see every comment that comes into my blog .
The other day I noticed one that contained nothing more than a link to a fake Google site : google - images.google-us.info/index.html .
This looked very suspicious to me so I made a note of it .
Over the next several weeks I noticed a lot more of these , not only pointing to Google but also to Yahoo and MSN .
The servers they pointed to all had the same basic structure , such as google - homepage.google-us.info , msn-us.info , yahoo - us.info , etc .
Every one resolves to the same IP address : 124.217.253.8 .
That IP address is registered to Piradius . net in Singapore .
The server appears to be hosted out of Kuala Lumpur .
The domains , however , are registered in Ukraine :
Registrant Name : ermua Registrant Organization : santa banta Registrant Street1 : lenina str. 43/67 Registrant City : Kiev Registrant State / Province : Registrant Postal Code : 0444 Registrant Country : RU Registrant Phone : 044.763238 Registrant Email : yura_gpz@mail.ru
Domaintools.com confirms this .
You will soon see a related domain , xpantivirus.com .
That one is registered to Chebotarev Oleksandr , in Odessa , Ukraine .
This had me very curious and I wanted to know more about what this site was attempting to achieve .
Consequently , I fired up a virtual machine and started investigating .
What I found was an interesting tale of trickery .
AFP
GEORGIAN soldiers , tanks and fighter - planes struck Tskhinvali , the capital of the breakaway ( Russian - backed ) region of South Ossetia , on Friday August 8th .
Parts of the city were reported to be burning as Georgia 's president , Mikheil Saakashvili , declared that his forces had “ freed ” much of the area from separatist control .
The immediate cause of the fighting is unclear as claim and counterclaim abound .
But what is clear is that a conflict which has been simmering for years , has at last erupted .
What happens next will depend almost entirely on Russia 's response : 150 Russian tanks were reported to be entering South Ossetia on Friday .
Georgia 's government says that Russian planes have dropped bombs outside of South Ossetia including on the edge of Tblisi , the Georgian capital .
Alexander Lomaia , the secretary of Georgia 's National Security Council , told The Economist on Friday that “ this is an open military aggression and we are now at the state of undeclared war with Russia .
What else could you call it ? ” .
He also said that Georgia had announced a ceasefire in South Ossetia from 3 pm on Friday .
On its own , South Ossetia is unlikely to last long .
It is a tiny territory run by Russia 's security forces and a small and nasty clique of local thugs who live off smuggling goods and pocketing Russian aid money .
According to a Georgian television channel , some 70 % of Tskhinvali had been taken by government forces by the end of Friday morning .
It appears that Russia will get heavily involved — Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev , says that he must protect Russian citizens there .
The conflict could now quickly spiral into a war between Russian and Georgia , and engulf Abkhazia , a separatist region on the Black Sea coast in which Russia has much more strategic interest .
Russia says that Georgia fired first in South Ossetia and that several of its “ peacekeepers ” inside the territory have been killed .
Last month Russia sent warplanes into Georgian airspace — to deter an attack , it said .
The row has given Russia a chance to step up pressure on Georgia , portrayed in the Russian media as a tiresome and aggressive Western stooge .
The South Ossetian leader , Eduard Kokoity , said that he would force Georgian troops out of his self - declared republic ( which is a patchwork of villages and small towns , some controlled by Georgian authorities and others by separatists ) .
The quarrel in South Ossetia follows an escalation of tension in Abkhazia .
Russia has reinforced its military presence there , which is nominally part of a UN - monitored peacekeeping effort .
In the past few months European governments got more involved in the peace process and Germany drafted a plan for the economic revival of Abkhazia , indefinite autonomy and the return of Georgian refugees .
So far the plan has stalled .
The Abkhaz authorities are uneasy about the Russian embrace , but fear the return of Georgian refugees , once the largest ethnic group in the region .
Russia does not want to surrender its key role in Abkhazia .
As Russian gets involved in the war with Georgia , the disposition of political forces within the Kremlin itself may shift .
Russia 's prime minister Vladimir Putin , who is in China , indicated that Russia would retaliate against Georgia 's aggression .
Mr Medvedev may not be best pleased to start his presidency with a war in Georgia : it suggests that he may have to submit to the wishes of the hard - line military and security services .
But Mr Putin has a fierce dislike of Mr Saakashvili , Georgia 's maverick president , and seems determined to replace his government .
Mr Putin may also want to deal with Georgia in good time before Russia hosts 2014 winter Olympic games in Sochi , a Black - sea resort town only few miles from the Abkhaz border .
A military conflict in Georgia will also derail for a long time Georgia 's aspiration to join NATO — something that Russian finds deeply unpalatable .
Russia 's broader aim may be to try to roll back the advance of pro-Western forces in its “ near abroad ” by highlighting the West 's inability to help Georgia .
The hotting up of Georgia 's conflicts coincided with Kosovo 's declaration of independence , recognised by much of the West , and American pressure for the expansion of NATO to Georgia and Ukraine .
That move has been stymied , mainly by Germany ; Georgia was promised eventual NATO membership but no firm plan .
Though Georgia has become a vital corridor for oil and gas exports to Europe , this has not brought the support that its leaders had expected .
A lame - duck American administration has been able to do little , though Georgians hope a presidential - election victory by John McCain , an ardent supporter , may change their fortunes .
The country 's strong - willed and idiosyncratic president , Mr Saakashvili , is not seen by all European leaders as quite the paragon of legality , freedom and reform that he claims to be .
Georgia 's image was severely dented in November last year by a crackdown against the opposition .
All the talk in the credit markets this week is that another big bomb is about to go off in the financial system .
That helped pull the stock market down Tuesday for a second session , led ( again ) by bank and brokerage stocks .
What kind of financial - system bomb ?
That ’s the problem :
The fear is very generic , not specific .
Notably , these jitters intensified last week , even before a weekend article in Barron ’s that effectively dug the grave for the common stocks of mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Because their shares crashed on the article , Fannie and Freddie do n’t seem to fill the bill as looming market surprises , although they ’re adding to the heightened state of concern .

Michael Darda , economist at MKM Partners in Greenwich , Conn. , notes that nervous investors have recently demanded higher yields to buy high - quality mortgage - backed bonds and corporate bonds , widening the “ spreads ” between those yields and Treasury bond yields .
“ When the spreads widen out , there are stresses brewing ” in the system , Darda says .
“ Previous surges have preceded bank failures or other collapses . ”
As with the demise of Bear Stearns in March , for example .
Fears of a mega - failure were amplified Tuesday after Kenneth Rogoff , former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , predicted in a speech in Singapore that a huge U.S. bank was certain to collapse in the near future -- although , of course , he was n’t naming names .
“ The worst is yet to come , ” he said , according to the BBC .
“ We ’re not just going to see midsized banks go under in the next few months .
We ’re going to see a whopper , we ’re going to see a big one , one of the big investment banks or big banks . ”
Given that kind of good cheer , it ’s a wonder the credit markets are functioning at all .

Yet Freddie Mac on Tuesday sold $ 3 billion in five - year notes , and although the annualized yield of 4.17 % was 1.13 points over five - year Treasury note yields -- the widest spread in at least 10 years , according to Bloomberg -- there was enough demand to get the deal done .
The markets ’ bad case of nerves may partly stem from memories of what happened a year ago .
Just as much of Wall Street was packing up for summer vacation last August , the first major explosions occurred in what was to become the credit crunch .
That should remind us of something :
In financial markets , it often works out that you get a crisis when nobody ’s expecting one -- not when everybody ’s looking for it .

GUANTÁNAMO BAY , Cuba 
A panel of six military officers convicted a former driver for Osama bin Laden of one war crime Wednesday but acquitted him of another , completing the first military commission trial here and the first conducted by the United States since the end of World War II .
In a stinging setback for the military prosecutors , the commission acquitted the former driver , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , of a conspiracy charge , arguably the more serious of two charges he faced .
Mr. Hamdan ’s conviction came on a separate charge of providing material support for terrorism .
The split verdict gave both sides in the long debate over the procedures here grounds for their competing claims .
Supporters said that the system ’s fairness was illustrated by the careful verdict while critics said the trial , which featured secret evidence and closed proceedings , demonstrated the injustice of the Bush administration ’s military commission system .
Mr. Hamdan , who has said he is about 40 , faces a possible life term .
The sentence is to be set in a separate proceeding before the same panel that is to begin this afternoon .
As the verdict was read , Mr. Hamdan , who has been in custody since he was detained in Afghanistan in November of 2001 , stood passively at the defense table in a white headscarf , his head bent slightly down .
Cheating on a Sick Spouse Illness and its fallout open the door to adultery , experts say .
Aug. 12 , 2008  -- John McCain .
Then Newt Gingrich .
And now John Edwards .
Edwards ' betrayal of his wife at her most vulnerable moment -- as a cancer patient -- is more common than conventional wisdom suggests , according to infidelity experts .
A mistress of former House Speaker Gingrich told Vanity Fair they had their tryst as his first wife recovered from uterine cancer surgery in the 1980s .
While McCain was married to his first wife , who was disabled from a car accident , he was " aggressively courting a 25 - year - old woman who was as beautiful as she was rich , " according to a New York Times colunmist 's account of the 1970s incident that predated McCain 's election to the Senate .
Both McCain and Gingrich have admitted to the affairs .
" It 's not that uncommon for the spouse of a seriously ill person to commit adultery , " said Anthony DeLorenzo , who , with his wife , founded infidelity.com .
" The healthy spouse often feels guilty , lonely and helpless about the illness , and that combination can make a spouse more vulnerable to having an affair . "
Sickness frequently interferes with or eliminates sex from a relationship , making a healthy spouse more vulnerable to advances or situations that lead to sex outside of marriage , the New Jersey private detective told ABCNews.com .
Blogs this week have been less sympathetic , calling Edwards and his extramarital sex with videographer Rielle Hunter " very low " and " depraved . "
" Edwards claimed , while engaging in the affair , that Elizabeth was in remission , " read one post on the site , the World According to Matt .
" In short he is a cad . "
Relationship experts like DeLorenzo , who counsels wronged spouses on his Web site , say about 60 percent of men and 40 percent of women stray during the course of a marriage .
" I know Edwards spoke of his narcissism as a factor , but far more than that had to be going on , " said DeLorenzo , who has handled many cases of cheating .
And it 's not just the men who are going astray .
One middle - aged man who was confined to a hospice - like setting suspected his wife was having an affair when he got no answer to his telephone calls to her on Friday and Saturday nights , DeLorenzo said .
" His wife took care of him three or four times a week , but she was in her 50s and was still a young person , " DeLorenzo said .
After receiving the report confirming the affair , the man eventually accepted his wife 's dalliances .
But according to Thomas Nagy , who is on the clinical faculty at Stanford School of Medicine and works with couples dealing with cancer , that and other chronic diseases can have an especially devastating effect on a marriage .
Depression , anxiety and medications can take a toll on the spouse who is the patient .
" It hugely impacts on moods and emotional intimacy -- everything , " Nagy said .
" Mental health treatment is extremely important .
Most are not in spousal support or marriage counseling . "
He advocates for mandatory marital counseling whenever a partner faces a serious illness .
In Cancer , Illness ' Trumps Everything '
" The mental health needs of a marriage are n't paid attention to because the medical illness trumps everything , " Nagy said .
The Edwards couple -- at the center of political power -- got the " one - two punch , " according to Nagy .
" His wife is having cancer in this really high - profile fast life . "
But women who have been wronged have less sympathy for the senator and more for his wife .
" My heart went out to her and for the embarrassment she is suffering , " said one New Jersey woman , whose husband has been having an illicit affair for the past seven years , but wo n't admit to it .
" I just wish I had an answer . "
The 53 - year - old , who works in marketing , said her husband of 33 years recently had quadruple bypass surgery after a clandestine weekend with the other woman .
As his wife , she stood by his side at the hospital .
" I was miserable , " said the woman , who did n't want to be identified .
" He was at death 's door .
I am no angel , but I did n't want to make the situation worse or add to the stress .
I was trying to make things easier for him . "
In her time of need -- during eye surgery and later for a cancer test -- he was n't there .
" He could n't take the time off from work , " she said .
" He just has excuses : That 's his nature .
" I was there every day for him and sat there thinking he would go through a big metamorphosis and turn things around , " she said .
" I do n't know why I am still here .
I told the kids , ' He 's in your hands now . ' "
Michigan therapist Bob Huizenga anonymously coaches clients on his Web site and in his book of the same name , " Break Free From the Affair . "
He said women who have been wronged have a wide range of responses .
" Some cave in and feel victimized and others say , ' Screw it , ' and fight and win , " he told ABCNews.com .
" It 's utterly devastating . "
One woman sought help from Huizenga when her husband turned to a girlfriend after her breast cancer metastasized .
" Not only are you losing your body parts and vitality , but also losing what you perceive to be your dreams , your family and your social status , " he said .
" It 's worse than someone dying . "
Many couples do n't survive the betrayal , but power couples like the Edwardses often save their public face and work things out .
' High - Ups ' Struggle With Infidelity
Some of Huizenga 's recent online patients have been " high up " in Washington politics , he said .
" Spouses are having affairs and have nowhere to go , " he said .
" It 's a safe relationship talking to me anonymously .
They wonder how to deal with the mistress or with the cheating spouse . "
Like Edwards , they worry about their reputations and being exposed , according to Huizenga .
And when a woman has cancer , she has to consider the financial repercussions of leaving the spouse -- and his insurance -- behind .
And , as in the Edwards ' case , there are sometimes young children to consider .
" It 's very difficult for someone like [ Elizabeth Edwards ] to leave in this situation , " he said .
" She has a high investment in maintaining that relationship .
She may submerge a great deal .
Political wives do .
They have an investment in the political arena as well . "
But , he said , in all cases it 's hard to take the high road in infidelity cases .
" I am not sure what the word forgiveness means , but they never forget , " he said .
" It 's always there . "

While I do n’t believe Hillary Clinton is a lamia ; I can understand the label .
Agrestic as it may be , many would say a case could be made .
However , I believe her strong support for the condign jail sentence of Edward Mann shows her to be a smart woman .
Mann was convicted last year of defenestration of his law partner from a 5 story building .
Luckily for Mr. Mann his partner was not badly injured ( he landed on a stegophilist , who broke his fall ) .
Ms. Clinton made the argument that even if the man was not hurt , punishment was still necessary because of the seriousness of the crime .
Outside My Brain
http://outsidemybrain.com
A stegophilist , whose head is glabrous , once told me about a lamia who , at the risk of sounding agrestic , had an inanition during any syzygy .
While eating a gallinaceous meal , this deipnosophist relayed the story of a aleatory act of defenestration , in which the one who went through the window used a explicative ridden tmesis ( which was condign ) due to the abruptness of being agroof .

The glabrous man walked with a gallinaceous gait .
He could never be mistaken for a stegophilist , a pretender of inanition .
He sat and Zena , a deipnosophist and as beautiful as a lamia ignored him with a condign sigh and spoke about eclipse and syzygy , which would occur that night .
He was agrestic and allowed to agroof , without the help of other diners .
His aleatory remarks were like defenestration and Zena used tmesis expressing dismay .

The stegophilists who were recently incarcerated for attempting to climb the exoskeletons of silicon - covered edifices , should have contemplated the internal hubris that motivated their sense of extreme egocentric need for exhibitionism .

Notto be agrestic , but if I agroof here , it was aleatory .
If you perform defrenestration on me it ’s condign .
You are a deipnosophist althoug not gallinaceous or glabrous .
You do n’t suffer inanition , nor are you a lamia ; you may be a stegophilist when syzygy is in the heavens , so the tmesis is :
This post is fan - freakin’ - tastic , and I really DIGG .

OK , this is all fun and stuff – but how the heck do you pronouce these things ?
Here is my spin :
Rob , a deipnosophist , was having a condign dinner atop a high - rise .
The waitress was a lamia , but full of inanition .
An agrestic fellow complained about the gallinaceous and glabrous eggs .
Rob performed an act of defenestration with the jerk but in an aleatory move , he somehow followed and they struck a stegophilist on the way down .
In a syzygy like formation they explicated in a tmesis manner before they were all agroof .
Nvidia Adding PhysX Processing to Existing GPUs Next Week , Developers Line Up with Support
Nvidia GeForce 8 , GeForce 9 , and GeForce GTX 200 - series cards will support the new physics acceleration initially .
PhysX began as Ageia Technologies ' attempt at a dedicated hardware physics processor .
The idea of an expensive physics processing card never took off , and Nvidia purchased Aegia in February of this year , announcing that it would directly incorporate Aegia 's technology into its line of cards .
Game support for PhysX includes released titles such as Epic 's Unreal Tournament 3 .
Users can download the free PhysX Mod map pack , a collection of three UT3 maps that show off special effects such as twirling tornadoes and particle - based hail .
Nvidia claims that PhysX support is also being added to upcoming projects like EA DICE 's Mirror 's Edge , Creative Assembly 's Empire : Total War , and Gearbox 's Aliens : Colonial Marines and Borderlands .
Early benchmarks predictably indicate that turning on the flashy PhysX effects will cost users several frames of performance .
For a look at a PhysX - enabled UT3 map , check out the video below .

JULY 31 -- A New York City man was charged today with posting YouTube videos in which he claimed to have poisoned thousands of bottles of Gerber baby food in a bid to kill black babies .
According to federal investigators , Anton Dunn -- using the alias " Trashman " and wearing a ski mask in his clips -- created three videos claiming that the baby food had been tainted with cyanide .
In one video , according a federal criminal complaint unsealed today , Dunn , filming himself from inside a shower stall , claims that his " plan is in motion " and that four babies had already died .
Dunn , 42 , claimed that he would not be caught , despite " attempts to 'rat him out , ' " adding that he had the police and FBI on his " payroll . "
A copy of the two - count U.S. District Court felony complaint filed against Dunn can be found here .
In April , federal investigators were alerted to Dunn 's first video by a Gerber representative , and Food and Drug Administration investigators subsequently identified two other threatening videos .
Dunn 's videos received wide attention last week when the popular web site MediaTakeOut.com posted one of the 10 - minute clips ( the video first appeared on worldstarhiphop.com ) .
Agents tracked Dunn via a web site registered in his name .
The name of that site , chroniccast.org , streamed across the bottom of some " Trashman " videos .
Dunn has been arrested three times in the past ten months on charges unrelated to his moviemaking , according to the complaint .
The Harlem resident , who has previously posted videos in which he claimed to have infected numerous female sex partners with the HIV virus , operates a low - budget porn web site and , on his MySpace page , describes himself as an " adult website owner looking to network with people in the porn and music world . " ( 6 pages )
After nearly 20 years of working as a television writer , I made a radical life decision : to teach English at an L.A. public high school .
I felt it was time for me to make a difference , to share my passion for language and literature with the next generation .
Sure , I knew that the pay would be abysmal and that the teaching conditions in gang - infested , impoverished communities might be tough .
But I really wanted to try , so I braced myself to keep going even if there were times of struggle , of heartbreak , of feeling inadequate and humiliated , even if there were times when I wanted to weep from frustration , even if I sweated through dark nights of the soul overwhelmed by the futility of it all .
And indeed , I have experienced all that .
But what ’s crazy is that I have n’t even set foot in a classroom yet .
By state law , I cannot teach in a California public school without a credential from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing .
On the face of it , this requirement makes sense .
Schools ca n’t go around hiring any slob who professes a love of children and a burning desire to make $ 39,788 a year ( the LAUSD starting pay scale for interns ) .
But just applying to a teaching - credential program has taken me months of pointless , numbing , bewildering toil .
I ’ve submitted stacks of applications , online and on paper , along with college transcripts and letters of recommendation .
I ’ve written a five - page letter of “ self - reflection , ” completed 45 hours of early field experience , endured a TB test and had my fingerprints taken to prove that I ’m not a convicted felon .
And that was just to start the actual work : proving I am “ highly qualified . ”
Advertisement
As mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act and interpreted by the Legislature , all teachers in public schools must be deemed “ highly qualified . ”
Again , fair enough .
One of the notorious disgraces of our public school system is the way the best teachers are funneled into schools serving high - income students , while children from low - income families are often stuck with far less - qualified teachers .
I have a bachelor of arts degree in English from Bryn Mawr and have spent my entire adult life as a working writer -- and all I want is to sign up to take the education classes I need before I walk into a classroom .
Wo n’t my degree and my life ’s work qualify me at least to sign up for those classes ?
Not even close .
First , I had to take the CBEST , a four - hour exam on reading , writing and math .
After taking the CBEST , I still had not proved “ subject matter competence . ”
For that , I would have to fill the apparent gaps in my transcript with five courses in linguistics , expository writing , adolescent literature and American literature -- or pass something called the CSET , an Orwellian , five - hour sequence of four exams with some questions so obscure I would defy most PhDs to answer them .
What is a modal verb ?
What ’s an embedded appositional phrase ?
A grapheme ?
Can you pick the meaning of a poem from a list of answers a , b , c and d , none of which in any way capture the ineffable beauty of the poem itself ?
By studying for weeks , I managed to pass the CSET .
And by a miracle , I found a job teaching at a charter school in South L.A. as an emergency hire , or intern , through a program that gives a temporary credential to teachers willing to work in schools that would otherwise be hard to staff , while taking education classes at night .
Advertisement
To enroll in the intern program , I had to fill out more applications and then complete 40 hours of pre-service training in teaching English language learners , a course that in theory would have been very useful but in fact only entailed reading a stack of paperwork and writing essays I suspected would be stuck in my file unread .
I also had to summarize what I ’d learned in a page of sentences that began with “ I used to think , ” and ended with “ but now I know ... . ”
Whatever the actual purpose of this exercise , writing about my former state of ignorance felt deeply sinister , like some kind of forced confession by a totalitarian state .
And I had to pass an 80 - question , unbelievably arcane and ambiguously worded test on the U.S. Constitution .
I have wracked my highly qualified brain , and I cannot imagine any possible rationale for this test .
Because if I had n’t memorized the Bill of Rights I might march into the classroom and try my students twice for the same crime ?
Or force them to quarter soldiers in their homes ?
What is being tested here ?
My patriotism ?
My sanity ?
My level of desperation ?
What ’s next ... eating centipedes ?
Remember :
This is not to finish my teacher education .
This is to be allowed to enroll in it .
Meanwhile , a new study shows that 33 % of California high school students drop out before graduating ; Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has speculated that in particularly underserved Los Angeles communities , the dropout rate might be as high as 70 % .

I understand the idea of “ standards - based ” education .
I embrace the need to hold teachers in low - income schools to the same standards as teachers who work with more privileged children .
But the standards to which I ’m being held here are not high standards ; they are just a high pile of standards , a mountain of detritus generated by various acts of legislation whenever new statistics come out showing that California schools are failing , that teachers are fleeing the state , that high school students can barely read .
In a system so broken , a system that already deters most applicants with its near - poverty - level wages and difficult working conditions , why are they trying so hard to weed out anyone who , in spite of everything , still wants to come in and change a child ’s life ?
She was told she had a criminal record stretching back 18 years , including three convictions for assaulting police officers , and the only way to clear her name was to get her fingerprints checked against every unsolved crime in the country .

data / generate
A new release of the Hoogle command line is out , including bug fixes and additional features .
Upgrading is recommended .
Two interesting features of Hoogle 4 are working with mulitple function databases ( from multiple packages ) , and running your own web server .
Both these features are n't fully developed yet , and may change in their use , but can be used with care .
This post covers how to generate your own databases , and how the web version databases are generated .
Tomorrow I 'm going to post on how to run your own Hoogle web server , but you 'll need to generate your databases first !
I 'm going to walk through all the steps to create a database from the filepath library , as an example A
Hoogle database is a set of searchable things , including text and type searching , and has a " .hoo " extension .
A database may include the definitions from one package , or from multiple packages .
Typically the Hoogle databases installed would include one database for each package ( i.e. base.hoo , filepath.hoo ) , a default database ( default.hoo ) comprising of all the standard search items , and any number of custom databases ( all.hoo ) which comprise of different combinations of the other databases .
When using Hoogle , addingwill include the given database in the search list , andwill exclude the given package from the search .
By default , Hoogle will use default .hoo , but if anycommands are given then those databases will be used instead .
Hoogle looks for databases in the current directory , in the data directory specified by Cabal , and in anydirectories passed at the command line .
A
Textbase is a textual representation of a function database .
To generate a textbase you need to install the darcs version of Haddock , then useon your package .
For filepath , this will create the file , which is a textbase .
To convert a textbase to a database use the commandin the appropriate folder .
If a package depends on any other packages , then addingwill allow Hoogle to use the dependencies to generate a more accurate database .
In the case of filepath , which depends on base , we use .
This command requires base .hoo to be present .
Adding the dependencies is not strictly necessary , but will allow Hoogle to generate a more accurate database .
For example , the base package defines , without theflag this type synonym would not be known to Hoogle .
We now have filepath .hoo , which can be used as a search database .
To generate a database comprising of both filepath and base , type .
By combining databases you allow easy access to common groups of packages , and searching all these packages at once becomes faster than listing each database separately .
The web version uses the Hackage tarballs to generate documentation for most of its databases , but also has three custom databases :
All the code for generating the web version databases is found inin the Hoogle darcs repo at http://code.haskell.org/hoogle
There are two database related tasks that still need to be done : Cabal integration and indexing all of Hackage .
Bug 80 : In the future I would like Hoogle databases to be generated by Cabal automatically on installing a package .
Unfortunately , I do n't have the time to implement such a feature currently , and even if I did implement it , I 'm unlikely to ever use it .
If anyone wants to work on this , please get in contact .
This is mainly a project working with Cabal .
Bug 79 : The other work is to index all the packages on Hackage .
The problem here is generating the textbases , once they have been created the rest is fairly simple .
However , to run Haddock 2 over a package requires that the package builds , and that all the dependencies are present .
Unfortunatley my machine is not powerful enough to cope with the number of packages on Hackage .
Hopefully at some point the machinery that builds Haddock documentation for Hackage will also generate textbases , however in the mean time if someone wants to take on the task of generating textbases for Hackage , please get in contact .
I 'm not working on Hoogle full - time anymore , so am using my bug tracker to keep track of outstanding issues .
In order to interact more effectively with my bug tracker , you might want to read this guide .
It describes how to vote for bugs etc .
Thousands of people have moved from their homes in Bakassi Nigeria has handed over the potentially oil - rich Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon , bringing an end to a long - standing dispute over the territory .
The handover ceremony was moved from the peninsula 's main town to Calabar in Nigeria amid security concerns .
Over the past year about 50 people have been killed in clashes .
The majority of the local population considers itself Nigerian , but an international court ruled in favour of Cameroon in 2002 .
The BBC's Abdullahi Kaura in Calabar says there are unconfirmed reports that militants have attacked a boat travelling to Abana , the main town on the Bakassi peninsula .
Unresolved pain at Bakassi handover
In pictures
Nigerian security sources said between three and seven people were killed when militants ambushed the boat as it made its way from Cameroon .
Correspondents say security had been beefed up ahead of the ceremony .
On the Cameroonian side , there have been celebrations as people moved back into the peninsula .
In recent years , at least 100,000 people have moved from the peninsula to Nigeria , local leaders say .
The International Court of Justice ruling was based on an early 20th century colonial agreement between Britain and Germany .
Nigeria challenged the ruling , but finally agreed to relinquish the territory two years ago .
" The gains made in adhering to the rule of law may outweigh the painful losses of ancestral homes , " said the head of the Nigerian delegation at the ceremony , Attorney General Mike Aondoakaa .
Part of the territory was handed over to Cameroon two years ago .
Revellers
A spokesman for Nigerian President Umaru Yar 'Adua said the process was " painful ... for everyone including the president " , but added that Nigeria had made " a commitment to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it " .
Bakassi plan stirs tensions Cameroon said the final handover would mark " the end of a crisis " .
On the beaches of the northern part of the island there were parties and celebrations as Cameroonians prepared to go into the last section to be turned over to them .
" We are going straight to the place , and we 're going to be happy , " one reveller told the BBC's Randy Joe Sa'ah in Bakassi .
But in Nigeria there is still bitterness about the deal .
" The government has abandoned its duties , " said Kayode Fasitere , the lawyer acting for some displaced from Bakassi who sought to have the handover delayed .
The transfer of Bakassi had been described by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon as " a model for negotiated settlements of border disputes " .
A group of Bakassi leaders have been seeking compensation from the Nigerian government .
About 90 % of the area 's population , estimated at up to 300,000 , is made up of Nigerian fishermen .
About 30,000 of the residents have moved out to an area in Cross Rivers State set aside for them , but it has no access to the sea , campaigners say .
Bakassi has a rich fishing culture and people say the handover has destroyed their way of life .
The Bakassi peninsula juts out into the Gulf of Guinea close to the Niger Delta .
Its offshore waters are thought to contain substantial oil fields - untapped because of the border dispute - which Nigeria and Cameroon will now work together to explore .

What are these ?
( Natural News ) Physicists at Arizona State University say they have developed a method to calculate the exact frequency that it would take to shake a virus to death , according to an article published in the journalResearchers have discovered that when viruses are bombarded with laser pulses of the right frequency , they shake apart .
This arises from an inherent characteristic of all objects called a " resonant frequency , " which is the frequency at which an object naturally vibrates .
Resonant frequencies are the key to stringed instruments , in which a string of a certain material , thickness and length has a resonant frequency that produces a specific musical note .
But resonant frequencies can also cause objects to shake so uncontrollably that their stability is undermined , as when a wind shook the Tacoma Narrows Bridge at its resonant frequency in 1940 , causing it to collapse .
Because the shell of a single virus can contain millions of atoms , it is difficult to calculate a given virus ' resonant frequency except by trial and error .
But in the current study , researchers successfully calculated the resonant frequency of a simple satellite tobacco necrosis virus .
The next step for the researchers is to determine if the same technique will work for other , more complex viruses .
Although practical applications are probably a long way off , vibrational antiviral treatments have a number of benefits over chemical approaches .
First of all , while many antiviral drugs are very harsh on the body and have dangerous or debilitating side effects , the frequencies used to disrupt the viruses should have no effect on human or even bacterial cells , which are much larger and consequently have significantly lower resonant frequencies .
In addition , because a resonant frequency is an inherent characteristic of a virus ' makeup , researchers say it is unlikely that resistance to it could develop .
Among the obstacles toward creating vibrational antiviral therapy is the fact that lasers have trouble penetrating the skin .
Researchers have suggested that ultrasound could be used instead , or perhaps a dialysis - type machine that cycles of blood out of the body , irradiates it , then cycles it back in .
Introduction and Specifications
Asus certainly made a splash this year with their line of ultra- light , ultra - affordable Eee PC notebooks and they 've been fleshing out the product line ever since with a wealth of new offerings , as the company continues to milk the product 's successful brand name recognition for all it's worth .
Since their initial release we 've seen a number of different notebook - based Eee PC products come to market , including machines pre-loaded with either Windows XP or Linux operating systems .
In addition , Asus has even brought out larger models , with the 10 " display and near full size keyboard of the Eee PC 1000 series of notebooks , not to mention larger storage options and systems based on the new Intel Atom processor .
And the end - user and modder community following that the Eee PC product line has garnered is something straight out of a business management text book case study .
How a company was able to create such a buzz and following behind a product line is something to observe and a success story that competitors will envy for product launches to come .
For starters , it 's obviously safe to say that Asus put plenty of engineering resources behind their Eee PC project and you almost have to wonder , are they done yet ?
Not quite .
In the realm of small form - factor , low cost computing , there 's another market niche ' that , believe it or not , the Eee product line has yet to bring out an offering for -- the low cost desktop .
Today marks the introduction of the $ 349 Asus Eee Box but we 've had a unit in house for the better part of a month now .
Just what does $ 349 buy you in terms of capabilities and features , in an absolutely tiny footprint ?
You 're about to find out .

NEW YORK - A New York City doorman who kept his day job at an exclusive Park Avenue apartment building after winning a $ 5 million lottery has been shown the door .
Kate Ferranti , a spokesman for the union representing apartment building workers , said Richie Randazzo notified the union 's grievance center on Tuesday that he had been fired .
The building management company , Brown Harris Stevens , did not immediately return a call for comment .
Randozzo's father said Wednesday that the letter did not specify the reason for Randozza 's discharge .
He declined to give his name and said his son was not home .
Randazzo made $ 40,000 a year as a doorman .
He began taking in another $ 65,000 every three months after hitting the jackpot on May 2 .
According to published reports , his attendance record was spotty after he won the lottery .
The Brooklyn resident said when he won that he had no immediate plans to change his life , but allowed that he might indulge in a motorboat and a luxury auto .
Ferranti said the discharge will be investigated by Local 32 BJ of the Service Employees International Union as a routine matter .

Global Economy at " Point of Maximum Danger " ?
VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( AP )  A U.S. Army deserter who fled to Canada three years ago was deported Tuesday to America , marking the first time a resister to the U.S war effort in Iraq has been removed by Canadian authorities .
Paula Shore , spokeswoman for the Canada Border Services Agency , confirmed that Robin Long , 25 , was deported , but she could not discuss specifics of the case , including Long 's destination .
Long fled to Canada in 2005 to avoid serving in Iraq .
He sought refuge in Canada on the grounds that the U.S. Army wanted him to participate in what he called an " illegal war of aggression in Iraq . "
Justice Anne Mactavish of the Federal Court of Canada ruled Monday that Long could n't provide clear evidence he would suffer irreparable harm if he was returned to the United States .
In her ruling , Mactavish said that although the percentage of American military deserters prosecuted for desertion has increased since 2002 , the vast majority have not been prosecuted or faced jail time .
Last week , the Federal Court blocked the deportation of National Guard Sgt. Corey Glass , 25 , while it decides whether to hear his case .
Glass refused redeployment to Iraq .
Long and Glass were among some 200 American deserters believed to have come to Canada trying to avoid service in Iraq .
So far , Canadian immigration officials and the courts have rejected efforts to grant them refugee status .
During the Vietnam War , up to 90,000 Americans successfully won refuge in Canada , most of them to avoid the military draft .
The majority went home after the United States granted amnesty in the late 1970s .

To help you through the fairly overwhelming archives , I ’ve compiled a beginner ’s guide .
Kind of a Quick Start guide .
First , a note : Please do n’t try to go through this all at once .
There are days and days worth of reading here .
I ’ve just organized that so that you can go to the stuff you want to learn about first .
Take it in small chunks .
Where do you start when you have a thousand posts to read through ?
You start with the best , or at least the most popular .
So here they are :
The All - Time Most Popular Posts on Zen Habits
Or you can go through a few compiled guides I ’ve hand picked for some of the more popular categories :
By now , you might want to know more about Leo , the guy who writes this blog … well , here ’s more than you ever wanted to know :
About this series
This is the fourth in a series of occasional stories looking at how skyrocketing oil prices are transforming lives in Southern California and around the world .
--
Its gray and black walls stretching to infinity , Latin America ’s largest coal mine resembles a miniature Grand Canyon .
Advertisement
The big difference is that the timeless hand of nature has not carved out El Cerrejon mine .
Booming global demand has .
A fleet of electric shovels runs 24 hours a day scooping up 50 tons of coal at a swipe .
The rock is loaded onto 100 - car trains that roll nine times a day to a private Caribbean port , where it is placed on cargo ships that deliver it to power plants in Chile , the Netherlands , Japan , the United States ’ Eastern Seaboard and elsewhere .
As the global price of oil and natural gas soars , some customers are taking a new look at other fuels -- including coal .
And countries such as China and India , whose demand is contributing to the price of petroleum , need even more energy .
Besides petroleum products , they are buying vast amounts of coal , as well .
The worldwide demand for oil has its own set of environmental consequences -- drilling in pristine areas where it previously was uneconomical and continued emission of greenhouse gases .
But environmentalists warn that renewed reliance on coal takes the threat to another level .

“ Growing coal use threatens nothing less than the end of civilization as we know it , ” said Henry Henderson , the Chicago - based Midwest director of the Natural Resources Defense Council .
Low in acid-rain - causing sulfur and cheap to produce , Colombia ’s coal has always been coveted .
These days , El Cerrejon and half a dozen other major mines in the region are booming .
Energy & Mines Minister Hernan Martinez says Colombia ’s shipments will rise to 80 million tons this year , 10 % more than last year and double the amount just five years ago .
The value of Colombia ’s coal exports in 2008 will surpass $ 5 billion , up 40 % from last year and 10 times what it was six years ago , a reflection of the increased price .
Coal has more than doubled in price to $ 100 a ton in a year .
China added more coal - burning power plants in 2007 than Britain has built in its history , said Gerard McCloskey , a coal market specialist with Cambridge Energy Research Associates in London .
A few years ago , China was exporting the equivalent of Colombia ’s current annual exports .
But by next year , the U.S. Department of Energy forecasts , it will become a net importer .
Advertisement
Similarly , Russia and Poland are keeping much of the coal they once exported .
Prices have also been driven up by flooded mines in Australia and a hike in global shipping rates .
Still , generating energy from coal costs a third as much as from natural gas in Japan , and half to two - thirds as much in Britain , McCloskey said .
According to John Dean , coal energy consultant with Global Insight , a research firm in Frederick , Md. , those favorable economics have persuaded several U.S. utilities to build new or expand coal - fired power plants .
Probably the largest project is Duke Energy ’s two coal - fired generation plants in Cliffside , N.C. , which by 2012 will produce 1,600 megawatts of energy -- more than the output of the San Onofre nuclear power plant near San Clemente .
Advertisement
By 2030 , about 54 % of all U.S. electric power will be coal - fired , up from the current 48 % , according to the National Mining Assn. , a Washington - based trade group .
Environmentalists and consumer advocates warn of the consequences .
Customers are beginning to see higher electric bills .
Much more pain is on the way , according to U.S. Department of Energy economist Michael Mellish .
“ Coal prices have taken off with a vengeance and electricity prices will spike up if they stick , ” Mellish said .
Of longer - term concern are the effects on climate change .
Coal - fired power generation and manufacturing is the leading source of carbon dioxide and methane emissions , which scientists agree are the leading contributors to the “ greenhouse effect ” and global warming .
Two environmental advocacy groups , Greenpeace and Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , have called for a moratorium on new coal - fired plants until a feasible means of mitigating carbon dioxide emissions is in place .

One such method , called “ carbon capture and sequestering , ” which recycles carbon dioxide from smokestacks for use or storage underground , has raised hopes .
But the National Mining Assn. says its practical application is 12 to 15 years away .
“ We recognize coal is a reality to which you ca n’t simply say no , ” said the NRDC ’S Henderson .
“ But you have the issue of getting coal right , or of many , many other things going wrong . ”
Kate Smolski , legislative coordinator with Greenpeace in Washington , said that although all fossil fuels contribute to global warming , coal is the “ dirtiest , emitting double the carbon dioxide per energy unit produced , compared with natural gas . ”
A mid-sized coal mine that produces 500 megawatts of energy , the amount consumed by 500,000 families , will churn out as much carbon dioxide a year as half a million cars , according to the NRDC .

Located in sparsely populated northern Colombia , the El Cerrejon mine , rail line and port were built in the late 1970s by Exxon according to U.S. standards .
El Cerrejon has generally been credited with being environmentally kind , as coal mines go .
( ExxonMobil sold the mine in 2002 to a partnership of Australia ’s BHP Billiton and two London - based firms , Anglo American and Xstrata . )
The owners say they are making an effort to reclaim the areas already stripped by planting trees and pasture , predicting that they will be habitable decades from now when the coal is gone .
But other areas of Colombia , particularly the historic port city of Santa Marta and its surrounding beach areas , are suffering spills and barge sinkings , which have damaged fishing and tourism along the country ’s Caribbean coast .
The government is requiring all mines to use direct loading systems like El Cerrejon ’s by 2010 , but some in the industry say the goal is unrealistic .
For now , Colombia is reaping a windfall .
Known for legal exports such as coffee , bananas and oil as well as illegal tonnage of cocaine , it has quietly become a world player in coal , ranking fourth among exporters , behind Indonesia , Australia and Russia .

El Cerrejon ’s owners are considering investing $ 600 million in a second docking facility at Puerto Bolivar and a major expansion of its railroad line .
The Colombian government is sharing the wealth .
El Cerrejon will pay royalties totaling $ 380 million to the government this year .
“ The industry invested billions of dollars in an area of Colombia where there was once nothing , and it ’s paid off , ” Martinez said .

Since it came about in the 1930s as the Army 's rocket research lab , the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been a part of just about every major unmanned U.S. space mission to date .
JPL also has a somewhat surprising history of running major missions out of modular trailers scattered around their Pasadena HQ , which are packed with all of the stuff you need to , oh , I do n't know , monitor a spacecraft on its way to Mars .
Photographer Richard Harrington stumbled upon one of these trailers , abandoned on a dusty lot somewhere between L.A. and Las Vegas , and as you would expect , it 's a retro space - tech dream inside .

David Wratt
A lead New Zealand scientist believes renewable energy production can minimise risks associated with climate change , outlining his views yesterday during an Environment Court appeal hearing for the largest wind farm development in the Southern Hemisphere .
National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research ( Niwa ) Wellington climate change general manager David Wratt told the hearing for Meridian Energy 's proposed Project Hayes development the wind farm could serve as mitigation for potentially dangerous climate change effects in New Zealand .
" Renewable power , including wind power , is one of the key mitigation technologies and practices currently commercially available for the energy sector .
New renewable energy power stations are an essential part of New Zealand 's emission management response , " Dr Wratt 's written evidence stated .
New Zealand would get warmer and experience more turbulent weather in the 21st century because of climate change if greenhouse gas emissions were not reduced , he said .
" Floods , landslides , droughts and storm surges are very likely to become more frequent and intense , while snow and frost is very likely to become less frequent .
" A reduction of 50 % to 85 % would be required in global carbon dioxide emissions in 2050 , compared with 2000 , in order to maintain an eventual long - term global equilibrium temperature . "
Dr Wratt , who is a bureau member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , said wind speed at 10 m above ground level was likely to increase by between 2 % and 6 % across Central Otago during winter .
He said because of slightly warmer temperatures in the future there would also be less snow and ice to freeze turbines , which rendered them useless for energy production until thawed .
" I do n't want to overstate the positive effects [ of changes in climate ] on the wind farm , but there will be some benefits in the form of more wind and less ice , " he said .
One thing I am hearing right now is that Sarah Palin is a fiscal conservative .
The Club for Growth released a statement on a potential Palin VP candidacy that praises her stance on earmarks and support for opening ANWR .
Fighting earmarks and opening ANWR are important , but they are only half the battle .
When the Alaska Creamery Board decided to close the state - owned Matanuska Maid Dairy , she objected .
She could n’t fire Creamery Board members , so she fired members of the Alaska Agriculture Board who in turn replaced Creamery Board members .
The Matanuska Maid Dairy remained open , jacked up milk prices and eventually closed anyway after substantial losses .
Only then did Palin believe that it should be sold to a private company .
Unfortunately , the state received no bids for the diary and taxpayers were stuck with a loss .
John McCain has been critical of Barack Obama ’s plan for a windfall profits tax on oil companies , correctly citing that it would hurt potential oil exploration in the United States and increase dependence on foreign oil .
Criticism should be point toward Sarah Palin as well .
Palin signed a windfall profits tax into law last year that has taken $ 10 billion from oil companies .
Part of the plan , as conservative blog Hot Air noted earlier this month , is very similar to a plan pushed by Barack Obama :
Palin ’s plan looks similar in concept to Barack Obama ’s plan .
The state gave Alaskans $ 1200 checks from oil revenues as a one - time bonus to pay for increased fuel prices , a move Palin pushed .
That echoes the Obama plan to send one - time rebates to taxpayers , funded by similar levies on oil companies .
However , the results in Alaska should warn the rest of the country about pursuing this policy .
Already oil companies have stopped drilling on state lands , thanks to the tax burden Alaska imposes .
It should be cheaper to drill and extract from these areas , but the oil companies have decided to focus their investment instead on the Gulf , where the costs and risks would normally be higher .
In Alaska , the government takes 75 % of the price on a barrel of oil at current prices , which gives them no incentive to work there .
Then there is ethics .
She has made a name for herself as a reformer .
Palin demanded answers from and openly criticized Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens when he was indicted .
She was right to do so .
As far as I ’m concerned , Stevens is a crook for more things that what he was indicted for .
It turns out that she may have ethics issues of her own .
Walt Monegan , former Alaska Department of Public Safety Commissioner , claims that he was pressured by Palin and individuals close to her pressured him to fire State Trooper Mike Wooten , who happens to be Palin ’s former brother - in - law .
Monegan was eventually fired by Palin :
Monegan said phone calls and questions from the Palin administration and the governor ’s husband , Todd Palin , about trooper Mike Wooten started shortly after Monegan was hired and continued up to one or two months ago .
The governor herself also had a brief conversation with him about Wooten in February , Monegan said .
The new assertions from Monegan , who has been mostly silent on his abrupt firing July 11 , conflict with what the Republican governor said earlier in the week .
She said she never put pressure on the commissioner to fire her sister ’s ex-husband and no one from her office had complained about Wooten .
She has also said replacing Monegan with Kenai Police Chief Chuck Kopp had nothing to do with Wooten .
She has offered little explanation for the dismissal .
[…]
Monegan said he still is n’t sure why he was fired but thought that Wooten could be part of it .
“ I do n’t know that it ’s all of it . … I worked at the pleasure of the governor , ” he said .
I ’m sure more will come out about Palin in the coming months .
I do n’t know why conservatives are jumping up and down about Palin .
She does n’t seem all that great .
She may support transparent government , but that does not make someone a fiscal conservative .

' Thank you for calling xxx , my name is Noel , can I have your home telephone number please ? "
I have spoken this exact sequence of words at least two thousand times in my life .
The last time I did it , I vowed never to do it again .
I answered 50 or 60 calls a day in the exact same way , and in the exact same tone when I worked in a call centre some years ago , providing technical support for computer - related issues .
If you had a problem , you called me , and I told you what to do .
Quite often though , I would n't know what to do , but of course I would n't tell you that .
' Never admit you do n't know ' was the tech support motto .
Instead , I would put them on hold , have a mild panic attack and try and think of what to do .
Such is the life of a call - centre drone .
What you hear as a politely spoken voice that vows to help you in any way they can is actually a thoroughly unhappy , damaged human being that hates your guts for calling .
They wish they could tell you what they really think about you and your billing issue .
During training , they teach you how to handle irate callers , failing to add however that a very large majority of calls would be from irate callers .
The trick is to speak in a very low voice , so they have to concentrate in order to hear what you are saying .
Eventually , they adopt your tone and order is restored .
Then , of course , there was the ' sneeze button ' , a cute little thing that when pushed meant you could hear them , but they could n't hear you .
You were meant to press it only when you needed to sneeze or cough .
Instead , it was widely used to curse in frustration , or to continue your wide - ranging conversation with the colleague beside you .
Our call centre handled calls from the UK only .
After a while , you began to learn how to handle different calls from different area codes .
' 0208 ' meant they 're from London , and expected special treatment .
If they were from Liverpool , they were generally more reasonable .
Geordies too tended to be bemused by why it was n't working , but not necessarily angry .
Scottish people would often take issue with how much they were paying each month .
Then there were the various rules and protocols initiated by management .
They never stopped coming up with new ideas and rules .
We never stopped thinking of ways out of doing them .
It was decided that employees had to say the caller 's first name three times during a call , for reasons of friendliness I suppose .
Their mistake was to not specifying when , thus leaving open the handy loophole of saying their names three times in quick succession at the end of the call : " is that okay , David ?
Thanks , David .
Bye , David ... "
Another was the attempt to get rid of the sneeze button altogether , as management came to realise it was being ' misused ' .
They installed new phones that had no mute button .
We retaliated by physically disconnecting the headset from the phone when we wanted to go on a rant .
And of course there were the games .
It 's boring work remember , hundreds of people sitting in a room with no windows , taking call after call after call , barely clinging on to their sanity .
We took comfort in each other , forming bonds that only war veterans and ex-call centre employees fully understand .
We sometimes used to take calls speaking in a foreign accent , and then slowly morph it into another accent to confuse the caller , and amuse ourselves .
I was known for being able to sustain a London accent for long periods ( it 's easy ; just say ' yeah ? ' at the end of every sentence ) , before reverting into a heavy Dublin or Cork accent towards the end of the call .
Most times the caller would respond to this by asking if I was American .
' I want to speak to a supervisor ' are the words all call centre workers fear .
If you have to pass your calls to a supervisor all the time , it reflects badly on the agent .
The easy way out was to just get a colleague to pretend to be a supervisor .
They would just repeat everything you said in a more authoritative tone , and the caller usually felt a lot better .
The job was as bad , though , as you wanted it to be .
I struggled to shrug off tough calls , sometimes thinking about it all the way home , perhaps only letting it go as I drifted to sleep .
One classic I still remember to this day : during a call that was getting increasingly fractious , a very well - spoken English lady declared " you must think I 'm stupid , and you 're the one who 's Irish " .
I would moan about it , sure , but if it was to a fellow employee they always had a better story , something that happened that was even worse .
Everyone claimed their department was the hardest - tech support workers all wished they were in customer services ; customer services wished they worked in tech support .
Everyone agreed that the sign - up department was the place to be .
Towards the end of my time there a rumour spread that an employee in tech support had lost the head , and thrown his chair across the room in a wild rage over a difficult call .
Word also had it that he had been given three months paid leave for stress .
Everyone who heard this story had a light bulb suddenly appear over their head .
About a week later I stood up from my desk , threw my headset down , and approached a supervisor .
I performed my best impression of a man on the edge , mumbling incoherently about call times and support .
I said , Peter Finch - like , that I was mad as hell , and I was n't gonna take it any more .
They said fine , and asked me what address they should send my P45 to .
If I do need to ring a call centre now for whatever reason , I 'm always polite .
I learned , the hard way , that it's not the person on the end of the line 's fault ; it 's not even the supervisor 's fault .
It 's the system .
Whoever I 'm polite to will probably get an earful on the very next call , but it 's a welcome relief .
Every little helps .
i just can't take it any more ...
Many call centres never stop hiring .
A report showed that 56 pc of recruitment drives were due to staff turnover .
The report also found that the average ' lifetime ' of an employee working with a call centre is only about 15 months .
After 15 months , they either join another call centre or quit the profession altogether .
In 2006 , a call centre in Arizona came agonisingly close to taking the world record for annual staff turnover rate for a call centre outside of India .
Agent Dan Ferguson , who had been working there for three months , decided he had had enough and walked out , thus breaking the record .
However , two hours later Ferguson had a change of heart , and decided to come back to work , remembering he could n't make his car repayments without his job .
Biden :
We do n't need a war hero , we need wisdom David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday July 16 , 2008
Print This Email This On Tuesday , Sen. John McCain told a town hall , " I know how to win wars .
... I will turn around the war in Afghanistan .
... I know how to do that . "
The next day , CNN's John Roberts asked Senator Joe. Biden ( D - DE ) , " Do you believe Senator Obama knows how to win wars ?
And if he does , how ? "
" He has a much more centered view on what our problem are , " Biden replied .
" John McCain was wrong about the war in Iraq .
John McCain says the surge worked -- but remember the purpose of the surge ... was to create ' breathing room ' for a political settlement in Iraq .
...
We 're no closer to a political settlement . "
" John McCain has finally acknowledged he has to put more troops in Afghanistan or we 're going to lose Afghanistan , " continued Biden .
" John McCain 's now realizing the desperate situation in Afghanistan , says we need more troops .
...
He first said we have to take them out of Iraq .
...
Then he says no , we 'll have NATO do it .
Then he came back and corrected again , NATO can't do it , we have to do it . "
" The truth of the matter is , Barack Obama has been centered , " Biden stated firmly , " and the central war on terror is in Afghanistan and Pakistan , not Iraq . "
Roberts then cited an ABC / Washington
Post poll which indicates that Americans think McCain has a better knowledge of world affairs by 63 % - 26 % and that 72 % think McCain would make a good commander - in - chief , while only 48 % believe Obama would .
Biden 's response was that Obama is " leading John McCain on every area except the one where experience just intuitively suggests people think if you 're experienced you must know more .
But 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen does n't make you a better commander - in - chief . "
" We do n't need as a commander - in - chief a war hero , " Biden emphasized .
" Joh n 's a war hero .
We need someone with some wisdom .
... President Bush 's policy , which John McCain has embraced on Iraq and foreign policy generally , has been an abject failure . "
" I 've been [ in Iraq ] more than John McCain .
That does n't that I 'm ipso facto more qualified than John McCain , " Biden concluded .
" Barack has had many meetings with military leaders .
He 's been on the Foreign Relations Committee since he 's been in the Congress .
...
He 's going [ to Iraq ] now .
He 's going to have a full view .
And I think he 's going to find when he gets on the ground that the military 's more in line with his position on Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iraq than they are with John's . "

John McCain , Republican presidential candidate , has said he would authorize his secretary of state to talk to Iran about its nuclear program , in a break with Bush administration policy and his own previous stance .
His comments , on one of the most charged issues , reflect a measure of convergence on foreign policy between McCain and Barack Obama , his Democratic rival .
Tehran ’s nuclear plans are widely seen as among the biggest challenges facing the next U.S. president and were at the centre of fierce exchanges between McCain and Obama in their debate on Friday night .
But underneath the invective , McCain went further than before in indicating he favored high - level meetings with Iran .
His comments narrowed his practical policy differences with Obama , who has long championed dialogue with Tehran and who , like McCain , favors tougher international sanctions over Iran ’s nuclear program .
On Pakistan and Afghanistan , the two clashed rhetorically and over whether the Pakistan - Afghanistan region represented “ the central front on terror ” .
But they outlined similar plans that involved sending more troops to Afghanistan and co-operating with Pakistan ’s government .
McCain has previously dismissed calls for high - profile direct talks with Iran .
“ The most overrated aspect of our dialogue about international relations is direct face - to - face talks , ” he told Fox News last year .
But the Republican candidate appeared to change tack on Friday night .
“ There could be secretary ( of state ) level and lower level meetings , ” he said .
“ I ’ve always encouraged them .
” The exchange arose after Obama cited Henry Kissinger , the Republican grandee and informal McCain adviser , who called this month for negotiations at the secretary of state level without prior conditions .
By contrast , Condoleezza Rice , U.S. secretary of state , will only discuss the nuclear file with her Iranian counterpart if Iran reins in its program first .
“ You always have to have the right conditions , ” she said last week .
McCain agreed with Kissinger but contrasted himself with Obama by highlighting his reluctance to meet Mahmoud Ahmadi - Nejad , Iran ’s president .
He called for a new league of democracies to impose sanctions on Iran working with countries such as Britain , France and Germany .
But the three wary of any move that appears to circumvent the United Nations .
“ If we want to move forward , we should n’t antagonize countries that we need , like Russia and China , ” said one European diplomat .
“ It does n’t make sense .
If a non-democracy wants to increase pressure on Iran , it is welcome to .

Two weeks ago we reported on the strange goings on in New York concerning the congressional seat formerly held by Vito Fossella ( which incidentally is the only New York City congressional seat held by a Republican ) .
Things were pretty strange then , but they just got even stranger .
If I were a tele - evangelist , I ’d claim that the supreme being is punishing the Republicans .
To refresh your memory , Republican Congressman Vito Fossella was stopped in Virginia for running a red light .
He was also drunk , and was on his way to visit his second family , complete with an out - of - wedlock daughter .
Vito Finito , as the tabloids put it .
Next the Republicans can’t find anyone to run for his seat , but after frantic searching they finally settle on Francis Powers , a wealthy businessman .
This despite the vow of his own son ( also named Francis Powers ) to run against his father as a Libertarian .
Yesterday , Francis Powers ( senior ) died of a heart attack .
At this point , if I were thinking of running for that seat as a Republican , I ’d strongly reconsider .
But the Republicans do n’t have much time — the filing deadline is July 10 .

Here ’s part of a press release describing Square Enix ’s proposed take over bid for Tecmo .
As news goes this is about as interesting as , well as the last thing Gordon Brown said – and we all remember what that was .
What is interesting is what the new name of the company will be .
Oh , sure it ’s easy to say Square Enix Tecmo , doofus .
But , come on we ’ve had the fairly imaginative Squeenix bandied about it before , so what ’s a good and funny new name assuming Tecmo is taken over ?
Answers in the comments below , and if nofi’s got anything good lying around TSA Towers there will be a prize for the best name – although you ’ll have to be UK - based to receive that .
Go on then , get to it .

Engineers at Georgia
Tech have used skin cells to create artificial bones that mimic the ability of natural bone to blend into other tissues such as tendons or ligaments .
The artificial bones display a gradual change from bone to softer tissue rather than the sudden shift of previously developed artificial tissue , providing better integration with the body and allowing them to handle weight more successfully .
" One of the biggest challenges in regenerative medicine is to have a graded continuous interface , because anatomically that 's how the majority of tissues appear and there are studies that strongly suggest that the graded interface provides better integration and load transfer , " said Andres Garcia , professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology .

Garcia and former graduate student Jennifer Phillips , along with research technician Kellie Burns and their collaborators Joseph Le Doux and Robert Guldberg , were not only able to create artificial bone that melds into softer tissues , but were also able to implant the technology in vivo for several weeks .
They created the tissue by coating a three - dimensional polymer scaffold with a gene delivery vehicle that encodes a transcription factor known as Runx2 .
They generated a high concentration of Runx2 at one end of the scaffold and decreased that amount until they ended up with no transcription factor on the other end , resulting in a precisely controlled spatial gradient of Runx2 .
After that , they seeded skin fibroblasts uniformly onto the scaffold .
The skin cells on the parts of the scaffold containing a high concentration of Runx2 turned into bone , while the skin cells on the scaffold end with no Runx2 turned into soft tissue .
The result is an artificial bone that gradually turns into soft tissue , such as tendons or ligaments .
If the technology is able to pass further testing , one application could be anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) surgery .
Oftentimes , ACL surgery fails at the point where the ligament meets the bone .
But if an artificial bone / ligament construct with these types of graded transitions were implanted , it might lead to more successful outcomes for patients .
" Every organ in our body is made up of complex , heterogeneous structures , so the ability to engineer tissues that more closely mimic these natural architectures is a critical challenge for the next wave of tissue engineering , " said Phillips , who is now working at Emory University as a postdoctoral research fellow in developmental biology .
Now that they have been able to demonstrate that they can implant the tissue in vivo for several weeks , the team 's next step is to show that the tissue can handle weight for an even longer period of time .

Karma :
A sprinkler system partially flooded part of the Pepsi Center Monday morning .
The Denver Fire Department , which has a crew stationed at the center all week , was able to respond quickly before 5 a .m. when the sprinkler went off .
The sprinkler was located on the club level in a skybox which had recently been renovated to host a news crew .
It appears the skybox belongs to Fox .
After going off , the sprinkler released 50 to 100 gallons of water per minute and 9NEWS crews estimate it was on for around 5 minutes .
" Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends , it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists -- whether through design or stupidity , I do not know -- as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms .
The punctuations occur at the level of species ; directional trends ( on the staircase model ) are rife at the higher level of transitions within major groups . "

The donuts are starting to make more sense .
Last month , at the Associated Press meeting with the presidential candidates , Obama was referred to as “ Osama ” — McCain got a box of donuts from Liz Sidoti and her boss , Ron Fournier .
They got the right kind : “ Dunkin Donuts with sprinkles . ”
And , McCain got coffee “ with a little cream and a little sugar ” the way he likes it , too .
Sidoti explained that she and Fournier used to spend a lot of time on the bus with McCain .
Jed has the the video .
It was a bizarre , but telling exchange .
Sidoti ’s boss , Ron Fournier , AP ’s Washington bureau chief , is profiled at Politico today on the new “ style ” he ’s bringing to AP .
Fournier was also involved in another bizarre , yet telling exchange back in April of 2004 — right after Pat Tillman died in Afghanistan .
TPM Muckraker revealed that Fournier and Karl Rove were email pals .
Oh , sure , Rove emailed with a lot of reporters .
But , how many reporters wrote to Rove “ Keep up the fight . ”
This e-mail was dated April 23 , 2004 — right smack in the middle of the presidential campaign .
The Associated Press : In 2004 , “ Keep up the fight . ”
In 2008 , “ Dunkin Donuts with sprinkles . ”
Part of him wanted to lay her down on the bed and hold her and make passionate love to her the way they do in romantic movies .
Part of him wanted to get his clothes on and get out of there as fast as possible .
And never look back .
And never discuss this moment .
Ever .
They were covered in soapy bubbles , standing close to each other in the shower of her Fort Lauderdale townhouse .
Steam crept down the bathroom mirror .
" Does that feel OK ? " she asked , running her fingertips through the lather on his shoulder .
He was a burly man , a merchant marine in his 40s who 'd spent most of his life at sea .
The only woman with whom he'd had any relationship was his mother , who was both religious and abusive .
She 'd often reminded him that sex was a dirty , sinful , unspeakable act .
Catherine , the woman touching him in the shower , was the first woman who'd ever caressed him .
" That feels good , " he said in a shaky voice .
" Now I 'm going to rub the other shoulder , " Catherine said .
A slim , modest - looking woman with straight , soft hair and a smooth , warm face , she was calm and reassuring .
" That is n't too bad , is it ? "
Before they got in the shower , they 'd talked a bit , getting to know each other .
They started with soft touching on the hands and arms .
Eventually , they were standing naked next to each other .
All the while , Catherine encouraged him to talk about how he was feeling .
He said he was frightened , tense .
He could n't stop thinking about what his mother had told him so many times .
He could n't help but feel that what he was doing was wrong .
But it also felt good to be touched .
It felt good to connect with someone , even if it was just temporary .
Catherine continued rubbing him and speaking in a soothing , caring tone .
He extended his hands to her body .
First to her hands and arms , then her shoulders and stomach , and soon her breasts .
As his hands moved over Catherine 's soapy body , he gulped .
His eyes turned glassy .
His hands shook .
He felt a twisting deep in his chest .
Soon it was too much for him .
The merchant marine was overwhelmed by the experience .
He began sobbing .
" That 's all right , " she said , still covered in bubbles .
Catherine 's voice was like warm syrup on a cold morning .
" Stay with your feelings .
Talk to me .
It 's OK . "
Catherine is n't his wife or girlfriend .
Nor is she some trollop off the street .
And while technically she is getting paid $ 185 an hour to play with him in the shower , she is not a prostitute .
She 's a sexual surrogate — a partner supplied by the man 's therapist so he can work through his sexual dysfunction .
The concept of sexual surrogates first came about in the late 1950s , when sexology researchers William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson were working with couples dealing with sexual problems ranging from physical handicaps to serious emotional issues caused by childhood trauma .
Many of the most severe cases were men and women who struggled with these issues but understandably did n't have a partner to work with .
So Masters and Johnson found open - minded , compassionate young women to fill the role of sexual partner for therapy purposes .
Since then , men have also become sexual surrogates .
Partner surrogates can work with patients for as long as several years or for only a few weekends .
Over an extended treatment period , a surrogate might dispense anything from verbal encouragement and soft touching to intercourse .
Though most psychologists no longer view surrogate therapy as radical , the practice is rare these days .
Dozens of surrogates were spread across the country in the ' 70s and ' 80s , but today , in a Viagra - infused society , there are fewer than 30 licensed practitioners .
And there is just one certified surrogate working in Florida — Catherine .
She works with men traumatized by childhood abuse or who have physical or emotional handicaps that make sex difficult .
The merchant marine , for example , felt that his mother 's sentiments about sex had a hold on him that prevented him from connecting with anyone .
" It was n't until his mother died that he would even think about these things , " says Dr. Marilyn Volker , the Miami sexologist who brought in Catherine to be the sailor 's surrogate .
" He had never really been around women , and these thoughts paralyzed him . "
Because he was so accustomed to living at sea , where he showered in saltwater once every few days , Volker and Catherine started by coaching him on simple things like dress and meal etiquette and showering and brushing his teeth daily .
They were nonjudgmental and reassuring , explaining how a mature relationship should work .
" It 's not about sex , " Volker says .
" It 's about being able to connect with another human being . "
The sailor 's breakdown in the shower was actually a breakthrough , Volker says .
As he felt the sensuous touch of a woman for the first time , he discovered that he was capable of opening up and sharing with another person and , in turn , being loved himself .
Later that afternoon , he told Volker , " If I never have sex with a woman , it wo n't matter , because today I feel free of whatever my mother did to me . "
Before that moment in the shower , Volker says , " all of his emotional connections to other humans had been tapered down or shut off .
You would n't be able to tell it by looking at this big , smelly kind of guy , but he was closed down .
Now he feels like he can at least search for someone .
Like life is n't hopeless . "
The first time Volker told her about surrogate therapy , Catherine felt as though her entire life had been leading up to this .
" I felt immediately like this is what I was meant to do , " she says .
Now in her early 60s , she sat down recently to talk about her life as Florida 's only sexual surrogate .
Catherine is not her real name .
She asked that her name not be published because of the nature of her work .
Catherine , ironically , is her confirmation name .
She grew up in a Catholic family in southeast New Jersey .
Her father was a factory worker and an alcoholic .
Though her Ukrainian mother was devoutly Catholic , she divorced while Catherine was in elementary school and waited tables at a diner to pay the bills .
She worked the graveyard shift while Catherine looked after her three younger sisters .
Her mother never taught her about the birds and the bees .
" All my mother ever told me about boys was that I should stay away from them no matter what , " Catherine says .
" She never even said anything about protection or how anything worked or anything .
' Just stay away . '
So , of course , naturally , I could n't resist . "
In high school , she 'd sneak out of the house to meet her older , football - star boyfriend .
At 15 , she got pregnant .
It was 1960 .
Her mother was devastated .
" A priest came to my house , " she says .
" They said I had two options : Get married or move to a convent .
Luckily , [ the father of the baby ] was OK with getting married , and as much as you can be at 15 , we really were in love . "
A week before her 16th birthday , she married and moved to Key West , where her new husband 's father was a wealthy businessman .
She says her father - in - law had a string of girlfriends he regularly mistreated .
She worried that her husband might one day take after Dad .
Seven months after the move , she gave birth to a boy .
Over the next five years , they had two more sons .
She says that by then , her husband had cultivated a stable of para­mours just like his father .
When they divorced , she was 22 .
She says her father - in - law pushed hard to keep the kids in Key West .
Relinquishing custody of her sons , Catherine worked one odd job after another , bouncing up and down the East Coast .
She tended bar , waitressed , and sang in clubs in Key West .
Her longest stint was as a receptionist for Xerox in Miami .
The same year her oldest son went off to college on an ROTC scholarship , her ex-husband died at 37 .
The two youngest sons decided not to move in with their mother .
Their grandfather gave the boys a mobile home to live in by themselves in Key West .
" As you can imagine , two teenage boys living on their own , the place was a constant party . "
Catherine took a job as a flight attendant .
Two of her sisters were flight attendants , and it sounded appealing — crisscrossing the world , meeting interesting travelers , learning about other cultures .
And taking care of people , which is what Catherine did best .
She had a run of short relationships with men , including a brief marriage to an alcoholic who reminded her of her father .
After several airlines she worked for went out of business , she started looking for a new line of work .
She took acting classes and got work as an extra in movies and a few speaking roles in commercials .
She saw an ad in New Times calling for actresses who would be comfortable showing their genitals to Nova University med students needing to learn how to examine live patients .
She got $ 30 per student , with about eight per class .
She found that she was completely relaxed with her clothes off .
And she liked it .
She found satisfaction in helping nervous future physicians navigate what could have been an awkward experience .
Catherine told a chiropractor friend how much she liked working with the young students .
One day , as he worked on her back and she talked about what she wanted to do with the rest of her life , he touched a sore spot below her shoulder blade , the area behind her lungs .
The sensation immediately brought tears to her eyes .
Not from physical pain , though ; the touch seemed to trigger something else inside of her .
Her friend asked her to talk about what she was thinking .
She explained that the touch reminded her of something from her childhood .
Something horrible .
Something someone had done to her .
He told her about the concept of " muscle memory . "
As humans , one of our brain 's coping mechanisms for dealing with trauma , particularly sexual trauma , is to repress the memory of the traumatic event .
Certain kinds of touch can stimulate those memories , even if they 've been dormant for decades .
" The body is a funny thing , " Catherine says .
The chiropractor 's touch brought back memories of a time as a child when she was molested .
Through the years , Catherine pieced together her college degree , taking night classes at community colleges , majoring in psychology .
She told her chiropractor she wanted to work in therapy .
Maybe even sex therapy .
" The problem was , I did n't want to go through getting a Ph.D. , and in psychology , you basically can't work unless you have a doctorate . "
He put her in touch with his friend Volker in Coral Gables .
Volker , a slim , urbane woman , told Catherine there was something in the field of sex therapy that did n't require a post - grad degree .
Catherine had never heard of surrogate therapy , but as Volker explained the process , it made sense .
Surrogates help patients connect on an intimate level .
" I 'd been doing that all my life .
In my personal life , I had been coaching boyfriends for years .
I 'd get calls from exes telling me how much I helped them become comfortable with themselves , " she says .
" I 've never felt better - suited for anything . "
When the International Professional Surrogate Association training program accepted Catherine , she was told to bring plenty of comfort foods and her favorite blankets — this was going to be an emotional process .
To get into the IPSA program , the only surrogate partner certification course in the country , Catherine needed three letters of recommendation from health professionals attesting to her earnest desire to help people .
She had to write an essay detailing her sexual history and another one explaining why she wanted to be a surrogate .
After her application was approved by the IPSA board , Catherine paid the $ 1,500 tuition and went to California for three weeks .
Her class consisted of four students : herself , a young man , and a married couple .
There were two instructors : Vena Blanchard , president of IPSA , and a male surrogate trainer .
Classes took place at Blanchard 's home in Los Angeles .
The first day , the students were told they would work as partners for the duration of training .
" Obviously , I thought they 'd put the couple together and pair me with the young man , " she says .
" But no , I was told to work with the man , even though his wife was right there watching us and talking to us . "
On the second day , the class was instructed to disrobe .
The exercise for that day was a full - body , head - to - toe , up - close inspection of each student .
Throughout the training , the partners played the roles of both patient and surrogate .
Students kept journals of their most intimate feelings and shared them with Blanchard every day .
They heard lectures on topics ranging from basic human biology to dealing with the natural human attachments that arise in this line of work .
Toward the end of training , Catherine wrote in her journal that she was having conflicting feelings .
She believed 100 percent in the concept of surrogate therapy , but she suspected that her training partner — the husband — was " just there to get a cheap thrill . "
She felt guilty for feeling that way .
Blanchard approached her after the last class .
She told Catherine that her instincts were right on .
" You 've got exactly what it takes , " Blanchard told her .
" You 're going to be a great surrogate . "
Her training was put to the test with her first client : the malodorous merchant marine who'd never been around women .
" It was a really tough case , " she says now , smiling as she thinks of the patient .
" I had to call Vena [ Blanchard ] and ask what to do .
He just had all sorts of social problems . "
The solution ?
" She suggested I take him out on a date .
The rules were , he picks the place , he pays , we walk through what women like and do n't like .
Then have the session afterward . "
So the sailor cleaned himself up and took Catherine to a nice steak house in Fort Lauderdale .
" It was rough , " she says .
" He was eating with two hands , burping , getting up for smoke breaks throughout the meal .
I told him , ' Look , if you want to connect with someone , you can't do this .
You ca n't just get up and go outside in the middle of dinner . ' "
After dinner , he said he was too full of steak to have a regular surrogate session .
" You see , food was one of the ways he dealt with his anxious feelings , along with alcohol and cigarettes , " she says .
" So when he was nervous about the date , he ate more than he should have and smoked more .
Those were his crutches . "
As therapy progressed — long before the breakthrough in the shower — he began to open up more .
He talked about his overbearing , controlling mother , but he also talked about the time an uncle took him to a prostitute as a teenager .
He had showered and put on cologne ahead of time .
But when the time for sex came , the prostitute told him he needed to shower again .
He could n't go through with it .
It 's no coincidence that his big breakthrough with Catherine occurred in the shower , she says .
Human psychology is a powerful force .
Behind man 's sexual desires are millions of years of evolution urging him to spread his seed , she says .
But the emotional responses such as fear and shame are so strong that they override biology and physiology .
" He was already self - conscious and scared being in that situation , " Catherine says , " and now you have a hooker telling you that you smell bad .
The poor thing .
He went 20 years before he could even talk to a woman . "
Picket - fence America was n't ready for the concept of sexual surrogates when the therapy was developed in 1959 at the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation in St. Louis , later renamed the Masters and Johnson Institute .
Respectable folks did n't discuss such matters .
Masters and his research assistant turned wife , Johnson , were the first American academics to examine human sexuality since Alfred Kinsey 's groundbreaking work at the University of Indiana .
They created a broad program that involved everything from interviewing volunteers about their sexual histories to observing couples having sex in the laboratory .
Their findings are still the basis for most research in the field of sexology , according to Dr. James Walker , president of the American Board of Sexology , a national quality assurance and certification organization that oversees sex therapists .
" There have been new models for study and treatment and obviously with pharmaceuticals , " he says , " but everything people are doing really comes from adaptations of this original way of looking at sex . "
Masters and Johnson developed new methods to treat married couples with sexual dysfunctions , conditions they described with terms such as " ejaculatory incompetence " and " orgasmic dysfunction in women . "
The solution , as they saw it , combined psychological approaches with practice at home .
The exercises were based on trust and acceptance , with couples and therapists working as a team .
But this posed a problem for unmarried men and women , who were often the most severe cases .
Their sexual problems , in fact , were precisely the reason they did n't have a partner .
It was a twisted social paradox : can't work on the problem without a partner ; can't get a partner before working on the problem .
So Masters and Johnson trained the first surrogates .
For the study , 13 women were selected as surrogates from 31 volunteers .
They worked with 41 single men .
After 11 years , in 1970 , Masters and Johnson published Human Sexual Inadequacy , a book about their research .
It became a bestseller and has since been translated into 30 languages .
The book , written in intentionally dry , clinical language , has a chapter dedicated to the work of the original group of women , whom they called partner surrogates .
An optimal partner surrogate , they explained , was , for the patient , " someone to hold on to , talk to , work with , learn from , be a part of , and above all else , give to and get from . "
Masters and Johnson believed that without two people present to explore the nature of the dysfunction , there was no chance of recovery .
With an emotional connection , they said , the treatment can bring healing , in some cases overriding the original trauma and replacing it with a positive association .
The original surrogates came into the program with some traumatic stories of their own .
Three of the 13 women had been married to men with sexual dysfunctions .
One man killed himself .
Another husband , unable to deal with his dysfunction , became an alcoholic and eventually divorced .
But the women all had their own reasons for wanting to participate in the program .
If someone wants to conquer a fear of flying , at some point , he must ride in a plane .
If someone wants to conquer a fear of intimacy , he also has to board the plane at some point .
The way Volker looks at it , to be a surrogate , you have to like being the plane in the equation — the one who eases the pain , no matter how physically or emotionally handicapped the patient may be .
Volker is sometimes called the Dr. Ruth of South Florida .
She used to host a call - in radio show called Sex With Marilyn .
She also teaches graduate classes at Florida International University , Barry University , and St. Thomas University .
She 's the type of grandmother who gives her grandkids books about sex every year .
Volker does at least four or five " talk therapy " sessions before she introduces a patient to the surrogate .
If the patient is struggling with problems like addiction or anger management or depression , or even if there 's a medical issue such as high blood pressure , these must be addressed before starting therapy with a surrogate .
" We can't have anything else getting in the way of those true , intense emotional feelings , " she says .
The first sessions are a screening process .
Because patients often work with surrogates in the surrogates ' home or alone in hotel rooms , she has to make sure she is n't putting the surrogate in danger .
They use protection if there is intercourse .
If the patient seems like an appropriate candidate , the three parties — Volker , Catherine , and the patient — meet in the Hollywood office .
" The first step is everyone getting to feel comfortable with one another , " Volker says .
" Surrogates are n't prostitutes , not that there is anything wrong with prostitution .
It is n't , ' Here 's 50 bucks — give me a blowjob . '
A lot of times , there is n't even intercourse .
It 's mostly talking . "
She says if a patient asks about what the surrogate looks like , " that 's an immediate red flag .
I know right there that 's not the type of person who would benefit from working with a surrogate . "
If the meet - and - greet goes well , the therapy begins with what Volker calls body mapping — the surrogate and patient going over the patient 's body together , determining what 's comfortable ( or functional ) and what 's not .
Then comes an exchange of touches : first observational , then playful , then nurturing , and , finally , sexual touching , which may or may not lead to intercourse .
The process is often done slowly , with weekly meetings over a number of years .
" For people who have done surrogate work , " Volker says , " their rituals of moving with regard to closeness will be very different from what 's on adult films .
Their ritual of what we call foreplay — I call it ' outercourse . '
They get to genitals in very different ways .
Because for many people , if it were done like on adult films , it could be triggering , and the body could shut down .
Because it is like reenacting the traumatic experience . "
Volker recalls the case of a man who'd been injured in a car accident at 18 .
Before the accident , the man was sexually active ; he was engaged , in fact .
But the crash left him a quadriplegic , unable to speak .
After ten years of rehab , he was living in a nursing home .
His psychologist asked Volker to see the patient .
" This man was very angry , hostile , " she explains .
" He was making — I suppose clinically it'd be called ' lascivious tongue movements ' at women . "
He also managed to swing his arm , hitting people near him .
Volker established a communication system so the patient could answer yes or no questions .
" I wanted to see what was important to this young man .
He was very interested in the sexuality part .
He was very angry that there was no way to express this .
Here he was in a Catholic nursing home , which was great for helping him in all the rest of his life , but the sexuality was very overlooked . "
When she brought in pictures , she learned he liked blonds — blonds with large breasts .
As it turns out , his fiancée who left him after the accident ( " and one could hardly blame her , " Volker adds ) fit that picture .
Volker said she 'd bring in a surrogate to work with him but only if he agreed to stop the tongue movements and hitting .
Catherine quickly figured out what he could feel and what he could n't , what worked and what did n't .
As it turned out , the patient could get erections and ejaculate ( the limbic system , which controls sexual impulses , had not been affected by the accident ) , but he could n't reach himself to masturbate .
He had gone ten years unable to tell anyone .
The climax of the treatment came when they arranged for Catherine to come to the nursing home one night .
It was Volker 's idea .
" We set up a step - by - step ' date ' of watching a movie together , eating some food or drinking something together , then a massage with what we might call a happy ending . "
There 's no way of knowing exactly what percentage of the populace might be candidates for surrogate therapy .
Volker suspects that the percentage of " sexual anorexics and phobics " who actually come in for therapy is small .
There are many others out there who would be right for the treatment but can't afford it or are too embarrassed .
David Yoblick is no longer embarrassed about the time he spent with a sexual surrogate .
It was 30 years ago .
Yoblick , then 37 , had just divorced his second wife , and he wanted help with delayed ejaculation .
" This was before we had Viagra , " he says .
" There was n't much a man could do , but I tried it all : eating certain things , not eating certain things , vitamins , minerals , exercises , whatever I thought might work . "
Yoblick says the problem began with his first sexual experience , when he was 12 .
" It was in a public park in Philadelphia , and , well , I ejaculated very rapidly . "
He had sex in high school , but it was always brief , and there were long stretches when he could n't perform .
It was the same when he got married .
He was always tired from working two full - time jobs , causing a strain on the marriage .
In his second marriage , sex was n't as big an issue , but it still did n't work out .
Yoblick 's lack of sexual confidence was a huge issue , he says .
" The first thing I thought about whenever I shook a woman 's hand and introduced myself was , ' Will I be able to get an erection ? '
Men think if they do n't get erections , they are in some way less of a person . "
In the late ' 70s , Volker was finishing her graduate work in sexual behavior at the University of Miami .
She was at a party with one of her mentors when a psychologist was talking about a patient who needed someone with knowledge of sexology to work as a surrogate with him .
Inspired by the moment — and a recent divorce — she volunteered her services .
She worked with the therapist and the patient , following the traditional Masters and Johnson steps , making emotional connections , then physical .
" There 's nothing like seeing a person discover their own sexuality — seeing the moment they feel free from some trauma or the moment they learn they are just as capable of having sex as anyone else . "
She gets a knot in her throat as she talks .
" It 's just overwhelming .
What people are capable of is amazing . "
After she had assisted several other patients , the therapist she worked with at the time introduced her to a man who'd been having problems getting and keeping an erection .
They got to know each other .
His name was David , and he needed an understanding partner who would n't rush him and would n't scold him if he could n't perform .
She liked him .
She really liked him .
Something was wrong , actually .
She told the therapist that it would be psychologically damaging to everyone involved if she continued seeing someone for whom she had such strong feelings .
Patient and surrogate had a sitdown in the therapist 's office .
When David was told Marilyn would no longer be his surrogate , he asked her out on a date .
" I can't date one of my patients , " she said .
" Why not ? " he asked , pointing out that she already knew his darkest secret and did n't seem to mind .
" And you just said I 'm not your patient anymore . "
Soon , David Yoblick did n't need a surrogate .
Marilyn , his new girlfriend , knew just how to handle his little dilemma .
Volker 's voice gets softer and quieter when she talks about the successes she 's seen through surrogate partner therapy , like the resolution of the quadriplegic accident victim 's problem .
" This young man still gets help eating and dressing and speech therapy , " she says .
" He gets taken to church and to the beach and different activities .
And once a week , an escort comes who sits and watches a movie with him and they have something to eat , and she gives a massage with the manual sex .
And he 's able to ejaculate . "
As for the merchant marine , he 's doing OK too , she says .
He 's still looking for the right woman .
And he 's ready to connect with someone .
" And who knows ? " Volker says .
" There are people into all sorts of what I call skanky smells . "
Almost every day , as she 's leaving her office , she gets a call from her favorite surrogate patient .
After 30 years , she and David are still married .
They see their children and grandchildren regularly .
David knows he 's lucky to have found the perfect partner for him .
When he tells people how they met , he says , " Thank God for my limp - dick problem . "
Technically , since she is getting paid and occasionally has sex with her patients , Catherine could be charged with prostitution .
The only state with explicit laws protecting therapists and surrogates is California .
A police officer would have to be having a really bad day , though , to ignore the fact that this is clearly therapeutic , Volker says , and it 's never happened in any of her cases .
But Dr. Walker of the American Board of Sexology says legal ambiguity is precisely the reason surrogate therapy might be in its last throes .
" The controversy comes from the fact that prosecutors have decided that if you are hiring someone to have sex with someone , you are a panderer , " he says .
" Many clinicians , not wanting to put themselves at risk , have stopped using surrogates . "
The decline has more do with technology and pharmaceutical advancements , says Volker , citing what she calls the " Viagrazation of America . "
Catherine thinks it also has something to do with the emotionally draining nature of the work .
Recently , she took a year off from being a surrogate .
" It 's rewarding , but it 's also exhausting , " she says .
She calls the work " a roller coaster of feelings you have for and about these desperate people who need your help so badly . "
She knows how much of a man 's identity is entwined with his sexuality , sometimes becoming an all - consuming plague on an otherwise tolerable life .
More than any other dysfunction , her patients are rapid ejaculators with anxiety issues .
" I 'm here to tell you , the Jewish mother is alive and well , " Catherine says .
" That overmothering , the control , the ' He 's my son , and nobody 's gonna take him away , ' that has an effect on men .
I see it . "
One patient needed overstimulation to get aroused .
He was a doctor who was able to have sex , but he needed to watch an adult movie to maintain an erection .
" He needed women with unnaturally large , superenhanced breasts , " Catherine says .
" He could n't get enough of anything .
But he was also in his 40s , and he had never been in love .
He wanted to know why he could n't get into a serious relationship . "
During an early session , Catherine was giving him a full - body , fully clothed massage .
Going over his back , she pushed down below his shoulder blade , behind his lung — the same place her chiropractor had pressed on years earlier .
The doctor began sobbing .
She spoke to him in a calm voice .
" Stay with your feelings , " she said .
" Talk to me .
Talk to me about what you 're feeling . "
He was inconsolable , she says , holding his arms over his ears as he cried .
It turned out that , when he was 7 , his family lived in an apartment building in New York .
The building 's janitor lived in the basement , where the boy would sometimes visit him .
That spot on his back that Catherine touched during the massage was the same place where the janitor had put his hand when he raped him and ejaculated on his back .
Not long after the massage , the physician started seeing someone .
For the first time in his life , he had what was at least the beginning of a serious relationship .
He had his final session with Catherine and switched to exercises with his girlfriend .
As the final session with Catherine ended , he leaned over to her and whispered , " Still , she 's not you . "
Many of Catherine 's patients fall in love with her , just like Volker 's surrogate patients fell in love with her at the time .
It 's only natural when you have an emotionally wounded individual and someone who 's always ready to listen .
" I tell them , ' You do n't see me first thing in the morning .
You do n't have to deal with me when I 'm cranky or tired . ' "
Catherine always holds a closing session in which she explains that she was there just to model a relationship and that they will do just fine without her .
In 12 years , she has had about 30 patients .
She 's had intercourse with only three of them : two 40 - plus virgins and one rapid ejaculator who could n't last more than a few seconds during intercourse .
After a year off and a move from Fort Lauderdale to Boynton Beach , she 's ready to start seeing clients again .
She feels like her life is coming together for the first time in years .
She has a good relationship with her sons , the oldest of whom is a captain in the Navy .
And yes , they do know what she does .
She sat them all down in a room a few years ago and told them she had a great opportunity to help people as a surrogate .
" It 's not about the sex .
It 's about the intimacy , " she told them .
If they had any questions , she added , all they had to do was ask .
The topic has not been discussed since .
She 's in a serious relationship now .
Relationships are tricky for a surrogate .
Before the current boyfriend , she 'd had two serious boyfriends .
When it came time to talk about her work , she gave them both the same careful , practiced talk about helping people with serious sexual dysfunction and feeling like she had a purpose in life .
One ended the relationship immediately .
" The other one said he was OK with it , but he basically did n't understand it and was n't OK with it . "
They split up a month later .
After that , she did n't date for a while .
" It was just easier , " she says .
" I fell into the same routine I 'd always had in life : give and give and give and not get anything back . "
That 's what she did when she was taking care of her younger sisters as a child .
But self - neglect has consequences .
" If you do n't date outside with this job , it will kill you , " she says .
So she set up an online dating account .
On Yahoo !
Personals , she met a man 15 years younger than she who had n't been in a relationship for ten years .
He told her he'd never been in love .
On their first date , they ended up kissing in a booth at Bennigan's .
This time , she had told him ahead of time in an email that she was a surrogate .
" He really is OK with it , " she says .
" He is n't jealous at all .
He 's more curious about it than anything else .
He likes to hear stories about different patients I 've had . "
They just celebrated their one - year anniversary .
When she works as a flight attendant now , Catherine has someone to pick her up and drop her off at the airport .
One night , she got to thinking about their age difference .
" I know one of these days , you 'll leave me for someone younger , " she told him , a slight hint of bitterness in her otherwise sugary voice .
Her eyes tear up and her voice flickers as she talks about the moment .
She thinks about her life spent taking care of others .
" He held me by the hand , " she says , " and looked me in the eye .
He said , ' You 're the first woman I 've ever loved .
I 'll always take care of you . ' "
" Corsi is hampered in what he can do - with only 18 soldiers , he cannot allow his men to patrol the vicinity .
There are several reconstruction projects ongoing , but the Americans are largely unable to protect them .
All Corsi can do is radio headquarters and ask for air support if he hears of an attack .
But in such mountainous terrain reports of incidents can take hours to filter through , by which time the Taliban are long gone .
And with military helicopters and jets stretched to the limit on other operations , support is not guaranteed .

Half a platoon on a hilltop resupplied by civilian contractors in light planes and Ukrainians using an old Russian helicopter ?
This is a " shoestring " operation .
Clearly there are not enough coalition troops in Afghanistan .
What is the mission for Outpost " Margha ? " Border surveillance ?
The officer in charge does not have enough men or fire support to patrol or ambush toward the nearby border .
One " heavy " mortar ?
The miniaturization of this effort is disturbing .
In Vietnam , an equivalent position , similarly sited , was Bu Dop Special Forces Camp in Phuoc Long Province .
It was two miles from Cambodia and the rear base area of North Vietnamese Army units that , depending on circumstance , numbered several thousand at any given time .
Bu Dop Camp had about 30 US and Vietnamese Special Forces soldiers and several hundred Civilian Irregular Defense Group ( CIDG ) militia IN THE CAMP .
These CIDG " strikers " were full timers who had been recruited from all over the country .
The camp covered a couple of acres , was star or triangle shaped ( I forget which ) , had two concentric lines of defenses , both heavily dug in , underground tunnels running everywhere , underground living facilities and massive fire support available within the camp .
This consisted of half a dozen 4.2 inch and 81 mm mortars in dug in positions and a 105 mm howitzer .
There were M2 .50 caliber machine guns in positions all over the inner perimeter and .30 caliber Brownings in similar positions in the outer perimeter .
Everything was deeply entrenched with double apron barbed wire fences all around the outside and between the two lines of defense .
Anchored concertina wire was piled up between the fences .
The wire was booby trapped .
Fougasse and claymore mines abounded in the wire obstacle as well as aircraft flares situated to use their cylindrical metal shipping container halves as reflectors to shine 25 million candlepower in the faces of an assault force when needed .
In addition to this , the place sometimes had available the fires of American artillery temporarily in the area .
Then there was available air support , especially the ubiquitous AC - 47 " Spooky " gunships with their gatling guns .
A formidable place , but not all that unusual .
In spite of this the North Vietnamese tried several times to capture the post .
They tried with regimental size attacks backed by a lot of artillery and rockets .
They failed although it was a close thing at times .
What was Bu Dop 's mission ?
It was surveillance of the border and North Vietnamese infiltration and supply of their forces in South Vietnam .
To that end the garrison of Bu Dop patrolled and ambushed right up to the border across a wide swath of border country .
It was dangerous work .
A secondary mission was the protection of the nearby district town of Bo Duc and the Vietnamese government apparatus there .
These were reasonable missions given the resources available .
Outpost " Margha " is ridiculously under -resourced .
Not enough men , very little readily available fire support for the protection of either the outpost or any civilians who could be persuaded to become friendly .
The junior officer in command has a thankless task .
All he can do is hold on , try not to be over run and pray for his relief to show up .
Air power is lovely as a source of logistical and fire support , but " Margha " is resupplied by civilian contractors and has one mortar as its available indirect fire support ?
There is obviously not enough US air power available for either job .
Men living on combat rations for months at a time ?
Constipation must be a problem .
Both the foreground ridge in the picture and the one behind it should be covered with pre-registered artillery and mortar fires so that every attack by fire will be answered so rapidly that it will be extremely dangerous to fire from those positions .
Dare I think of an aggressive program of ambush patrols on the part of these paratroops ?
There would have to be a lot more of them .
They are now now more or less pent up in their little fort .
The Taliban must think they have already died and gone to paradise .
This is eerily reminiscent of old British experience in this same area .
A counter - battery mortar radar would be a good idea at " Margha " if they do not already have one .
There should be US artillery positioned to support places like this , but in today 's army that kind of thinking seems to have gone away .
Too little , too much risk , disaster waiting to happen .

" The Daily Show " was in top form last night as they called out every single cable news network for helping spread the myriad scurrilous and unfounded rumors about Senator Obama .
Download Download ( h/t to the wonderful Heather )
Obama 's camp initially agreed that the cartoon was " tasteless and offensive " .
Really ?
You know what your response should have been ... let me put this statement out for you .
Barack Obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a Muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons ?
Muslim extremists , of which Barack Obama is not .
It 's just a f %#!- ing cartoon !
But as always , no where was the anger at the media hotter , than in the media .
Even though these coordinated lies about Barack Obama are shameful and disturbing , the fact remains that this presents a real problem for his campaign .
According to a recent Newsweek poll , a whopping 29 % of respondents said they believe Obama was raised a Muslim , while a significant 12 % said Obama was sworn in on the Qur'an .
Indeed , most of the reservations I hear from close friends about thier reluctance to vote for Obama revolve around their doubts about his " character , " most of which are exacerbated by these deliberate and coordinated distortions .
This is where the whole New Yorker cartoon comes into play .
Although many have argued that the whole controversy is a net gain for Obama -- because it vividly illustrated the absurdity of the lies , therefore debunking it on a wider scale than otherwise possible -- I tend to agree with those who think it 's harmful to the cause of setting the record straight .
Regardless of whether or not you found the satirical cover funny and clever , I fear it may have just reinforced the false impressions people may ( or may not ) have had .
In the end , though , it 's almost kind of humorous .
After the whole Jeremiah Wright saga , you would think everyone would recognize that Obama is , in fact , a Christian .
I think Kos said it best when he wrote this :
[ The Wright scandal ] really puts Obama 's smear merchants in a bind -- do they push false rumors that he's a secret Muslim bent on delivering America to Al Qaida , or is he a member of an intolerant and radical black Christian church ?
While I know the crazies on the Right have a remarkable power to ignore the laws of reality , science , and logic in pursuit of their wrongheaded ideology , trying to float both these theories at once might be a stretch , even for them .
Unfortunately I think Markos may have misunderestimated the power of the right wing smear machine and its ability to convince more than a handful of people that both lies are simultaneously true .
Recently I worried that the news media would do again what they did in 2000 , and somehow latch on to the storyline that a very conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat were really practically the same on the issues .
And lo and behold , it ’s starting ( via dday ) .
As a numbers guy , I ’m particularly upset that the piece contains this assertion :
With a Republican president experiencing some of the worst approval ratings ever , it ’s no shock that the party opted for an unusually centrist candidate .
Look , there are ways to assess politicians ’ position on the left - right scale .
Ignore the National Journal , which has a somewhat subjective method , and always manages to find that the current Democratic candidate is an ultra-liberal .
Instead , we can turn to the Poole - Rosenthal - McCarty analysis , which is based on a systematic , no fiddling technique using rollcall votes .
And they tell us that , based on his voting record , McCain is the eighth most conservative member of the current Senate .
That ’s right : he ’s been voting on the right wing of the Republican party .
But has he just moved right to curry favor with the GOP base ?
No : he was the second most conservative member of the previous Senate .
Add : Barack Obama , by contrast , while more liberal than the average Democrat , is considerably closer to the center than McCain .
What Is the Future of Suburbia ?
A Freakonomics Quorum
On a forum at the Chicago outpost of City - Data.com , a certain JohnDoe2008 asked suburbanites :
Why do you like suburbs over [ the ] city ?
Be honest please , I never understood it , still do n’t .
I might have serious problems , because I hate even looking at pictures of suburbs .
Respondents cited backyards , quiet and cheap living , and congestion - free commutes — the very sort of suburban characteristics that have started to change due to higher gas prices , more single - person households , and even refugees .
What will the future hold for suburbs ?
In an interesting article about Clifton Park , a suburb of Albany , N.Y. , that has swollen mightily in past decades ( and where I , during one long , hot summer , helped build new houses ) , here ’s what a local architect and urban planner , Dominick Ranieri , thinks may happen to suburbia : “ If we do n’t change the patterns , we ’re in for a long and slow and arduous collapse . ”
Several months ago , we ran a quorum here about urbanization , pegged to the fact that more than half of the world ’s population now lives in cities .
Given the economic changes of the past several months , particularly those in the housing market and in energy prices , it seemed like a good idea to run a new quorum on suburbia , even if it might cover some of the same ground .
( Indeed , we even invited two participants from the first quorum to respond to this one as well . )
So we gathered up a group of smart people — James Kunstler , Thomas Antus , Jan Brueckner , Gary Gates , John Archer , Alan Berube , and Lawrence Levy — and asked them the following :
What will U.S. suburbs look like in 40 years ?
Their answers are informative and often fascinating .
As always , Kunstler is vastly entertaining as he advocates what one critic calls “ apocalyptic utopianism , ” while Antus gets a bit Swiftian on us .
Brueckner and Archer are far more measured ( and , if I had to lay money on the future , closer to reality ) , although Archer borders on his own utopianism .
Gates takes a surprising and compelling angle , Levy is brutally realistic , and Berube is prescriptive in a way that I wish political candidates could learn to be .
I hope you enjoy their replies , and learn from them , as much as I have .

“ The suburbs have three destinies , none of them exclusive : as materials salvage , as slums , and as ruins . ”
There are many ways of describing the fiasco of suburbia , but these days I refer to it as the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world .
I say this because American suburbia requires an infinite supply of cheap energy in order to function and we have now entered a permanent global energy crisis that will change the whole equation of daily life .
Having poured a half - century of our national wealth into a living arrangement with no future — and linked our very identity with it — we have provoked a powerful psychology of previous investment that will make it difficult for us to let go , change our behavior , and make other arrangements .
Compounding the problem is the fact that we ditched our manufacturing economy for a suburban sprawl building economy ( a.k.a. “ the housing bubble ” ) , meaning we came to base our economy on building even more stuff with no future .
This is a hell of a problem , since it is at once economic , socio-political , and circumstantial .
Here ’s what I think will happen : First , we are in great danger of mounting a futile campaign to sustain the unsustainable , that is , of defending suburbia at all costs .
In fact , it is already underway .
One symptom of this is that the only subject under discussion about our energy predicament is how can we keep running all our cars by other means .
Even the leading environmentalists talk of little else .
We do n’t get it .
The Happy Motoring era is over .
No combination of “ alt ” fuels — solar , wind , nuclear , tar sands , oil - shale , offshore drilling , used French - fry oil — will allow us to keep running the interstate highway system , Wal - Marts , and Walt Disney World .
The automobile will be a diminishing presence in our lives , whether we like it or not .
Further proof of our obdurate cluelessness in these matters is the absence of any public discussion about restoring the passenger railroad system — even as the airline industry is also visibly dying .
The campaign to sustain suburbia and all its entitlements will result in a tragic squandering of our dwindling resources and capital .
The suburbs have three destinies , none of them exclusive : as materials salvage , as slums , and as ruins .
In any case , the suburbs will lose value dramatically , both in terms of usefulness and financial investment .
Most of the fabric of suburbia will not be “ fixed ” or retrofitted , in particular the residential subdivisions .
They were built badly in the wrong places .
We will have to return to traditional modes of inhabiting the landscape — villages , towns , and cities , composed of walkable neighborhoods and business districts — and the successful ones will have to exist in relation to a productive agricultural hinterland , because petro-agriculture ( as represented by the infamous 3000 - mile Caesar salad ) is also now coming to an end .
Fortunately , we have many under - activated small towns and small cities in favorable locations near waterways .
This will be increasingly important as transport of goods by water regains importance .
We face an epochal demographic shift , but not the one that is commonly expected : from suburbs to big cities .
Rather , we are in for a reversal of the 200 - year - long trend of people moving from the farms and small towns to the big cities .
People will be moving to the smaller towns and smaller cities because they are more appropriately scaled to the limited energy diet of the future .
I believe our big cities will contract substantially — even if they densify back around their old cores and waterfronts .
They are products , largely , of the 20th - century cheap energy fiesta and they will be starved in the decades ahead .
One popular current fantasy I hear often is that apartment towers are the “ greenest ” mode of human habitation .
On the contrary , we will discover that the skyscraper is an obsolete building type , and that cities overburdened with them will suffer a huge liability — Manhattan and Chicago being the primary examples .
Cities composed mostly of suburban - type fabric — Houston , Atlanta , Orlando , et al — will also depreciate sharply .
The process of urban contraction is likely to be complicated by ethnic tensions and social disorder .
As petro-agriculture implodes , we ’ll have to raise our food differently , closer to home , and at a finer and smaller scale .
This new agricultural landscape will be inhabited differently , since farming will require more human attention .
The places that are not able to grow enough food locally are not likely to make it .
Phoenix and Las Vegas will be shadows of what they are now , if they exist at all .
These days , an awful lot of people — the production builders , the realtors — are waiting for the “ bottom ” in the real - estate industry with hopes that the suburban house - building orgy will resume .
They are waiting in vain .
The project of suburbia is over .
We will build no more of it .
Now we ’re stuck with what ’s there .
Sometimes whole societies make unfortunate decisions or go down tragic pathways .
Suburbia was ours .

“ To pay for the expanded services taxes will also increase exponentially to the point where individual pay checks are made payable to the government and deposited directly in the general treasury . ”
In 40 years I could see living in the world ’s largest city , a megalopolis , extending from New York City to Philadelphia and engulfing all of New Jersey .
New Jersey could change the state motto to “ The Overdevelopment State . ”
As we already have more cars per square mile than any other state , we could change the shape of the license plates from a rectangle to the outline of a car .
Government services such as police , fire , health , and public works will increase exponentially .
To pay for the expanded services , taxes will also increase exponentially to the point where individual paychecks are made payable to the government and deposited directly in the general treasury .
All individuals will have to use credit cards for all living expenses , going into massive debt and having to work until they are 90 years old , thus saving our Social Security system .
With a massive increase in the population density there will be a traffic light on every single corner .
Smart individuals will have seen this coming and invested heavily in the firms that manufacture and install traffic lights , creating a new class of wealthy Americans ( the “ stop light rich ” ) .
Developers wo n’t be impacted by the megalopolis as they rival Bill Gates in wealth and purchase the entire state of Wyoming .
The first act of the new Wyoming legislature will be to abolish development so the developers can live in peace and quiet .

“ If [ gentrification ] continues in a significant way , large numbers of suburban households looking for urban stimulation may end up switching places with minority central - city dwellers , stirring the ethnic pot in both places . ”
Urban economics tells us that cheap gas , lots of investment in highways , and rising incomes created the suburbs that we now see in American cities .
The first two forces made it affordable and convenient to commute from far out , and greater affluence made people covet big houses , which can be built for less on inexpensive suburban land .
Lately , these suburbanization forces are being reversed by “ gentrification , ” with well - off , empty - nester households lured back to city centers by improving urban amenities ( restaurants , museums , etc. ) and the renewal of crumbling downtown housing stocks .
Over the next 40 years , these forces will continue to operate , with some new twists thrown in .
Skyrocketing gas prices will lead some households to reconsider their long commutes , introducing an “ anti-suburbanization ” force that favors denser , more compact cities .
Boosts in auto fuel economy will soften this blow , but the push for suburbanization will nevertheless slow .
Urban densification will also mean a different look for some of our neighborhoods : single - story ranch houses , the hallmarks of past suburbanization , will increasingly give way to denser , two - story suburbs , as is already happening in many cities where land prices are high .
Suburbanization has shown a white bias , with most minority households yet to acquire their nice house in the suburbs .
Some of this difference may reflect a history of housing - market discrimination , but lower suburbanization by minorities is mainly a result of lower incomes .
As the black and Hispanic middle classes continue to grow and get richer , they are likely to follow the same suburbanization path as white households before them , restrained somewhat by higher gas prices .
So U.S. suburbs 40 years hence will look much more ethnically diverse than they do today .
Although some cities , such as Chicago , have seen dramatic recent gentrification , the future path of this phenomenon remains unclear .
If it continues in a significant way , large numbers of suburban households looking for urban stimulation may end up switching places with minority central - city dwellers , stirring the ethnic pot in both places .

“ The Will and Grace version of gay America — urban , wealthy , and white — is starting to look a bit dated . ”
While Ward and June Cleaver and their two boys might still be around in the suburbs in forty years , my guess is that their neighbors will be Olivia and Harriet and their twin girls .
The Will and Grace version of gay America — urban , wealthy , and white — is starting to look a bit dated .
Suburban locales like Decatur , Georgia ( Atlanta ) , Takoma Park , Maryland ( Washington , D.C. ) , and Ferndale , Michigan ( Detroit ) , are joining urban neighborhoods like Castro , Chelsea , and West Hollywood as gay meccas .
Lots of lesbians and gay men now view the suburban home with a white picket fence and a family with 2.5 kids as their version of gay equality .
In 1982 , Gallup found that only 32 percent of Americans considered homosexuality to be an acceptable “ alternative lifestyle . ”
Their 2008 poll shows the figure at 57 percent .
With greater social acceptance , gay people are coming out of the closet , and many are doing so outside of urban America .
From 2000 to 2006 , the number of same - sex couples in Montana , Wyoming , Iowa , and Utah increased by more than 140 percent .
That ’s nearly five times higher than the national increase in same - sex couples and 23 times higher than the general population increase .
Since there ’s little evidence of a mass migration of gay folk to Montana , these big increases probably reflect more willingness of lesbians and gay men to be visible in the heartland .
Not surprisingly then , the proportion of same - sex couples living in large cities has been halved from 45 percent in 1990 to only 23 percent in 2006 .
Houses are a lot cheaper in Ottumwa than Manhattan .
Perhaps that explains why home - ownership rates among same - sex couples have increased from 52 percent in 1990 to 70 percent in 2006 .
With marriage now available to same - sex couples in Massachusetts and California , lesbian and gay couples are making it legal — more than 11,000 in Massachusetts so far and an estimated 5,000 just in the first week it was possible in California .
Suburbs , home ownership , and marriage — what ’s left but the kids ?
In 1990 , fewer than one in ten same - sex couples had children .
Today , it ’s more like one in five .
In states like Mississippi , South Dakota , Alaska , South Carolina , and Louisiana , it ’s one in three .
The gay - by boom is alive and well in small town and suburban America .
And these new parents are largely non-white .
African - American and Latino / a lesbians and gay men are two to three times more likely than their white counterparts to be raising kids .
So back to the question at hand — my vision of suburbia circa 2050 .
Lesbian and gay families will be a much more visible community fixture .
They ’ll probably be married , own their homes , be raising a few kids , and will very likely not be white .

“ Suburbia will be flexible , it will be smarter , and it will be hybrid . ”
First of all , forget the personal helicopters .
Frank Lloyd Wright promised them to us in the 1930’s , and the Jetsons reinforced the idea in the 1950 ’s , but they are one futuristic vision of suburbia whose proponents just got it wrong .
Nevertheless they do embody fundamental aspects of suburbia that are going to persist well into the future , as they are endemic to Western , and now global , society .
Modern suburbia evolved in the early eighteenth century along with Enlightenment ideals of private selfhood and capitalist economics .
As such , suburbia — not the city — became , and remains , the perfect social and geographic apparatus for bringing fundamental ideals and principles of our culture to fruition , for better or worse .
Ideals of privacy , property , and selfhood — overoptimistically embodied — in those helicopters , are splendidly realized in the single nuclear - family detached house , set in its private surrounding yard .
And no matter the threats of global warming or energy shortages , the solutions that we pursue are going to adhere to those ideals .
Nevertheless , as we look to the future , suburbia is evolving in three key directions — not incidentally , along the same paths already being paved by global capitalism ; suburbia will be flexible , it will be smarter , and it will be hybrid .
For example : one of the troublesome consequences of the tract - house boom of the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s is that the housing stock of that era no longer suits current needs and desires .
Except in the most expensive housing markets it is economically unrealistic to retrofit those houses , resulting in worries over the rise of suburban slums .
There is , however , an optimistic vision .
With advanced methods of modular construction and individualized product design , suburbia , like capital , will learn to be flexible : instead of holding the same shape for 60 years , at the mercy of demographic shifts and mortgage - finance crises , houses can become resizable and reconfigurable to suit residents ’ changing needs .
Neighborhoods will evolve , instead of turning over , thus enhancing community and social capital .
Planning will become flexible as well , so that infrastructure of all scales can smartly adapt to changing demographics and advancing energy , water , transportation , and other technologies .
Again , the flexibility of capital as an investment will be registered in the form of more flexible real - estate instruments — which , as different clusters and neighborhoods evolve in different ways over time , will afford more occasions for aesthetic and demographic diversity .
As many “ new urbanist ” and “ new suburbanist ” projects demonstrate , suburbia is becoming a hybrid place that melds desirable traits of city living ( activity , diversity ) while still maintaining allegiance to primary suburban ideals of selfhood and domesticity ( and , one might add , consumption ) .
Still to be realized , but now on the horizon , are greater opportunities for aesthetic hybridity .
Left behind will be master planning codes that leave critics complaining about the aridity of suburbia .
In part motivated by the continual need to adapt to ever greener technologies , as well as the need to make “ smarter ” capital investments , Americans may well realize the advantages of a more adventurous range of housing types , scales , styles , colors , landscaping , and so forth , in any given locale .
One of the least recognized truths about suburbia is that it has always been more extensively segregated by class than it has by race .
Affording the flexibility to make local modifications in response to changing desires and conditions can result in a more dynamic and diverse aesthetic that , instead of eventually becoming old and tired , sustains healthy growth and change for the person , family , and community alike .
Alan Berube , research director and fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution , which he joined in 2001 .
“ … in 40 years perhaps we ’ll get beyond our fixation with “ the suburbs ” ( love them or hate them ) and develop a richer vocabulary for what lies beyond the city limits . ”
In 40 years , “ the suburbs ” wo n’t exist .
With all their current heterogeneity and further changes on the horizon , chances are we ’ll have retired the phrase from popular lexicon by 2050 .
That ’s not because they ’ll depopulate — the nation will need to accommodate at least another 100 million people during this period , and not even $ 10 - per- gallon gas will send the majority of Americans scrambling back to cities .
But “ suburbia ” will be an even less useful descriptor in 2050 for the diverse range of communities in which the majority of Americans will continue to live .
An educated guess at what we ’re likely to see : New physical forms .
Just as America ’s first suburbs sprouted up along the streetcar lines built in the early 20th century , the first half of the 21st century will see the growth of “ light rail suburbs ” ( even in areas that do n’t have the rail yet ) .
High oil prices and the imperative to address global climate change will help spur denser residential development along transit corridors outside of cities .
We ’d see more of it today , if supply kept up with demand .
Chris Leinberger estimates that walkable suburban communities served by transit today command anywhere from a 40 percent to 200 percent price premium over conventional drivable suburban development .
New demographic profiles .
Suburbs of 2050 will be a far cry from the Ozzie and Harriet communities a century before .
Already , most immigrants in the nation ’s newer gateways — metro areas like Sacramento , Charlotte , Minneapolis , and Washington — skip the city and head directly for suburban communities .
These regions boast a far - flung ethnic patchwork , with a tremendous diversity of national origin groups .
Meanwhile , as the Baby Boom generation “ ages in place , ” the suburbs of several major metro areas are projected to have larger elderly population shares than their cities by 2030 .
And even today , there are more poor Americans living in the suburbs of major metro areas than in cities .
New governance .
Diversifying populations and changing infrastructure needs will demand a less parochial , more regional approach to public decision making .
Small suburban jurisdictions can’t finance and manage transit systems , public hospitals , or affordable housing on their own .
A move toward more metropolitan collaboration on these issues , borne of economic necessity , may further blur the traditional political boundaries that define suburbs .
“ Suburbia ” is an oppositional concept — in Latin , it ’s literally “ under city . ”
But as the people and places that define suburbia look more and more like those we associate with the city , and less and less like one another — in 40 years perhaps we ’ll get beyond our fixation with “ the suburbs ” ( love them or hate them ) and develop a richer vocabulary for what lies beyond the city limits .

Part Four : Catallactics or Economics of the ... > Chapter XV .
The Market
All civilizations have up to now been based on private ownership of the means of production .
In the past civilization and private property have been linked together .
Those who maintain that economics is an experimental science and nevertheless recommend public control of the means of production , lamentably contradict themselves .
If historical experience could teach us anything , it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization .
There is no experience to the effect that socialism could provide a standard of living as high as that provided by capitalism .
The system of market economy has never been fully and purely tried .
But there prevailed in the orbit of Western civilization since the Middle Ages by and large a general tendency toward the abolition of institutions hindering the operation of the market economy .
With the successive progress of this tendency , population figures multiplied [ p. 265 ] and the masses ' standard of living was raised to an unprecedented and hitherto undreamed of level .
The average American worker enjoys amenities for which Croesus , Crassus , the Medici , and Louis XIV would have envied him .
The problems raised by the socialist and interventionist critique of the market economy are purely economic and can be dealt with only in the way in which this book tries to deal with them : by a thorough analysis of human action and all thinkable systems of social cooperation .
The psychological problem of why people scorn and disparage capitalism and call everything they dislike " capitalistic " and everything they praise " socialistic " concerns history and must be left to the historians .
But there are several other issues which we must stress at this point .
The advocates of totalitarianism consider " capitalism " a ghastly evil , an awful illness that came upon mankind .
In the eyes of Marx it was an inevitable stage of mankind 's evolution , but for all that the worst of evils ; fortunately salvation is imminent and will free man forever from this disaster .
In the opinion of other people it would have been possible to avoid capitalism if only men had been more moral or more skillful in the choice of economic policies .
All such lucubrations have one feature in common .
They look upon capitalism as if it were an accidental phenomenon which could be eliminated without altering conditions that are essential in civilized man 's acting and thinking .
As they neglect to bother about the problem of economic calculation , they are not aware of the consequences which the abolition of the monetary calculus is bound to bring about .
They do not realize that socialist men for whom arithmetic will be of no use in planning action , will differ entirely in their mentality and in their mode of thinking from our contemporaries .
In dealing with socialism , we must not overlook this mental transformation , even if we were ready to pass over in silence the disastrous consequences which would result for man 's material well - being .
The market economy is a man-made mode of acting under the division of labor .
But this does not imply that it is something accidental or artificial and could be replaced by another mode .
The market economy is the product of a long evolutionary process .
It is the outcome of man 's endeavors to adjust his action in the best possible way to the given conditions of his environment that he cannot alter .
It is the strategy , as it were , by the application of which man has triumphantly progressed from savagery to civilization .
Some authors argue : Capitalism was the economic system which brought about the marvelous achievements of the last two hundred years ; therefore it is done for because what was beneficial in the past [ p. 266 ] cannot be so for our time and for the future .
Such reasoning is in open contradiction to the principles of experimental cognition .
There is no need at this point to raise again the question of whether or not the science of human action can adopt the methods of the experimental natural sciences .
Even if it were permissible to answer this question in the affirmative , it would be absurd to argue as these a rebours experimentalists do .
Experimental science argues that because a was valid in the past , it will be valid in the future too .
It must never argue the other way round and assert that because a was valid in the past , it is not valid in the future .
It is customary to blame the economists for an alleged disregard of history .
The economists , it is contended , consider the market economy as the ideal and eternal pattern of social cooperation .
They concentrate their studies upon investigating the conditions of the market economy and neglect everything else .
They do not bother about the fact that capitalism emerged only in the last two hundred years and that even today it is restricted to a comparatively small area of the earth 's surface and to a minority of peoples .
There were and are , say these critics , other civilizations with a different mentality and different modes of conducting economic affairs .
Capitalism is , when seen sub specie aeternitatis , a passing phenomenon , an ephemeral stage of historical evolution , just the transition from precapitalistic ages to a postcapitalistic future .
All these criticisms are spurious .
Economics is , of course , not a branch of history or of any other historical science .
It is the theory of all human action , the general science of the immutable categories of action and of their operation under all thinkable special conditions under which man acts .
It provides as such the indispensable mental tool for dealing with historical and ethnographic problems .
A historian or an ethnographer who neglects in his work to take full advantage of the results of economics is doing a poor job .
In fact he does not approach the subject matter of his research unaffected by what he disregards as theory .
He is at every step of his gathering of allegedly unadulterated facts , in arranging these facts , and in his conclusions derived from them , guided by confused and garbled remnants of perfunctory economic doctrines constructed by botchers in the centuries preceding the elaboration of an economic science and long since entirely exploded .
The analysis of the problems of the market society , the only pattern of human action in which calculation can be applied in planning action , opens access to the analysis of all thinkable modes of action and of all economic problems with which historians and ethnographers are confronted .
All noncapitalistic methods of economic [ p. 267 ] management can be studied only under the hypothetical assumption that in them too cardinal numbers can be used in recording past action and planning future action .
This is why economists place the study of the pure market economy in the center of their investigations .
It is not the economists who lack the " historical sense " and ignore the factor of evolution , but their critics .
The economists have always been fully aware of the fact that the market economy is the product of a long historical process which began when the human race emerged from the ranks of the other primates .
The champions of what is mistakenly called " historicism " are intent upon undoing the effects of evolutionary changes .
In their eyes everything the existence of which they cannot trace back to a remote past or cannot discover in the customs of some primitive Polynesian tribes is artificial , even decadent .
They consider the fact that an institution was unknown to savages as a proof of its uselessness and rottenness .
Marx and Engels and the Prussian professors of the Historical School exulted when they learned that private property is " only " a historical phenomenon .
For them this was the proof that their socialist plans were realizable .
The creative genius is at variance with his fellow citizens .
As the pioneer of things new and unheard of he is in conflict with their uncritical acceptance of traditional standards and values .
In his eyes the routine of the regular citizen , the average or common man , is simply stupidity .
For him " bourgeois " is a synonym of imbecility [ p. 268 ] .
The frustrated artists who take delight in aping the genius 's mannerism in order to forget and to conceal their own impotence adopt this terminology .
These Bohemians call everything they dislike " bourgeois . "
Since Marx has made the term " capitalist " equivalent to " bourgeois , " they use both words synonymously .
In the vocabularies of all languages the words " capitalistic " and " bourgeois " signify today all that is shameful , degrading , and infamous .
Contrariwise , people call all that they deem good and praiseworthy " socialist . "
The regular scheme of arguing is this ; A man arbitrarily calls anything he dislikes " capitalistic , " and then deduces from this appellation that the thing is bad .
This semantic confusion goes still further .
Sismondi , the romantic eulogists of the Middle Ages , all socialist authors , the Prussian Historical School , and the American Institutionalists taught that capitalism is an unfair system of exploitation sacrificing the vital interests of the majority of people for the sole benefit of a small group of profiteers .
No decent man can advocate this " mad " system .
The economists who contend that capitalism is beneficial not only to a small group but to everyone are " sycophants of the bourgeoisie . "
They are either too dull to recognize the truth or bribed apologists of the selfish class interests of the exploiters .
Capitalism , in the terminology of these foes of liberty , democracy , and the market economy , means the economic policy advocated by big business and millionaires .
Confronted with the fact that some -- but certainly not all - wealthy entrepreneurs and capitalists nowadays favor measures restricting free trade and competition and resulting in monopoly , they say : Contemporary capitalism stands for protectionism , cartels , and the abolition of competition .
It is true , they add , that at a definite period of the past British capitalism favored free trade both on the domestic market and in international relations .
This was because at that time the class interests of the British bourgeoisie were best served by such a policy .
Conditions , however , changed and today capitalism , i.e. , the doctrine advocated by the exploiters , aims at another policy .
It has already been pointed out that this doctrine badly distorts both economic theory and historical facts .
There were and there will always be people whose selfish ambitions demand protection for vested interests and who hope to derive advantage from measures restricting competition .
Entrepreneurs grown old and tired and the decadent heirs of people who succeeded in the past dislike the agile [ p. 269 ] parvenus who challenge their wealth and their eminent social position .
Whether or not their desire to make economic conditions rigid and to hinder improvements can be realized , depends on the climate of public opinion .
The ideological structure of the nineteenth century , as fashioned by the prestige of the teachings of the liberal economists , rendered such wishes vain .
When the technological improvements of the age of liberalism revolutionized the traditional methods of production , transportation , and marketing , those whose vested interests were hurt did not ask for protection because it would have been a hopeless venture .
But today it is deemed a legitimate task of government to prevent an efficient man from competing with the less efficient .
Public opinion sympathizes with the demands of powerful pressure groups to stop progress .
The butter producers are with considerable success fighting against margarine and the musicians against recorded music .
The labor unions are deadly foes of every new machine .
It is not amazing that in such an environment less efficient businessmen aim at protection against more efficient competitors .
It would be correct to describe this state of affairs in this way : Today many or some groups of business are no longer liberal ; they do not advocate a pure market economy and free enterprise , but , on the contrary , are asking for various measures of government interference with business .
But it is entirely misleading to say that the meaning of the concept of capitalism has changed and that " mature capitalism " -- as the American Institutionalists call it -- or " late capitalism " -- as the Marxians call it -- is characterized by restrictive policies to protect the vested interests of wage earners , farmers , shopkeepers , artisans , and sometimes also of capitalists and entrepreneurs .
The concept of capitalism is as an economic concept immutable ; if it means anything , it means the market economy .
One deprives oneself of the semantic tools to deal adequately with the problems of contemporary history and economic policies if one acquiesces in a different terminology .
This faulty nomenclature becomes understandable only if we realize that the pseudo - economists and the politicians who apply it want to prevent people from knowing what the market economy really is .
They want to make people believe that all the repulsive manifestations of restrictive government policies are produced by " capitalism . "
The missionary working periodically with Ioan paid him a recent visit , and shares this report and these photos :
" I went back to see Ioan Tudor last Saturday .
It had been just a few days short of one year exactly since I had first seen him .
Seeing him left no question that he was much better , and that is an understatement .
What they did to him in the hospital , and why , I am sorry to say I think will be left as a bit of mystery — but one that I will continue to look for answers to .
The doctors in Bucharest did skin grafts on the palms of his hands and I think you will be able to see that in the pictures .
He has good use of his right hand but the last two fingers of his left hand have limited mobility .
As to his feet , ankles , and the back of his hands , he said they did not do any surgery — though he is scheduled to return to the hospital in this upcoming week for skin grafts on the backs of his hands .
As to the dramatic changes in his feet , ankles and back of his hands , he is unaware that they did anything besides soak his feet , ankles and back of his hands with a solution which he thought was Betadine .
I am sorry that I can not tell you more but there in no other sign of invasive care , I suspect that he was soaked in something more like 3 WEA ( phenyl mercuric nitrate ) and he promises to get me one of the empty bottles .
When I used this on him last year there was a noticeable change in the growths .
But this then makes me wonder why they did the skin grafts on his palms when such a dramatic change came with only soaking ?
If you have any questions I will try to answer but as if often the case here , Ioan does not seem to know very much about what happened to him . "

It was dispelled Wednesday by Adm .
Mike Mullen , who repeatedly made clear that he opposes an attack on Iran â€ ” whether by Israel or his own forces â€ ” and , moreover , favors dialogue with Tehran .
While various media have printed or run excerpts of his press conference , I think it might be useful to post virtually all of his remarks regarding Iran just to illustrate how clear he was :
[ In his opening statement , he says ] â€ œI will say this , however : My position with regard to the Iranian regime hasnâ€™t changed .
They remain a destabilizing factor in the region , and thatâ€™s evident and actually more evident when one visits .
But Iâ€™m convinced a solution still lies in using other elements of national power to change Iranian behavior , including diplomatic , financial and international pressure .
There is a need for better clarity , even dialogue at some level.â€ 
[ In response to a question about his discussions with his counterpart in Israel during his recent visit there , he says ] â€ œCertainly , the concern about Iran continues to exist .
And you talk about the nuclear threat .
And I believe theyâ€™re still on a path to get to nuclear weapons and I think thatâ€™s something that needs to be deterred .
They are â€ ” and I talk about my time up on the border .
They are very involved with Syria , very involved with Hezbollah , supporting Hamas .
And so the network that they support is also a very dangerous one and a very destabilizing one.â€ 
[ Asked about what the consequences of an Israeli strike on Iran and how the Iranians would react , he says ] â€ œWell , I â€ ¦donâ€™t want to speculate in that regard .
Clearly , there is a very broad concern about the stability level â€ ” the overall stability level in the Middle East .
Iâ€™ve been pretty clear before that from the United Statesâ€™ perspective , the United Statesâ€™ military perspective in particular , that opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful on us .
That doesnâ€™t mean we donâ€™t have capacity or reserve , but that would really be very challenging .
And also the consequences of that sometimes are very difficult to predict .
â€ œSo I think that , you know , just about every move in that part of the world is a high - risk move .
And thatâ€™s why I think itâ€™s so important that the international piece , the financial piece , the diplomatic piece , the economic piece be brought to bear with a level of intensity that resolves this .â€ 
[ Asked whether he was suggesting that an Israeli attack would drag the U.S. into a military confrontation with Iran , he says ] â€ œIâ€™m not specifically again speculating about what the consequences of any action would be .
It is a very , very broad , and what has been enduring for a while , concern about the instability in that part of the world .
And destabilizing acts , destabilizing events are of great concern to me.â€ 
â€œâ€ ¦Iâ€™m really very focused on trying to inject as much stability in that part of the world .
And it is my view that Iran is at the center of what is unstable in that part of the world .
And it reaches all the way , you know , from Tehran to Beirut.â€ 
[ After insisting that U.S. forces could prevent Iran from closing the Straits of Hormuz at least for any sustained period , Mullen is asked to elaborate on what he meant by the need for dialogue and whether it includes military - to - military talks . ] â€ œNo , Iâ€™ve â€ ” when I talk about dialogue â€ ” actually , I would say very broadly , across the entirety of our government and their government , but specifically that would â€¦ need to be led , obviously , politically and diplomatically .
And if it then resulted in a military - to - military dialogue , I think that part of it certainly could add to a better understanding about each other .
But Iâ€™m really focused on the diplomatic aspect.â€ 
â€œâ€
¦We havenâ€™t had much of a dialogue with the Iranians for a long time , and I think if I were just to take the high stakes that â€ ¦I just talked about a minute ago , part of the results of that engagement or lack of engagement , I think , is there .
But as has been pointed out more than once , it takes two people to want to have a dialogue , not just the desire on one part.â€ 
[ Asked whether heâ€™s saying thereâ€™s a need for dialogue between the United States government and the Iranian government , he says ] â€œâ€ ¦I think itâ€™s a broad dialogue .
I think it would cover the full spectrum of international â€ ” and it could very well certainly cover the dialogue between us as well .â€ 
Mullen is actually going further in calling for dialogue than former Centcom Commander Adm.
William â€ œFoxâ€ Fallon did .
And note that thereâ€™s no mention of the current precondition , that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment .
His opposition to any attack by Israel is really quite explicit .
Now , the question is , why did Mullen , who clearly enjoys the backing of his boss , Pentagon chief Robert Gates , go as far as he went in his remarks ?
Is it simply an effort to tamp down rising tensions ( and oil prices ) set off the threats and counter - threats of the last few weeks , as even the White House seemed inclined to do , particularly in the wake of Israelâ€™s well - advertised exercises last month and the publication of Sy Hershâ€™s New Yorker article over the weekend ?
Does it reflect real concern that Israel may indeed be preparing to attack unilaterally or that the hawks are gaining ground in their push for an attack before the the administration leaves office ?
Or does it reflect confidence that the realists are in control and that now , particularly in light of indications this past week that the Iranians may be prepared to conditionally accept the latest 5+1 offer , is the moment to push for serious engagement ?
I think itâ€™s still too early to tell , but the message behind these remarks is pretty clear : the Pentagon brass are firmly opposed to military action .
Visit Lobelog.com for the latest news analysis and commentary from Inter Press News Service ’s Washington bureau chief Jim Lobe .
The purpose was to gauge their reaction to the company 's plan to raise the amount it charged for in - house day care by 75 percent .
Parents who had been paying $ 1,425 a month for infant care would see their costs rise to nearly $ 2,500 - - well above the market rate .
For parents with toddlers and preschoolers , who were charged less , the price increases were equally eye - popping .
Under the new plan , parents with two kids in Google day care would most likely see their annual day care bill grow to more than $ 57,000 from around $ 33,000 .
At the first of the three focus groups , parents wept openly .
As word leaked out about the company 's plan , the Google parents began to fight back .
They came up with ideas to save money , used the company 's TGIF sessions -- a weekly meeting for anyone who wanted to ask questions of Google 's top executives -- to plead their case , and conducted surveys showing that most parents with children in Google day care would have to leave Google 's facilities and find less expensive child care .
Do you think you know how this story ends ?
You 're probably guessing that because it involves " do no evil " Google , Fortune magazine 's " Best Company to Work For " the past two years , this is a heart - warming tale of a good company reversing a dumb decision .
If only .
Although Google is rolling back its price increase slightly and is phasing in the higher price over five quarters , the outline of the original decision remains largely unchanged .
At a TGIF in June , the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said he had no sympathy for the parents , and that he was tired of " Googlers " who felt entitled to perks like " bottled water and M&Ms , " according to several people in the meeting .
( A Google spokesman denies that Brin made that comment . )
On Monday , Google began the first phase of its new day care plan , letting go of the outside day care firm it had been using .
In recent months , Google has hit the first rough patch in its short , magical life as a public company .
From November to April , Google 's once high - flying stock dropped 44 percent , to $ 412 from $ 744 .
( It has since gained some of that back , closing on Thursday at $ 537 . )
It may be a stretch to equate the day care fiasco with the fall in Google 's stock .
But maybe not .
When a stock was rising as fast as Google 's once was , it was easy to buy the view that there was something truly special about Google .
But when the stock is falling , overlooked problems start to loom large .
Having discovered that Google is not , in fact , the promised land , a number of Googlers have left recently to join start - ups , hotter companies like Facebook -- and even Microsoft .
" There are many things about Google that are not great , and merit improvement , " blogged Sergey Solyanik , who recently returned to Microsoft after a stint at Google .
" There are plenty of silly politics , underperformance , inefficiencies and ineffectiveness , and things that are plain stupid . "
Starting , it would appear , with day care .
Baby steps
Google first began offering day care three and a half years ago , and perhaps it is only coincidence that this occurred not long after a woman named Susan Wojcicki returned to the company from maternity leave .
Ms. Wojcicki is a figure of significant stature at Google ; hers was the garage that Brin and Google 's other founder , Larry Page , rented while starting up Google .
Today she is the company 's vice president for product measurement , though as I discovered in talking to unhappy Google parents this week , not many Googlers seem to know what her exact duties entail .
Everybody , however , knows that she 's Brin 's sister - in - law .
From the start , Wojcicki has been a passionate advocate for Google 's day care efforts , though there is some dispute about how much decision - making authority she has .
Parents who know her point out that the company 's day care approach is very much aligned with her views ; for its part , a Google spokesman insists that " these decisions were not made by her ; they were made by the executive management team . "
Google 's first facility , called the Kinderplex , was run by the Childrens ' Creative Learning Centers , or CCLC , which , according to its Web site , offers " learning in a play - based , developmentally appropriate environment that incorporates a variety of activities and multicultural aspects in a thematic style . "
That sounds perfect for Silicon Valley , does n't it ?
One of CCLC 's longtime Silicon Valley clients , Electronic Arts , sent me an e-mail statement telling me how happy it has been with CCLC 's services .
According to Google , there were numerous complains about CCLC , but the Google parents I spoke to disagree .
They say that at the Kinderplex , teacher - child ratios were low , teachers were first - rate , the facility was clean and upbeat , and the food - - organic , naturally - - was terrific .
But at least one parent was n't happy : Wojcicki .
She is a proponent of a preschool philosophy called Reggio Emilia , the hot kiddie philosophy of the moment , which stresses even small children 's ability to chart their own learning paths .
A year after the Kinderplex opened , Google opened its second day care center , called the Woods , which Google ran itself .
The Woods was an expensive undertaking ; in terms of the square footage per child , the aesthetics of its toys , and the college degrees of its teachers , it put the Kinderplex to shame .
It also used the Reggio Emilia philosophy .
With the Woods open , Google decided to upgrade the Kinderplex to match the salaries and the teacher - student ratios of the Woods .
Google now had 200 day care spots -- and such wonderful day care at that !-- and was promoting this new perk as a recruiting tool .
The company was growing like crazy - - its work force now numbers 19,000 - - its young employees were starting to have babies , and well , you can just picture what happened next .
The wait list ballooned insanely , finally reaching over 700 people .
New employees who arrived at Google thinking they were getting in - house day care were stunned to discover that it could take up to two years to land a coveted spot .
Meanwhile , someone at Google woke up one day and realized that the company was subsidizing each child to the tune of $ 37,000 a year -- which nobody had noticed up until then -- compared with the $ 12,000 - a- year average subsidy of other big Silicon Valley companies like Cisco Systems and Oracle .
Wait list vs. subsidy
Faced with this dilemma , Google decided that the way to solve the dual problems of a too - long wait list and a too - large subsidy was -- are you sitting down for this ?-- to get rid of CCLC and make the Kinderplex more like the Woods .
( Google says it was always planning to replace CCLC . )
Given that decision , the only possible way to reduce the subsidy was to raise prices through the roof .
If you are shaking your head at this point , that 's because you lack the proper understanding of Google 's culture .
Having conquered the Internet , Google 's executives tend to believe that they can do pretty much everything better than everybody else -- even day care .
When I spoke to Laszlo Bock , the company 's vice president for " people operations " ( aka human relations ) , he told me that " what is really driving the cost is eliminating the two - year wait list while focusing on providing really high quality . "
Google can't just have low teacher - child ratios -- it has to have the lowest of anybody .
Its teachers have to be the best .
Its toys have to be the most advanced .
If it costs a lot of money to provide the Greatest Day Care on Earth , well , that 's life .
Plus , the high price of Google day care solves the waiting list problem .
Indeed , getting the waiting list down was a huge priority for Google ; the spokesman told me that forcing people to wait two years for day care was " inequitable . "
And maybe it is .
But parents who talked to me said that several times during the six - week - long day care brouhaha , Brin made comments indicating that he viewed the whole thing as a giant economics experiment .
" This is a supply - and - demand issue , " he told one group of parents -- adding that Google needed to charge what the market would bear .
( Through a Google spokesman , Brin denies making such a statement . )
Given that Google has lots of pre-IPO millionaires , it can clearly charge a lot .
Indeed , at one meeting , Wojcicki , a multimillionaire herself , told the parents that she planned to keep her own children in Google day care , despite the higher cost .
" I 've had firsthand experience with the great care provided by these centers and I want as many other parents as possible to have access to it , " Wojcicki noted in an e-mail message .
Google has also started charging people several hundred dollars to stay on the waiting list ; as a result the list has dropped to around 300 parents .
By next fall , Google plans to open new facilities with another 300 places .
See ?
No more waiting list .
Objects strongly to criticism
Google , I should note , believes that it has handled the day care issue in a " Googly " way and objects strongly to the criticism by the parents .
The company points out that the prices are somewhat lower than originally planned , that it is expanding its day care operation , that its facilities will be state of the art and that it will be giving scholarships to parents who can't afford to keep their children in Google day care .
( Although yet to release the details of the scholarship plan , the company says that employees will have to show proof of household income to qualify . )
But here 's the real problem : providing day care is n't an economics experiment , nor should it be just another Google perk , alongside organic food and free M&Ms .
Day care matters to people 's lives in a way that few other perks do .
There are many people in this country -- including , I 'll bet , many Googlers -- who believe that employer - provided day care , at affordable prices , ought to be like health insurance , a benefit that every company provides as a matter of course .
Yet as the technology blog Valleywag noted recently , Google does n't even advertise day care as a benefit for its employees anymore .
That 's the real shame .
Google may be providing the greatest day care ever , but so what ?
It does n't matter how good the day care is if only its wealthiest employees can afford to use it .
If Google had really wanted to do something path - breaking about its day care crisis , it would have spent less time creating elitist day care centers and more time figuring out how to " scale " day care for everybody no matter what their salaries .
Instead , Google has shown that it thinks about day care the same way every other company does -- as a luxury , not a benefit .
Judging by what 's transpired , that 's what Google is fast becoming : just another company .
BEIJING -- Sports fans from the U.S. and China had cause to celebrate Tuesday , with both sides able to claim that the day 's results left them firmly atop the Olympic medals tables .
And the interesting thing is that both sides were right .
Despite all the high - tech clocks , cameras and sensors , the Olympics still can't give a definitive answer to one basic question :
Who is winning the medals race ?
The reason is due to a divide between the U.S. and the rest of the world .
The U.S. -- actually its media , including The Wall Street Journal -- ranks countries by all the medals a team wins .
At the end of Tuesday 's competition in Beijing , the U.S. tops that table with 22 , versus 20 for China .
The rest of the world ranks countries by golds .
Silver and bronze are used only as tie - breakers .
By that tally , China sat atop the rankings , with 13 gold medals , compared with seven for the U.S. ( Wednesday 's medal events will have added to all these numbers . )
The split has its roots in the early days of the Olympics and reflects the movement 's evolution , from an organization that sought to eliminate nations ' victories over one another to one that celebrates them .
And while it 's primarily a quirky point for most people , the difference in the medal tables arguably has its serious side too .
Some see in the gold - first ranking -- which is unofficially endorsed by the International Olympic Committee -- one reason why countries have become increasingly ruthless in cutting funding for sports where they do n't have a clear shot at a gold .
" The message is that winning is everything , " says James Riordan , emeritus professor of sports history at Surrey University in Britain .
" That 's not the message the Games are supposed to convey .
Why have silvers and bronzes ? "
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr is establishing a new fighting force to battle U.S. - led troops in Iraq , he said in a letter read in Iraqi mosques Friday .
Al - Sadr 's letter said that " the resistance will be exclusively conducted by only one group .
This new group will be defined soon by me . "
Al - Sadr 's militia , the Mehdi Army , has a strong and ubiquitous presence in Shiite cities , towns and neighborhoods .
Sources familiar with al - Sadr said they believe he 's trying to embrace what the U.S. calls " Special Groups " -- Iran - backed Shiite militants , including rogue Mehdi Army members , who have been fighting U.S. - led troops despite a cease - fire that the cleric declared in August .
The mainstream Mehdi Army has operated under the cease - fire , which dramatically reduced violence in Iraq .
During that time , however , there has been fighting between U.S. and Iraqi troops and members of the Mehdi Army , with many of the battles this spring in the southern city of Basra and Baghdad 's Sadr City neighborhood .
In the latest fighting overnight , American - led coalition forces killed five and arrested two Special Groups members near Hilla , south of Baghdad , the U.S. military said .
In the letter , al - Sadr said , " The weapons will be held exclusively by this new group , and they should be pointed exclusively at the occupier , " adding that he will forbid the group " to target anyone else . "
The letter added , " We will not stop resisting the occupation until liberation or martyrdom . "
Al - Sadr is transitioning much of the rest of the Mehdi Army into a civilian movement dealing with " religious , social and cultural affairs , " according to the letter .
That part of the Mehdi Army will not be involved in militancy but will " fight the Western ideology and liberate the minds from domination and globalization . "
The letter said al - Sadr would disown anyone in the Mehdi Army who disobeys his new command .
It was read at mosques affiliated with the cleric 's movement .
Iraqi and Western intelligence sources have said that Iran , over the last few months , has pressured al - Sadr to promote its interests , which include getting the United States out of Iraq .
Al - Sadr 's letter did n't explain why he decided to issue his command .
Meanwhile , Iraqi officials , frustrated by the lack of success in negotiations with the United States over a long - term security agreement , are contemplating a new tack -- pulling out of security talks and developing their own legislation that would dictate the shape of the American military presence in Iraq .
Haidar Abadi , an aide to Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , announced the move in remarks Thursday .
The talks have sparked concern among Iraqis that a bilateral security pact will compromise their country 's sovereignty .
The United States has said it hopes to secure a status of forces agreement by the end of July .
At present , a U.N. mandate governs the American military presence through the end of the year .
CNN 's Michael Ware , Saad Abedine and Yousif Bassil contributed to this report .

I ’ve just bought an excellent book called Invention of Hysteria which is about how the use of photography by the 19th century French neurologist Jean - Martin Charcot helped shape the our concepts of ‘ hysteria ‘ – a disorder where psychological disturbances manifest themselves as what seem like neurological symptoms .
Such patients would today be diagnosed with ‘ conversion disorder ’ , usually after presenting to a neurology clinic with paralysis , blindness or epilepsy , only for it to be found that there is no damage to any of the areas you might expect or no seizure activity in the brain during a ‘ fit ’ .
Importantly , the patients are n’t ‘ faking ’ , they genuinely experience themselves as paralysed , blind , or otherwise impaired .
What recent research suggests is that there may be a disturbance in higher level brain function which may be suppressing normal actions or sensation .
To use a business analogy , none of the workers are on strike but the management is causing problems so the work ca n’t be carried out .
Charcot revived interest in this disorder through his weekly , somewhat theatrical , case demonstrations , and , as the book discusses , through some striking and equally theatrical photos and illustrations .
This wonderfully illustrated book examines the history of Charcot ’s work at the Salp√™tri√®re , the famous Paris hospital , and how the newly developed technology of photography played a key role in popularising the disorder and shaping our ideas about hysteria .
In the last few decades of the nineteenth century , the Salp√™tri√®re was what it had always been : a kind of feminine inferno , a citta dolorosa confining four thousand incurable or mad women .
It was a nightmare in the midst of Paris ‚Äôs Belle Epoque .
This is where Charcot rediscovered hysteria .
I attempt to retrace how he did so , amidst all the various clinical and experimental procedures , through hypnosis and the spectacular presentations of patients having hysterical attacks in the amphitheater where he held his famous Tuesday Lectures .
With Charcot we discover the capacity of the hysterical body , which is , in fact , prodigious .
It is prodigious ; it surpasses the imagination , surpasses ‚ Äúall hopes , ‚Äù as they say .
Whose imagination ?
Whose hopes ?
There ‚Äôs the rub .
What the hysterics of the Salp√™tri√®re could exhibit with their bodies betokens an extraordinary complicity between patients and doctors , a relationship of desires , gazes , and knowledge .
This relationship is interrogated here .
What still remains with us is the series of images of the Iconographie photographique de la Salp√™tri√®re .
It contains everything : poses , attacks , cries , ‚ Äúattitudes passionnelles , ‚Äù ‚ Äúcrucifixions , ‚Äù ‚ Äúecstasy , ‚Äù and all the postures of delirium .
If everything seems to be in these images , it is because photography was in the ideal position to crystallize the link between the fantasy of hysteria and the fantasy of knowledge .
A reciprocity of charm was instituted between physicians , with their insatiable desire for images of Hysteria , and hysterics , who willingly participated and actually raised the stakes through their increasingly theatricalized bodies .
In this way , hysteria in the clinic became the spectacle , the invention of hysteria .
Indeed , hysteria was covertly identified with something like an art , close to theater or painting .
The book ’s website has the first chapter freely available , but sadly none of the photos .
Most of Charcot ’s books , containing many of the wonderful illustrations and photos , are listed on Google Books but for some reason I can’t work out , you ca n’t view the pages .
As they were published in the late 1800s , they should be well out of copyright , so its a bit frustrating we can’t read them .
To give you an idea , however , the illustration on the left is the ‘ Grande Hysterie Full Arch ’ , one of Charcot ’s classifications of hysterical epilepsy .
This is one of Charcot ’s many illustrations of amazing bodily contortions that was used as inspiration by the famed and somewhat eccentric French sculptor Louise Bourgeois , as you can see in a ( possibly NSFW ? ) article on her work from the Tate magazine .

The New York Times ran a huge ( huge ! ) A1 investigative piece on John McCain and his weird gambling obsession and ties to the Indian Casino industry and Vegas and lobbyists and ten thousand other things yesterday .
It was well - reported , historical in focus , and fair .
It ran on the front page of the Sunday edition , which reaches almost half a million more readers than the weekday edition .
But , you know , no one is talking about it .
It did n't really stick !
Did anyone read the whole thing ?
Were there bombshells ?
Who knows !
What happened ?
The Times sabotaged itself , either intentionally or through ineptitude .
Allow us to explain .
Times editor Bill Keller complains a lot these days about how no one pays enough attention to the Times and their big stories .
He blames the internet and a million competing voices for distracting people from the Important Work of Times journalists .
He 's sorta right !
Gone are the days when the Times set the agenda for the national press .
Though the slow death of newspapers across the nation has been beneficial to the Times in one important way : they 're the only national paper , effectively .
A Times investigation reaches more of the country than a Washington Post investigation .
So one would expect a story of this size and seeming heft would make a big splash .
But it did n't !
Drudge did n't play it up — though as we move closer to the election , he regresses even more to his natural Republican hackdom , so they should n't have expected a push from him .
And the liberals have no one coherent answer to Drudge , just a million sites trying desperately to push their own often competing agendas .
Kos , Talking Points Memo , and the Huffington Post all share an elitist coastal liberal bias and huge audiences , but very different methods of achieving their goals and working the media refs .
But on the other hand ... the way the Times dropped the story seems self - defeating .
Front page of the Sunday edition , sure .
But it went online Saturday night .
So by the time Monday morning rolls around , it seems ancient , even though no one actually talked about it over the weekend .
Furthermore , it came right after a presidential debate , right before a hugely anticipated vice presidential debate , and right in the midst of a gigantic economic crisis and a desperate attempt by Congress to prevent another Great Depression .
The Times should 've had the story go live online on Thursday night ( in time for it to be an issue in the debates ! ) , they should 've leaked salient details to Drudge beforehand , or they should 've waited until the bailout negotiations collapsed or succeeded .
The fact that they did none of those things indicates to us that they did n't actually want this story to blow up .
Maybe there 's nothing actually to it ( though the bit where McCain helped take down Jack Abramoff because he was the competition to McCain 's preferred lobbyists seems a bit juicy , right ? ) or maybe they 've actually been cowed by the McCain campaigns attacks on their credibility , or maybe they just do n't know what the hell they 're doing .
Now , for your edification , some interesting bits from the 100 - page Times piece on John McCain 's gambling addiction :
John McCain used the Abramoff investigation to personally attack Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed , two conservative activists who helped destroy McCain 's 2000 campaign .
" Inside the investigation , the sense of schadenfreude was palpable , according to several people close to the senator . "
McCain helped invent the Indian Casino industry with a 1988 law he drafted with Mo Udall .
In 2005 or so , after Abramoff and before his current run for the presidency , McCain declared Indian gambling " out of control " and began declaring the need to restrain the industry .
McCain does lots of favors for lobbyists , all the time , like every other Senator .
" In Connecticut that year , when a tribe was looking to open the state ’s third casino , staff members on the Indian Affairs Committee provided guidance to lobbyists representing those fighting the casino , e-mail messages and interviews show .
The proposed casino , which would have cut into the Pequots ’ market share , was opposed by Mr. McCain ’s colleagues in Connecticut . "
Update :
Two more points we missed !
The McCain camp began attacking the Times for no real reason last week .
They , uh , probably saw this story coming .
Did their preemptive attacks cause the paper to bury this piece or cause people to assume the story was biased and discount it ?
Well , the McCain campaign 's media strategy has been desperate and stupid for a month now , so we do n't think they have enough muscle to bury this themselves .
But point two , from a reader :
or maybe it was just a lousy lede .
Five paragraphs in and facing the decision on whether to continue on to page A4 ( or whatever page it was continued on ) all the reader knew was that John McCain liked to gamble and did exactly that back in 2001 .
Not exactly compelling stuff and certainly not compelling enough to follow the story into the bowels of section A1 .
Yes .
The " McCain gambling at 3 a.m. " story was a great atmospheric lede , but it had nothing to do with the news in the story .
A wiser editing decision might 've been to play up the Abramoff stuff , way more , up top , in easy - to - understand language .
" John McCain 's lead role in the Abramoff investigations may have been driven by personal animus and the influence of other lobbyists , documents and emails show . "
You know , like that , but better .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain defended his campaign Thursday for saying that Sen. Barack Obama is playing the race card .
Sen. Barack Obama says Sen. John McCain offers a continuation of failed policies .
McCain 's campaign manager charged that Obama falsely accused the McCain campaign of injecting race into the presidential contest .
Asked by CNN's John King whether that was fair criticism , McCain said it was .
" I 'm sorry to say that it is .
It 's legitimate .
And there 's no place in this campaign for that .
There 's no place for it , and we should n't be doing it , " he said in Racine , Wisconsin .
The Obama campaign has denied the accusation , but McCain said , " I 'll let the American people judge . "
Watch McCain 's interview with John King »
In a statement earlier Thursday , McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said , " Barack Obama has played the race card , and he played it from the bottom of the deck .
It 's divisive , negative , shameful and wrong . "
The charge came one day after Obama alluded to his race during several stops in Missouri .
An Obama spokesman immediately denied the assertion but noted that the presumptive Democratic nominee believes that the McCain campaign was " using the same old low - road politics to distract voters from the real issues . "
" This is a race about big challenges : a slumping economy , a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies , " Obama spokesman Bill Burton said .
" Barack Obama in no way believes that the McCain campaign is using race as an issue , but he does believe they 're using the same old low - road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign , and those are the issues he 'll continue to talk about . "
At three stops in the battleground state of Missouri , Obama told audiences that his opponent is trying to make voters " scared " of him because he does n't look like past presidents -- an apparent reference to being black -- and has a " funny name . "
" Nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face , " Obama said Wednesday in Springfield , Missouri .
" So what they 're going to try to do is make you scared of me .
You know , he 's not patriotic enough .
He 's got a funny name .
You know , he does n't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills , you know .
He 's risky . "
This is not the first time Obama has delivered this line .
He made similar comments dating back to the Democratic presidential primary .
But a McCain adviser said Davis reacted strongly because the McCain campaign said Obama was directly responding to a new McCain campaign ad .
The political ad , which the McCain campaign released Wednesday , features starlets Britney Spears and Paris Hilton .
The ad calls Obama the " biggest celebrity in the world " and asks , " But is he ready to lead ? "
Watch reaction to the attack ad »
Responding to the ad , Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said , " on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking Sen.
McCain to task for a steady stream of false , negative attacks , his campaign has launched yet another .
Or , as some might say , ' Oops !
He did it again . ' "
The Obama campaign released a response ad declaring that McCain has taken the " low road " over the course of the presidential campaign .
The ad compares McCain to President Bush and says McCain is " practicing the politics of the past . "
Tucker Bounds , spokesman for the McCain campaign , released the following statement in response to the ad : " Pointing out your opponent 's worldwide celebrity is not the ' low road , ' and neither is pointing out that he opposes oil drilling and supports higher taxes . "
As McCain campaigned Wednesday , he stressed his independence from Bush and highlighted times he 's spoken against the administration .
" My independence has n't always made me friends in Washington .
I was not elected Ms. Congeniality in the United States Senate , " he said at a town hall in Aurora , Colorado .
McCain praised Obama for his speaking abilities and success but said , " my concern with Sen .
Obama is -- that on issues big and small -- what he says and what he does are often two different things . "
McCain said Obama 's solution is to raise taxes and promised that he would not do the same .
Watch McCain make his promise »
" I want to look you in the eye .
I will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase .
I will not do it , " he said .
Obama charged that McCain does n't have any new ideas and said that 's why the Arizona senator 's campaign is focusing its energy on anti-Obama ads .
" You have n't heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month .
All they do is try to run me down , " he said .

And , in addition to everything else , the dirty trick push - polling seems to have begun in earnest .
From AP today ...
MIAMI — Jewish voters in Florida and at least one other state [ the other state is Pennsylvania ] are being targeted by a telephone survey tying Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama to Palestinian causes , an advocacy group alleged Monday .
The Jewish Council for Education in Research says at least two women in separate states were push polled , or asked questions intended to influence voters while pretending to take a poll , on Sunday afternoon from a caller who said he was from Research Strategies .
Cilk
Cilk ( pronounced " silk " ) is a linguistic and runtime technology for algorithmic multithreaded programming developed at MIT .
The philosophy behind Cilk is that a programmer should concentrate on structuring her or his program to expose parallelism and exploit locality , leaving Cilk 's runtime system with the responsibility of scheduling the computation to run efficiently on a given platform .
The Cilk runtime system takes care of details like load balancing , synchronization , and communication protocols .
Cilk is algorithmic in that the runtime system guarantees efficient and predictable performance .
Important milestones in Cilk technology include the original Cilk - 1 , which provided a provably efficient work - stealing runtime support but little linguistic support ; the later Cilk - 5 , which provided simple linguistic extensions for multithreading to ANSI C ; and the commercial Cilk ++ , which extended the Cilk model to C++ and introduced " reducer hyperobjects " as an efficient means for resolving races on no Cilk is an especially effective platform for programming " irregular " applications such as sparse numerical algorithms , N - body simulations , graph - theory applications , backtracking search , and cache - efficient stencil computations .
Using Cilk , our group has developed three world - class chess programs , StarTech , * Socrates , and Cilkchess .
Click here for a brief introduction to Cilk .
The Cilk - 5.4.6 Reference Manual contains a programming guide with a short tutorial on the Cilk language .
Cilk at Intel !
MIT licensed Cilk technology to Cilk Arts , Inc.of Lexington , MA , a venture - funded start - up founded by Charles E. Leiserson and Matteo Frigo .
Cilk Arts developed Cilk ++ , a quantum improvement over MIT Cilk , which includes full support for C++ , parallel loops , and superior interoperability with serial code .
In July 2009 Intel Corporation acquired Cilk Arts .
Intel has since released its ICC compiler with Intel Cilk Plus , which provides an easy path to multicore - enabling C and C++ applications .

If someone makes a false claim , it ’s a little easier to get away with it the first time .
He or she could always just claim ignorance : “ Wait , he was n’t caught in a compromising position with farm animals ?
Oh , I ’d heard that he was .
My mistake . ”
When someone makes a false claim after he / she has been told it ’s false , there ’s less of an excuse .
At that point , it goes from a mistake to a lie .
It ’s the difference between inadvertently misleading people and deliberately misleading people .
And John McCain is deliberately misleading people .
McCain and his campaign repeated at least two lines of attack against Obama , which when first said in early July , were called “ bogus , ” “ wrong , ” “ inflated ” and “ misleading ” by independent fact checkers .
At his town hall today , McCain repeated that Obama wants to raise taxes on those making as little as $ 32,000 a year and in his campaign ’s response to Obama ’s event in Springfield , Mo. , today , repeated that “ … Obama ’s bad judgment led him to vote in support of higher taxes 94 times … . ”
Now , I wo n’t bore you detailing all of the ways in which McCain is lying here .
Instead , I ’ll just farm this one out — the claim about raising taxes on those making as little as $ 32,000 a year is demonstrably false , and the claim about voting for higher taxes 94 times is just as ridiculous .
I bring this up , though , because I think the presumptive Republican nominee is offering up an opportunity to create a new campaign meme : “ John McCain has a problem telling the truth . ”
This might even work , if there ’s a concerted push behind it .
Reporters may be slowly realizing that this is a legitimate area of criticism — whether they ’re willing to say so out loud or not — as evidenced by the MSNBC blog item mentioned above .
For that matter , reporters also seem to coming to the realization that McCain has become relentlessly negative as a candidate .
The next natural step is to point out the obvious : McCain is n’t just launching negative attacks , he ’s launching false negative attacks .
McCain lied about Obama snubbing the troops .
We know it , he knows it , the media knows it .
McCain lied about Obama ’s economic policies .
We know it , he knows it , the media knows it .
McCain lied about coastal drilling offering “ short - term ” relief .
McCain lied about Obama wanting to raise taxes on 23 million small businesses .
McCain lied when he held Obama responsible for high gas prices .
We know it , he knows it , the media knows it .
Arguing that McCain has become entirely negative is almost beside the point — a candidate can be negative and honest .
In fact , I kind of expected to see McCain go after Obama for things that are true — Obama attended Jeremiah Wright ’s church ; he wants to end the war in Iraq ; he ’s only held elected office for 12 years , etc .
If McCain wanted to go on the attack in a truthful way , he could .
But he ’s following a different path .
“ John McCain has a problem telling the truth . ”
Tell your friends .
Mysterious Honey Bee Disorder Buzzes into Court
Studies on the pesticide , clothianidin , were ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from the pesticide 's manufacturer , Bayer CropScience , in 2003 when the federal agency granted the company a registration for the chemical .
An NRDC bee researcher and the organization 's attorneys believe that the EPA has evidence of connections between pesticides and the mysterious honey bee die - offs reported across the country called " colony collapse disorder , " or CCD , that it has not made public .
The connection is important because commercial honey bees pollinate about 90 of the country 's crops , valued at $ 15 billion .
Apples , peaches , pears , pumpkins , squash , cucumbers , cherries , berries , peppers , squash , soybeans , almonds , cashews , and sunflowers all require or benefit from honey bee pollination .
The EPA has failed to respond to the NRDC's Freedom of Information
Act request for agency records concerning the toxicity of pesticides to bees , prompting Monday 's legal action .
" Recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die - offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny , " said NRDC attorney Aaron Colangelo .
" EPA should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides , but now refuses to tell the public what it knows . "
" Pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis , so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions ? "
Calangelo asked .
At an apiary by the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania , bees fill the air as beekeepers examine hives for disease .
( Photo courtesy Penn State )
Maryann Frazier , who works with Pennsylvania State University as an extension associate in entomology , says in a paper on neonicotinoids and bees that , " There is conflicting information about the affects of neonicotinoids on honey bees , and different chemicals in this class are known to vary in their toxicity to bees , however the EPA identifies both imidacloprid and clothianidin as highly toxic to honey bees . "
The use of clothianidin and other insecticides of this class has " increased dramatically " over the past few years and they are now the most widely used group of insecticides in the United States , Frazier says .
" Their uses include : seed treatments for corn , cotton , canola and sunflowers ; foliar sprays of fruit , nut and coffee crops ; granular , and liquid drench applications in turf , ornamentals , fruit crops and in forests , " she explains .
The EPA fact sheet says of clothianidin , " It has the potential for toxic chronic exposure to honey bees , as well as other non-target pollinators through the translocation of clothianidin resides in nectar and pollen .
In honey bees , the affects of this toxic chronic exposure may include lethal and / or sub-lethal effects in the larvae and reproductive effects on the queen . "
In addition , says Frazier , " there is concern about the practice of combining certain insecticides and fungicides . "
She cites a North Carolina University study found that some neonicotinoids in combination with certain fungicides , synergized to increase the toxicity of the neonicotinoid to honey bees over 1,000 fold in lab studies .
Colony collapse disorder has claimed more than one - third of honey bees in the United States since it was first identified in 2006 .
A survey by the Apiary Inspectors of America published in May found that losses of honey bees nationwide topped 36 percent of managed hives between September 2007 and March 2008 , compared to a 31 percent loss during the same period a year earlier .
The chemical is sold under the brand name " Poncho " by Bayer AG in Germany , where it was banned in May after an unauthorized release that Bayer blames on an " extremely rare " " application error . "
In fact , Germany banned the entire class of neonicotinoids .
Another Bayer neonicotinoid , imidacloprid , has been blamed in France and South Dakota for colony collapse disorder .
In South Dakota , farmers are suing , and the French government has banned the chemical for use on sunflower seeds .
Scientists have not yet pinned down the cause of colony collapse disorder but they believe it is linked in part to pesticides .
Penn State research has documented more than 70 pesticides in pollen and bees , information that was presented Monday at a national American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia .
" We do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with Colony Collapse Disorder , but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources , " says the Penn State scientist who conducted this research , Dr. James Frazier .
" Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD .
We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors , possibly including mites , viruses and pesticides . "
" This is a real mystery right now , " said Dr. Gabriela Chavarria , director of NRDC 's Science Center .
" EPA needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem .
This is n't just an issue for farmers - this is an issue that concerns us all . "
In documents to be filed next month , NRDC attorneys will ask for a court order directing the EPA to disclose its information about pesticides and bee toxicity .
If you ’re a CEO whose company has shorted its customers on quality and safety , you ’re breathing a little easier today .
If you ’re a politician who has traded favors with the Ã¼ber - rich in exchange for campaign cash , you ’re relieved .

That ’s because there will be fewer journalists nosing around on your turf .
Gannett Co. is eliminating 1,000 jobs across its newspaper operations , including 600 layoffs .
That includes 84 dailies such as The Arizona Republic and the Detroit Free Press as well as nearly 900 non-daily publications but not USA Today , reports the Chicago Tribune .
That means fewer journalists available to defend the public ’s interest .
What ’s particularly cold about this news is Wall Street ’s reaction .
Gannett ’s stock price had fallen about 60 percent from a year ago .
When the news hit the Street , Gannett ’s stock shot up .
According to a MarketWatch story by Jon Friedman , a longtime industry observer :
Gannett ’s stock - market jump is a commentary on how Wall Street thinks .
It ’s an exacting boss .
There is a saying that the stock market has no memory .
Professional investors care about the future â€ ” they are the ultimate frontrunners and their motto may well be : what have you done for me lately ?
Gannett has historically been regarded as a prudent , well - run company .
But Wall Street on Thursday is n’t rewarding the company for once having the optimism and long - range strategy of launching USA Today in 1982 .
Nor is the Street hailing Gannett for its years of expertise and strong management .
Instead , Wall Street is thanking Gannett for cutting costs , big time .
[ emphasis added ]
The personnel cuts ( which go beyond the newsroom ) remain incomprehensible .
As argued repeatedly at S&R , an industry that devalues its product by tossing overboard the people that principally create that product is foolishly reducing its ability to compete effectively with other media distributing information â€ ” including news that people want and need to lead informed , productive , satisfying lives .
The true owners of newspaper companies such as Gannett are large institutional investors concerned about obtaining the highest rate of return on an investment in the shortest time .
Investors seek to maintain a newspaper industry profit margin now hovering in the mid- to high teens .
But revenues are declining , mostly because of decreased print ad revenues ( and a sour economy ) .
Do the math : 16 percent X declining revenue = declining return .
Astute financial analysts could probably speak to this more effectively than I .
But Wall Street ’s needs continue to dominate newspaper industry decision - making .
The industry sold its soul to Wall Street decades ago as a means to finance consolidation of formerly family - owned papers ( with profit margins of 20 and 30 percent or higher ) into conglomerates .
Efficiencies of scale led to higher profits .
Wall Street reaped high rewards from bankrolling a huge cash cow .
But the newspaper industry ’s timid , inept leadership failed to timely recognize the competitive force of the Internet .
Now the industry claims the Internet is its revenue generator of the future , pointing to ad sales figures showing double - digit growth in online advertising .
But the gross of online revenue remains a pittance compared with the much larger ( though declining ) print ad revenue .
Thus , to keep Wall Street happy , the news biz falls back on its favorite trick :
Slash expenses to maintain the all - important and increasingly illusory profit margin .
The Street is thus appeased .
The public is the loser .
Journalists hold government ( and corporations can be considered a government these days ) accountable for its actions .
With fewer journalists on watch , more actions of government and corporations go without public inspection .
The newspaper industry needs a new business model if the public is to be better served by journalists â€ ” as it once was , long ago .

A groundbreaking poll finds that almost half of U.S. adults have heard nothing about nanotechnology , and nearly nine in 10 Americans say they have heard just a little or nothing at all about the emerging field of synthetic biology , according to a new report released by the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies ( PEN ) and Peter D. Hart Research .
Both technologies involve manipulating matter at an incredibly small scale to achieve something new .
This new insight into limited public awareness of emerging technologies comes as a major leadership change is about to take hold in the nation 's capital .
Public policy experts are concerned , regardless of party , that the federal government is behind the curve in engaging citizens on the potential benefits and risks posed by technologies that could have a significant impact on society .
" Early in the administration of the next president , scientists are expected to take the next major step toward the creation of synthetic forms of life .
Yet the results from the first U.S. telephone poll about synthetic biology show that most adults have heard just a little or nothing at all about it , " says PEN Director David Rejeski .
The poll findings are contained a report published September 30 .
Synthetic biology is the use of advanced science and engineering to construct or re-design living organisms–like bacteria–so that they can carry out specific functions .
This emerging technology is likely to develop rapidly in the coming years , much as nanotechnology did in the last decade .
In the near future the first synthetic biology " blockbuster " drug is anticipated to hit the market — an affordable treatment for the 500 million people in the world suffering from malaria .
The poll , which was conducted by the same firm that produces the well - known NBC News / Wall Street Journal polls , found that about two - thirds of adults say they have heard nothing at all about synthetic biology , and only 2 percent say they have heard " a lot " about the new technology .
Even with this very low level of awareness , a solid two - thirds of adults are willing to express an initial opinion on the potential benefits versus risks tradeoff of synthetic biology .
This survey was informed by two focus groups conducted in August in suburban Baltimore .
This is the first time — to the pollsters ' knowledge — that synthetic biology has been the subject of a representative national telephone survey .

At the same time , the poll found that about half of adults say they have heard nothing at all about nanotechnology .
About 50 percent of adults are too unsure about nanotechnology to make an initial judgment on the possible tradeoffs between benefits and risks .
Of those people who are willing to make an initial judgment , they think benefits will outweigh risks by a three to one margin when compared to those who believe risks will outweigh benefits .
The plurality of respondents , however , believes that risks and benefits will be about equal .
A major industry forecasting firm determined that last year nanotech goods in the global marketplace totaled $ 147 billion .
According to the poll , the level of U.S. public awareness about nanotechnology has not changed measurably since 2004 when Hart Research conducted the first poll on the topic on behalf of the PEN .
The report is titled " The American Public 's Awareness Of And Perceptions About Potential Risks and Benefits of Nanotechnology & Synthetic Biology " and can be requested from Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies .
About Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is the ability to measure , see , manipulate and manufacture things usually between 1 and 100 nanometers .
A nanometer is one billionth of a meter ; a human hair is roughly 100,000 nanometers wide .
In 2007 , the global market for goods incorporating nanotechnology totaled $ 147 billion .
Lux Research projects that figure will grow to $ 3.1 trillion by 2015 .
About Synthetic Biology
Synthetic biology is the use of advanced science and engineering to make or re-design living organisms , such as bacteria , so that they can carry out specific functions .
Synthetic biology involves making new genetic code , also known as DNA , that does not already exist in nature .
Urging drilling , House GOP members refuse to leave floor for recess Nick Juliano
Published : Friday August 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Members says Capitol cops gathering near House floor
In a dramatic protest aimed at urging Congress to vote to drill for more oil within the US , House Republicans are refusing to leave the House floor despite a vote to adjourn the chamber early Friday afternoon .
The GOP lawmakers are furious at Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's refusal to allow a vote on legislation aimed at lifting a Congressional moratorium on offshore drilling .
Republicans had delivered a letter ( .pdf ) to Pelosi earlier in the day outlining their request for an " all of the above " energy plan that would open more areas to drilling , encourage conservation and invest in alternative energy sources .
They accused Democrats of caring more about leaving Washington for a recess that will last the entire month of August than enacting new energy legislation .
Democrats and environmentalists argue that opening US coasts to oil exploration will not reduce gas prices .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) said Capitol Hill police officers were gathering outside the House chamber about three hours into Friday 's demonstration .
" A lot of policeman assembling off of floor .
What does that mean ?
House is full , " the Republican congressman wrote on his Twitter feed .
The protest ended around 5:10 p.m. with no Republicans hauled off in handcuffs , according to the Washington Post .
It 's over .
Approximately 20 minutes ago , the remaining members and staff on the floor sang " God Bless America , " chanted " U.S.A. , U.S.A ! " and then , finally , left the chamber .
Politico was the first to report on the GOP demonstration : Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and the Democrats adjourned the House and turned off the light and killed the microphones , but Republicans are still on the floor talking gas prices .
Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) and other GOP leaders opposed the motion to adjourn the House , arguing that Pelosi 's refusal to schedule a vote allowing offshore drilling is hurting the American economy .
They have refused to leave the floor after the adjournment motion passed at 11:23 a.m. and are busy bashing Pelosi and her fellow Democrats for leaving town for the August recess .
At one point , the lights went off in the House and the microphones were turned off in the chamber , meaning Republicans were talking in the dark .
But as Rep. John Shadegg ( R - Ariz .. ) was speaking , the lights went back on , and the microphones have been turned on as well .
 Madame Speaker ,
Where art thou ?
Rep . Ted Poe , R - Texas , shouted from the well of the House , according to CQ .
 This room is vacant of most members of Congress .
Where , oh where , has Congress gone ?  he yelled to about a dozen other Republicans , the tourists in the gallery , some House pages , and Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio , the lone Democrat who witnessed the unusual proceeding .
Rep. John Culberson ( R - TX ) is providing updates on the protest via Twitter and video - streaming service QIK .
" This is a historic first - conservatives will not go quietly home and neglect our duty to vote to bring down energy prices , " he writes .
Liberal activists are responding to the GOP protest with implications that Republican members are simply shilling for contributors in the oil companies .
" Good to see you 're putting in overtime for the $ 300,000 you received from the oil & gas industry , " said one response to Culberson .
House Republican Whip Roy Blunt sent out the following message to colleagues , according to Politico : " Although , this Democrat Majority just Adjourned for the Democrat 5 - Week Vacation , House Republicans are continuing to fight on the House Floor .
Although the lights , mics and C - SPAN camera's have been turned off , House Republicans are on the Floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who , not surprisingly , agree with Republican Energy proposals .
All Republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the House Floor . "
Conservative blog Redstate says 22 Republicans are participating in the protest .
A campaign finance watchdog echoed the sentiment that Friday 's pre-recess protest was simply a publicity stunt .
" As members of Congress pull a stunt today on the floor of the House regarding oil drilling , one day after Exxon Mobil 's record profits , Campaign Money Watch urges all voters and reporters to go to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics ' website , OpenSecrets.org , and review how much each member of Congress received from the oil and gas industry over their careers .
These contributions from Big Oil , more than anything else , will tell you what you need to know about today 's circus , " said David Donnelly , Director of Campaign Money Watch .
Earlier this year , House Republicans dramatically walked off the floor in protest of a vote to hold two Bush administration figures in contempt for flouting Congressional subpoenas .
DEVELOPING ...
Two years ago I read a strange little story in an obscure American magazine for Orthodox Jews , claiming that a descendant of Adolf Hitler had converted to Judaism and was living in Israel .
I had heard rumours in Jewish circles for years about " the penitents " - children of Nazis who become Jews to try to expiate the sins of their fathers .
Could it be true ?
I dug further and discovered that a man with a family connection to Hitler does indeed live in Israel as an Orthodox Jew .
Virtually unnoticed in the English - speaking world , he was exposed seven years ago in an Israeli tabloid .
Then he sank from sight .
I went to Israel to meet him - and on the way I was plunged into the strange subculture of the Nazi - descended Jews .
I am walking through the alleys of the Old City of Jerusalem , to meet Aharon Shear - Yashuv .
He is the son of a Nazi .
And yet he was a senior rabbi in the Israeli armed forces .
He lives in an apartment in the Jewish quarter , near the Western Wall .
I walk through a pale gold alley ; Orthodox Jewish men in long black coats and round fur hats dart past .
He opens the door and looks like every other rabbi I have ever met - a black suit , a beard , a questioning shrug .
He takes me into his study , settles into a chair , and says , in a thick German accent : " My father was in the Waffen - SS . "
He was , he explains , born in the Ruhr Valley in 1940 .
During the war , his father served on the eastern front with Hitler 's elite troops .
What did his father do in the Waffen - SS ?
" I do n't know , " he says calmly .
" When I grew up I tried to ask , but there were n't really answers . "
He was four when he first met his father .
" I do n't remember anything about that , " he says .
It seems he does n't want to talk about his father ; he does n't describe his conversion in psychological terms but in grand theological and historical ones .
" During my theological studies at university it became clear that I could n't be a minister in the church , " he says .
" I concluded that Christianity was paganism .
One of [ its ] most important dogmas is that God became man , and if God becomes man then man also can become God . "
He pauses .
" Hitler became a kind of god . "
So would he have become a Jew even if the Holocaust had never happened , even if his family had been anti-Nazi ?
He looks surprised .
" Oh yes . "
I try to draw him back to his father , but he seems exasperated .
" Well , you see , he is a father , of course , but ideologically , there was no connection .
I was so involved in my conviction that I had found the right path , all the other items no longer had any importance . "
Fragments of the story begin to emerge through the haze of theological reasoning .
His father was " shocked and enraged " when he went to study Judaism in America , he concedes .
" For him that was the end of the world .
' My son is leaving Germany to study in a Jewish rabbinical seminary ! '
He told me I was crazy and renounced me as a son . "
When he moved to Israel , his parents pretended that it had n't happened ; they told their neighbours he was still in America .
Years later , his sister arranged a meeting with his parents at a station in Düsseldorf .
Shear - Yashuv arrived with a Jewish friend .
His father peered out of the train , saw the Jewish stranger , and refused to get off .
Today , he believes Germany is doomed .
" People there do n't get married , and if they do they have one child , " he says .
" But the Turks and the other foreigners have many children .
So it is a question of time that Germany will no longer be German . "
Why does he think this has happened ?
" I think it is a punishment for the Holocaust , " he says , matter - of - factly .
" Germany will leave the stage of history , no doubt about it . "
But the Jews , by contrast , will never die .
This is a neat irony of history that he loves .
" All the great cultures have left the stage of history , " he says .
" The Romans , the Greeks , the Egyptians , the Babylonians .
But this little people , who gave so much to the world , do not . "
He chuckles .
" That is something . "
I walk through the Old City , pondering my encounter with this strange , kindly man .
Something seems to be missing from his story .
To stand in front of a rabbi whose father was in the SS and to hear he became a Jew because he doubted the Trinity is absurd .
So I telephone Dan Bar - On , a professor of psychology at Ben Gurion University , and a world expert on the psychology of the children of perpetrators .
He tells me , flatly , pitilessly : " The motive of the converts is to join the community of the victims .
If you become part of the victim community , you get rid of the burden of being part of the perpetrator community . "
He interviewed Shear - Yashuv for his book Legacy of Silence .
" For me , " he says , " Shear - Yashuv represents a person who ran away from the past . "
A few days later , I take a tatty bus to the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem , on a mountain just outside Jerusalem .
There is an air of absolute , manufactured silence .
In the middle is a glass - and - concrete mausoleum - the memorial .
I am here to meet a woman who works in the educational department .
She was born in Munich , she told me on the telephone , and she is a convert .
I meet her in a cafe on the terrace ; it is very chichi , but the wind is blowing in from the desert .
She is in her late 30s and her head is covered .
Her face is stereotypically German but the mannerisms - her emphatic movements and the soaring cadences of her voice - are all Jewish .
I cannot name her , she says .
( Apart from Shear - Yashuv , every convert refuses to be named . )
She tells me , briskly and crossly , that although her grandparents were not perpetrators in the Holocaust , they were bystanders , anti-semites .
Her mother , she explains , still says things like , " There are a lot of rich Jews in America , " and her family have what she calls " a classic German narrative " about the war .
She bunches her fists .
" There were no Jews in these stories and no Nazis in these stories , " she says .
And she imitates them , angrily .
" No , no , there were no Nazis , we are not Nazis .
We did n't know any Jews , we did n't know anything . "
How did she feel about it ?
She pauses , and then says , " I was annoyed . "
Her favoured word for Germany is " annoyed " .
She was " annoyed " when a synagogue recently opened in Munich .
" People said , ' Now we have closed the circle ; now everything is fine , ' " she says .
" It was like nothing had happened .
But there were 11,000 Jews in Munich before the Holocaust .
Where are they now ? "
She is annoyed by the affluence of Germany .
" Everything is so clean , " she says .
" Everything is so ... nice .
And here , " she stares out over the mountains , " the life is so difficult sometimes . "
Why did she become Jewish ?
" Because I was annoyed by how the narrative was fixed , " she says .
She tells me a story from the Midrash , a Jewish commentary on the Bible .
There are , it states , non-Jews who are born with Jewish souls .
They belong to the Jewish people , and will eventually join them .
" It is only a matter of time , " she says , speaking very seriously , " before you learn you should convert . "
I remember Shear - Yashuv said this too .
I ask her if she believes that Nazi children convert to expiate the guilt of their parents - but this angers her .
" There is something not right when you do it to get rid of your German burden , " she says .
" That is not honest in my eyes .
Do you stop being the daughter of a Wehrmacht soldier if you are Jewish ?
No .
That is no solution .
You do n't get rid of it . "
So why is she here ?
" To live here , to work here , to be this bridge between two worlds . "
She repeats the word " bridge " and she calls it " exciting " .
She talks of her " motivation package " and she calls the " discourse about the Holocaust " in Germany " sophisticated " .
There is something emotionless about it , something deeply unsaid .
And precisely on the stroke of the hour , she looks at her watch and says , " I have to go now . "
I call Bar - On again .
I feel the converts are giving me half - answers , scraps of answers .
They talk about despising the Trinity and the terrible things that the Germans did to the Jews , but it seems like they are talking a genocide that does n't exist , even in their memories .
I can't escape the feeling that it is all about something else .
I tell Bar - On they talk obsessively about the Trinity .
But is incredulity really a reason for abandoning a religion with a three - in - one god for one that still believes bushes talk and that waves are parted by the will of God ?
" That is another way of saying what I have already told you , " he says .
" They want to join the community of the victim .
They may have their own way of rationalising it . "
Later that day , I meet a young man .
He bounces into a kebab shop on West Jerusalem 's main drag .
He is 24 , handsome and excitable .
He tells me , simply , that he hated Germany .
" In Germany I did n't care about anyone , " he spits .
" I did n't give a fuck . "
He describes a jumbled youth , being thrown out of school , joining the army , rejecting the army .
After a while , he drags me off to the Independence Park , sipping a Coke , and telling me how wonderful it all is in Israel .
He describes growing up in a small town in industrial western Germany .
A terrible anger leaks into his sentences .
When I ask him why he converted , he stares at the spindly trees , bunches his arms between his knees like an adolescent boy , and says , " I hate that question .
I do n't know . "
He calms down and says that something was n't right for him in Germany , ever : " I was always looking for my place .
I hated Catholicism .
I have hated it since I was 14 . "
He educated himself and what he likes about Judaism , he says , is that " what counts is the deed .
In Christianity it is enough just to believe . "
" I did n't think of my family of being like ' the Germans ' , " he says .
" I did n't say , ' Grandfather , did you kill anyone ? '
My grandmother said , ' As kids under the Nazis , before the war , we had a wonderful time .
They sent us to Croatia , they sent us to Sweden , and we had youth camps .
How could we not be thankful for what they gave us ? ' "
The Holocaust was just a subject you learned in history , he says .
" You went in the classroom twice a week , they told you , you fell asleep . "
But he tells me one of his grandmother 's anecdotes about Nazism .
" She remembers Kristallnacht , " he says .
" She was 13 .
She says she remembered there were Jewish shops that got burned down and it was a big loss .
Because , she said , you could always go to the Jews and buy something and if you did n't have the money you could bring it in next time . "
And that is his family .
He never asked them about the war - I have yet to meet a convert who has .
According to Bar - On , converts and their parents almost never speak about the war .
He calls it the " double wall " : both the parent and child erect a wall of silence ; even if one tries to break it , the other will keep it firmly in place .
This man told his parents he was converting one Christmas Day .
He has had death threats from neo -Nazis , he says .
His hometown is full of them .
Why does he think they became neo -Nazis ?
" Ask them - do n't ask me , " he replies .
Did he become Jewish because of the Holocaust ?
" People ask me that a lot , " he says , " and when I say no they do n't believe me . "
Does he really believe that ?
" Maybe . "
He sighs and looks around at the trees .
" Maybe what the war made Germany into ... "
He pauses and then says , " I feel myself turning into a block of ice every time when I go back .
I have to force myself to melt down again . "
I call Bar - On a final time .
They all say they are happy now , I tell him .
Is this true ?
The conversion " may give them an illusion of peace " , he says .
" But it is not the way to work through the role of the parents [ in the war ] .
I think it is running away from it .
In order to be able to really work through the past , you have to try to understand how could it be that your father was a mass murderer .
You have to think of the possibilities that had you lived at this time you might also have been able to do such things . "
Is he telling me that they are always wondering what they would have done in Nazi Germany to the Jews they have become ?
" Being in Israel is to keep away as far as possible from it , " he replies .
" I am not sure to what extent they have really been accepted into Israeli society .
I think they are struggling .
I do n't envy them . "
As far as I can tell , the converts may know of each other , but they do not come together .
In Judaism it is a sin to point the finger at a convert .
And why would they ?
They are not here to be German ; they are here to be Jewish .
I return to the suburbs to meet an artist .
This convert is also a member of an organisation that promotes human rights for Palestinians .
An incredibly beautiful woman answers the door and I say hello .
" Oh , no , " she says .
" You are not here to speak to me - you are here to speak to my girlfriend . "
The woman I have come to interview is small and wiry , with short hair ; she says she is 42 .
She speaks very , very fast .
The words pour out of her .
She sits me down and gives me cake and coffee .
I say I have interviewed a lot of converts .
" Are they all mad ? " she asks me , and laughs .
What does she mean ?
" Well , " she says , " I met some who surprised me .
Some of them were shockingly unintelligent .
I even wondered why they would have the intellectual independence to make this choice - especially the people who chose to be ultra-Orthodox , who chose to throw away their freedom . "
She shrugs .
" There is stigma in conversion , " she says .
" People end up being fanatics . "
She sips her coffee and says that she believes there is a parallel between the way that some Jews respond to the Palestinians and the way some Germans responded to the Nazis .
She never asked her grandmother about the war , she says , because she loved her too much .
" I was worried I would get hurt by information I did n't want to know , " she says .
" Sometimes I feel that a lot of Israelis live that way .
It is better not to ask questions , and not be hurt , and so you do n't have to look at yourself or your family or your nation .
And you can live with the illusion of who is good and who is bad . "
She says she was eight years old when she first heard of a Jew .
" I heard a boy next door call another boy a ' stupid Jew ' , " she says .
" I asked my mother , ' What is a Jew , and is it something bad ? ' "
When she learned about the Holocaust , it literally made her retch .
" I was horrified by what Germans did to Jews , " she says .
" I was physically disgusted .
And I was totally disgusted by even my own Germanness . "
It is strange to hear things like this over coffee in a clean apartment in the Middle East .
" I did n't want to be German , " she says .
" And because this entered my mind so early , it became as natural as brushing my teeth . "
So why did she convert ?
She grimaces .
" It is n't rational .
We are talking about religion here . "
But she says she ran away to Israel to convert when she was 25 .
And today , she berates herself for her immaturity in doing it .
She was shocked by the racism in Israel .
Towards her ?
" Towards the Arabs , " she replies .
" I felt that I was being told that to be a good Jew , you had to hate Arabs . "
So she stands at West Bank checkpoints to observe the behaviour of Israeli soldiers towards Palestinians .
" It causes a lot of tension to come here and say the things that I say , " she says .
So why does she say them ?
" Because it would be very inconsistent to have had so much criticism of Germans who were terrible cowards when it was still possible to say something , and then to come here and not speak up for justice . "
She is through with Israel .
She says it is because of the triple whammy of otherness - German , leftwing , gay .
A shrink would say that she came here to be wrong , I tell her .
" Do n't think I have n't thought about it in those terms myself , " she replies .
" I had wanted to connect myself to a history I did not perceive as shameful .
Now I am wondering if I will stay .
I am more or less sure that I wo n't .
Sometimes I feel I am not built for it , that I am not strong enough for this country . "
She runs her hands through her hair briskly , and shakes her head .
" Sometimes I feel that just by existing I am always wrong here .
But I cannot live with personal attacks now .
I cannot bear it . "
Later that day , I meet the man who brought me here to Israel , the man who started all this - the so - called Jewish Hitler .
He is a professor at the Jewish studies faculty at one of the universities .
I telephoned him , and to my surprise he answered .
How could I ask : " Are you a Hitler ? " I told him I was writing a story about German converts to Judaism , and he said I could come over immediately .
So I go to an apartment just around the corner from where the artist lives .
It is a grimy white block , with a few scrubby bushes outside .
I walk upstairs and a woman with the headscarf of all married orthodox Jewish women answers the door .
She does n't say anything , simply gestures for me to sit at a table in a room heaving with books .
And then he comes in .
Is this my Jewish Hitler ?
He is incredibly tall and slim , in a blinding yellow shirt , very animated , and his accent - an odd pulp of German , English and Hebrew - seems to zoom out of him .
He is holding two pieces of paper .
One is a family tree ; the other is a printout of an account of the life of Alois Hitler Junior - Adolf Hitler 's half - brother .
" I will tell you the whole story , " he says , " on the condition that you do not print my name " .
He places the first piece of paper in front of me , points at names , and begins a strange , almost incomprehensible account of the lives of Germans who died more than a century ago .
At the end of each summary of a long finished life , he jabs his finger on the table and says , " OK ? "
It only becomes clear what he is doing when I follow the tree down to a name I know - Alois Hitler .
Alois Hitler had two sons who lived to maturity - Adolf ( that Adolf ) and Alois Junior .
This half - brother of the Führer then produced an illegitimate son called Hans . " OK ? " he says .
" Hans married my grandmother Erna after she divorced my grandfather . "
He immediately states that he hates the Hitler branch of his family .
He becomes agitated .
" I have neither any blood nor DNA from Adolf and his family , " he insists .
" I was not socialised by that family . "
He met Hans only once .
The Hitlers came for tea when he was 12 years old .
" Hans was a very nice man , " he says .
" No passions , no brutality . "
But Erna was thrilled to have married into the Hitler clan , and remained a Nazi until she died .
" I did n't know her , " he says of his grandmother .
" She was n't part of my family . "
The professor explains that his mother severed all connections with the Hitlers .
As a teenager she was beaten for refusing to go to Hitler Youth dances , and when she gave birth to the professor - an illegitimate child she conceived during an affair with a married man - her mother and stepfather disowned her .
He was raised in a series of rented rooms , while the Hitlers lived well .
After the war , his grandmother changed her name , but her beliefs remained .
He begins to tell me what happened to his mother during the war .
She worked as a typist for the Wehrmacht in Poland and she saw dead Jews hanging in the town squares .
" She was a girl in the war , " he says , " but I always appreciated that she told me the truth about it .
We spoke frankly .
I never heard that normal German lie you hear so often from that generation . "
His voice rises and he impersonates them with a fierce whine : " ' We did n't know , we just did our duty . ' "
And he thumps the table .
" My grandparents never understood what they had done , " he says .
" My mother understood . "
When she came home after the Allied victory , she was denounced as a Nazi , and the Communists seized her flat .
" She became one of those German ladies who cleared up after all the bombing . "
He stomps to the kitchen and comes back , thrusting two silver spoons at me .
" That is all that my mother brought home from the war .
I keep them to honour her . "
It was a brutal childhood : he barely saw his father , and his mother beat him - one time so severely that she could n't go to work for three days because her fingers were too swollen to type .
" She was a fighter , " he says .
" It is not the nicest thing you can be . "
Was she religious ?
He gives a deranged giggle .
" She had the religion of herself , " he says .
His mother was entirely alone .
" Nobody helped anybody at that time , " he says .
His father had another family - a real family : " I saw my father very seldom and the times I saw him I was so proud to have a father that it was not the time to ask what he did in the war .
He died when I was 19 .
So I never asked him what he did . "
But he does know his father was a major in the Wehrmacht .
So , barring a miracle , he killed people for Hitler .
His journey towards Judaism was long .
" It was not a sudden light from heaven that came down . "
When he was a teenager he met a girl who was interested in Judaism , and he read Mein Kampf .
" I was embarrassed when I read it , " he says .
" How could people be so stupid as to elect a person who was writing things like this ?
It 's awful . "
He blinks at me .
" I do n't think you can really understand how awful it is if you do n't read it in German .
I put it away .
But I keep it here . "
Did he ever finish it ?
He scowls at me for the first and only time .
" No . "
When the time came for him to be conscripted into the German army , he decided to take a theology degree , because he wanted to benefit from an ironic leftover from Nazism : Hitler promised the Pope in 1933 that he would n't conscript priests , and the law has never been repealed .
" I am a pacifist , " he says .
" You raise up an army if you think you have to use it . "
As part of the degree , he was due to spend six weeks in Israel in the early 1970s .
" I felt at home .
I was no longer living in a conflict .
I did n't have to reject the older generation .
And I thought I had met for the first time a nationality that at that point in history - today it is more problematic - still had good reasons to be proud of itself . "
So he stayed .
We go out on to the balcony to smoke .
He really enjoys his cigarette ; I can see he is a pleasure - savouring man .
He does not have the heaviness of the other converts , who all seemed crushed by an invisible burden .
Is it because he spoke to his mother about it all ?
I steel myself and ask : would he have become Jewish without the Holocaust ?
" I think not , " he says .
" The sharp distinction between the generations that committed the crimes and the generation born after would n't exist .
Non-Germans hardly understand that a whole generation checked out our teachers and asked , ' Where were you 20 years ago ? ' "
And then , to my surprise , he calls his son - his Israeli son - a fascist .
" When I hear my own son speak - as I did last weekend - I sat like this , " and he does the Hitler salute .
" Two of my sons are chauvinists and one of them is even partially racist .
I can't listen to fascistic discourse .
I do n't suffer that . "
They talk about the Palestinians with contempt .
" Each time I hear it is another time too much .
If the Holocaust and the Third Reich have really somehow shaped me , I am a sworn democrat .
I believe that democracy has to prove itself by keeping the rights of its minorities . "
I have been with this man for three hours , insistently asking why - why did you convert ?
Why ?
This stray branch of the Hitler family tree stares out at his dull suburban street at the heart of the Jewish state , puffs on his cigarette , and begins to talk about the images of the Holocaust that linger in his mind .
" I see that soldier trampling that child and in the end killing it , and I remember that kind of aggression .
I remember the feeling of the child , too .
I remember both .
I could see my father or my grandfather really standing there . "
And as he says this , his shoulders seem to relax .
He is giving me my answer .
" And all I can say , Tanya , " he says from inside his little cloud of smoke , " is that since I came to Israel , that feeling is n't there any more . "
( L- R ) Nicaragua 's President Daniel Ortega , Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez , Honduras ' President Manuel Zelaya and first lady Xiomara Castro , Cuba 's Vice President Carlos Lage and Bolivia 's President Evo Morales attend the signing of accession of Honduras to the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) in Tegucigalpa , August 25 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Edgard Garrido
TEGUCIGALPA ( Reuters ) - Honduras , long considered an ally of the United States in Central America , joined on Monday a Latin American pact that has been pushed by Venezuela as a way to contain U.S. influence in the region .
Honduras is a member of a free trade pact between Central America and the United States .
But President Manuel Zelaya , a logging magnate seen as a moderate liberal , has been drifting toward closer ties with Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez , a U.S. foe .
On Monday , Honduras joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas , or ALBA , which is based on complementary trade and cooperation instead of free - market competition .
Venezuela has used the pact and its oil wealth to expand its influence in the impoverished region .
“ All the energy that they need ... in Honduras is assured for the next 100 years , ” Chavez told a cheering crowd of about 50,000 people in the Honduran capital .
ALBA also includes Cuba , Bolivia , Nicaragua and Dominica .
Honduras was a cold war ally of the United States and allowed U.S. - backed “ Contra ” rebels from Nicaragua to operate from its soil in the 1980s .
Honduras still hosts U.S. troops at one of its military bases .
Coffee - producing Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere .
I normally do n’t suggest things I have n’t tried for long , but I ’m too encouraged by the results to let this pass without comment .
A few days ago I had lunch at Phillippe in downtown Los Angeles ( the best sandwich shop in God ’s country ) .
Whenever I eat there , my self - discipline invariably goes out the window , and I find myself devouring enough to regret it immediately afterwards .
I ordered my usual French Dip , a bowl of clam chowder and a slice of chocolate cream pie .
As soon as I set the tray down on the table , I found myself looking at the volume of food I was about to eat with different eyes .
My intuition was raising a red flag against the act of hyperconsumption I was about to commit .
Staring at the food for a moment longer , a question suddenly came to mind .
What 20 % of this would give me 80 % of the satisfaction ?
I wound up eating perhaps more than 20 % , but well below half .
I ate the full ( small ) bowl of clam chowder , less than half of the sandwich , and four forkfulls of the pie .
I put the rest in a box , and repeated the process at home .
It took me four days to finish a meal that I would have ordinarily pounded away in one sitting .
I ’ve started doing this with everything I eat and drink now , and I not only have more energy when I ’m finished , but the act of eating is more enjoyable .
It ’s not the mathematical proportion that matters .
80/20 is an arbitrary ratio in this context , and could just as easily be 50/50 or 90/10 .
What matter is the fact that I ’m forced to pay attention to what I ’m eating in relation to a standard of fulfillment , not consumption .
Like most Americans , I was raised to finish everything on my plate .
This ethic carries a number of unexamined assumptions :
Everything on a plate is worth eating
The size of the plate is appropriate to the amount of food we actually need
The plate needs to be loaded
Food left on the plate is “ wasted , ” as opposed to turning to excess fat if eaten
“ Full ” meals are served on plates , as opposed to bowls , skewers or napkins
The 20 % Not - to - Eat list
While I ’ve only been applying the Pareto ( 80/20 ) principle to individual meals for less than a week , I ’ve had more experience with a different application .
Last December , I decided to lose some weight .
Being too lazy to maintain a real diet , I asked myself , “ What are the 20 % of foods that are causing 80 % of my excess weight ? ”
It took about three minutes to realize that they fell into two categories : candy and pastries .
I was surprised by how simple it was to drop these from my eating routine ( Phillipe being the one and only exception ) , since I usually ate them to alleviate boredom anyway .
Sometimes resisting the urge took a little emotional effort , but the alternative of counting calories or carbs would have taken much more .
I always prefer making things easier before applying more effort .
Within two days , I noticed that my stomach no longer exerted pressure against my belt , and within two weeks , I noticed that I had to keep pulling my pants up .
In six weeks I lost 11 pounds , with nothing to analyze or track .
The great thing about 80 /20 analyses is that they apply at any level .
If you ’ve already eliminated candy and pastries , your 20 % might be dairy products and meat .
Whatever it is , it ’s usually something that ’s obvious once you focus on it as an issue .

I just went through Apple ’s iPhone availability checker for all 50 states in the U.S. : one store in Hawaii has one model ( 8 GB ) , one store in California ( out of 38 in the state ) has one model ( 16 GB black ) , and the Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York has one model ( 16 GB white ) .
That ’s it .
So much for my “ just wait a week and then cruise in and pick one up in five minutes ” plan .
Update : I mistakenly skipped New Hampshire , where they still have one model ( 16 GB white ) at the Rockingham Mall .
We regret the error .

The World 's Oldest Profession I clearly stirred up some unreceptive feelings with the column , Prostitutes Nominated for Honesty Award .
For those who pointed out that prostitution causes crime , I would like to submit that most of the criminal activity surrounding prostitution is the direct result of ... ... forcing it into the underworld of illegal activities ... ... right along side of those unsavory types who inhabit that world .
C ountries where prostitution is legal do n't have the crime problems associated it with that we do .
Yet , in the United States prostitution is a real problem .
But there 's a real solution .
Legalize it . *
It already is in many parts of the world .
Even in at least one Nevada county in the good ol ' U - S - of - A .
If prostitution were legal we could - reduce or eliminate the rampant victimization of prostitutes by pimps , johns , and the whole unsavory raft of criminal elements commonly associated with it
control disease by requiring regular checkups and health certificates
get many prostitutes off the street and into a controlled environment
put more of our limited law enforcement resources into fighting major crimes
take away the impetus to get young women ( and men ) hooked on drugs in order to turn them into prostitutes ( and profit )
eliminate a significant source of income for organized crime , and
put this multi-billion dollar business on the tax rolls .
Right now , instead of deriving income from prostitution , we are spending large sums of money trying to wipe out " an evil " which .... ... has largely been created .... ... in a muddled effort to legislate morality .
By legalizing prostitution , we would not be condoning it .
Strangely , this is exactly the same conclusion the Catholic Church came to many years ago ... ... before the anti-sex factions imposed their views on Christianity .**
With some of the tax revenue generated by legalizing prostitution we could also do a little educating ... ... inform some people that prostitution is n't exactly the way it is in Pretty Woman .
B ut , legalizing prostitution has n't a chance in hell .
It makes too much sense .
And it would be politically unpopular .
And politicians depend too much on inflating issues like this to get elected .
Interesting how we keep coming back to politics .
* I have been informed that many would prefer prostitution decriminalized instead of legalized .
I 'll admit I did n't see a difference when I first wrote this .
But , according to at least two organizations of " working women , " if prostitution is just legalized , it will allow the government to impose all manner of unrealistic controls .
Decriminalizing it would make it no different ( and probably a lot safer than ) than legal sports such as boxing , demolition derbies , and ice hockey .
We should also note that even in some countries where prostitution is not legal , it tends to be ignored .
** A number of modern bible scholars have established that an anti-woman and anti-sex biblical perspective was imposed on Christianity for two primary reasons :
1. to to satisfy the emerging Church 's social and political goals , and 2 . to conform to the extensive dictates of an early Church " saint , " a person who admitted he was suffering from serious personal problems related to sex and women FYI : A revealing and objective book on prostitution is Brothel by Alexa Albert , a graduate of Harvard Medical School .

A bus stop that grows its own foliage as shade ?
A children 's playground , made entirely from trees ?
A shelter made from living tree roots that could provide natural protection against earthquakes in California ?
" Eco-architecture " may sound like a Buck Rogers vision of an ecologically - sustainable future , but that future is now thanks to the guidance of Tel Aviv University Professors Yoav Waisel and Amram Eshel .
The concept of shaping living trees into useful objects -- known as tree shaping , arborsculpture , living art or pooktre –– is n't new .
But scientists are now ready to use this concept as the foundation of a new company that will roll out these structures worldwide .
Pilot projects now underway in the United States , Australia and Israel include park benches for hospitals , playground structures , streetlamps and gates .
" The approach is a new application of the well - known botanical phenomenon of aerial root development , " says Prof. Eshel .
" Instead of using plant branches , this patented approach takes malleable roots and shapes them into useful objects for indoors and out . "
A Scientific and Commercial Partnership
The original " root - breaking " research was conducted at the Sarah Racine Root Research Laboratory at Tel Aviv University , the first and largest aeroponics lab in the world .
Founded by Prof. Waisel 20 years ago , the lab enables scientists to conduct future - forward and creative research that benefits mankind and the environment .
Commercial applications of the research are being developed by Plantware , a company founded in 2002 .
TAU and Plantware researchers working together found that certain species of trees grown aeroponically ( in air instead of soil and water ) do not harden .
This developed into a new method for growing " soft roots , " which could easily turn living trees into useful structures .
Completing the informal collaboration between Plantware founders and the university , the company 's director of operations , Yaniv Naftaly , holds a degree in life sciences from TAU .
An Eco-Positive Abode
It 's even possible that , in the near future , entire homes will be constructed with the eco-friendly technology .
An engineer by trade , Plantware 's CEO Gordon Glazer hopes the first home prototype will be ready in about a decade .
While the method of " growing your own home " can take years , the result is long lasting and desirable especially in the emerging field of green architecture .
Prof .
Eshel 's team is also working on a number of other projects to save the planet 's resources .
They are currently investigating a latex - producing shrub , Euphoria tirucalii , which can be grown easily in the desert , as a source for biofuel ; they are also genetically engineering plant roots to ensure " more crop per drop , " an innovative approach to irrigation .

HOW STEAM CLEANERS WORK
A steam cleaner , also called a vapor steam cleaner , uses " dry " vapor steam to clean , sanitize / disinfect , and remove most stains and buildup .
The machines are ideal for hard surfaces , like sealed floors and tile and grout , and spot cleaning of softer materials , like carpets and upholstery .
On the more industrial / commercial side , they are commonly used for commercial ktichen cleaning , food processing equipment cleaning , and general degreasing of all types of surfaces and equipment .
Since the machines generate very high temperatures , they kill fungus , mold , bacteria , and other allergens .
The devices generally use low pressure levels of up to 150 psi .
Water in a steam cleaner is heated in a boiler , which converts the liquid to vapor that exits the machine via a nozzle .
The steam loosens dirt on hard surfaces and in soft fibers , so it can be wiped or vacuumed .
The vapor in a steam cleaner contains about 5 % water .
Some steam cleaners work with cleaning solutions and detergents .
Others include vacuums .
Key Components
Boiler :
The boiler does what the name implies : boils water and turns it into steam .
Boilers are subjected to extreme heat and pressure , so top - grade versions of this component are made of stainless steel .
One key feature is a replaceable heating element , which means customers can have a single low - cost heating rod replaced instead of the entire costly boiler .
Industrial - grade steam cleaners sport boilers of up to 14 liters .
Refill Tank :
Some residential and most commercial grade steam cleaners include a non-pressurized refill tank that allows the operator to add water to the machine while it 's still running .
For systems without a refill tank , the operator must depressurize the system , add water to the boiler , and wait up to 20 minutes for the water to heat .
Automatic Refill :
Some industrial steam cleaners include a direct water feed that connects the machine to a water outlet and refills the boiler as needed .
( Automatic refill systems can also be refilled manually if a water line is not available . )
Detergent tanks :
These tanks hold and dispense cleaning chemicals .
Some steam cleaning machines include simple handle controls that allow the operator to control the detergent and steam flow while cleaning .
Industrial steam cleaners can have detergent tanks in excess of 20 liters .
Steam Vacuum :
Steam cleaners can also be equipped with vacuums that empty their contents automatically into extraction tanks of up to 35 liters .
Steam vacuum cleaners can boost productivity dramatically since they allow users to clean and extract without the use of towels .
Non-vacuum steam cleaners require the use of a towel to wipe the moisture and residue left behind .
Accessories :
Steam cleaners usually include a collection of brushes in various shapes and sizes with and without towel clips ; small detail brushes ; squeegees for glass and mirrors ; microfiber towels ; plungers for sink drains .
Tips for Using a Steam Cleaner
- Never try to steam clean surfaces made of pressed paper , cardboard or surfaces painted with non-enamel paint .
- For waxed floors , use low pressure .
Clip a clean towel over a large rectangular brush and work fast .
The process will melt a thin layer of dirty wax and leave behind what looks like a freshly waxed floor .
- For unwaxed vinyl floors , work fast and do not allow heat to build up as it can soften the vinyl and affect the texture .
- For tile floors , scrub briskly using a brush with no towel .
Wipe up the mess immediately with a loose towel .
Do no let an area dry before wiping up .
If your steam cleaner has a vacuum , steam first and vacuum dry .
- For grout , use a small detail brush and wipe up as you clean .
Dirt within tight grout may be pre-sprayed with an alkaline cleaner .
Let the solution sit several minutes before cleaning .

Last week , the Romanian Senate unanimously voted a law proposal forcing media to distribute 50 % of positive news .
According to its instigators , the law will help to fight against “ the extraordinary harms of negative news and their irreversible effects on health and people ’s lives . ”
The Senate wishes that TV and radio news programs feature as much ‘ negative ’ as ‘ positive ’ news .
The Romanian ’s National Council for Audiovisual broadcasting is to validate the law – under which it will have the responsibility to decide what constitutes good or bad news .

How much gasoline would the nation save in the year 2035 if lightweight hybrid and plug - in hybrid vehicles dominated the marketplace ?
More than 68 billion gallons , or about half the fuel currently used each year by today 's vehicles .
Such detailed analyses in a new MIT report published this month conclude that over the next 25 years , the fuel consumption of new vehicles could be reduced by 30 - 50 percent and total U.S. fuel use for vehicles could be cut to year 2000 levels , with greenhouse gas emissions cut by almost as much .
But it will be challenging to meet those demands .
It will require not just developing improved and new engines , vehicles and fuels , but also convincing people that they do n't need to buy bigger , faster cars .
Each step will be difficult , yet all must be pursued with an equal sense of urgency .
" We 've got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology -- that we can invent our way out of this situation , " said John B. Heywood , the Sun Jae Professor of Mechanical Engineering , who led the research .
" We 've got to do everything we can think of , including reducing the size of the task by real conservation . "
MIT teams spent five years examining different approaches to cutting transportation fuel use and emissions .
Projects analyzed specific propulsion technologies , vehicle performance and design , market penetration rates for the various technologies , consumer expectations , new fuels and potential policy measures .
For example , the teams calculated the fuel economy and emissions gains achievable with hybrid technology , then , using analyses of cost and consumer preferences , they projected how rapidly sales volumes of hybrids may build up and how much total U.S. gasoline consumption would decline as a consequence .
" That last task is very important because unless you 've got lots and lots of vehicles with the better technology , the impact is limited , " Heywood said .
" The need to bring better technology into production and build up volume inevitably makes the time frames for technologies to make a difference long .
Optimists want to move faster , but it 's not clear we can really do it much faster . "
Slashing transportation fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 will require immediate action on several challenging fronts .
For the near term ( up to 15 years ) , we should increase our efforts to improve light - duty vehicle engines and transmissions , but all improvements must go toward increasing fuel efficiency rather than making cars bigger and faster .
Also critical is reducing vehicle weight and size .
For the mid- and long - term ( 15 - 30 years , and more than 30 years ) , we should ramp up work on radically different technologies such as plug - in hybrids and hydrogen fuel - cell vehicles .
We must also develop and market more environmentally benign fuels based on nonpetroleum sources .
In general , the use of biofuels will grow but not as fast as expected just a few years ago .
The final key is policy action .
A coordinated set of regulatory and fiscal measures will be needed to push and pull improved technologies and greener alternative fuels into the market place in high volume .
Measures should require auto manufacturers to make smaller , more - efficient cars , encourage consumers to choose those vehicles , and discourage everyone from driving so much .
Overall , the report shows that there are many opportunities for change .
However , the challenges involved are enormous .
" Transitioning from our current situation onto a path with declining fuel consumption and emissions , even in the developed world , will take several decades -- much longer than we had hoped or realized , " Heywood said .
" We 've got to start now . "

LAKE CITY , Ga. - More than 1,800 people showed up to help ABC's " Extreme Makeover " team demolish a family 's decrepit home and replace it with a sparkling , four - bedroom mini-mansion in 2005 .
Three years later , the reality TV show 's most ambitious project at the time has become the latest victim of the foreclosure crisis .
After the Harper family used the two - story home as collateral for a $ 450,000 loan , it 's set to go to auction on the steps of the Clayton County Courthouse Aug .
5 . The couple did not return phone calls July 28 , but told WSB - TV they received the loan for a construction business that failed .
The house was built in January 2005 , after Atlanta - based Beazer Homes USA and ABC's " Extreme Makeover " demolished their old home and its faulty septic system .
Within six days , construction crews and hoards of volunteers had completed work on the largest home that the television program had yet built .
The finished product was a four - bedroom house with decorative rock walls and a three - car garage that towered over ranch and split - level homes in their Clayton County neighborhood .
The home 's door opened into a lobby that featured four fireplaces , a solarium , a music room and a plush new office .
Materials and labor were donated for the home , which would have cost about $ 450,000 to build .
Beazer Homes ' employees and company partners also raised $ 250,000 in contributions for the family , including scholarships for the couple 's three children and a home maintenance fund .
ABC said in a statement that it advises each family to consult a financial planner after they get their new home .
" Ultimately , financial matters are personal , and we work to respect the privacy of the families , " the network said .
Some of the volunteers who helped build the home were less than thrilled about the family 's financial decisions .
" It 's aggravating .
It just makes you mad .
You do that much work , and they just squander it , " Lake City Mayor Willie Oswalt , who helped vault a massive beam into place in the Harper 's living room , told The Atlanta Journal - Constitution .

Anheuser - Busch Unveils Massive Green Beer Plan
July 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
But is it greenwashing ?
Anheuser - Busch , the largest brewer in the US , announced today that its breweries will rely on renewable energies for 15 percent of their needs by 2010 .
The Houston brewery plans to use biogas from a nearby landfill combined with an on - site bio-energy recovery system ( BERS ) that will make use of brewing wastewater , and the Fairfield , California facility will use solar panels in addition to a BERS .
The other US breweries will use only BERS .
When the facilities are completed , 10 out of the 12 Anheuser - Busch breweries in the US will use alternative fuels .
It ’s tempting to shake our heads and exclaim that this is just another example of meaningless corporate greenwashing .
But that might not be entirely true .
Anheuser - Busch ’s plan will produce 1 in 7 beers using alternative energy — that ’s over 5 billion 12 oz .
servings .
Additionally , Anheuser - Busch is the world ’s largest operator of BERS .
Such cogeneration is extremely important for large breweries to pursue if they want to be at all sustainable .
As I mentioned earlier , Anheuser - Busch is the largest US brewer — so they set an example for other large companies .
If other breweries choose to pursue BERS , even if it is just to look good in the public eye , I wo n’t complain .
I do n’t know anyone who plans to stop drinking beer in the name of sustainability anytime soon , so Anheuser - Busch ’s plan is a step forward .

Megapixels , like megahertz before them , are the big consumer swindle of the camera world .
The first thing anyone asks me when they see my Canon G9 is “ How many megapixels does it have ? ”
My answer , 12 , causes a swoon .
The trouble is , I neither want nor need that many .
My Nikon D60 , with just 10 megapixels , takes better pictures , especially in low light .
In fact , when Nikon announced its new P6000 two weeks ago , I groaned when I read the sensor size : 13.5 megapixels .
All those extra dots add up to one thing : noise .
Here we take a look at the advantages of smaller pixel - counts , and what they mean for the future of photography .
Fast ISO
ISO ratings on digital cameras mimic the different sensitivities of film , but they do n’t quite work in the same way .
The same information falls onto the same sensor , but at higher sensitivity settings the signal is simply amplified to make things brighter .
Unfortunately , any noise is also amplified , which is why we normally see noisy images at high ISO settings , despite improving noise - reduction software in cameras .
And the more megapixels on a sensor , the more noise ; those pixels are so small and so close together , especially on the tiny sensors in compact cameras , that information bleeds between them , a kind of visual cross -talk .
Nikon was the first company to have the cojones to release a flagship DSLR , the D3 , with “ only ” 12.1 megapixels .
This relatively low count , coupled with a full - frame sensor , means that the D3 can shoot amazingly low - noise photos at ISO 6400 , with pretty good images all the way up to ISO 25600 .
This has left Canon , still focusing on pixels , scrambling to catch up .
Burst Mode
Almost every compact camera comes with a video mode , and many shoot in high definition .
If pixel counts were to top out at , say , 8 million , the camera ’s processors will soon be powerful enough to shoot video at full resolution .
Why do you care ?
Because if a camera can grab frames that fast , shutter lag ( still a problem on compacts ) , blinking subjects and forced smiles are all moot :
You simply review the burst of images and pick the one you want .
Sure , this will fill up your memory cards quicker , but that ’s just another reason to keep pixel counts low .
Casio already does something similar with its Exilim EX - F1 , which shoots 6 - megapixel images at 60 fps .
GPS
This one is independent of pixel count , but – we predict – will soon be in every camera .
In - cam GPS means that the picture can be stamped with location coordinates ; not just when it was taken , but where , meaning that it can easily be placed on a map , automatically .
It also means that you can search out other peoples pictures taken in a certain place , even finding out where the pros stand when they take their amazing photos .
So far , the only big name to add GPS to a camera is , again , Nikon , with its new P6000 .
Anybody spotting a trend here ?
RAW
RAW , like GPS , should be available on every camera .
The RAW file format , although different for almost every single camera model , is the closest we get to a digital negative .
It is essentially the RAW data from the camera ’s sensor , completely unprocessed , unlike JPEG files which are white - balanced , sharpened and compressed in camera .
A RAW file might need a little extra work in post production , but you are working with all you camera has to offer , including increased exposure latitude .
RAW files are , by their nature , bigger than JPEGs , but I ’d warrant ( unscientifically ) that an 8 - megapixel RAW file will contain more information than , say , a 12 - megapixel JPEG , and be of a similar size .
So , the combo of RAW and a small pixel count means better images .
Aside from this list , a slowdown in the megapixel arms race would leave the technicians at Canon and Nikon to concentrate on new ways to make the cameras better for the photographer , instead of laboring to squeeze yet more dots onto their chips .
Unless you are actually printing your photographs , and blowing them up to the size of posters , the camera in you pocket has all the sensor you need .
Imagine , then , that same camera , only that you never miss a shot , never forget where you took it and , above all , never need to turn on the harsh , on - camera flash .
We must first recognize that what a town or building is , is governed , above all , by what is happening there . [… ]
Those of us who are concerned with buildings tend to forget too easily that all the life and soul of a place , all of our experiences there , depend not simply on the physical environment , but on the patterns of events which we experience there .
– Christopher Alexander , The Timeless Way of Building , p62
Software is not about code , it ’s about experiences .
It ’s about people doing things .
Your software should serve as a backdrop to this , an enabler and a force multiplier .
But keep in mind that software is never the center of the show .
Stop thinking about your product in terms of code , in terms of technology and features .
Instead , your software is stories , it ’s actions and people doing stuff .
If you have n’t got people doing stuff , then you do n’t actually have software , just a bunch of bytes sitting on a server .
When people change the stuff they ’re doing , your software has changed .
As a designer , you need to be always mindful that you ’re designing spaces , it ’s up to the users to inhabit them .

The always - relevant Onion A.V. Club has coined a term for the type of movie girl - woman whom we 've long despised : the Manic Pixie Dream Girl .
The A.V. Club defines the MPDG as " that bubbly , shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer - directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures . "
Our own Sadie had a fantastic rant about this particular kind of flighty creature , whom she termed " Amazing Girls , " or , ideal muses whose beauty , sweetness and gentle , studied eccentricity renders them entirely docile .
Of all the MPDGs listed by the A.V. Club , the most pernicious of these cinematic sweethearts is far and away Natalie Portman 's irksome moppet in Garden State .
Advertisement
I hated that character from the second she flounced on the screen .
I remember distinctly Portman telling Zach Braff 's character that she was " weird " and then doing a silly little dance to illustrate her " weirdness . "
Honestly ?
Anyone who telegraphs their so - called weirdness so outlandishly is not actually weird , they 're merely quirky enough to be vaguely interesting without having their own thing going on .
They 're completely mainstream but have one really big tattoo , or occasionally sing really loud in the shower !
" Oh , Natalie , " the A.V. Club writes , " your unconventional ways are so inspiring , and your beauty is surprisingly non-threatening ! "
As the A.V. Club deftly notes , " Like the Magical Negro , the Manic Pixie Dream Girl archetype is largely defined by secondary status and lack of an inner life .
She 's on hand to lift a gloomy male protagonist out of the doldrums , not to pursue her own happiness . "
Since they 've defined it so succinctly , I 've realized that many recent films employ the MPDG stock character — Forgetting Sarah Marshall , for instance , where Mila Kunis 's character is a free spirited nymph deposited on the shores of Hawaii in order to encourage Jason Segel to write the vampire rock puppet musical he 's been fantasizing about for years .
But what of the dude ?
You know , the brooding artsy loser in need of a MPDG to revive his creative and sexual juices ?
The ones who use MPDG's to stroke their fragile egos and project their muse - fantasies on ?
What should we call him ?
I think he deserves a name because these movies , and the notion of the MPDG , are really about him : his needs , his desires , his artistic endeavors .

Wimpster , while appropriate , lacks the specificity of MPDG and also is so four years ago .
Maybe the new bromantics , because that term emphasizes their dudeliness but also their childish notions of romantic attachment ?
In any event , these self - absorbed whiners are to be avoided in real life , though , like ( adorable ! )
Jason Segal in FSM , new bromantics can be charming in film .

The world ’s wetlands , threatened by development , dehydration and climate change , could release a planet - warming “ carbon bomb ” if they are destroyed , ecological scientists said on Sunday .

Wetlands contain 771 billion tons of greenhouse gases , one - fifth of all the carbon on Earth and about the same amount of carbon as is now in the atmosphere , the scientists said before an international conference linking wetlands and global warming .
If all the wetlands on the planet released the carbon they hold , it would contribute powerfully to the climate - warming greenhouse effect , said Paulo Teixeira , coordinator of the Pantanal Regional Environment Program in Brazil .
“ We could call it the carbon bomb , ” Teixeira said by telephone from Cuiaba , Brazil , site of the conference .
“ It ’s a very tricky situation . ”
Some 700 scientists from 28 nations are meeting this week at the INTECOL International Wetlands Conference at the edge of Brazil ’s vast Pantanal wetland to look for ways to protect these endangered areas .
Wetlands are not just swamps : they also include marshes , peat bogs , river deltas , mangroves , tundra , lagoons and river flood plains .
Together they account for 6 percent of Earth ’s land surface and store 20 percent of its carbon .
They also produce 25 percent of the world ’s food , purify water , recharge aquifers and act as buffers against violent coastal storms .
Historically , wetlands have been regarded as an impediment to civilization .
About 60 percent of wetlands worldwide have been destroyed in the past century , mostly due to draining for agriculture .
Pollution , dams , canals , groundwater pumping , urban development and peat extraction add to the destruction .
IMAGE PROBLEM
“ Too often in the past , people have unwittingly considered wetlands to be problems in need of a solution , yet wetlands are essential to the planet ’s health , ” said Konrad Osterwalder , UN Under Secretary - General and rector of United Nations University , one of the hosts of the meeting .
So far , the impacts of climate change are minor compared to human depredations , the scientists said in a statement .
As is the case with other environmental problems , it is far easier and cheaper to maintain wetlands than try to rebuild them later .
As the globe warms , water from wetlands is likely to evaporate , rising sea levels could change wetlands ’ salinity or completely inundate them .
Even so , wetland rehabilitation is a viable alternative to artificial flood control for coping with the larger , more frequent floods and severe storms forecast for a warmer world .
Northern wetlands , where permanently frozen soil locks up billions of tons of carbon , are at risk from climate change because warming is forecast to be more extreme at high latitudes , said Eugene Turner of Louisiana State University , a participant in the conference .
The melting of wetland permafrost in the Arctic and the resulting release of carbon into the atmosphere may be “ unstoppable ” in the next 20 years , but wetlands closer to the equator , like those in Louisiana , can be restored , he said .
Teixeira admitted wetlands have an image problem with the public , which is generally well - disposed to saving the rainforest but not the swamp .
“ People do n’t have a good impression about wetlands , because they do n’t know about the environmental service that wetlands provide to us , ” he said .
Recent activity at Ms. Branthover ’s company is telling .
Boyden ’s revenue from placing people in finance jobs was about flat , globally , in the first quarter .
But its placement revenue in Russia was up 73 percent , and in China and Dubai , they were each up more than 300 percent .
In New York , where the market is nearly frozen , revenue from finance job placements was down 24 percent .
JPMorgan Chase , which acquired Bear Stearns when it nearly collapsed in March , is continuing to hire overseas even as it whittles its New York base .
For example , the commodities trading group has hired 126 people in the last year , of which 85 are based abroad in markets like Singapore and Hong Kong .
“ In the past everything was done out of New York , and that was the place to be , ” said Nicolas Aguzin , head of investment banking for JPMorgan in Latin America , which has added bankers in Brazil , Mexico and Colombia over the last year .
“ But now everyone has decided to go local and to go quite aggressively . ”
The acceleration can be seen among senior employees at Morgan Stanley .
In the first six months of 2007 , only 10 of Morgan Stanley ’s managing directors were transferred to countries other than the United States .
That figure has more than tripled  to 33  this year , as executives like Stephen Roach relocated to Hong Kong to become chairman of the bank ’s Asia operations , along with Owen Thomas , who moved there from New York as chief executive .
In addition , five senior Morgan executives were sent to Dubai from London .
“ People understand that this is important .
It ’s clear that growing our franchises in key emerging markets is an important strategic priority , ” said Charlie Stewart , who moved to São Paulo this summer to run investment banking for Morgan Stanley in Latin America .
“ It ’s not like you ’re being shipped off . ”
On top of the foreign transfers , banks are also hiring locally .
In the last six months , Merrill Lynch recruited a team of bankers from Brazil for that office .
JPMorgan Chase has hired in the Middle East and Asia .
( Natural News ) A Nigerian state judge has issued arrest warrants for three top Pfizer officials , saying that they failed to appear in court to face charges of illegally conducting drug trials that led to the deaths of 11 children .
Judge Shehu Atiku , sitting in the city of Kano , said that Nigerian Pfizer head Ngozi Edozien and senior company officials Lare Baale and Segun Donguro failed to appear in court in compliance with a Nov. 6 court order .
The state of Kano is seeking $ 2.6 billion from Pfizer , charging that the company illegally tested an experimental antibiotic , Trovan , on children in Kano during a meningitis outbreak in 1996 .
According to the government , the drug trials were carried out without the informed consent of the children 's parents or the Nigerian government , and led to the deaths of 11 children .
Dozens of other children were allegedly harmed by the drug .
Pfizer insists that the trial was legal , and that the drug saved people 's lives .
In addition to the criminal and civil suits initiated by the state of Kano , the federal government has also filed suit and charges against the corporation .
The Nigerian government seeks $ 7 billion in damages .
United States - based Pfizer said that it would fight the arrest warrants and seek to block their implementation .
This follows Pfizer 's attempts in November to avoid federal prosecution by securing an injunction to prevent police from arraigning any company officials on federal charges .
" What Pfizer has done is what a former governor did to stop EFCC from prosecuting them , " said government lawyer Babatunde Irukera .
" They went to Lagos state , where there is no action pending , to procure an exparte order to stop the police from taking steps to serve criminal summons on its officials .
" That federal case has been adjourned until January 28 , to give prosecutors time to convince the court in Lagos to withdraw the injunction and allow Pfizer officials to be arrested .

Nearly two years after E. coli bacteria traced to California - grown spinach killed three people and sickened 205 , the federal government says it will allow producers of fresh iceberg lettuce and spinach to use irradiation to control food - borne pathogens and extend shelf life .
The Food and Drug Administration is amending the food - additive regulations to provide what it calls the safe use of ionizing radiation for just the two leafy greens .
The FDA also has received petitions seeking permission to use irradiation for other lettuces and many other foods .
The government is allowing the practice in the wake of the major E. coli outbreak in 2006 and numerous other problems with food safety and recalls .
But this wo n't be first time such a technique has been used on food .
Consumers have eaten irradiated meat for years .
Despite some consumer concern , the FDA says irradiation is safe .
" The agency has determined that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment , " reads the FDA 's final rule , released Thursday and effective today .
' Expensive gimmick '
As expected , criticism of the FDA was swift .
Food & Water Watch , a nonprofit consumer rights group that challenges what it calls corporate control and abuse of food and water resources , said that very little testing has been conducted on the safety and wholesomeness of irradiated vegetables .
The group also said the action was off target .
" It is unbelievable that the FDA 's first action on this issue is to turn to irradiation rather than focus on how to prevent contamination of these crops , " said Wenonah Hauter , executive director of Food & Water Watch .
" Instead of beefing up its capacity to inspect food facilities or test food for contamination , all the FDA has to offer consumers is an impractical , ineffective and very expensive gimmick like irradiation . "
On the industry side , there is little demand for irradiation from California growers and shippers of spinach and iceberg lettuce .
" I think that from a growers ' perspective , we have to consider anything that helps us provide safety for consumers , but whether this takes off depends on consumers , " said Cathy Enright , vice president for government affairs for Western Growers , which represents growers , packers and shippers of nearly half of the nation 's fresh fruits , vegetables and nuts .
" In any marketing decision , we have to look at cost in adapting the technology and consumer acceptance , " which will take time to develop , she said .
The petition for the voluntary use of ionizing radiation was filed in 2000 by the Grocery Manufacturers Association .
At the time , said Robert Brackett , the group 's chief scientist , the grocers wanted permission to use irradiation in the preparation of many foods .
However , they amended the petition and asked the government to focus on iceberg lettuce and spinach after the 2006 E. coli outbreak .
The contamination was traced to spinach co-packaged by Dole and Natural Selection Foods in San Juan Bautista ( San Benito County ) .
Spinach virtually vanished from grocery stores as demand plummeted .
" That was a big motivation for us , " said Brackett , in Washington , D.C .
California producers of leafy greens , in the aftermath of the case of the contaminated spinach , formed a voluntary group called the Leafy Green Marketing Agreement , which developed a food safety protocol for its members - nearly all of the major leafy green producers in California .
The approved business practices range from accommodating fieldworker sanitation to preventing animal contamination of leafy green vegetables .
Staved off regulation
The marketing effort also kept the producers steps ahead of attempts at government regulation of the industry .
The marketing group , said its chief executive , Scott Horsfall , was surprised by the government rule announced Thursday , saying , " It 's not something we have talked about in the year and a half we have had the marketing agreement in place . "
He added , " I do not know anyone clamoring for it .
There has to be consumer acceptance .
We do not know how big a hurdle that might be .
The science needs to be looked at and the cost , too . "
Others feel it is a step in the right direction .
The grocers ' association 's Brackett said , " It 's more of a safety net .
No matter how good a job you do with preventative steps - good practices , proper sanitation - there is still a small chance for contamination .
This takes care of those small chances . "
Feral swine
The California spinach was contaminated by feral swine , an investigation later found .
Most of the victims were from Wisconsin and Utah .
William Marler , a Seattle lawyer representing victims of food - borne illness , is handling lawsuits for 103 families affected by the outbreak .
All the suits except four have been resolved , he said Friday .
Marler said the ionizing radiation tool " gives potential consumers more choice . "
He said most of the E. coli problems in recent years have been with mass - produced , bagged product , " and those products are ripe for using some kill step like irradiation to make it safer . "
Marler , along with the Grocery Manufacturing Association , advocates for national food safety oversight regulation and said this week 's FDA rule may prompt more of a discussion about that .
" Everyone would have to play by that rule , " said Marler .
MI5 said 2,000 people are involved in terrorist - related activity
Scotland Yard has disrupted 13 terrorist networks in London in the last financial year .
During the 12 month period , there was an average of a suspected terrorist incident in London every other day .
There were 181 incidents , slightly up on the previous year 's figure of 177 and police took 4,346 calls on the anti-terrorism hotline .
The figures were revealed in a document prepared for the Metropolitan Police Authority .
Its author Supt Neil Haynes , from Scotland Yard 's Specialist Operations unit , said disrupting a network could involve several features .
" Some cases may result in the foiling of a planned major bombing campaign , others may reduce the funding or resources available to mount such an attack , " he said .
Last November , Jonathan Evans , the Director General of the Security Service MI5 , said it was aware of about 2,000 people involved in terrorist - related activity in the UK , and there could possibly be a further 2,000 it was unaware of .
This year Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , said there were 200 terror networks and 30 plots under investigation .
For generations , millions of Roma and Sinti people - often referred to as gypsies - have been excluded from mainstream schools in Europe .
But the European Court of Human Rights ruled last year that this was discrimination , against the continent 's largest ethnic minority .
The BBC's Ray Furlong examines what impact the landmark judgement has had .
There is no sense of victory in Berta Cervenakova 's small flat .
The four children , aged 13 - 18 , still share the same bedroom they did eight years ago , when she first began her ultimately successful law suit against the Czech state .
The dilapidated tenement block in the northern Czech city of Ostrava is now a condemned building .
It does n't make up for the years she 's lost - the years when you learn to read , write , and count
Berta Cervenakova
Last year the European Court acknowledged that Berta 's daughter , Nikola , now 18 , had suffered discrimination by being sent to a special school for mentally disabled children , even though there was nothing wrong with her .
" They took her in for a psychological test .
I was told to wait outside . "
" Then they gave me something to sign , and I signed .
It said she was mentally retarded - but I had no idea what that meant , " she recalls .
She has received 4,000 Euros compensation .
" But that does n't make up for the years she 's lost - the years when you learn to read , write , and count .
I can't even send her shopping .
All she can do now is manual work . "
But the verdict was seen by Roma groups as an important tool to fight a practice that is found across Europe - lawsuits have followed in Greece and Croatia , while other countries have taken steps to desegregate classes .
Attitudes Despite this , real change is slow to filter through .
The Czechs abolished special schools in 2006 as criticism surrounding the court case grew .
Critics say the only change was on the nameplate by the door - and a visit to one former special school in Ostrava seemed to confirm this .
I can't say : tomorrow you have to change the philosophy you 've been teaching with for 20 years
Ondrej Liska , Czech Education Minister
Read your comments
" In the first grade in a normal school , the kids can count to 20 .
Here , they can only count to five - although we want to teach them numbers up to 10 , " says headmaster Jindrich Otzipka at the Ibsen school .
He takes me on a tour .
In the eighth grade , a classroom for 14 - year - olds , a brightly - coloured alphabet is on the wall .
" Normally the children would learn this at fourth grade .
But these kids keep forgetting things , so you have to keep repeating them , " he says .
" I blame the parents .
They do n't read to their kids .
The Roma have no appreciation that you have to apply yourself to get on .
They just live for the day . "
Views like this are commonplace in the Czech Republic , and were also voiced to me by other teachers .
The Czech Education Minister , Ondrej Liska , says changing attitudes is his greatest challenge .
" We can't say to those who teach like this : you have to go .
That would lead to a collapse of the school system . "
" I want to see in two years that teachers in schools with a high percentage of Roma children have appropriate training and I want to see a major shift in these schools - but I can't say : tomorrow you have to change the philosophy you 've been teaching with for 20 years . "
Choices
They do n't send their kids to school because they do n't want them to be white
Radek Bhanga , Roma rapper
But members of the Roma community tell me Roma parents also need to take more responsibility for how their children get on at school .
" I was n't at a special school because my parents were strict with me , " says Radek Bhanga , a Roma rapper who draws large , mixed - race audiences - mixing hip - hop with traditional gypsy sounds .
He has become notorious for challenging what he has called the ' victim mentality ' of Czech Roma .
" Czech people are racist and xenophobic .
But many Gypsies are worse .
They do n't send their kids to school because they do n't want them to be white .
It 's a big mistake .
We can talk about racism .
But we live in a democratic country and everyone can make choices . "
Sinti After talking to Radek , I head for Germany - where there have been similar problems getting Sinti children into mainstream schools .
I want to see what effect 30 years of strident efforts at integration have had .
My visit to the special school in Straubing , Bavaria , is more upbeat than my visit to the school in Ostrava .
The lessons I see seem much more demanding .
But still , the Sinti are massively over - represented .
" The Sinti families see this school as their school , " says headmaster Wolfgang Steinbach .
" They send us their children , and we try to send them back to a normal school .
But they like to have their kids in schools where the other Sinti are . "
Sinti teaching assistants like Manuela and Nadia support children entering mainstream education
They do special classes with Sinti teaching assistants to prepare the children to re-enter mainstream schooling .
In one class , I meet Leo - who will be transferring up to a normal school next year .
Leo is a cheeky , funny character , with podgy cheeks and jet - black hair .
He says the work in this school frustrates him and that new Sinti assistants at the new school will make him feel at home .
But it took a year to persuade his parents to have him transferred .
The experience here is a warning to anyone expecting quick change in the Czech Republic after the Strasbourg ruling .
But Jim Goldston , the lawyer who represented Berta Cervenakova on behalf of the European Roma Rights Centre ( ERRC ) says the judgement is still a crucial moment .
" The parents of many of the children in special or sub - standard schools are themselves the products of a discriminatory educational environment .
That will affect their children 's chances . "
" So there are problems within many affected communities , but the principal burden rests on government to make clear that discrimination must end . "

What are these ?
Here we look at seven self - endangering scientists who only wear lab coats because you can't get explosive - bear - proof tuxedos outside of MI6 .
Each one of these researchers has been voted " Most likely to inject themselves with the Omega Serum while shouting , ' Dammit , there 's no time for testing ! ' "
Scientists have a PR problem .
If TV is to be believed , doctorates are awarded in the form of fishbowl glasses and a tendency to stutter .
Sometimes movies try to help out by portraying action scientists , like in The Core , but usually do more harm than good since it 's generally restricted to truly terrible movies , like in The Core .
6 John Paul Stapp , Scientist and Human Bullet
While other so - called heroes run around saving useless things like kittens and " civilians , " John Paul Stapp looked at jet fighter pilots and thought , " Those poor guys need my help . "
Yes , the manliest profession in the world since " Grizzly Bear Rodeo " was outlawed , and World War II veteran Dr. Stapp was the man who saved them .
He served as a flight surgeon in WWII , and after the war performed critical research on the effects of sudden deceleration on the human body .
His human body .
He used a rocket armed with four rocket engines and a total thrust of 6,000 pounds .
The wider scientific community believed the human body could not survive more than 18 Gs of deceleration -- Stapp hit 35 .
Because he goddamn could .

Above : Science
He became the fastest man in the world , moving faster than a bullet -- 632 miles per hour .
In 1954 he decelerated from 120 miles per hour to 0 in 1.4 seconds , and gained two huge black eyes from the force of his own slammed - forward eyeballs punching him on the inside of the face .
The impact blinded him for two days , during which we must imagine his response was to walk around and simply dare the world to put things in his way .
Oh , and he also broke his back , arm , wrist , lost six fillings and the icing on the cake ?
He got a hernia .
His response ?
He built a bigger rocket .
More Rockets = More Science

He lived to 89 and his research has saved lives around the world ever since .
Oh , and in case Dr. Stapp has n't made a mockery of your life 's work and achievements just yet :
The whole time he he was slinging his own body around like a fleshy cannon shell , he was also running an after - hours clinic for the families of servicemen at the base where he worked , making house calls and providing free medical care .
Every night .
Yeah , you sit up straighter now when you 're reading about a real man , you loser .
TULSA --
A police affidavit alleges child neglect by a 17 - year - old mother whose 2 - month - old son was mauled to death by a family pet .
Police in Tulsa allege that Linzy Earles has a history of drug abuse and was neglectful when her baby , Zane Earles , was eaten alive by a black Labrador puppy at the home of his mother and grandparents , Stan and Holly Earles , on July 28 .
The affidavit says police received a call from the Emergency Medical Services Authority about a reported dog mauling at the home .
When officers arrived , they found that Zane , who had been left unattended in a baby swing for about two hours , had suffered multiple dog bites and had been eaten alive by the puppy .
Authorities pronounced the baby dead at the scene .
When the mauling occurred , Linzy Earles was asleep in her bedroom 65 to 85 feet away from her son at the other end of the house , according to the affidavit .
Initial reports indicated that the baby 's grandmother was also asleep on the far side of the home .
His father and grandfather had left the home earlier that morning .
The affidavit indicates that Linzy Earles was taken off juvenile probation on June 2nd for drug charges .
Police have obtained a search warrant to retrieve blood and hair samples from her to determine whether she was under the influence of alcohol or narcotics during the time that her baby was left unattended and eaten alive , according to the affidavit .
A positive drug test could indicate why she was unable to hear the baby 's screams when he was being mauled , according to the affidavit .
Police have also obtained a search warrant to conduct a decibel test at the home to find out whether the baby 's screams could have been heard from the other end of the house and to collect any bodily fluids that may have been left by the dog when it walked through the home after killing the baby .
The Labrador was taken to the Tulsa Animal Shelter , where it was euthanized at the request of police so that evidence could be recovered from it , Officer Leland Ashley said last week .
It could be several weeks before all of the tests connected to the case are conducted and a report is completed by the state Medical Examiner 's Office .
Family members have declined interviews and have not returned phone calls .
Police have been called to their home three times previously since May 2007 .
In May and June last year , police were dispatched there to investigate reports about a runaway .
In May of this year , they were called to investigate a report of an attempted first - degree burglary .

Well before Senators Barack Obama and John McCain rose to the top of their parties , a partisan shift was under way at the local and state level .
For more than three years starting in 2005 , there has been a reduction in the number of voters who register with the Republican Party and a rise among voters who affiliate with Democrats and , almost as often , with no party at all .
While the implications of the changing landscape for Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain are far from clear , voting experts say the registration numbers may signal the beginning of a move away from Republicans that could affect local , state and national politics over several election cycles .
Already , there has been a sharp reversal for Republicans in many statehouses and governors ’ mansions .
In several states , including the traditional battlegrounds of Nevada and Iowa , Democrats have surprised their own party officials with significant gains in registration .
In both of those states , there are now more registered Democrats than Republicans , a flip from 2004 .
No states have switched to the Republicans over the same period , according to data from 26 of the 29 states in which voters register by party .
( Three of the states did not have complete data . )
In six states , including Iowa , New Hampshire and Pennsylvania , the Democratic piece of the registration pie grew more than three percentage points , while the Republican share declined .
In only three states  Kentucky , Louisiana and Oklahoma  did Republican registration rise while Democratic registration fell , but the Republican increase was less than a percentage point in Kentucky and Oklahoma .
Louisiana was the only state to register a gain of more than one percentage point for Republicans as Democratic numbers declined .
Human activities are cumulatively driving the health of the world 's oceans down a rapid spiral , and only prompt and wholesale changes will slow or perhaps ultimately reverse the catastrophic problems they are facing .
Such is the prognosis of Jeremy Jackson , a professor of oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego , in a bold new assessment of the oceans and their ecological health .
Publishing his study in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , Jackson believes that human impacts are laying the groundwork for mass extinctions in the oceans on par with vast ecological upheavals of the past .
He cites the synergistic effects of habitat destruction , overfishing , ocean warming , increased acidification and massive nutrient runoff as culprits in a grand transformation of once complex ocean ecosystems .
Areas that had featured intricate marine food webs with large animals are being converted into simplistic ecosystems dominated by microbes , toxic algal blooms , jellyfish and disease .
Jackson , director of the Scripps Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation , has tagged the ongoing transformation as " the rise of slime . "
The new paper , " Ecological extinction and evolution in the brave new ocean , " is a result of Jackson 's presentation last December at a biodiversity and extinction colloquium convened by the National Academy of Sciences .
" The purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse , " said Jackson .
" It 's a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long .
If anything , the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways . "
Jeremy Jackson , Scripps Professor of Oceanography .

In the assessment , Jackson reviews and synthesizes a range of research studies on marine ecosystem health , and in particular key studies conducted since a seminal 2001 study he led analyzing the impacts of historical overfishing .
The new study includes overfishing , but expands to include threats from areas such as nutrient runoff that lead to so - called " dead zones " of low oxygen .
He also incorporates increases in ocean warming and acidification resulting from greenhouse gas emissions .
Jackson describes the potently destructive effects when forces combine to degrade ocean health .
For example , climate change can exacerbate stresses on the marine environment already brought by overfishing and pollution .
" All of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems , " Jackson writes in the paper .
Jackson furthers his analysis by constructing a chart of marine ecosystems and their " endangered " status .
Coral reefs , Jackson 's primary area of research , are " critically endangered " and among the most threatened ecosystems ; also critically endangered are estuaries and coastal seas , threatened by overfishing and runoff ; continental shelves are " endangered " due to , among other things , losses of fishes and sharks ; and the open ocean ecosystem is listed as " threatened " mainly through losses at the hands of overfishing .
" Just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered , I looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species , " said Jackson .
" The reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future , we 're going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response that 's necessary to achieve it . "
To stop the degradation of the oceans , Jackson identifies overexploitation , pollution and climate change as the three main " drivers " that must be addressed .
" The challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries , agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do , " he writes .
" So it 's not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments ; the only way to keep one 's sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible . "

During a recent research expedition to Kiritimati , or Christmas Island , Jeremy Jackson and other researchers documented a coral reef overtaken by algae , featuring murky waters and few fish .
The researchers say pollution , overfishing , warming waters or some combination of the three are to blame .

Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko received Leonid Stadnyk ( 36 ) , who , at 2.59 meters , is the world tallest living man .
He presented him with a shiny - blue Chevrolet Tacuma van and even took him for a brief drive .
The four - door car had been modified and specially adapted to the stature of its new owner .
Stadnyk , who 's phenomenal height prevents him from leading a normal life , was overjoyed .
Offering outstanding versatility , a wide range of standard equipment and excellent value for money , the Chevrolet Tacuma is a particularly family - friendly companion .
With its length of 4.35 meters , the compact van takes up no more road space than a conventional station wagon , but it offers added value with its height of 1.58 meters ( without roof rack ) , its variable seating arrangement and attention to everyday details .

The international condemnation of Russian aggression against Georgia  and the concomitant assaults by Abkhazians and South Ossetians against ethnic Georgians within their territories  is in large part appropriate .
But the self - righteous posturing coming out of Washington should be tempered by a sober recognition of the ways in which the United States has contributed to the crisis .
It has been nearly impossible to even broach this subject of the U.S. role .
Much of the mainstream media coverage and statements by American political leaders of both major parties has in many respects resembled the anti-Russian hysterics of the Cold War .
It is striking how quickly forgotten is the fact that the U.S. - backed Georgian military started the war when it brutally assaulted the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali in an attempt to regain direct control of the autonomous region .
This attack prompted the disproportionate and illegitimate Russian military response , which soon went beyond simply ousting invading Georgian forces from South Ossetia to invading and occupying large segments of Georgia itself .
The South Ossetians themselves did much to provoke Georgia as well by shelling villages populated by ethnic Georgians earlier this month .
However , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ruled out signing a non-aggression pact and repeatedly refused to rejoin talks of the Joint Control Commission to prevent an escalation of the violence .
Furthermore , according to Reuters , a draft UN Security Council statement calling for an immediate cease - fire was blocked when the United States objected to “ a phrase in the three - sentence draft statement that would have required both sides ‘ to renounce the use of force . ' ”
Borders and Boundaries
In the Caucasus and Central Asia , the Russian empire and its Soviet successors , like the Western European colonialists in Africa , often drew state boundaries arbitrarily and , in some cases , not so arbitrarily as part of a divide - and - rule strategy .
The small and ethnically distinct regions of South Ossetia , Abkhazia , and Adjara were incorporated into the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic and  on the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991  remained as autonomous regions within the state of Georgia .
Not one of the regions was ethnically pure .
They all included sizable ethnic Georgian minorities , among others .
Despite cultural and linguistic differences , there was not much in the way of ethnic tension during most of the Soviet period , and inter-marriage was not uncommon .
As the USSR fell apart in the late 1980s , however , nationalist sentiments increased dramatically throughout the Caucasus region in such ethnic enclaves as Chechnya in Russia , Nagorno - Karabakh in Azerbaijan , as well as among those within Georgia .
Compounding these nationalist and ethnic tensions was the rise of the ultra-nationalist Georgian President Zviad Gamsakhurdia , who assumed power when the country declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 .
With the possible exception of the Baltic states , Georgia had maintained the strongest sense of nationalism of any of the former Soviet republics , tracing its national identity as far back as the 4th century B.C. as one of most advanced states of its time .
This resurgent nationalism led the newly re-emerged independent Georgia to attempt to assert its sovereignty over its autonomous regions by force .
A series of civil conflicts raged in Georgia in subsequent years , both between competing political factions within Georgia itself as well as in South Ossetia and Abkhazia , resulting in widespread ethnic cleansing .
Backed by Russian forces , these two regions achieved de facto independence while , within Georgia proper , former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze emerged as president and brought some semblance of stability to the country , despite a weak economy and widespread corruption .
Russian troops , nominally in a peacekeeping role but clearly aligned with nationalist elements within the two ethnic enclaves , effectively prevented any subsequent exercise of Georgian government authority over most of these territories .
Meanwhile , the United States became the biggest foreign backer of the Shevardnadze regime , pouring in over $ 1 billion in aid during the decade of his corrupt and semi-authoritarian rule .
The Rose Revolution
Though strongly supported by Washington , Shevardnadze was less well - respected at home .
For example , the New York Times reported how “ Georgians have a different perspective ” than the generous pro-government view from Washington , citing the observation in the Georgian daily newspaper The Messenger that , “ Despite the fact that he is adored in the West as an ‘ architect of democracy ’ and credited with ending the Cold War , Georgians cannot bear their president . ”
Though critical of the rampant corruption and rigged elections , the Bush administration stood by the Georgian regime , as they had the post - Communist dictatorships in Azerbaijan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , and most of the other former Soviet republics .
Georgia enjoyed relatively more political freedom and civil society institutions than most other post - Soviet states .
Nevertheless , high unemployment , a breakdown in the allocation of energy for heating and other needs , a deteriorating infrastructure , widespread corruption , and inept governance led to growing dissatisfaction with the government .
By 2003 , Shevardnadze had lost support from virtually every social class , ethnic group , and geographical region of the country .
Heavy losses by his supporters in parliamentary elections early that November were widely anticipated .
Still , Shevardnadze continued to receive the strong support of President George W. Bush due to his close personal relationship with high - ranking administration officials .
Contributing to this relationship were his pro-Western policies , such as embarking upon ambitious free market reforms under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund , agreeing to deploy 300 Georgian troops to Iraq following the U.S. invasion , and sending Georgian troops trained by U.S. Special Forces to the Pankisi Gorge on the border of Chechnya to fight Chechen rebels .
Opposition leaders Zurab Zhvania and Mikheil Saakashvilli strongly criticized the United States for its continued support of the Georgian president .
In addition to the electoral opposition , a decentralized student - led grassroots movement known as Kmara emerged , calling for an end to corruption and more democratic and accountable government as well as free and fair elections .
Though not directly supported by the Bush administration , a number of Western NGOs , including the Open Society Institute ( backed by Hungarian - American financier George Soros ) and the National Democratic Institute ( supported , ironically , by U.S. congressional funding ) provided funding for election - monitoring and helped facilitate workshops for both the young Kmara activists and mainstream opposition leaders .
This led to some serious tension between these non-governmental organizations and the U.S. embassy in the Georgian capital .
For example , when U.S. ambassador to Georgia Richard Miles learned that some leaders from the successful student - led nonviolent civil insurrection in Serbia three years earlier were in Tbilisi to give trainings to Kmara activists there , he tried to discourage them by telling them that  Shevardnadze is the guarantee for the peace and stability of the region . 
Noting that the United States was providing training and equipment of the Georgian army that anti-government demonstrators would soon be facing down in the streets , he referred to the Kmara as troublemakers . 
Similarly , Miles discouraged Kmara leaders from working with the Serb activists , whom he had known from his prior post as chief of mission in Belgrade , insisting that  Georgia is not the same as Serbia . 
( Despite these efforts , the scheduled trainings in strategic nonviolent action went forward anyway . )
The parliamentary elections that November were marred by a series of irregularities .
These included widespread ballot - stuffing , multiple voting by government supporters , late poll openings , missing ballots , and missing voter lists in opposition strongholds .
These attempts to steal the election elicited little more than finger - wagging from the Bush administration .
The Georgians themselves did not take the situation so lightly , however .
They launched general strikes and massive street protests against what they saw as illegitimate government authority .
This effort was soon dubbed the “ Rose Revolution . ”
Gaining support from the United States only after the success of the nonviolent civil insurrection appeared inevitable , this popular uprising forced Shevardnadze to resign .
Presidential elections , certified as free and fair by international observers , were held two months later , in which opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili emerged victorious .
Four months later , the authoritarian ruler of the autonomous region of Adjara , a Shevardnadze ally , was ousted in a similar nonviolent civil insurrection .
Though not responsible for the change of government itself , the Bush administration soon moved to take advantage of the change the Georgian people brought about after the fact .
U.S. Embrace of Saakashvili
Despite its longstanding support for Shevardnadze , the Bush administration quickly embraced Georgia ’s new president .
Taking advantage of Georgia ’s desperate economic situation , the United States successfully lobbied for a series of additional free market reforms and other neoliberal economic measures on the country , including a flat tax of 14 percent .
Though official corruption declined , tax collection rates improved , and the rate of economic growth increased , high unemployment remained and social inequality grew .
With strong encouragement from Washington , Saakashvili ’s government reduced domestic spending but dramatically increased military spending , with the armed forces expanding to more than 45,000 personnel over the next four years , more than 12,000 of whom were trained by the United States .
Congress approved hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance to Georgia , a small country of less than 5 million people .
In addition , the United States successfully encouraged Israel to send advisers and trainers to support the rapidly expanding Georgian armed forces .
Although facing growing security concerns at home , the Bush administration also successfully pushed Saakashvili to send an additional 1,700 troops to Iraq .
Thus , Georgia increased its troop strength in Iraq by more than 500 percent even as other countries in the U.S. - led multinational force were pulling out .
Though Georgia is located in a region well within Russia ’s historic sphere of influence and is more than 3,000 miles from the Atlantic Ocean , Bush nevertheless launched an ambitious campaign to bring Georgia into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) .
The Russians , who had already seen previous U.S. assurances to Gorbachev that NATO would not extend eastward ignored , found the prospects of NATO expansion to the strategically important and volatile Caucasus region particularly provocative .
This inflamed Russian nationalists and Russian military leaders and no doubt strengthened their resolve to maintain their military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Washington ’s embrace of Saakashvili , like its earlier embrace of Shevardnadze , appears to have been based in large part on oil .
The United States has helped establish Georgia as a major energy transit corridor , building an oil pipeline from the Caspian region known as the BTC ( Baku - Tbilisi - Ceylan ) and a parallel natural gas pipeline , both designed to avoid the more logical geographical routes through Russia or Iran .
The Russians , meanwhile , in an effort to maintain as much control over the westbound oil from the region , have responded by pressuring the governments of Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan to sign exclusive export agreements and to construct natural gas pipelines through Russia .
( See Michael Klare ’s “ Russia and Georgia : All About Oil . ” )
Amid accusations of widespread corruption and not adequately addressing the country ’s growing poverty , Saakashvili himself faced widespread protests in November 2007 , to which he responded with severe repression , shutting down independent media , detaining opposition leaders , and sending his security forces to assault largely nonviolent demonstrators with tear gas , truncheons , rubber bullets , water cannons , and sonic equipment .
Human Rights
Watch criticized the government for using “ excessive ” force against protesters , and the International Crisis Group warned of growing authoritarianism in the country .
Despite this , Saakashvili continued to receive strong support from Washington and still appeared to have majority support within Georgia , winning a snap election in January by a solid majority , which  despite some irregularities  was generally thought to be free and fair .
Lead -up to the Current Crisis
A number of misguided U.S. policies appear to have played an important role in encouraging Georgia to launch its Aug. 6 assault on South Ossetia .
The first had to do with the U.S. - led militarization of Georgia , which likely emboldened Saakashvili to try to resolve the conflict over South Ossetia by military means .
Just last month , the United States held a military exercise in Georgia with more than 1,000 American troops while the Bush administration , according to the New York Times , was “ loudly proclaiming its support for Georgia ’s territorial integrity in the battle with Russia over Georgia ’s separatist enclaves . ”
As the situation was deteriorating last month , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made a high - profile visit to Saakashvili in Tbilisi , where she reiterated the strong strategic relationship between the two countries .
Radio Liberty speculates that Saakashvili “ may have felt that his military , after several years of U.S. - sponsored training and rearmament , was now capable of routing the Ossetian separatists ( ‘ bandits , ’ in the official parlance ) and neutralizing the Russian peacekeepers . ”
Furthermore , Saakashvili apparently hoped that the anticipated Russian reaction would “ immediately transform the conflict into a direct confrontation between a democratic David and an autocratic Goliath , making sure the sympathy of the Western world would be mobilized for Georgia . ”
According to Charles Kupchan of the Council on Foreign Relations , the United States may have caused Saakashvili to “ miscalculate ” and “ overreach ” by making him feel that “ at the end of the day that the West would come to his assistance if he got into trouble . ”
Another factor undoubtedly involved the U.S. push for Georgia to join NATO .
The efforts by some prominent Kremlin lawmakers for formal recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia coincided with the escalated efforts for NATO ’s inclusion of Georgia this spring , as well as an awareness that any potential Russian military move against Georgia would need to come sooner rather than later .
And , as a number of us predicted last March , Western support for the unilateral declaration of independence by the autonomous Serbian region of Kosovo emboldened nationalist leaders in the autonomous Georgian regions , along with their Russian supporters , to press for the independence of these nations as well .
Despite the pro-American sympathies of many in that country , Georgians were notably alarmed by the quick and precedent - setting U.S. recognition of Kosovo .
No Standing to Challenge Russian Aggression
Russia ’s massive and brutal military counter - offensive , while immediately provoked by Georgia ’s attack on South Ossetia , had clearly been planned well in advance .
It also went well beyond defending the enclave to illegally sending forces deep into Georgia itself and inflicting widespread civilian casualties .
It has had nothing to do with solidarity with an oppressed people struggling for self - determination and everything to do with geopolitics and the assertion of militaristic Russian nationalism .
While the international community has solid grounds to challenge Russian aggression , however , the United States has lost virtually all moral standing to take a principled stance .
For example , the brutally punitive and disproportionate response by the Russian armed forces pales in comparison to that of Israel ’s 2006 attacks on Lebanon , which were strongly defended not only by the Bush administration , but leading Democrats in Congress , including presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
Russia ’s use of large - scale militarily force to defend the autonomy of South Ossetia by massively attacking Georgia has been significantly less destructive than the U.S. - led NATO assault on Serbia to defend Kosovo ’s autonomy in 1999 , an action that received broad bipartisan American support .
And the Russian ground invasion of Georgia , while a clear violation of international legal norms , is far less significant a breach of international law as the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , authorized by a large majority in Congress .
This does n’t mean that Russia ’s military offensive should not be rigorously opposed .
However , the U.S. contribution to this unfolding tragedy and the absence of any moral authority to challenge it must not be ignored .

An innocent passer - by was quizzed by police under anti-terror laws - because he took a photo of their patrol car .
David Gates , 42 , saw they were parked illegally at a bus stop and decided to take a snap on his mobile phone .
But he was stunned when the two officers , who were knocking on the door of a nearby house , suddenly turned their attentions to him .
Accounts manager David claims they told him his picture could pose a security risk .
He says they asked him why he had snapped their BMW estate - and told him he was being questioned under the Terrorism Act 2000 , which gave them stop - and - search powers .
David , from Southsea , Hants , says he co-operated fully but reckons it was " ridiculous " that the officers were so heavy handed .
He was forced to give his full details and told a record of the incident would be kept on file for a year .
David , who spotted the police car at a bus stop in Portsmouth , Hants , said : " I explained that I had taken the picture as their car was parked illegally .
And I said that taking a photograph in public was not illegal .
" I told them I thought using the Terrorism Act and suspecting me of being a terrorist was ridiculous . "
Local Lib Dem MP
Mike Hancock agreed that the use of the Terrorism Act in such circumstances seemed " excessive " .
He added : " The whole thing is quite bizarre .
I do n't have a problem with the officers parking at the bus stop , but I do have a problem with them using this legislation for something so trivial .
" If this was used in Portsmouth 50 times in a year , the statistics would make the city look like a hotbed of terrorism . "
But Supt Neil Sherrington , deputy commander for Portsmouth police , claimed his officers - who were dealing with a domestic incident at the time - had acted " reasonably " .
He said : " Police officers are given powers under the Terrorism Act to stop and search .
" The act states that ' this power can only be used for the purposes of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism , and may be exercised whether or not the constable has grounds for suspecting the presence of articles of that kind ' . "
He added : " It is therefore reasonable for the officer in this case to have made reference to the act and been suspicious about why the photograph of the vehicle had been taken . "
Reasonable for the officer to have been suspicious of why photo was taken

Breaking News .
This from the desk of Florida Congressman Robert Wexler , one of the co-sponsors of the 35 articles of impeachment introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich :
“ Capitol Hill is buzzing today with major developments regarding our campaign for impeachment hearings for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Just today , in what could be described as a perfect impeachment storm :
“ After stating unequivocally that impeachment “ is off the table , ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated to CBS News today that the House Judiciary Committee should address the issues that Rep. Kucinich ’s has raised in his impeachment resolution … .
This issue now reaches far beyond the substance of the Judiciary Committee ’s original inquiry regarding the firing of US Attorneys for political purposes .
The crisis at hand relates to our most fundamental laws and of our Constitution .
It is , in many ways , more serious than the Constitutional crisis surrounding Watergate . ”
Nancy Pelosi ’s comments reflect the growing pressure of impeachment supporters on all elected officials and the heat from Cindy Sheehan ’s courageous campaign to unseat her in the coming November elections .
Cindy has made the impeachment of Bush , and Pelosi ’s previous refusal to allow impeachment to proceed , a centerpiece of her campaign .

An internal investigation at the Utica Police Department has since exonerated the unnamed officers of any wrongdoing , officials said .
Still , Garrett ’s allegations remain tucked away within sealed court documents .
The nature of the accusations and the identities of the accused officers remains a secret .
The accusations may have been entirely bogus , although it 's not clear what Garrett would gain by inventing a story that the government would not be predisposed to believe .
Ratting out a competing drug dealer or anyone else he knew would have been a smarter move .
The local district attorney says other suspects have " accused local police officers of playing a role in drug - trafficking or gun-selling operations " but that none of those accusations have ever been proved to be true .
Maybe that 's because the police do n't rely just on the word of a snitch when they investigate a police officer , as they often do when investigating other suspects .
Utica Public Safety Commissioner Daniel LaBella has a theory about why Garrett might have falsely accused the police :
“ A lot of times people make allegations against police officers to defer attention away from their own criminal matters , ” LaBella said .
A lot of times people make allegations against all sorts of other people to deflect attention from their own crimes .
That 's why accusations made by criminals should rarely be credited , even though they 're the driving force behind a large share of federal drug prosecutions .
The larger point is that snitches always have an incentive to fabricate .
Even when they accurately identify another criminal , they often make that offender seem worse than he is ( " yeah , man , he moves 20 keys a week for sure " ) with the expectation that they 'll get more brownie points for frying a big fish than they will for a small one .
As for Garrett , federal prosecutors did n't like the fact that he accused the cops of mischief , and have moved to revoke his plea deal .
Garrett in turn has moved to withdraw his guilty plea .
His sentencing has been postponed until the mess gets straightened out .
Eighteen months into the 110th Congress , federal investigators are still taking a hard look at the 109th , adding to the incredible tally of lawmakers from that body to reportedly be investigated by the FBI for corruption .
Recently revealed investigations of two former lawmakers bring that total to 21 .
Some of those 21 investigations have closed with no charges , some seem dormant , some are ongoing , and some have resulted in convictions .
Since the FBI does n't comment on ongoing investigations , it 's often hard to determine the status .
But the total clearly demonstrates that public corruption is one of the FBI 's top priorities .
The FBI told us the number of agents focusing on public corruption jumped by more than 56 percent in the past several years -- from 451 agents in fiscal 2001 to 705 in fiscal 2008 .
Last Friday , the FBI raided a New York lobbying firm as part of an investigation by the Justice Department 's Public Integrity Section into ex-Rep.
John Sweeney ( R - NY ) .
And a former aide to ex-Rep.
Ernest Istook ( R - OK ) pleaded guilty last week to accepting gifts from Jack Abramoff 's lobbying firm in exchange for help with Abramoff clients .
Below is a rundown of all 21 lawmakers , current and former .
Ten of them are no longer in office .
Investigations of seven are part of the Abramoff investigation .
Seventeen are Republicans , four are Democrats .
This total , based on prosecutorial filings and unambiguous news reports , does not include at least three reported federal investigations of lawmakers for matters other than corruption , including Ex - Rep. Mark Foley ( R - FL ) .
All the lawmakers , with the exception of those who have pleaded guilty , deny wrongdoing .
Two of those investigations resulted in convictions :
Ex -Rep. Duke Cunningham ( R - CA ) pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from two defense contractors in 2005 .
He 's currently serving a sentence of eight years , four months in prison .
Ex -Rep. Bob Ney ( R - OH ) pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from Jack Abramoff and his associates in September of 2006 and was sentenced to 30 months in prison .
After serving one year , he was released to a halfway house , which he 's likely to leave at the end of the summer .
Two lawmakers have been charged :
Rep. William Jefferson ( D - LA ) was indicted last June on bribery charges , but extensive litigation stemming from an FBI raid of his Congressional office has delayed the trial .
Rep. Rick Renzi ( R - AZ ) was indicted in February on extortion , wire fraud , money laundering and other charges .
He has also yet to go to trial and has said he will not seek reelection .
Four current and former lawmakers appear to still be under investigation related to the Abramoff scandal :
A grand jury has issued a number of subpoenas regarding ex-Rep .
Tom DeLay 's ( R - TX ) and his wife 's relationship with Abramoff .
Two of his former aides have pleaded guilty to corruption charges , but DeLay has not been charged .
FBI agents raided the Virginia home of Rep. John Doolittle ( R - CA ) and his wife in April of 2007 as part of the Abramoff investigation .
But he also still has n't been charged .
He 's not seeking reelection .
Ex -Rep. Ernest Istook ( R - OK ) appeared as " Representative # 4 " in guilty plea documents of his former aide John Albaugh .
The filing describes a 2003 conversation between Istook and Abramoff , during which the lawmaker thanked the lobbyist for providing a skybox at FedEx Field for a fundraiser and then asked what appropriations Abramoff 's clients could use .
Istook says he 's met with investigators and has been told he's not " a target " of the investigation .
However , prosecutors typically only issue a " target letter " as a warning that they are moving toward filing charges .
Albaugh has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduction in sentence .
Istook did not seek reelection in 2006 , instead making a failed gubernatorial bid .
In the spring of 2007 , FBI agents sought emails and other documents related to Rep. Tom Feeney 's ( R - FL ) participation in a 2003 Scotland trip organized and paid for by Jack Abramoff .
Feeney has started a legal defense fund to cover fees related to the investigation .
Eight lawmakers are apparently under investigation for other matters :
Grand jury subpoenas issued in the Ex - Rep. John Sweeney ( R - NY ) investigation reportedly focus on earmarks he obtained for clients of a lobbying firm that employed his wife .
The New York Timesreports the investigation is also part of the Abramoff investigation , but it 's unclear how precisely .
Ex -Rep. Curt Weldon ( R - PA ) lost re-election in 2006 after the FBI raided his daughter 's home and office , among other locations .
The investigation reportedly centers on his advocacy for his daughter ’s lobbying clients .
A former aide has pleaded guilty to accepting corrupt payments from a Russian non-profit .
A federal grand jury in Washington has been investigating whether Ex - Rep. Jim Gibbons ( R - NV ) accepted illegal gifts from a defense contractor .
Rep. Don Young ( R - AK ) has spent over $ 1 million on criminal defense lawyers , but has refused to discuss the nature of the allegations .
The Wall Street Journalreported last year that federal investigators were examining whether Young had accepted bribes , illegal gratuities or unreported gifts from VECO Corp. , an Alaska energy company .
The FBI is also investigating whether Sen . Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) accepted such payments or gifts from Veco .
The FBI searched his home last summer .
Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R - CA ) has paid more than $ 1 million in legal fees since June of 2006 in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Attorney ’s Office for Los Angeles .
The probe reportedly centers on Lewis ’ earmarks for clients of his longtime friend , lobbyist Bill Lowery .
Federal grand jury subpoenas issued in September of 2006 focused on Sen. Robert Menendez 's ( D - NJ ) relationship with a publically funded nonprofit group to whom he 'd rented office space .
In August 2007 the grand jury shifted focus to the lobbying work of his former chief of staff Kay LiCausi .
No charges have been filed .
Both Menendez and LiCausi have retained lawyers .
Rep. Alan Mollohan ( D - WV ) has been under investigation since May 2006 for earmarks to nonprofits he created .
The grand jury subpoenaed at least one witness , in June 2007 , to testify about his finances .
According to Roll Call , he spent about $ 80,000 on legal fees in the second half of 2007 .
There have been no reported developments in two investigations for 18 months :
The FBI interviewed a number of Ex - Rep. Katherine Harris ' ( R - FL ) aides as part of investigation into her relationship with defense contractor Mitchell Wade , who 's pleaded guilty to bribing Duke Cunningham .
There have been no reported developments in the case since late 2006 , when she made a failed bid for the Senate .
Federal agents interviewed officials in Monrovia and Fontana about several of Rep. Gary Miller ’s ( R - CA ) land deals with the California cities .
The Los Angeles Timesreported in the summer of 2006 that Miller may have improperly avoided paying millions in capital gains taxes by mischaracterizing the sales as forced by eminent domain .
The scope of that investigation , which involved the FBI , was always unclear , and there have been no reported developments since early 2007 .
Miller has consistently and vigorously denied any wrongdoing .
Three investigations have either been closed or gone dormant :
Ex -Rep. J.D. Hayworth ( R - AZ ) , who was the second largest congressional recipient of gifts from Jack Abramoff and his associates , says his lawyers were told by investigators in December of 2007 that the investigation of his relationship with Abramoff had been closed .
Ex -Sen. Conrad Burns ( R - MT ) was similarly notified around the same time .
Both Hayworth and Burns lost reelection in 2006 , in large part because of the Abramoff scandal .
A Justice Department probe in 2005 centered on whether Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) had sought to aid the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in return for AIPAC 's help in persuading House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) to appoint Harman chair of the intelligence committee .
The probe had found no evidence of wrongdoing and and was considered dormant , the Washington Postreported in late 2006 .
Matthew Schwarzfeld and Matthew Townsend provided reporting for this story .
“ In and of itself , ” said Elon Musk , “ a $ 100,000 sports car is not going to change the world . ”
Mr. Musk is a 37 - year - old technology entrepreneur who became extremely wealthy when eBay bought PayPal , which he had co-founded .
A lanky South African , he is using that wealth to finance two quixotic efforts .
The first is SpaceX , a company he hopes will one day make it possible to colonize Mars .
( I kid you not . )
The second is Tesla Motors , which was started in 2003  Mr. Musk became its chief backer and board chairman in early 2004 .
After raising $ 150 million and going through four years of technological and internal struggles , the company has begun manufacturing the first - ever all - electric sports car , the Tesla Roadster .
Its base price is $ 109,000 .
And if Mr. Musk is willing to concede that the Roadster , by itself , is n’t a world - changer , he fervently believes that the technology Tesla has created  technology that gives the car a range of 227 miles per battery charge , and enough acceleration to go from zero to 60 in under 4 seconds  will indeed change the world .
The age of the electric car , he is convinced , has dawned .
The Tesla Roadster is a gorgeous sports car .
That ’s not a surprise : one of Tesla ’s goals was to prove that an electric car did n’t have to look stodgy  or resemble something out of “ The Jetsons . ”
Tesla ’s other goal , though , was to show that an electric vehicle could provide a driving experience that was a good or better than any finely tuned sports car .
They appear to have succeeded at that as well .
“ My experience was highly positive , ” said Don Sherman , the technical editor at Automobile magazine who test - drove it last December .
“ It was a very exciting , very interesting piece of work that I found quite appealing . ”
Though I ’m no auto expert , I ’d have to agree .
I took the wheel for an hour last week and came away exhilarated by how quickly it accelerated , and how beautifully it handled .
For the first time in my life , I had car lust .
RNC ad , was cut , sent out before package failed
The Republican National Committee 's new advertisement critical of the the Wall Street " bailout " was produced and sent to television stations in key states before the package failed , officials at two stations said .
" Wall Street Squanders our money .
And Washington is forced to bail them out with -- you guessed it -- our money .
Can it get any worse ? " asks the ad's narrator , as the words " BAILOUT WITH OUR MONEY " cross the screen .
( The answer : Obama 's plans would make it worse . )
The ad , however , seems to assume that it can safely attack a successful plan .
And the reason may be the timing :
Though it started airing this morning , the spot was released to stations yesterday morning , ad executives at stations in Michigan and Pennsylvania said .
Kae Buck of WLNS in Lansing said her station received the at at 7:55 a.m. Monday .
Luanne Russell of Pittsburgh 's WTAE said her station received it at 10:49 Monday morning .
The ad taps into deep resentment of the plan , but it comes at a time when the candidate it supports , John McCain , is urging its package , and asking that it not be referred to as a " bailout , " but a " rescue . "
Asked about the ad's relationship to the congressional legislation , the consultant heading up the RNC 's expenditure , Brad Todd , responded in an email that Obama is its focus .
" This ad is about Barack Obama ’s spending plan , " he said .
" Last Friday in the debate he struggled to name even one spending proposal he would responsibly trim in light of the economic crisis and any potential bailout plan .
Senator Obama clings to his big spending approach even today and our ad campaign will focus attention on that irresponsible position . "
UPDATE : Asked if he has any regrets about an ad that seems to cut against McCain 's message , Todd reiterated his criticism of the fact that Obama has n't altered spending plans in light of the crisis , and added : " In all seriousness .... what planet are you on ? "
Freddie , Fannie shares sink on bailout concerns The Associated Press
Published : Friday July 11 , 2008
Print This Email This By ALAN ZIBEL WASHINGTON -- Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plummeted Friday as Wall Street and Washington became more convinced that the government is likely to bail out the nation 's key mortgage financiers .
Freddie Mac shares fell $ 2.91 , or 36.4 percent , to $ 5.09 in late - morning trading , while Fannie Mae fell $ 3.80 , or 28.7 percent , to $ 9.40 .
Both are at 17 - year lows .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sought for the second - straight day to calm investors panicked about out the financial state of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , saying the agency aims to keep the mortgage finance companies " in their current form " without a government takeover .
The financial health of the companies is of critical concern to Washington policymakers because of the crucial role Fannie and Freddie play in the housing market .
The pair hold or guarantee more than $ 5 trillion worth of mortgages .
That 's roughly half of the $ 9.5 trillion debt of the United States .
The fear is that a failure of one or both would wreak havoc on the nation 's financial system and the broader economy .
Paulson 's comments came amid reports that the government was considering a plan to take over one or both of the companies and place them in a conservatorship .
The Treasury chief said his department is " maintaining a dialogue with regulators and with the companies . "
The companies ' main regulator will continue to work with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac " as they take the steps necessary to allow them to continue to perform their important mission , " Paulson said .
" I think everybody 's just holding their breath in expectation that something substantive from the government will happen today or over the weekend , " said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner of consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics in Washington .
The companies ' troubles are more a result of market perceptions than a changed financial picture at the two companies , Petrou said .
" External reality does n't warrant such an action , but external reality seems no longer to matter , " she said .
Under a 1992 law , if either company fell into financial trouble , the government could take over their operations by placing it in a conservatorship .
That process could be used to keep operations going at Fannie and Freddie , but shareholders would likely see their investments erased , and the companies ' ability to support the mortgage market could be reduced .
" Typically when this happens the business is a shell of its former self , " said Louisiana State University banking professor Joseph Mason .
" Shareholders are n't going to like it , managers and directors are n't going to like it , but it 's not about whether they like it . "
Wachovia Corp. economist Jay Bryson said the two mortgage giants could face a replay of the near - collapse in March of investment bank Bear Stearns Cos .
A lack of market confidence could make it difficult for Fannie and Freddie to raise funding through debt sales , he said .
" It becomes a liquidity issue , rather than a solvency issue , " Bryson said .
The New York Times reported Friday the government was considering taking over the operations of one or both of the companies , adding to fears that have mounted this week .
Representatives from Fannie and Freddie were not immediately available for comment Friday morning .
Fannie and Freddie play a crucial role in providing funding for home loans by buying up mortgages and packaging them as investments .
If they are unable to operate , the implications could be dire .
" Without them , our economy would collapse , " Piper Jaffray analyst Robert P. Napoli said in a note to clients .
Napoli lowered his target on Freddie to $ 9 per share from $ 28 , and on Fannie to $ 15 per share from $ 30 .
On Thursday , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight - the companies ' chief regulator - said both remain " adequately capitalized , " after Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke sought to calm investors jitters in testimony on Capitol Hill .
Reassurances by government officials do not appear to be working .
" We doubt anyone will listen as fear is so high , " Napoli said .
Congress created Fannie in 1938 and Freddie in 1970 to keep money flowing into the home - loan market by buying up mortgages and bundling them into securities for sale to investors worldwide - thereby making home ownership affordable for low - and middle - income Americans .

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , CUBA ( Reuters ) - Guantanamo’s only convict was moved to a prison wing all by himself hours after U.S. military jurors found him guilty of driving Osama bin Laden , his lawyers said .
But if convicted Yemeni captive Salim Hamdan behaves , he ’ll get to see as many as 10 movies before his 66 - month sentence runs out on New Year ’s Eve .
Still , serving out his sentence does not mean he will walk free .
“ He ’ll still be retained as an enemy combatant , ” Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters .
“ But as an enemy combatant , he then becomes ... eligible for the annual review board process to determine whether he ’s eligible for release or transfer . ”
Hamdan ’s move to a wing by himself marked his change in status from “ detainee ” to “ prisoner ” on Wednesday , when he was convicted of a crime -- providing material support for terrorism by driving bin Laden around Afghanistan in a truck and occasionally acting as his bodyguard and weapons courier .
The U.S. military considers the other 264 or so suspected Taliban and al Qaeda captives held at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. naval base in Cuba to be in detention to prevent them from returning to the global battlefield .
Another Pentagon spokesman , Navy Cmdr. J.D. Gordon , said late on Thursday that Hamdan still would be allowed library books , outdoor recreation periods and access to the “ movie night initiative . ”
Officials at the base recently began allowing captives in the maximum - security camps to watch one movie every two weeks , alone in a room with a small couch .
It is offered as a reward for good behavior and part of what the detention commander , Rear Adm .
Dave Thomas , called an attempt to provide more intellectual stimulation for men who have been locked up for as many as 6 - 1 / 2 years .
He said they can view commercially available films but not videos from home .
Hamdan , a small man with a short , neat beard and curly black hair , wears the tan uniform of a compliant captive rather than one of the orange jumpsuits reserved for troublemakers .
DIGG THIS
What follows are a few of the basic premises on which I base my thinking .
You might or might not agree with them , but may I suggest that you make a list of your own basic premises .
It will help you clarify your thinking .
Government is inherently incompetent , and no matter what task it is assigned , it will do that task in the most expensive and inefficient way possible .
The American government is corrupt from top to bottom .
If you rely on the mass media to inform you about your community , state and nation , you will , with rare exceptions , be woefully ignorant of what is really going on .
The universal franchise is a bad idea .
The notion that the destiny of the nation should be put in the hands of ignoramuses , parasites , boobs , party hacks and idiots is absurd on its face .
Public education in America is a failure and is so flawed it can not be reformed .
Not much has changed in the past 5,000 years of human history .
All of that might sound cynical , but it really is n’t .
True conservatives have argued for years that government , even a benign one , is like a clumsy , retarded giant , and therefore you have to be careful to limit what tasks you assign it .
You can make a career out of just criticizing obvious bloopers committed by the various departments of government , because they all commit them .
The Romans built roads that are still around , but states today continue to build roads that will pothole and crack within a year , sometimes sooner .
Look at the federal airport - security people .
They take nail trimmers away from grandmothers but allow real weapons to get through .
And so on and so on .
As for the news media , since most media companies are now controlled by a handful of corporations whose sole interest is in maintaining a high profit margin , you are getting mostly fluff instead of hard news .
Hard news is labor - intensive .
It is cheaper to go with the fluff .
Thomas Jefferson ’s theoretical belief in a free press soon foundered on the reality , and he came to despise it .
He advised one young man never to read newspapers , since it was better to be ignorant than misinformed .
As for government corruption , it ’s all around us .
Sure , there are honest public officials , but the system itself is corrupt .
It now requires so much money to run for office that the field is narrowed to bored millionaires and office - seekers willing to take as much money as they can from anywhere they can get it .
That ’s why Congress pays no attention to the people .
It pays attention to the suppliers of campaign funds — not to mention junkets , fancy vacations and off - the - radar business deals .
As for the universal franchise , the problem with that is obvious .
People who wish to vote should at least be required to pass the same test given to immigrants who want to become citizens .
A lot of voters are not even sure what state they live in — or what century , for that matter .
How can people who are ignorant of history , economics and basic science make an intelligent choice for a national leader ?
They can’t .
They will go with the demagogue .
And , of course , it is public education that is mass - producing these ignoramuses .
Imagine people completing 16 years of formal education and not knowing how to spell , punctuate or use their native language correctly .
Imagine college graduates who know virtually nothing about their country ’s history or geography .
As for the final premise , it is simply a reminder to utopians : Human beings are selfish , flawed and fallible animals .
They always have been , they are now , and they always will be .
Therefore , any human institution , public or private , will reflect those flaws .
If you want perfection , plant a rosebush .

W trailer leaks : Film follows
Bush from drunkard to president

From drunken buffoon to president
A leaked trailer for Oliver Stone 's new biopic W suggests the film will focus on George W. Bush 's transition from youthful drunken lout to President of the United States with one question in mind : Just how did this happen ?
The 90 - second trailer appeared online Sunday night , ahead of its official debut Monday on tabloid TV show Access Hollywood .
It was quickly pulled from YouTube but remained on DailyMotion and is reproduced below .
The trailer suggests the film will examine a difficult relationship between President Bush and his father , who is portrayed as disappointed in his son 's youthful indiscretions .
" What are you cut out for ?
Partying ?
Chasing tail ?
Driving drunk ? "
George H. W. Bush , played by James Cromwell , asks the title character , played by Josh Brolin .
" Who do you think you are , a Kennedy ?
You 're a Bush dammit !
Act like one . "
Stone 's quickly crafted biopic is scheduled for an Oct. 17 release , just two weeks before this year 's presidential election .
Republican nominee John McCain has been saddled with Bush ' abysmal approval ratings , and such an unflattering portrayal of his party 's standard - bearer for the last eight years is unlikely to help his chances against Democrat Barack Obama .
Instant reviews have been mixed for the latest offering from the widely acclaimed director , whose previous films have examined the assassination of John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon 's presidency and the 9/11 attacks .
" I love Oliver Stone when hes working at peak form , but bad oliver Stone is almost too painful to contemplate .
I had no idea what to expect from W. , and until this teaser trailer , I wasnt excited , " writes a reviewer at Ain't It Cool News .
" I am now . "
Writing at the political satire site Wonkette , editor Ken Layne was less impressed .
" Just looks terrible , all around , " he writes .
" Of course , no biopic could ever compare with the rancid stupid tragedy that is the life of George W. Bush , who should have been cremated at birth . "

On July 15th Financial
Week reported GM to cut jobs , bonuses , and dividend to stave off fears over bankruptcy .
General Motors today said it will improve its finances through 2009 by laying off salaried workers , making more cuts in truck production , suspending its dividend and borrowing at least $ 2 billion as it rides out its worst U.S. sales in a decade .
In total , the automaker said it expects to improve its cash position by $ 15 billion through the end of 2009 .
" We are responding aggressively to the challenges of today 's U.S. auto market , " CEO Rick Wagoner said in a statement .
" We will continue to take the steps necessary to align our business structure with the lower vehicle sales volumes and shifts in sales mix .
" Today 's actions , combined with those of the past several years , position us not only to survive this tough period in the U.S. but to come out of it as a lean , strong and successful company . "
GM said at the end of the first quarter 2008 it had liquidity of $ 23.9 billion , with access to an additional $ 7 billion in credit .
While GM contends it has enough liquidity through 2008 , it said the actions announced today will cushion it against a prolonged U.S. downturn .
Wagoner Is Disingenuous
General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. , Chrysler LLC and U.S. auto - parts makers are seeking $ 50 billion in government - backed loans , double their initial request , to develop and build more fuel - efficient vehicles .
The U.S. automakers and the suppliers want Congress to appropriate $ 3.75 billion needed to back $ 25 billion in U.S. loans approved in last year 's energy bill and add $ 25 billion in new loans over subsequent years , according to people familiar with the strategy .
The industry is also seeking fewer restrictions on how the funding is used , the people said today .
Presidential candidate and presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain today gave his support to the proposal .
" Our auto companies are rising to the challenge building the next generation of American cars , but are doing so in times when credit conditions cripple the funding for the facilities and technologies to take the steps to the future , " he said in an e- mailed statement .
" We should fund it and take action that will assist Detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition , " he said in the statement .
My Comment
" This is a horrible idea , another transfer of funds to failed ventures , " said David Littmann , senior economist for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in Midland , Michigan , which describes itself as a supporter of free - market ideals .
" If this were a good idea , the market would price the debt accordingly and give them the money . "
" We 've seen these kinds of bailouts for the financial companies , why not the automakers ? " said Aaron Bragman , a Troy , Michigan - based auto analyst for Global Insight Inc .
" The big problem is that a lot of people in Washington do n't see a value in the U.S. auto industry because they have a foreign plant in their district that is doing just fine . "

Setting up Django and mod_wsgi¶
I was just convinced to setup mod_wsgi on my server instead of mod_python , and I ’m going to write up how I did it .
All of the documentation I found on the internet was really hard to follow , so I ’m going to distill it here the best that I can .
This is assuming Ubuntu 8.04 Server Edition .
Update : Take note , this is installing mod_wsgi 1.3 .
The latest version of the package is 2.3 .
If you want to get the latest version from apt , you should use the Debian 2.3 package
Step 1 : apt - get install libapache2 - mod- wsgi
This should automatically install mod_wsgi into your apache instance and install it .
Step 2 : Create an apache directory on your filesystem , presumably inside of your Django project .
I keep my code in ~/ Python / Project , so I did :
mkdir ~/ Python / PROJECT / apache vim ~/ Python / PROJECT / apache / django .
wsgi
Then in that file you need to copy this code :
import os , sys sys .
path .
append ( '/ home/eric / Python/PROJECT
' ) os .
environ [ ' DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE ' ] = ' PROJECT.settings ' import django.core.handlers.wsgi application = django .
core .
handlers .
wsgi .
WSGIHandler ()
This creates an interface between Django and WSGI , as far as I can tell .
If you start getting errors about not seeing your project or modules , try adjusting and / or adding some things to your sys. path .
Step 3 :
Inside your /etc / apache2 / directoy , you will find the directory sites - available / .
This is where you are going to put your configuration for your server .
Presumably it will have a file called default in it that you will edit .
So :
In /etc / apache2 / sites - available / default :
< VirtualHost * : 80 > ServerAdmin eric @ericholscher .
com ServerName ericholscher .
com ServerAlias www .
ericholscher .
com DocumentRoot / var / www / LogLevel warn WSGIDaemonProcess ericholscher processes = 2 maximum - requests = 500 threads = 1 WSGIProcessGroup ericholscher WSGIScriptAlias / / home / eric / Python / PROJECT / apache / django .
wsgi Alias / media / var / www / media / </ VirtualHost >
The last 3 lines of WSGI stuff if what you want to pay attention to .
You are pointing WSGIScriptAlias to the file we created in Step 2 .
The other two WSGI prompts are n’t necessary unless you are running multiple sites on your server .
The Alias is so that the / media URLs on your site continue to work , it should point to where ever you have your media files stored .
Hopefully this will get you started along the way to setting up mod_wsgi on Apache with Django .
If not , feel free to leave comments or email me
EDIT : Someone in the comments pointed out this website on the mod_wsgi wiki is also helpful : Integration with Django
There appears to be a page on the Django WIki as well if you need more pointers .
For weeks , pressure has been mounting in Congress to approve more domestic oil drilling , but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has held the line , using her power to block a vote on offshore drilling .
President Bush has made almost daily calls for Democratic leaders to take action .
House GOP leaders , citing a new poll showing that a slim majority of Californians now favor offshore drilling , issued a release Thursday saying " even ( Pelosi's ) own California neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off American coasts . "
GOP lawmakers are so disgruntled they 're urging Bush to deny Congress its August break by calling a special session on energy .
Some Democrats wary
Even some Democrats are getting antsy , fearing the party 's stance could hurt them in the fall elections .
But Pelosi , who has opposed offshore drilling throughout her two decades in Congress , insists opening new areas to drilling wo n't lower gas prices in the short term .
She believes a vote would only help the GOP blame Democrats for high gas prices .
" I will not ... give the administration an excuse for its failure , " Pelosi said at an end - of - session roundtable interview Thursday .
Republicans have put a bull 's - eye on the federal moratorium on coastal drilling , which has kept most of the East and West coasts off limits to new oil rigs since 1982 .
Bush announced earlier this month that he would lift the presidential moratorium on drilling , and the GOP is now seeking to lift the congressional ban .
Pelosi drew derision from her critics for telling the Web site Politico this week that she was blocking a vote on offshore drilling because " I 'm trying to save the planet . "
But she elaborated on that theme Thursday , saying she sees energy independence and fighting global warming as " my flagship issue . "
She said she will use her power to resist a policy that could increase the country 's oil dependency .
" I 'm not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big - picture view - a vision about an energy - independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels ... and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment , " she said .
Republicans are quietly gleeful at Pelosi 's tactics , which have only breathed more life into an issue the GOP is clinging to as a lifeline in an otherwise grim year for the party .
Some House Republicans said Thursday that they will ask Bush to order a special session of Congress in August if lawmakers adjourn this week , as expected , without voting on drilling .
While a special session is unlikely , House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , made clear that his party plans to use the issue as a bludgeon against Democrats throughout the five - week August recess .
" A solid majority of Americans want us to have more drilling for more American - made energy , and they are n't going to take no for an answer , " Boehner said Thursday .
" Speaker Pelosi , Senators ( Harry ) Reid and ( Barack ) Obama are defying the will of the American people , and they 're doing so at their own risk . "
Some Democrats have already started to shift their views .
Rep. Tim Holden , D - Pa. , who voted two years ago against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and for a federal ban on offshore drilling , told a hometown paper last weekend he now wants to " drill everywhere . "
A new CNN / Opinion Research poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans favor more offshore drilling , while 30 percent oppose it .
But the poll found the public was split over whether more coastal drilling would lower gas prices , with 51 percent saying yes and 49 percent saying no .
But the poll 's more interesting finding was about who Americans blame for $ 4 - a - gallon gas prices :
About two - thirds said oil companies and foreign countries that produce energy were the major causes .
Just over half blamed the Bush administration , the war in Iraq and the moratorium on offshore drilling .
But only about 1 in 3 - 31 percent - blamed Democrats in Congress for high gas prices .
A GOP opening in the fall ?
" Republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue ( to push for ) domestic drilling , but we have n't seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that it 's hurting Democrats , " said Nathan Gonzales , political editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Report , which tracks House and Senate races .
" Maybe this fall the issue will develop into a Republican advantage , but I do n't see that we 're there yet , " he said .
" It 's a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of Democrats . "
Pelosi has been holding votes on measures aimed at addressing gas prices , such as legislation to crack down on speculators in energy commodity markets and a measure to force Bush to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
But here 's the catch :
The bills have won majority support , but failed to get the two - thirds backing needed to pass under special rules Pelosi has used to keep Republicans from offering a drilling measure on the House floor .
Democratic leaders fear such a measure might draw enough support to pass .
The issue is likely to heat up again this fall .
Republicans are debating whether to shut down the federal government - by blocking a continuing resolution to keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30 - if Democrats do n't allow a vote on offshore drilling .
Theodor Seuss Geisel was n't actually a doctor ( at least not until his alma mater , Dartmouth , gave him an honorary PhD ) , but his unique poetic meter and leap - off - the - page illustrations made him one of the most successful children 's writers in history ( over 220 million books sold ) .
Here are five stories about the man behind such classics as The Cat in the Hat and Oh , the Places You 'll Go !
1. Dr. Seuss came from a long line of German brewmasters , which perhaps explains how he came to throw a drunken bash during his Dartmouth days .
Due to school policy ( and also federal law , since Prohibition forbade drinking in those days ) ,
Ted 's excellent adventure got him fired from his position at The Dartmouth Jack - O - Lantern , the college 's humor magazine .
But the wily Geisel never let The Man keep him down :
He kept writing for the Jack - O - Lantern , adopting the pseudonym " Seuss " ( his middle name ) .
2 . In 1960 , publisher Bennett Cerf bet Dr. Seuss $ 50 that Seuss could n't write a book using only 50 different words .
So Seuss wrote Green Eggs and Ham , which became an instant picture book classic .
( Incidentally , Cerf apparently never paid up . )
Green Eggs and Ham marked the apex of Seuss 's minimalist - vocabulary period , and it was an awfully impressive feat ( we used 50 different words just to tell you about it ) .
3 . Before he started speaking for the trees , Dr. Seuss was working for big oil .
For fifteen years he wrote and designed ads for the corporate monolith Standard Oil .
In a series of ads hawking Standard 's pesticide Flit , Geisel coined the popular catchphrase , " Quick , Henry , the Flit ! " which was sort of the " Mikey likes it ! " of its time .
4. When Dr. Seuss Goes to War , a collection of Geisel 's World War II–era cartoons created for PM magazine , was published in 1999 , the American public was stunned .
How could the author of peace - loving , Truffula Tree–hugging children 's books have penned wartime cartoons that attacked Japanese Americans and depicted the Japanese as bucktoothed buffoons ?
Some argued that Seuss was only reflecting his times ; others argued that racism is racism ( regardless of whether it's in a box or with a fox ) .
5 . While it would be an exaggeration to say that Dr. Seuss singlehandedly ended the Cold War , The Butter Battle Book was one of the most influential anti-arms - race books of the ' 80s .
Telling the story of the absurd war between the Yooks and the Zooks ( whose sole disagreement is whether one ought to eat bread butter side up or butter side down ) , Seuss subtly challenged the Reagan administration 's emphasis on defense over social welfare programs .
For six months , the book was on the New York Times Best Seller list — for adults .

Circumcision and other forms of male genital mutilation have always been a puzzle .
The ritual mutilations can leave the man vulnerable to infection and even death .
So why do some societies insist on such a risky ritual for their men ?
There may be an evolutionary explanation , according to Christopher Wilson , of Cornell University in New York , US .
It could function to reduce a young man ’s potential to father a child with an older man ’s wife , he says .
Sperm competition theory predicts that males will evolve ways to ensure that their sperm , and not another male ’s , fertilises a female ’s eggs .
Genital mutilation , in this view , is just another way to win the sperm war .
In some forms of mutilation , the handicap to sperm competition is obvious .
There is subincision , for example , where cuts are made to the base of the penis .
This causes sperm to be ejaculated from the base rather than the end , and is performed in several Aboriginal Australian societies , says Wilson .
Advertisement
In some African and Micronesian cultures , young men have one of their testicles crushed .
Male genital mutilation makes it less likely that a male will manage to father a child with another man ’s wife , Wilson says .
Home advantage
Circumcision is one of the less painful forms of mutilation , but it is also less effective at reducing sperm competition .
Wilson suggests , however , that the lack of a foreskin could make insertion or ejaculation slower , meaning brief , illicit sex is less likely to come to fruition and lead to a pregnancy .
Younger men , he says , willingly submit to having their reproductive ability reduced because they benefit socially from the older men , by forming alliances , and by gaining access to weapons or tribal lore .
The older men have also gone through the ritual , and seen their own reproductive effectiveness reduced .
But if a man with , say , four wives wants to ensure that any children his wives produce are his , there is pressure to make sure other men ca n’t successfully impregnate them .
The husband ’s own reproductive ability is impaired , but continuous and repeated access to his wives makes up for it , while any genital mutilation is a greater handicap to an interloper trying to sneak brief occasional sex with his wives .
Price of alliance
“ An older married man must form alliances , or associate with younger or unmarried men at some point , and it would be better to associate with and invest preferentially in those who are least likely to threaten his paternity , especially in societies where cuckoldry is rife , ” says Wilson .
“ Men who demand genital mutilations as part of the price for alliance and investment would be less vulnerable to exploitation of such relationships and loss of paternity to peers . ”
Wilson has now tested the idea .
If the sperm competition theory is correct , he reasoned , then male genital mutilation should be more common in societies where men tend to have multiple wives , especially those in which the wives live apart from the husband .
The mutilation would also probably be carried out in a public setting , witnessed mostly by other men , and performed by a non-relative .
Men who refused would face social sanctions .
Who ’s the daddy ?
Wilson searched anthropological databases and found that his predictions were borne out : 48 % of highly polygynous societies practice some form of male genital mutilation , and in societies in which wives live in separate households that increases to 63 % .
Only 14 % of the monogamous societies in the database practice male genital mutilation .
It might also be the case that selection works at a group level , so that societies that enforce mutilation are more stable because of less conflict over paternity , Wilson says .
David Barash , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle , US , says that the paper makes a convincing case .
“ Wilson has tackled a perplexing question and come up with a persuasive preliminary answer to an evolutionary enigma : why do men submit to procedures that seem to reduce their fitness ? ” he says .

Swimming sensation Michael Phelps has an Olympic recipe for success – and it involves eating a staggering 12,000 calories a day .
“ Eat , sleep and swim .
That ’s all I can do , ” Phelps , who won two more gold medals today , told NBC when asked what he needs to win medals .
“ Get some calories into my system and try to recover the best I can . ”

By comparison , the average man of the same age needs to ingest about 2,000 calories a day .
Phelps , 23 , will swim 17 times over nine days of competition at the Beijing Games – meaning that he will need all the calories he can shovel in his mouth in order to keep his energy levels high .
Phelps ’ diet – which involves ingesting 4,000 calories every time he sits down for a meal – resembles that of a reckless overeater rather than an Olympian .
Phelps lends a new spin to the phrase “ Breakfast of Champions ” by starting off his day by eating three fried - egg sandwiches loaded with cheese , lettuce , tomatoes , fried onions and mayonnaise .
He follows that up with two cups of coffee , a five - egg omelet , a bowl of grits , three slices of French toast topped with powdered sugar and three chocolate - chip pancakes .
At lunch , Phelps gobbles up a pound of enriched pasta and two large ham and cheese sandwiches slathered with mayo on white bread – capping off the meal by chugging about 1,000 calories worth of energy drinks .
For dinner , Phelps really loads up on the carbs – what he needs to give him plenty of energy for his five - hours - a - day , six - days - a - week regimen – with a pound of pasta and an entire pizza .
He washes all that down with another 1,000 calories worth of energy drinks .
Phelps remains on course to at least equal Mark Spitz ’s record of seven gold medals won at the 1972 Munich Games .
At these Summer Games , a typical day for Phelps starts with a 5 a .m. wake - up call .
Most of his races have taken place between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET when in China – 12 hours ahead of East Coast time .

McCain says Obama trip to Iraq may be soon Reuters
Published : Friday July 18 , 2008
Print This Email This DETROIT - Republican presidential candidate John McCain commented on Friday on the unannounced timing of a high - security trip by Barack Obama to Iraq , saying he believed his Democratic rival was going this weekend .
But McCain 's spokesman said the Arizona senator knew nothing about Obama 's schedule .
Obama said last month he would go to both Iraq and Afghanistan soon .
But his campaign has given no dates , seeking to cloak the trip in a measure of secrecy for security reasons .
" I believe that either today or tomorrow -- and I 'm not privy to his schedule -- Sen. Obama will be landing in Iraq with some other senators " who make up a congressional delegation , McCain said at a Republican fund - raiser .
McCain 's campaign spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan insisted to reporters later : " He does n't know when he 's going .
He 's not privy to that information .
He was speaking in broader terms , about when Obama does land in Iraq . "
McCain has been sharply critical of Obama , particularly for announcing his support for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in a 16 - month timetable , before actually having visited the country or meeting with commanders on the ground .
" Sen. Obama is going to arrive in Baghdad in a much , much safer and secure environment than the one that he would 've encountered before we started the surge , " McCain said , referring to a boost in U.S. troop numbers in Iraq that began last year .
McCain , who has made national security and foreign policy the centerpiece of his campaign for the November 4 election , has pressed Obama to visit Iraq .
Robert Gibbs , a top aide to Obama , had no comment on McCain 's remark .
The Obama campaign has announced he would soon visit Jordan , Israel , London , Paris and Berlin but has made public only the barest of details .
McCain , a strong backer of the U.S. troop build - up that President George W. Bush launched in early 2007 , said that while in Iraq Obama should thank the top U.S. military officer , Gen. David Petraeus , for the current strategy and " thank him for his leadership . "
He said Obama should express his regrets to Petraeus for failing to support a non-binding Senate resolution last year condemning an advertisement in The New York Times by a liberal group that mocked Petraeus as " Gen. Betray - us . "
" So he 'll land in a very different Baghdad .
And we have succeeded in Iraq , and we will win if we continue with this strategy that we are pursuing , " McCain said .
Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island were to be part of the congressional delegation with Obama .

jQuery.com Site Redesign

We ’ve just pushed out a brand new site redesign ( for jQuery.com and all its sub- sites ) .
This has been a long time coming and it feels great to get it out the door .
New Homepage
Easily the most contentious part of the redesign – but absolutely the most eye - catching .
j Query has long been driven by rock , even looking back to its original release which was heavily inspired by the always - excellent Devo .
We shot for a catchy design that helped to bring JavaScript out of the cold doldrums that it frequently inhabits – giving it a serious jolt of fun .
New Site Layout
The entirety of the site has a new layout .
With drastically improved multi-layer navigation and a standardized sidebar it should become much easier to navigate the individual portions of the site .
You should probably wear a hard hat while exploring the interior pages – font sizes , spacing , and colors are all in need of tweaking , which will be handled over the upcoming week ( it ’s fun working against Trac , WordPress , Drupal , and Mediawiki simultaneously ) .
New Logo
The original jQuery logo was a variation of the Devo hat – we ’ve taken that concept , turned it on its ear , and made it something that we can call our own – while still being inspired by the original contours of the Devo Energy Dome .
Thanks
Site and Logo Design : Scott Jehl – he put a fantastic amount of work into this redesign , bringing it all the way from conception to final implementation .
Rockin’ Illustration : Varick Rosete from nGenWorks also of Happy Webbies fame .

Also want to thank Media Temple for our hosting .
They ’ve been helping us a lot this past week migrating our sites to some new servers – expect some speed improvements for the sub - domains very soon .
Every one of the major professional associations representing health care providers who treat women and girls have signed a letter to HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt opposing draft regulations restricting access to birth control .
The Bush administration wants
women to have the worst in reproductive healthcare .
As an ob / gyn , I
am proud to say that my colleagues and I wo n’t stand for it .
A few weeks ago , draft regulations
under consideration by the Department of Health and Human Services surfaced
in the press ,
rules that would expand the definition of abortion to include certain
forms of birth control — including IUDs and emergency contraception — and
allow healthcare providers to withhold these methods from their patients .
In some cases the IUD is by
far the safest and most effective method of birth control for women .
I can’t
imagine hiding the IUD from my patients who need it , like a woman I
recently treated who is living with breast cancer .
Nor can I fathom
treating the rape survivor in front of me without offering her EC .
My
patients come to me for advice and facts .
Ideology should not be a barrier
to their care .
But the Bush administration
wants my clinic and healthcare facilities around the country " not
to discriminate " against doctors or any other staff who would withhold
contraception from women who rely on it to continue working , going to
school , and raising the children they already have .
In essence , the
Department of Health and Human Services finds it both healthy and humane
to hire people who do n’t believe in women ’s healthcare to provide
women ’s healthcare .
As a July 30 article in the Washington Post
noted , patients ’ health should come first in the medical world , not
religion or politics .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

To urge HHS to scrap the draft
rules and protect women ’s healthcare , all of the major professional
associations representing physicians , nurses , and nurse practitioners
who treat women and girls have written a letter ( below ) to HHS Secretary
Michael Leavitt .
These organizations account for roughly 410,000 medical
professionals , all of whom want the best for their patients .
Physicians for Reproductive
Choice and Health and I are working with
Sen . Hillary Clinton and other elected officials to fight the draft regulations .
To spread
the word as far as we can , we are using the media and blog posts like
this one .
Please join us in taking action against the Bush administration ’s
outrageous proposal .
And after you read the letter
below , please do what you can to circulate it .
Thank you .
The Honorable Michael O. Leavitt
Secretary
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services
200 Independence Avenue , SW
Washington , DC 20201
July 30 , 2008
Dear Secretary Leavitt :
On behalf of the undersigned
health care providers and professionals , we are writing to express our
grave concerns about a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
( HHS ) draft proposed regulation , which we believe will threaten and
restrict women ’s access to reproductive health and birth control services .
If implemented , this regulation would upend state laws protecting women’s
access to care and erect barriers to obtaining basic health services ,
at a time when we should be working together to expand access to preventive
health care .
The HHS draft regulation confuses
contraception with abortion .
By doing so , it undermines our shared national
goal of reducing unintended pregnancy and abortion .
The oral contraceptive
pill is the most common contraceptive method in the country , and 82 %
of women have relied on oral contraceptives at some time in their lives .
Oral contraceptives , when taken consistently and correctly , are extremely
effective at preventing ovulation .
Yet the proposed regulation would
threaten the state laws that improve access to contraception .
Moreover ,
the regulation specifically defines as problematic state laws that require
employers who offer drug benefits to cover contraception , require hospitals
to offer emergency contraception to rape survivors and require pharmacies
to fill valid prescriptions .
Loss of these protections compromises women’s
access to medical services and safe and effective birth control .
The proposed regulation would
redefine abortion as " any of the various procedures – including
the prescription , dispensing , and administration of any drug or the
performance of any procedure or any other action – that results in
the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception
and natural birth , whether before or after implantation . "
This definition
is contrary to major medical authorities , including the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Medical Association ,
and the British Medical Association , which define an established pregnancy
as occurring after a fertilized egg is implanted in the lining of the
uterus .
The sweeping proposed definition is so overly - broad that it
could capture a range of hormonal contraceptives and nonhormonal devices
approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to prevent pregnancy .
Furthermore , the draft regulation
expands the scope of providers who can claim objections .
The meaning
of the term " assist in the performance " is broadened to include
even people tangentially related to patient care , such as those employed
to clean medical instruments , health care entities , such as HMOs , and
health insurance plans .
In fact , entire institutions receiving funding
from HHS could choose to make birth control unavailable to their patients .
We urge the Administration
to reconsider this detrimental regulation .
Sincerely ,

Physicians

A comment about the news that California health regulators have sent cease - and - desist letters to a baker 's dozen genetic - testing firms , forbidding them from selling tests without a doctor 's order :
To me , this reflects as much a cultural disagreement as a legal or regulatory one .
That is , there is the assumption in the states ' letters that , because genetic information has medical implications , the dissemination of this information must fall under their jurisdiction .
But there are , in fact , all sorts of areas in life that have medical implications that we do n't consider the province of government – a pregnancy test , most obviously .
We neither want nor assume that doctors should have a gatekeeper role in establishing whether we are or are not pregnant , nor do we look to the state to protect us from that information .
Pregnancy is a part of life , and it has all sorts of implications and ramifications .
So too with DNA .
To my mind , genetic information is a new sort of personal information that the state and even the physician community are terribly slow and old - fashioned in reckoning with .
Even those with knowledge in genetics , such as the Gene Sherpa blogger , assume a paternalistic tone : " I am just shocked and awed that some in the public think that they can do this on their own without professional help .
Do you build your own home ?
What about fight your own court cases ?
Some do their own taxes ... but only when it is n't complicated .
Trust me , this IS COMPLICATED ! "
Now , I agree with Steve Murphy about a lot of things , but I totally diverge from him on this .
Having been tested by both 23andMe and Navigenics , I can say that , yes , it 's complicated .
But frankly I do n't need a doctor , and I do n't want a doctor , to facilitate my understanding of what my DNA means .
Yes , there are some medical implications , but these are hardly live - or - die moments .
What 's more , when I have shared my results with physicians , they 're largely greeted with a shrug .
I do n't want to " trust " a doctor , no matter how skilled or well trained , I want the access to my genetic data just as I want to know , without government approval or physician filtering , all sorts of information about myself .
The assumption that there must be a layer of " professional help " is exactly what the new age of medicine bodes – the automation of expertise , the liberation of knowledge and the democratization of the tools to interpret and put to use fundamental information about who we are as people .
Not as patients , but as individuals .
This is not a dark art , province of the select few , as many physicians would have it .
This is data .
This is who I am .
Frankly , it 's insulting and a curtailment of my rights to put a gatekeeper between me and my DNA .
This is * my * data , not a doctor's .
Please , send in your regulators when a doctor needs to cut me open , or even draw my blood .
Regulation should protect me from bodily harm and injury , not from information that 's mine to begin with .
Bolt grabs third gold and record
Cannot play media .
Sorry , this media is not available in your territory .
Usain Bolt captured a third gold medal and a third world record after Jamaica claimed men's 4x100 m relay gold .
The quartet smashed the previous world mark of 37.40 seconds set by the United States at the 1992 Olympics by a huge margin to set a new benchmark of 37.10 .
Nesta Carter ran a strong first leg before passing the baton to Michael Frater , who handed on to Bolt before Asafa Powell brought it home .
Trinidad and Tobago took silver with Japan coming home for bronze .
The run was quicker than the previous record , twice ran by a US team - first in 1992 in Barcelona and also in 1993 in the world championships in Stuttgart .
Bolt has dominated the sprints in Beijing in his breakthrough season capturing the 100 m and 200 m titles in new world records .
Cannot play media .
Sorry , this media is not available in your territory .
The 22 - year - old began his gold rush six days ago by winning the 100 m crown in 9.69 seconds before adding the 200 m title in 19.30 to beat Michael Johnson 's previous world mark .
A third gold followed in the relay and the Jamaican team spirit produced yet another world record .
Bolt , who clocked 9.96 seconds on his leg , told the BBC : " I asked the guys for it and they said ' yes , we 're going out there to do it ' .
" I 'm just happy and grateful because we worked hard for it . "
Powell , who lost his 100 m world record to team - mate Bolt , was satisfied to come away with a medal after finishing fifth in the sprint final .
606 : DEBATE
We all knew that if the Jamaicans could get that baton around smoothly then the world record would be obliterated ...
Elpenor " It 's a great feeling being out there , " said the 25 - year - old , who ran hard to the line to make sure he broke the world mark .
" Usain is the world record holder but I was really excited to go out there and get the world record . "
Carter added : " It was a great moment .
We all wanted it and became victorious .
The conditions are good out here so we went for it and got it . "
The quartet became the first Jamaican men to capture the Olympic 4x100 m title .
Defending champions Great Britain failed to reach the final after anchorman Craig Pickering failed to receive the baton from Marlon Devonish inside the permitted area .
A disastrous handover between Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay also denied the US a place in the final .

New probe into US attorney affair
Alberto Gonzales resigned after being harshly criticised over the affair
The US attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine US attorneys in 2006 .
The move came as a report into the affair by the inspector general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials .
The report was critical of White House officials , lawmakers and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
The investigation was prompted by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons .
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the probe lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice .
“ Serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved , ” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report .
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations .
Politically - motivated
The row began when nine US attorneys were removed from their positions by the US Department of Justice in December 2006 .
At the time , the department said that the attorneys had been fired for poor performance .
But it later emerged that the fired attorneys had not been rated any more poorly than many of their colleagues , leading many observers to conclude that the sackings had been politically - motivated .
Some of the attorneys had been involved in the prosecution of high - profile Republican members of Congress , while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats .
US attorneys investigate and prosecute court cases for the government .
They can be dismissed at any time , but may not be removed for political reasons .
The then head of the justice department , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , came under fire for the sackings , and eventually resigned his position .
A number of other justice department officials also resigned .
The inspector general ’s report was highly critical of Mr Gonzales ’s role in the affair , saying he bore “ primary responsibility ” for the sackings , that he “ abdicated ” his leadership role and was “ remarkably unengaged ” in the process .
Other officials , including former senior Bush aide Karl Rove , were criticised for failing to co-operate with the investigation .

That old cliché about everything being bigger in America seems especially pertinent when attempting to describe the sheer scale of the crisis currently afflicting the US newspaper industry , which makes all Fleet Street 's woes look like a summer picnic .
Last week ,
The Los Angeles Times decided to flog its historic downtown offices , on top of sacking 150 of its 870 journalists .
So did The Chicago Tribune .
Almost every title in the land is now shedding staff ; a hundred New York Times hacks have been offered voluntary redundancy ; Newsweek recently announced cuts .
It 's a bloodbath out there , as US media companies attempt to claw a pound of flesh from haemorrhaging readerships .
Consider , against this backdrop of falling circulation and a failing industry , the decision of every mainstream paper in America to ignore the juiciest political story of the month ( and possibly the year ) : the discovery by National Enquirer hacks of John Edwards , in the corridors of a Beverly Hills hotel , where his alleged mistress and alleged love child were also staying , at half past two on the morning of Tuesday , 22 July .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Since Edwards was , until recently , hoping to be president and will almost certainly have a prominent role in any Barack Obama administration , his marital integrity is a matter of public interest .
It could yet become an election issue .
Yet neither the highfalutin NYT , nor the Tribune , nor even the LA Times , on whose patch the whole sordid business occurred , have yet stepped up to the plate to report it .
Their old - fashioned reticence seems quaint , in this day of kiss 'n'tell and chequebook journalism .
But it 's also depressing : one of the reasons America 's newspapers are dying is their perceived pomposity .
Readers say they are too timid to rock the boat ; right - wingers complain ( with some justification ) that they conspire to suppress damaging stories about Democrats .
The general public thinks they have simply become boring .
The Edwards story could be selling truckloads of newsprint .
It is attracting enormous traffic online , and has been devoured by viewers of Fox , the only TV network to report it .
In ignoring the affair , newspapers are sacrificing potential readers and repeating the mistakes of the 1990s , where they loftily decided against reporting Bill Clinton 's many bedroom misdeeds , allowing internet sites to claim the Monica Lewinsky " scoop . "
One of the top LA Times execs , Tony Pierce , has higher concerns , though .
He recently sent staff an edict .
" There has been a little buzz surrounding John Edwards and his alleged affair , " it read .
" Because the only source has been the National Enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumours or salacious speculations . "
I can't pretend to know what Mr Pierce does with his 870 journalists .
But if he'd asked just one of them to check out these " salacious rumours " regarding John Edwards the LA Times might have a few more readers , and fewer of the 870 staffers might have to be cut from its bloated payroll .
********
Speaking of bloated payrolls , it was instructive to read the LA Times on Wednesday , 24 hours after an earthquake hit the city , causing exactly zero injuries , and ( much to the disappointment of TV's rolling news channels ) failing to seriously damage one building .
Photos on the front page ( headline : " Why we rolled with the punch " ) revealed that some shampoo bottles had been knocked off the shelf of a K - Mart , and a window was smashed at a building in Pomona .
But the real fun was to be had underneath the inside page report .
There , an extended joint by - line listed all the reporters who had been dispatched to cover the tremor .
It carried a total of 39 names , neatly demonstrating that everything really is bigger in the US – even the number of men it takes to skin a cat .

Cheerier news pervades the TV industry thanks to a series of runaway hits , including a soon - to - be - released season two of Gossip Girl , and the new , somewhat darker second series of Mad Men , which launched to approving reviews on Sunday .
It is no longer news that most of the finest talents in UK telly are now heading across the pond to cash in .
Almost every hit programme now boasts some form of British talent , either behind or in front of camera .
One moment you 'll see Cat Deeley on So You Think You Can Dance ? , the next , Hugh Laurie in Heroes .
I even spotted June Sarpong on the LA party circuit the other night .
Inevitably , Ant 'n 'Dec have joined in , making their US TV debut last month , fronting an ABC game - show called Wanna Bet ?
It 's safe to describe their reception as mixed .
The New York Times called the duo " British comedians " ( possibly a compliment ) but Kevin McDonough , influential syndicated TV reviewer for ( among others )
The Chattanooga Times has just dubbed them " pathetic , " " boring " and " unoriginal . "
********
Nothing quite so thrills as an actor getting all political .
Jon Voight , whose by - line declares him " well - known for his humanitarian work , " pops up in The Washington Times with a thoughtful essay headlined " my concerns for America " .
Space does not permit an extended analysis of his rhetoric , but the gist of the op - ed piece can be summed up in two words : " vote McCain " .
" The Democratic party in its quest for power , has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages , creating a God - like figure in a man who falls short in every way , " reads one passage .
" It seems to me that if Mr Obama wins the presidential election , then Messrs Farrakhan , Wright , Ayers and Pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralise this country and help create a socialist America . "
How human evolution took us from Voight to his daughter Angelina Jolie , in a single generation , I will never know .
********
The lovely but bonkers Ms Jolie has agreed to donate the estimated $ 10 m ( £ 5 m ) proceeds from selling pictures of her and Brad Pitt 's newborns to charity .
They were bought by People magazine in the US ( and Hello ! in the rest of the civilised world ) following an intense bidding war .
She grows ever higher in our estimation .
Operation Bearhunt : Girl reunited with her teddy after rescue mission spanning 1,500 miles and 1,000 people
With thinning fur , plentiful stitches and only one eye , Orange Ted has clearly been through some tough times in his 50 years .
But separated from his young and devoted owner , the threadbare toy faced his greatest escapade yet .
After a family holiday on the Costa Brava , Orange Ted , who has had four owners ( including a small dog ) was mislaid at Girona airport .
Together again : Jaimee Armstrong is reunited with her toy bear Orange Ted after his marathon journey home
Other bears might have been left to sit on the lost property shelf .
But seven - year - old Jaimee Armstrong was distraught and unable to sleep without her trusty friend .
So her parents Deb and Dan launched Operation Bear Necessity – a mission to locate Orange Ted and bring him home .
It ended up taking 44 days , covering 1,500 miles and costing £ 1,000 , but the reward is that Jaimee is ' over the moon ' .
Ted 's great adventure began on April 23 when Jaimee accidentally left her hand luggage at the departure gate in the confusion before boarding .
It also contained a Nintendo DS game console , Mr Men books and an MP3 player , but the bear was all that she cared about .
Back home in Burnham - on - Sea , Somerset , the family phoned Girona baggage inquiries and were told the bag containing Ted was there – but that someone had to collect it in person .
Mrs Armstrong , 45 , said : ' Jaimee was frantic with worry .
Dan and I quickly realised we had to get Orange Ted back whatever the cost . '
The family contacted a travel agent friend , Kim Hughes , of Travel Counsellors , and enlisted her help .
She contacted more than 1,000 of her colleagues from across the globe to find out if anyone would be visiting Girona .
One said he would be at the airport on May 11 , and Mr Armstrong , 38 , a carer , authorised staff to hand over the bag containing Orange Ted .
But the man was running late for a flight and did not have time to collect it .
Mr Armstrong decided to rescue Orange Ted himself , and booked a return flight and one night in a hotel .
Just before leaving he made a final call to the airport to check on the bear , only to be told it had been collected on May 14 .
He discovered that another Travel Counsellors worker responding to the SOS had picked up the bag before taking a driving holiday across Spain and into France .
When the holiday finished on May 30 the bag was handed over to another travel rep , Laura Dawson , in Toulouse .
Relieved : The Armstrong family is overjoyed Orange Ted is safely back home
' By luck , her parents were visiting her from Yorkshire and brought Orange Ted back to the UK when they flew home , ' said Mrs Armstrong .
Ted was then posted to Burnham - on - Sea .
The couple say that expenses , including the unused flight , hotel and a string of phone calls , have totted up to about £ 1,000 but it is worth it to have Ted back home .
The bear was bought 50 years ago and belonged to Mr Armstrong 's great - aunt Vera .
When she grew up , she gave it to her beloved Pekinese called Jinx .
It was handed on to Mr Armstrong in 1970 , when he was a baby , and he passed it down to Jaimee in 2002 .
' It would have been much easier if the airport had just put him on a plane back home , but they said they could n't and we would have to collect him in person , ' said Mrs Armstrong .
' I was so upset about it because it was her teddy .
She has lost other things like her Nintendo , but Orange Ted was all she was worried about .
' It 's only got one eye , quite bald , with just tufts of hair and stitches all over it – a teddy only a child could love . '
Sadly for Orange Ted , his travelling days are over .
Mrs Armstrong said : ' One thing is absolutely certain – he is never leaving the country again . '
One of the most anticipated cameras of 2008 , the ground - breaking Sigma DP1 has a DSLR - sized , APS - C sensor in a compact body , allowing it to produce image files of a quality never before seen in a camera this small .
The DP1 also features a 28 mm fixed - length lens , the ability to shoot JPEG and RAW files , a 2.5 - inch LCD and an optional optical viewfinder .
Photographers have long dreamed of shrinking DSLR quality into a pocketable camera .
Has Sigma fulfilled our dreams with the DP1 ?
The answer is a qualified “ yes . ”

Introduction
Originally announced in September 2006 , the Sigma DP1 was delayed several times before finally being released in mid-2008 .
The camera ’s initial reception has been mixed – its image quality praised , its usability panned .
The DP1 is simultaneously a technological step forward and a throwback to old - school photography .
It ’s a champion of image quality above all else , married to a compact camera body that behaves a bit like an old rangefinder .
But what is it like to live with a DP1 ?
Does it function well in a wide variety of situations ?
Who will be happiest with this camera ?
Based on my testing , I think it must be someone flexible enough to adapt him or herself to the DP1′s style .
Features
The DP1′s major claim to fame is the digital SLR - sized Foveon X3 imaging sensor .
Briefly , the Foveon is different from and theoretically superior to the Bayer filter sensors found in most other digital cameras .
For starters , it ’s much larger than the sensors found in other compact digital cameras .
All else being equal , bigger sensors generally result in better image quality .
Bayer - filter sensors use a single layer of light detectors ( called “ photosites ” ) that are actually monochromatic .
The individual photosites across the layer are filtered to capture only one color ( red , green , or blue ) and the filters are alternated across the sensor .
So instead of an even grid pattern , Bayer sensors detect light in more of a checkerboard pattern .
And because of the resulting gap in between each colors ’ photosites , Bayer designs must interpolate ( a process called “ demosaicing ” ) the data to create the final image .
Foveon takes a different approach .
Foveon sensors are like three sensors in one .
There are three layers of photosites , each sensitive to an individual color – red , green , or blue .
The data returned from each layer is then combined to create an image .
Since each layer is fully dedicated to one color , no demosaicing is necessary .
While Foveon ’s approach appears to be superior to Bayer designs , one only has to remember the Betamax versus VHS video format war to know that second best is often good enough .
In fact engineers have done a respectably good job improving the quality of images from Bayer - filter sensors .
Obviously there is much more to the two technologies and you can read more about them at Wikipedia [ link ] and elsewhere .
And in the end , we the consumers have to live with the actual output , not the theoretical quality .
The DP1 is marketed as a 14 - megapixel camera .
But in practice , the file size produced by the camera is more like 4.6 megapixels .
When converting RAW files using Sigma ’s Photo Pro software , you have the option of small , medium or large output .
I found the Sigma software ’s “ large ” output to be over - sharpened .
The recommended optimal size is medium , which produces 2640 x 1760 pixels at 180 dpi – or a 14.667 x 9.778 - inch print .
Converting the file to 240 dpi translates into a native 11 x 7.333 - inch print .
While not exactly up to the specs of a 14 - megapixel DSLR like the Pentax K20D , it is adequate for most prints and I think the files “ up - res ” or size up nicely in Adobe Photoshop for larger prints .
Sigma says the DP1 is “ exactly like an SLR .
Just in a smaller body . ”
But once you get past the “ DSLR - in - your - pocket ” hype , the DP1 is a no- frills machine — minimalist design and minimalist functionality , and a far cry from the responsiveness of a DSLR .
The DP1 has limited controls , and of course there is no image stabilization , face recognition or smile - manipulation technology here .
The other major feature of the DP1 is its 28 mm ( 35 mm equivalent ) fixed focal length or “ prime ” lens .
In a world of zooms , why would you want a prime lens ?
Conventional wisdom — and the laws of physics — says that primes are sharper and have less distortion than zoom lenses , which must trade image quality for the convenience of zooming .
A fixed wide - angle lens has also traditionally appealed to a certain kind of photographic vision — it ’s just how some people like to take pictures .
By limiting yourself to one focal length , you are forced to learn and explore the ins and outs of what that focal length can and cannot do .
Working close to a subject , you can use a 28 mm lens to capture foreground and background relationships or communicate a sense of place .
As Robert Capa famously said , “ If your pictures are n’t good enough , you ’re not close enough . ” A 28 mm lens makes you zoom with your feet .
Sigma DP1
Mode dial and Controls
The DP1 offers just the standard shooting modes — Program , Shutter , Aperture and Manual — along with movie and audio recording .
The camera controls are basic with no dedicated buttons .
To change important settings like ISO or white balance you have to dig down through the menu tree to find them .
( Maybe Sigma can eventually fix this in a firmware update . )
The DP1 has a built - in , pop -up flash as well as a hot shoe , into which can be fitted an optional optical viewfinder or external flash .

The other major feature of the DP1 is its 28 mm ( 35 mm equivalent ) fixed focal length or “ prime ” lens .
In a world of zooms , why would you want a prime lens ?
Again , conventional wisdom — and the laws of physics — says that primes are sharper and potentially more distortion - free than zoom designs , which must trade off some absolutes for the convenience of zooming .
Sigma DP1 28 mm Lens / Pop -up Flash & Controls
A fixed wide - angle lens has also traditionally appealed to a certain kind of photographic vision — it ’s just how some people want to take pictures .
By limiting yourself to one focal length , you are forced to learn and explore the ins and outs of what that focal length can and cannot do .
Working close to a subject , you can use a 28 mm lens to capture foreground and background relationships or communicate a sense of place .
You do n’t use a 28 mm to photograph sweeping vistas in the distance .
As Robert Capa famously said , “ If your pictures are n’t good enough , you ’re not close enough . ”
The DP1′s design is handsome if plain .
It ’s a rectangular brick of a case with no significant curves or textures to grip .
I never really felt comfortable using the camera one - handed , and I often spent time correcting some setting or menu that I had inadvertently bumped .
It would be nice if the case had a contour for the right - hand fingers to grip , such as those found on the Nikon P5100 , P60 , etc .
A manual focus dial is mounted on the top rear where your thumb naturally falls , but I wanted some kind of physical indication of where the focus is set .
A thumb notch or tab ( like those found on Leica M- lenses ) would help you know approximately where the focus is set without having to take your eye off the subject and look at the dial .
Camera Experience
If you try to use the DP1 like any other modern compact digicam , it will likely disappoint .
But if you shift your thinking and use it like a rangefinder camera , the DP1 can be surprisingly fun .
This means learning to think ahead photographically :
Set it to manual focus and learn how to judge distance .
Then experiment to find out how much depth - of - field you get with say , f / 5.6 and focus set to three meters .
It will take some trial - and - error , but in my opinion it ’s the best way to work around the camera ’s slow auto focus .
Exposure is consistent , so working in aperture priority with exposure compensation is similar to other cameras .
Or shoot in manual exposure and use the playback histogram to fine - tune your exposures .
It turns out that the DP1′s three - frame burst mode ( Sigma does n’t list the spec on their site it feels to be around 3 frames - per- second ) does a respectable job of capturing action , especially if you ’re pre-focused ( shutter half - pressed ) or in manual focus mode .
Burst mode even works with RAW files .
However , once the camera has captured the burst , it takes five or six seconds to write the data — during which time you ’re dead in the water .
As it turned out it was fun to slow down and be more deliberate about the kinds of images I looked for .
Knowing I could n’t zoom in made me keep my compositions simple .
The DP1′s workflow and 28 mm lens force you to pay attention to background details , quality of light and “ decisive moments . ”
The downside is that if you ’re not a person who already photographs this way , you may find learning to use the DP1 an exercise in frustration .
But I trust some people will stick with it and appreciate how the camera expands their way of seeing and anticipating photographic moments .
While manual focus works at most distances , you may need to return to auto focus if your subject is within 5 feet ( 2 meters ) of the camera where it ’s more difficult to focus accurately using the DP1′s manual dial .
Obviously , you ca n’t make critical focus decisions based on what you see on the LCD .
And close focusing requires more precision than focusing on something 10 or more feet away .
I was initially excited about the optional optical viewfinder accessory , which mounts in the flash hot shoe .
It ’s well made and bright .
However , my initial excitement wore off , as I grew annoyed by the viewfinder sliding out of the hot shoe ; it has no lock latch .
And too often I found myself shooting from some angle where keeping my eye to the viewfinder was difficult , uncomfortable or just impossible ( e.g. , a low angle from the ground looking up ) .
It was n’t long before the viewfinder went back into its box for good .
The 2.5 - inch LCD is of reasonable resolution , but reflections make it difficult to see outdoors .
It does n’t display colors accurately , either – particularly reds .
I was photographing some red neon signs and when I replayed them on the camera , they were blown out to white .
Naturally , this was disturbing .
But when the RAW files were downloaded to the computer , the reds were there .
The LCD ’s color blindness had an effect on my shooting ; I learned to emotionally disassociate the bland image I saw on - camera with the scene before me , knowing that rich color and quality of light would be available in post - processing .
It was like stepping back from the scene and concentrating on form and framing only — sort of like shooting black and white film .
Using the DP1 felt reminiscent of the early days when I first discovered wide - angle lenses and shot everything with a 24 mm prime lens .
Yes , there are issues when trying to grab a fast snapshot — you must anticipate and have your focus zone prepared .
And yes , you find that you ca n’t shoot everything with wide - angle glass — body shapes and architecture can be distorted .
But on the whole , I found myself adapting to the limitations of the 28 mm field - of - view and expanding the way I think about framing and composition .
Image Quality
The DP1′s image quality is first rate – although only 4.6 megapixels of first - rate quality .
Nonetheless , it ’s the best available image quality in a compact digital camera for now , and has a distinctive look .
The subjective value of the DP1′s distinctive image character should not be underestimated .
Some have likened the DP1′s look to film ; others observe its smooth tonal gradations or the way it depicts light .
I feel the colors are natural and well - balanced , and when saturated they retain a rich , natural smoothness that does n’t seem overdone .
As with most digital captures , the usual slight , gray digital patina accompanies any underexposure , but this is easily corrected in post - processing .
I find the DP1′s saturation and contrast are both rendered on the low side ( conservative ) .
From a workflow standpoint , the DP1′s RAW files are very flexible .
I can open up shadows and change color temperature easily without unattractively distorting the overall color balance .
RAW captures are adjusted with the supplied Sigma Photo Pro software , and exported to 8 or 16 - bit TIFFs or JPEGs .
When I opened the files in Photoshop , I was impressed by their outstanding smoothness and yes – film - like quality .
Shooting at ISO 100 , the DP1′s RAW files can be underexposed and corrected in post - processing , which in my testing yielded a very film - like noise texture .
At higher ISOs , chroma noise began to appear , but noise reduction software should handle this issue .
Although Sigma ’s software does n’t provide the most polished workflow ever , it is functional and straightforward .
After using super - powered post - production software ( read : complicated ) for so long , it was a bit refreshing to find the exposure and color adjustment sliders simple and effective .
Thanks to the DP1′s great initial captures , most images only required some compensation here and there to spruce them up .
Sigma ’s Photo Pro software is not Lightroom , but it will get you close enough that further adjustments are only minor tweaks .
In good light at low ISO settings , the Foveon X3 sensor technology shines .
Colors from a RAW file are rendered with a very natural palette .
Saturation and contrast are easily increased or decreased to taste .
The lens delivers very sharp , detailed lines , while offering real , selective - focus background - blur or “ bokeh , ” something we ’ve largely lost with small digital cameras and their miniature image sensors .
The DP1 brings back more bokeh than you might expect from an f /4 lens .
As I mentioned , chroma noise did appear at times .
The degree of noise depends on the subject matter , original exposure , ISO setting and post - processing .
The cloudy seascape above , for example , has very slight magenta blotchiness in the clouds ’ tonal texture , but this is only visible at 1:1 on - screen and not worth bothering about .
The DP1′s image quality begins to become noticeably coarse at ISO 800 .
Lines and contrasting edges in ISO 800 images take on a grainy character that feels a bit like film , but with a sharper , more jagged edge than film ’s classic texture .
I would n’t use ISO 800 or higher unless I had no other choice .
I also underexposed ISO 400 and compensated the exposure in RAW format post - processing .
If you do n’t mind doing a little clean up with noise reduction software , it seems to me that the DP1′s files are more forgiving of exposure adjustments than Bayer filter camera files .
Since the DP1 uses an APS - C size sensor , I compared its images with DSLR images in my library .
Although I did not do a controlled comparison , I found DP1 images generally more appealing than captures from older DSLRs .
Then again , there are some instances where the DP1 falls pretty short relative to other cameras — such as shooting into the sun or other bright light , where ugly flaring occurs .
So the DP1 is not a DSLR - killer .
But there ’s no question that the DP1 produces images of distinctive quality .
Click on thumbnails to view sample photos .
Conclusion
Sigma has to be respected for being the first to answer the marketplace ’s cry for a pocket - sized DSLR .
The challenge of marrying an APS - C sensor with a compact camera clearly has not been easy .
While the resulting camera largely meets image - quality expectations , the DP1 suffers from a kind of mandatory retro-photographic technique that modern digital camera owners — the wider marketplace and gadget - freaks alike — are unlikely to appreciate .
I ’m glad Sigma persevered and brought the DP1 to market ; the world is a better place for it .
But I believe they only got it half - right .
If you ’re a rangefinder kind of shooter or enjoy the slower , more deliberate photographic thinking that the DP1 requires , it wo n’t be too much of a stranger in your hands .
I doubt I would have been so patient had I not had experience shooting with manual rangefinder cameras .
And while I enjoyed slowing down and adapting to the DP1 , this is 2008 and any serious digital camera should incorporate the years of solid functional design demonstrated by almost any compact digital camera introduced since 2006 .
I ’m talking about basic usability here , not fluff like face recognition , because the best image quality in the world is meaningless if you do n’t get the shot .
Potential DP1 buyers accustomed to modern digicam handling should be prepared to “ shoot different . ”
The Sigma DP1 is best suited to wide - angle photographers who value image quality and aesthetics as the primary photographic attributes .
Whether these are landscape photographers or street photographers may not really be the question .
The DP1 forces you to adapt to its wide angle , rangefinder - like shooting style , and people able to work within these limitations will be rewarded with a rich image quality never before seen in a compact camera .
Who Should Buy It
The Sigma DP1 is an ideal choice for :
Advanced or professional photographers who value the highest image quality possible in a pocket - sized camera .
Beginner or intermediate photographers who want to learn to shoot slowly and deliberately with a fixed wide - angle focal length .
Any fine - art photographer who enjoys taking their time and getting up - close and personal .
Photographers comfortable with rangefinder - style shooting .
The DP1 is probably not the best choice for photographers who require fast shooting , zoom or interchangeable lenses , and modern features like image stabilization , face recognition and scene modes .

Where the Rubber Meets the Road ( July 17 , 2008 )
I received this excellent and timely inquiry from astute reader Paul B. : I m interested in # 1 , while you seem to take into account 300 million people in your writings would you comment on rubber - meets - the - road impacts and proactive actions we can take to help shield ourselves ( and our local communities ) from the economic problems were facing ?
Ive recently discovered your website by a link from one of the survivalist blogs ( sorry  I dont remember which one ) .
During this time Ive enjoyed reading your commentary with your economic emphasis .
Would you consider including concrete actions " average " people could take to protect themselves in one of your future columns ?
Id certainly appreciate it and I bet many others would , too .
( emphasis added , CHS )
That 's big challenge but I 'll give it a shot .
None of this is startlingly new - - it 's just common sense , and I will undoubtedly leave a few things off -- but as a start : 1 . Build / strengthen a small community based on sharing , generosity and reciprocity around yourself and family .
My critique of much survivalist thinking -- and my alternative view - - can be found here : The Art of Survival , Taoism and the Warring States ( June 27 , 2008 ) The strongest " survivor " is not the most heavily armed individual but the individual surrounded by a community which values his / her contributions and support , and who cares whether he / she lives or dies .
Nobody gives a damn if the individual holed up in a bunker somewhere lives or dies , and that 's the fatal weakness in all too many survivalist scenarios .
A community can be a small as three neighbors , or a block , or a church , or an extended family .
The way to build a commmunity , or join a community if you do n't have one at the moment is to extend yourself via generosity .
Provide something of value without worrying about whether you 'll get back an " equal value . "
Believe me , if you surprise decent people with something useful / good , their delight will exceed all known monetary value of whatever time or product or service you offered .
Just cleaning up the trash on your street or baking some cookies and giving them away can have huge consequences .
We as a society have become selfish , greedy and isolated behind an insane wall of " entertainment , " TV and other electronic mind - control crap ( videogames , etc . )
The way forward is to be selfless occasionally , and then those who have benefitted from your generosity will start caring about you .
That 's always the way humans have survived extremely trying / difficult times .
For instance , the 13th century : Food Shortages , Rising Prices , Stagnant Wages :
Welcome to the 13th Century ( June 23 , 2008 ) .
Here are two related entries :
The Remnant , the Pareto Principle and You ( June 26 , 2008 ) A Critique of Reinventing Collapse ( June 25 , 2008 ) 2 . Cancel your cable or satellite TV .
Wean yourself from the souring insanity of " cable news " , " sports " and other soul - deadening wastes of time .
Sure , see an occasional movie / DVD , but by cutting off the 200 channels then you will find something better to do than watch TV for 6 hours a day ( the U.S. average ) .
Your kids will scream and cry and whine , so tell them you 're not raising zombies any more .
They can go plant a garden or contribute to the community doing something they enjoy .
Watching TV , adding mindless crappy songs to their iPod and going shopping are out , over , done , gone , history .
You want music ?
Then learn to play an instrument .
Yes , it 's hard and time - consuming , but the result is rewarding in a way no idiotic " guitar hero " game can ever be .
Set the example by stop watching TV yourself .
NOVA , Nature , American Experience and a few other PBS shows are worth watching -- the rest , including the food and history channels , are fluff .
You want history ?
Then read a book ; there are literally a hundred great history books listed in my " books / films " link at the top of this page .
Go actually cook something instead of watching some sappy / lame " entertainer " whip together something which has all been prepped for them .
3 . Get lean and prepare to heal yourself .
One of the first things to go will be the bloated , unaffordable , and largely ineffective " healthcare " a.k.a. " sickcare " system .
Hundreds of thousands of people blindly trust the medical system and enter the hospital like sheep to slaughter , where they contract incurable infections , get the wrong meds , or endure an operation of some sort that only makes them worse .
Yes , if you have operable cancer , then by all means go get it cut out , radiated , etc .
But get on the Web and learn everything you can about the condition and treament options first .
Example : I have high blood pressure , even though my BMI is 22 or 23 .
My doctor prescribed some blood - pressure lowering drug , and when it did n't seem to have much effect I went online and discovered that it generally lowers pressure by something like 3 % .
Our blood pressure varies by 10 % or more every day just naturally , so 3 % was practically statistical noise .
Then I read about how too much salt is the known cause of high blood pressure ( along with too much weight ) , and I started noticing how all the packaged / canned / prepared / restaurant / fast - food in the U.S. has extremely large amounts of salt .
So I stopped eating all that and use a salt substitute ( potassium ) or a little 50/50 potassium / salt .
From what I have read on the Web , it seems all blood - pressure meds either do n't work well , or do n't work for long , or they have side - effects .
Better to cut salt out of your diet and shed some pounds -- that works a lot better than all the drugs being shoved on us .
But you can't count on your doctor to tell you that , unfortunately .
We all have to take responsibility for our own health except in emergencies such as trauma / accident and operable cancer -- and even then , you better hope the trauma center has n't been shuttered due to budget cuts .
4 . Become politically aware and active in your local community .
As I outlined in Welcome to Sadr City , U.S.A. ( June 20 , 2008 ) , local municipalities and agencies will be going broke , and it will be up to the local citizenry to take back control of their city / town / county funds from the public unions and " professional " managers .
What we face is simple : the benefits and pensions government employee unions won during the " flush times " are simply unaffordable / unsustainable .
In all too many cases , firefighters , police officers , library workers and others " game the system " to retire with overtime - boosted retirements and gold - plated benefits the rest of us can only dream about as things deteriorate .
You can be assured that the public employees will be screaming bloody murder about " what we were promised , " but the money 's no longer there .
So it will come down to some difficult choices that we the public cannot leave to the unions or " professional " city managers : do you want to pay people $ 80,000 a year retirement plus another $ 20 K in medical benefits , or do you want a library that 's open more than 4 hours a week ?
Look , circumstances change , and we have to change with them .
Just because some agency / city caved into absurd demands back in the tech boom does n't mean we have to be enslaved to those no-longer - affordable retirement / benefits packages .
Make the agency / city go bankrupt when the money runs out and start with a clean slate .
Demand that municipal workers work 40 years before they earn a retirement , like the rest of us , rather than a mere 20 years .
Get online and educate yourself about the incredible waste and fraud in your own local government , and then let your elected officials know you want some accountability and services and a sustainable level of salaries , pensions and benefits .
Tell them you want the cops who are sitting at home on their duffs retired after 20 years to get back on the street for another 10 years , and ditto for every other early - retiree .
Tell them 50 is the new 30 , and nobody should retire until they 're 65 or 70 -- public employees included .
Yes , I know not every city and agency is filled with cronyism and people who call in sick so their buddy can get double - time , but if you work for a sterling municipality , please do n't assume your well - managed burg / agency is the norm .
I know for a fact that around here in bloated California , library employees have retired with a small pension after a mere 7 years of part - time service .
( Once you hit 55 , you can retire after just such minimal service . )
Around here , public employees retire with pensions larger than their salaries , pensions boosted in the final year with legerdemain and bogus tricks to boost the pay on which their pension is based .
Around here , cops and firefighters routinely draw paychecks with overtime in the range of $ 150,000 +
( please search Mish 's site for City of Vallejo - bankruptcy for the chart listing the hundreds of city employees drawing well over $ 100 K each ) .
Around here , a retired university police chief draws a $ 150,000 / year pension and then goes back to work under a contract which pays her an additional $ 250,000 / year .
This is just business as usual when it comes to taxpayer funds , public unions and public - sector fraud / cronyism / waste .
Maybe your city / town / county / state is blessed with hardworking public employees who draw modest benefits and retirements and who work 30 years before they draw a dime , managed by people who do n't run things according to cronyism and gaming the system -- if so , you are fortunate indeed .
The rest of us are n't so lucky .
We pay high taxes and make a fraction of what the public employees make and have nowhere near their healthcare benefits , working or retired , but then we get to hear about how poorly paid they are compared to private - sector jobs .
Get real , people ; the pay in the real - world private - sector is crappy and going down .
If you 're so underpaid , go onto monster.com and get yourself one of those plentiful high - paying private - sector jobs .
You will find them less plentiful than you might have imagined .
If you do n't get involved , well then a relative handful of protected folks will collect most of the taxes and public services will be sacrificed left and right : no road repair , no libraries , falling - apart schools , etc .
It 's our choice .
Get involved or get happy with whatever crumbs the public unions and graft / waste " experts " leave you .
5 . Eat lower on the food chain .
Let 's start with the fact that it takes about 10 pounds of meat to grow a pound of salmon or tuna , and 10 + pounds of grain to grow a pound of chicken , pork or beef .
There will be plenty of food for humans if we stop feeding 90 % of the grain to animals and then eating the animals .
Those of you who have hiked or wilderness - camped or equivalent know that a human can get by on remarkably little food .
The idea that we 're all going to starve to death is unlikely .
Corn bread and beans is a damned fine meal and it uses about 10 % of the energy / soil / feedstock etc. of an equivalent weight of meat .
Eat what 's grown locally , and if you can , eat meat which fed on algae and grass or leftovers and not a whole lot of processed grain : catfish , range - fed cattle , your neighbor 's chickens you traded something for , etc .
6 . Start growing some of your own food , however little that might be .
The value here is n't just the cost of the food you raise -- it 's reconnecting you and your family with where food comes from in the first place .
If you have a real spread , consider going no -till .
No - Till : How Farmers Are Saving the Soil by Parking Their Plows
The age - old practice of turning the soil before planting a new crop is a leading cause of farmland degradation .
Many farmers are thus looking to make plowing a thing of the past .
( Scientific American ) 7 .
Look into permaculture .
Comsider this astonishing " on the ground " permaculture report : Dear Folks , I would like to inject some real world experience into this otherwise abstract discussion of food and permaculture .
In addition to being an ecological biologist , a permaculture production food farmer for 9 years , and an expert on biomass fuels , I have also been teaching permaculture since 1997 and have worked in many countries on food / energy production design issues .
I have certified more than 400 people in permaculture design since 1997 .
For more info on this see my site at permaculture.com .
So in light of my experience I have a couple of things to say ...
I produced enough food to feed more than 300 people ( with a peak of 450 people at one point ) , 49 weeks a year in my fully organic CSA on the edge of Silicon Valley .
If I could do it there you can do it anywhere .
... My yields were often 8 times what the USDA claims are possible per square foot .
My soil fertility increased dramatically each year so I was not achieving my yields by mining my soil .
On the contrary I built my soil from cement - hard adobe clay to its impressive state from scratch .
By the end I was at over 22 % organic matter with a cation exchange capacity ( CEC ) of over 25 .
... At most times I had no more than half of my land under production with the rest in various stages of cover cropping .
And I was only producing at a fraction of what would have been possible if I had owned the land and could have justified the investment into an overstory of integrated tree , berry , flower and nut crops along with the various vegetable and fruit crops .
... I grew over 45 different kinds of crops ...
The math is easy .
With a polyculture , yields of 3 - 10 pounds of food per square foot are easy to come up with in most climates .
For comparison , commercial agriculture in California , which is way inefficient , routinely runs about 1.5 - 2.5 pounds per square foot per year across a wide variety of crops ... ... There are two main reasons known for the dramatically increased productivity of a polyculture ?
\the benefit of mycorhyzzal symbiosis ( which is destroyed in chemical agriculture ) and less solar saturation .
Solar saturation is the point at which a plants ' photosynthetic machinery is overwhelmed by excess sunlight and shut down .
In practice , this means that most of our crop plants stop growing at about 10 am and do n't start again until about 4 in the afternoon .
Various members of a polyculture shade each other , preventing solar saturation , so plants metabolize all day .
Polyculture as we pursue in permaculture uses close to 100 % of the sunlight falling on its mixed crops .
Monoculture rarely can use more than 30 % of the total sunlight received before saturation .
Here 's a fascinating , extremely provocative story about folks who created an oasis in Arizona with rain catchment alone : harvesting rainwater in Arizona .
8 . Blow off your high - interest debt .
If you can pay it off out of earnings , great , if not , go bankrupt once the laws change ( probably next year ) .
Do n't feel bad , just get it over with .
Scrape up the cash and hire a real bankruptcy attorney .
Get debt - free except for your low - interest fixed - rate mortgage .
9 . Stop shopping .
Nuff said .
If you do n't need it to literally survive and be healthy , do n't buy it .
10 . Stop " consuming " brainwashing " entertainment " and get involved in real life .
You like sports ?
Then turn off the TV and go play some yourself .
Throw out that idiotic " martial arts " videogame and go learn a martial art yourself .
It 's not just about kicking , it 's about the principles of Wushu and self - cultivation , responsibility , self - defense and self - control .
Stop watching and start doing .
Go canoeing , snowshoeing , toss the football around , put some air in the tires of that old bike , but build up to it ( I 'm 54 , so I know about injuries and warming up . )
Do n't be a weekend warrior and hurt yourself .
Remember : we 're responsible for our own health now ; do n't count on somebody else " saving " you .
11 . Try to get a job closer to home .
Nuff said , Shorter commute=less oil burned , less time wasted fuming in traffic .
12 . Stop moving around the country .
No wonder we 're so messed up as a culture ; so many people have no roots in the community and no family within a thousand miles .
Most of the crazy homeless people in my city have been abandoned by their family .
They do n't just have a psychiatric problem -- they have a family problem , which means we as a nation have a family problem , too .
13 .
Get your hands on an old , cheap , low - weight / small engine vehicle .
I mean a Chevy Geo , or a little Ford , or a Nissan , whatever .
Not all of us can afford a new Prius or Ford hybrid or whatever " high - tech solution " is presented ( ask yourself what 's the profit margin on all those " solutions " ) , so what we have to do is simple : make do and improve what we have .
In the Japanese cars , the older the better , in some ways ; the engines and cars were smaller and got great mileage without hybrid technologies .
I am pretty sure my 1998 Civic gets about the same mileage as a new hybrid .
If you keep the engine tuned , the oil and filter changed often , tire pressure up and drive a sane speed , even a mid-sized vehicle can turn 35 MPG .
The same vehicle , poorly maintained and driven with a heavy lead foot will get 20 MPG or less .
The difference is n't the technology , it 's behavioral .
Meaning : it 's up to you .
14 .
If at all possible , try to figure out how to walk or bicycle somewhere useful .
By that I mean , is there any possible route which enables you to walk or bike to a store or do some errand , at least in seasonable weather ?
If not , then maybe you should go to a city council meeting and ask why your town / city does n't have any safe bikeways .
On reasonably flat ground / modest grade , 8 - 10 miles on a decent bike is no big deal , meaning any destination 5 miles away or less is bikeable if there 's a safe route ( i.e. not sharing a highway with cars going 55 MPH . )
15 .
Be positive and fact - based .
Nurture the Inner Light regardless of which religion / faith you believe / follow .
We 're in this together , and we need to support reality - based solutions and those around us who are ready to deal with reality .
Our mental health is as important a survival advantage as our physical shape .
16 . Acquaint yourself with the idea of hedging .
Do n't trust the dollar to retain it 's value ?
Maybe it will , maybe it wo n't .
A little gold or silver is a hedge .
If precious metals plummet and the dollar goes gangbusters , great , most of what you own is dollar - denominated .
But if the dollar tanks , you 've got a little hedge .
Here in earthquake country , I keep dozens of gallons of potable water on hand ( i.e. enough to share ) .
It 's a hedge against an earthquake that breaks the water mains .
If an earthquake never hits , great , I 'm not out a dime .
But the hedge is there just in case .
If you 're game , you can even learn how to buy commodity hedges , or find a fund which does the hedging for you .
( I do n't follow funds , so I can't give you any tips at the moment . )
The main point is to start doing the research and thinking for yourself .
Along these lines , I recommend this little essay by frequent contributor Harun I. : The Principles of Trading Also Apply to Life ( June 19 , 2008 ) .
This is n't an exhaustive list but it's a start .
Much of it will not be popular because it is n't a " high tech solution " and it all requires work , learning , responsibility and paying attention -- all the traits which our " entertainment " obsession erodes , discounts and destroys .

I have several pumps ... from T's pogo pump , pump1 , the hand held faster blaster , to balloon buoy rechargeable and Cheezo 's pouch pump to my newest addition of The Balloon Masters floor model .
Most of which I still use .
Following is my own personal review of the pumps I have based upon my usage of them in the well over 200 shows per year in which I perform .
Each pump has its specific usefulness for specific venue .
ie ...
I no longer use the battery operated pumps in restaurant situations as the noise simple prohibits continuing conversations during the time to blow up the balloons and , as fun as it can be , is offensive to some people wanting a bit quieter of a dinner .
I find the rechargeable pumps much better suited for outdoor venues or even large indoor carnival type events .
Cheezo 's pouch pump is at the top of my list for these .
The battery NEVER runs out of a charge !
This thing has lasted me for over 5 hours at a clip .
It does get heavy though , so if weight is a problem balloon buoy does do OK if you make sure to bring along a spare completely charged battery or two .
I found it more convenient for me to just switch positions of Cheezo 's pump from strapped over my shoulder to the other shoulder to even around my waist , then to have to stop to change batteries which were an extra thing to have to carry along anyway .
Cheezo 's battery does take a bit longer to charge as it holds the charge longer , so just make sure you put it on to charge the evening before you have a long gig .
The hand held faster blaster is a GREAT little pump .
It pumps air on both strokes so takes half the work of most hand pumps to fully inflate a 260 .
I use this a lot while on stilts and do n't want to sling the heavier pump on my shoulder .
I just attach a balloon to the end of it and to the end of me to make sure if I loose my grip on it , it does n't fall to the floor .
This is also a great little pump to bring along with you if you prefer not to blow up by mouth but like to keep balloons handy where ever you go " just in case " you might want to make someone you meet a balloon .
I always keep a spare one with me just in case my main pump I have for the event breaks somehow .
Now this next commentary is going to be a tough one , cause T , I love ya ... and I know what a great job you do with your pumps ... but I have to say , I am using my new pump from Balloon Masters the very most .
It is an absolutely wonderful design and terrific pump !!
( and I am NOT getting paid to tell you all this either )
You can pick up the Balloon Masters pump with just one hand and carry it with you anywhere ... no more strap to hold it together .
It is also extremely light weight and yet I have found it to be one tough pump !!
It blows up a 260 with just one pump ...
The handle design is great ...
I have found it wonderful to hang my stickers from to give out to each child that gets a balloon , as well as a little bag that I keep my extra little toys that I buy from T Meyers ..
( which , btw , I highly recommend .
T has great alternatives for our little ones too young for a balloon . )
This pump from The Balloon Masters Really is GREAT .
I use it for more venues ( from birthdays to restaurant work to trade shows ) than any of my other pumps put together .
I highly recommend checking it out .
It is also one of the most reasonably priced of balloon pumps on the market that I am aware of .
All of the pumps I have mentioned above I am able to blow up 160's with as well .
You just have to get used to getting them over the nozzle ... it can be done and quickly once you get the hang of it .
Well , I hope this has been of some help to those that were asking the questions about pumps .
Below are a list of links to the sites I am aware of that you can go to to take a look at the products I have mentioned .
I am not aware of a site specifically for the Balloon Buoy pump , however , I THINK you can check it , as well as the faster blaster I mentioned , out thru TMeyers .
As we reported earlier today , Senator McCain was caught reinventing the Anbar awakening time line during an interview with Katie Couric Tuesday -- an interview CBS inexplicably edited to cover up for McCain .
Well , today HuffPo's Seth Colter Walls has dug up even more proof that the awakening 's most important progress occurred before the surge plan was publicly announced -- let alone implemented -- including remarks from John McCain and Joe Lieberman from an American Enterprise Institute speech in January 2007 .
McCain :
" Too often the light at the tunnel has turned out to be a train , but I really believe -- I really believe that there 's a strong possibility that you may see a very substantial change in Anbar province due to this new changes in our relationships with the sheiks in the region .
...
But it 's important , as I said in my opening remarks , that this troop surge be significant and sustained .
Otherwise , do n't do it . "
Lieberman :
" I wrote last week of a conversation I had after John and I and our delegation met with our military leadership in Anbar province -- a tough , brilliant , committed group of soldiers making progress there , turning the Sunni sheiks in that province to our side against Al Qaeda . "
The McCain campaign released a statement last night in which they claim that the surge helped consolidate earlier gains in Anbar , but that 's not what McCain said in his original remarks :
" Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others .
And it began the Anbar awakening .
I mean , that 's just a matter of history . "
So either McCain is lying about the Anbar timeline , or he 's simply confused about what happened and when .
Either way , this has to be problematic for a candidate who is running on the sole platform of being better equipped to handle the war .
If I could venture a guess , I would say that McCain deliberately distorted the effects of the surge in order to argue that it alone is responsible for the the reduction in violence .
As I said earlier , McCain 's only hope for winning in November is to convince enough voters that the surge is the only reason we 're " winning " in Iraq , and the he is primarily responsible for it .
Once Barack Obama challenged that narrative by pointing out the Anbar awakening was already taking shape and fighting back against al Qaeda before the troop increase , McCain was left with no choice but to re-write history to comport with the version he 's trying to tell .
UPDATE : Here 's what McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said yesterday about Obama :
" If Barack Obama had had his way , the Sheiks who started the Awakening would have been murdered at the hands of al Qaeda . "
Well as it turns out , the sheik cited by McCain and Bounds was tragically murdered last year .

Two wheels good ...
With more and more cyclists taking to the roads and designated bike racks in short supply , where they park has tremendous capacity to annoy .
So how can those on two wheels avoid winding up officialdom , pedestrians and even fellow cyclists when they lock up their trusty steeds ?
Below are five potential pitfalls and how to avoid them .
BATTLE OF THE BIKES
Do n't lock your bike to a stranger 's
The number one no - no in good parking practice is not to chain your bike to somebody else 's , says Chris Peck , policy co-ordinator at CTC , the national cyclists ' organisation .
Parking space fills up quickly
This can happen quite easily - especially with snaky locks which end up accidentally woven around another bike .
Checking can become a bit of an obsession , much like fixating over locking the car or checking whether hair straighteners have been turned off .
The outcome may not be pretty .
" In one case , a man inadvertently put his lock through another bike 's frame , " says Mr Peck .
" When he came back , his bike had been vandalised - the other bike owner had bashed it up by trying to destroy the lock . "
FLY PARKING
Is street furniture fair game ?
U - shaped Sheffield stands and designated bike shelters are in short supply , so cycling commuters get creative .
David Cameron 's bike was stolen , but soon returned Most regard locking bikes to street furniture such as lampposts and railings as perfectly acceptable .
It even has a name - " fly parking " .
But leaving a bike exposed to the elements can lead to rust .
Nor should cyclists abandon common sense .
As David Cameron recently discovered , a bollard offers little security .
Not all railings are fair game .
Sarah Bell , 29 , a marketing manager from Notting Hill , says if railings are private property , she wo n't park there out of courtesy : " I would n't want cyclists doing it at my place . "
In 2001 , one cyclist got so frustrated by a sign warning him off railings in London he began locking on other items - such as a kettle , frying pan , ironing board and fridge door .
Some regard this as an eyesore
The key is to park politely and prettily .
" Make sure the front wheel is secure and does not get in the way - otherwise people might kick the wheel in or drive over it , " says Mr Peck .
Although using public railings as a temporary solution is tolerated , abandoned bikes left are not .
Even if that one - wheeled , saddle - less bike latched onto railings is actually the work of an overzealous commuter who has stripped off every last accessory to deter thieves .
COMMUNAL SPACE
The bike in the hallway
In an ideal world everyone would have a shed , garden or secure space to leave a bike overnight .
Or a very big house .
A rare sight
But for those who share footpaths , corridors or halls , a badly parked bike can lead to damaging disputes and bitter bust - ups .
Rule number one is do n't block stairways or shared space .
" The fire brigade say there is nothing worse than falling into a bike because the wheels are so tangly , " says Barry Mason , of Southwark Cyclists .
Tyre marks on walls are likely to get backs up .
Try to come to an agreement with neighbours , or ask the council to convert any unused rubbish or storage space into bike facilities .
Bikes can become a sticking point at residents ' association meetings .
But if tucked away , most will turn a blind eye .
The best solution might be to take it into your home .
" Cyclists use all sorts of neat design solutions and clever techniques - such as pulley racks which can wheel bikes to the ceiling or suspend them above ground , " says Mr Peck .
BIKES ON TRAINS
Stuck at a level crossing ?
The Department for Transport wants cycling to integrate with public transport - it makes sense environmentally and eases road congestion - but cyclists complain that train operators do n't seem to be getting the message .
Park up , as it wo n't be welcome on the carriage Cycle parks at stations have started sprouting up all over the country , but those with smartcard locks can experience technical difficulties .
Many bemoan a ban on bikes at peak hours , and claim cycle policies for trains change all the time .
" I would n't take a bike on a train - you never know which ones you can take a bike on , and getting stuck in an area where you could n't would be a nightmare , " says Ms Bell .
" But it would be very useful if there was a section where they could be taken on the Tube . "
Mr Peck says train companies do welcome people with bikes - and 60 % of people live within a 15 minute bike ride of their nearest station , so it makes business sense .
But he recognises that space is at a premium .
" We need longer trains and longer platforms and designated carriages for bicycles like they do in Germany and Switzerland . "
OFFICE PROTOCOL
Does a bike belong at your desk ?
Plenty of employers provide bike racks and spaces , but according to Mr Mason , bike storage at workplaces is in real crisis .
" At the moment new office blocks cater for bike storage space for one in 20 employees , but this is an old - fashioned standard . "
European countries like Germany have huge underground parking garages
There are 91 % more cyclists in London now than in 2000 , and Mr Mason says one in five employees might soon commute by bike .
Some companies are already hiring car parking spaces to provide additional facilities .
And some cyclists take bikes into the office rather than expose that precious fold - up or hand - built road racer to the elements - or thieves .
This does not always endear them to colleagues .
" [ Bikes ] can drop oily water and grease up clothes , which other employees do n't take to happily , " says Mr Peck .
Mr Mason says attitudes towards cyclists are shifting : " Ten years ago it was only the messenger or photo copier who cycled - nowadays no - one bats an eyelid if an accountant turns up to a meeting first thing in shorts . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I do n't mind bikes being left in the stairwell of our flats , under the stairs .
They do take up a bit of room , but there is nowhere else to put them .
However , the bike that is most regularly there is actually a fold - up bike - that is never folded up .
You would have thought they bought it to be folded up and take less room .
I think someone with so little common sense should not be cycling in London .
Rachel , London
Some more : do n't lock your bike to stair handrails because people want to hold on to them .
Also , enormous great wicker baskets that make you take up three slots instead of one in those racks that only secure one wheel .
Nobody can carry that much stuff safely on their handlebars anyway .
Jo , Cambridge I still can't help feeling irritated when trying to get on a packed train when most of the standing area is occupied by someone with a bike .
Or , squeezing onto the train only to have a bike parked on my foot , and dirty marks from the wheels all over my clothing .
Whatever happened to guard 's vans on trains for transporting cycles ?
Surely it cannot be beyond the realms of possibility for a designated space to be allocated on trains to keep the bikes away from the rest of us on crowded trains ?
Coolhiggib , Essex Personally I cycle to work and chain it to the closest sign post .
Not the most secure and not weather protected but it does n't bother me .
Obviously I wo n't turn down a bike locker when one becomes available .
When cycling to the shops , I 'll chain it to anything anchored to the ground and does n't block any access .
It 's not really a problem in Aberdeen yet , maybe when it 's more popular it will be worth worrying about .
Damo , The Deen The " locking one bike to another " thing was explained to me by a colleague as a common technique used by thieves - as a simple way to force you to leave your bike in place overnight , the thief comes back after hours and in darkness and has the time to unlock theirs , and steal yours without interruptions .
Clever these criminals .
Peter Galbavy , London Someone once locked their bike to mine using a cable lock .
Having failed to locate the owner , a security guard came and sawed through their lock cable with a blunt butter knife .
Only one person stopped to ask what he was doing and we were on a busy London street for about half an hour .
I bought myself one of those huge chain - link locks after seeing that , and no - one ever got through it .
Adam , Belfast , UK
It is annoying that cycling is promoted as the most environmentally friendly way of getting around quickly but little infrastructure is provided by government , and most transport companies seem to go out of their way to demonise cycle commuters .
That said , recently London Underground has started accepting full - size bikes on certain lines and folding bikes are surprisingly effective and able to travel on all public transport .
There may be hope yet .
Adam GC , London
As the number of cyclists increases , a good thing in many respects , perhaps it 's time to regulate cycling .
If cyclists were required to pay an annual tax , just a small fraction of that paid by motorists , councils could be required to provide better facilities .
Mark , Gravesend Mark , cyclists already do pay an annual tax to cover the road costs .
It 's called income tax and VAT and it goes to subsidize motorised transport the true costs of which are covered by neither road tax nor fuel duty .
Joe Gallagher , London
On a recent trip to Santa Monica , California , I noticed that many of the buses had bike racks on the front that you could strap your bike to .
Great idea and encourages cyclists to take their bikes both locally and on long journeys .

Managers seeking to hire star employees away from competitors are likely to be disappointed with their costly new employee 's performance – and the star is likely to be unhappy , too – according to the Management Insights feature in the current issue of Management Science , the flagship journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences ( INFORMS ® ) .
Management Insights , a regular feature of the journal , is a digest of important research in business , management , operations research , and Management Science .
It appears in every issue of the monthly journal .
" Can They Take It With Them ?
The Portability of Star Knowledge Workers ' Performance " is by Boris Groysberg and Linda - Eling Lee of Harvard Business School and Ashish Nanda of Harvard Law School .
In their study , the authors ask two major research questions :
Does switching firms have an effect on the short - term and long - term performance of stars ?
And is hiring a star a value - enhancing or value - destroying activity for a firm ?
From an empirical analysis of star analysts over a period of nine years ( 1988 ? ) , they find that hiring stars is advantageous neither to stars themselves , in terms of their performance , nor to hiring companies in terms of their market value .
The performance of a talented worker depends in part on firm - specific human capital embedded in colleague relationships and firm capabilities .
The issue of whether workers ' performance is portable across firms is relevant for firms that seek to build a sustainable competitive advantage on star talent .
The authors find that stars are imperfectly mobile resources that can represent a potential source of sustained competitive advantage for firms .
The findings suggest that managers hiring stars and the stars themselves should be wary of performance declines following moves to a new firm .

Anti-aging researchers have figured out how to add about 5 years to the human lifespan , but the technique is unlikely to be widely adopted .
Meanwhile , research underway promises simple drugs and therapies that could eventually add 10 to 15 extra years to the average life and promise better health late in life .
Charles Shapiro , Dreamstime.com
While the quest for the proverbial Fountain of Youth is endless and typically fruitless , one method known to extend the human lifespan by up to five years has quietly become accepted among leading researchers .
The formula is simple : Eat less .
It could add years to your life , several experts now say .
And done in moderation , it could at least help you live a more healthy life .
The only question is :
Will the average person do it ?
While little short of a nip - and - tuck will make you look younger , calorie restriction , as it is called , is as close to a real Fountain of Youth as any known technique comes .
Even scientists who are cautious about anti-aging hype say it works , both by cutting risks for some diseases and by allowing all body cells , somehow , to hang in there longer .
" There is plenty of evidence that calorie restriction can reduce your risks for many common diseases including cancer , diabetes and heart disease , " says Saint Louis University researcher Edward Weiss , who last week announced a new study that brings fresh understanding to how it works .
" And you may live to be substantially older . "
The numbers
Here 's a rough rule of thumb that many experts generally agree on now : Eat 15 percent less starting at age 25 and you might add 4.5 years to your life , says Eric Ravussin , who studies human health and performance at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana .
One important caveat : Ravussin 's estimate is based mostly on studies of other animals and only preliminary research in humans .
But the work by Weiss and others is unlocking the mysteries of aging and suggesting the animal studies apply to humans .
" There is absolutely no reason to think it wo n't work , " Ravussin told LiveScience .
Perhaps even more promising , though in early stages of research , are drugs designed on the basis of what 's been learned from calorie - restriction studies .
Those drugs would target human cells to deliver the same benefits , turning off bad things and turning on good things to extend cell life in general , or offer new therapies and cures to vexing diseases like Alzheimer 's and cancer .
If you can hang in there until these promising new drug therapies are developed , you may live in a world where lifespan increases by 10 to 15 years , researchers say .
Do n’t plan on living to be 200 , Ravussin said , " but I think we 're going to gain quite a few years . "
Mysteries remain
Scientists are n't sure exactly why calorie restriction slows aging .
But they 're on the verge of a firm understanding .
In a nutshell , it is thought to lower metabolic rate and cause the body to generate fewer damaging " free radicals . "
One hypothesis is that it decreases a thyroid hormone , triiodothyronine ( T3 ) , which then slows metabolism and tissue aging .
Weiss and colleagues studied men and women , aged 50 to 60 , who did not smoke , were not obese and were in good health .
The volunteers were split into three groups — a calorie - restriction group , an exercise group , or a control group — and followed for one year .
The calorie - restriction group cut back by 300 to 500 calories per day .
( A typical healthy adult diet should include about 2,000 calories . )
Volunteers in the exercise group maintained their regular diet and exercised regularly .
While both the calorie - restriction and exercise groups experienced similar changes of body fat mass , only those in the calorie restriction group also experienced lower levels of the thyroid hormone .
A longer - term study is still needed to pin down whether reducing T3 levels through calorie restriction indeed slows the aging process as suspected , the scientists say .
The results were published in the June issue of the journal Rejuvenation Research .
Step - by - step
Weiss ' work advances the body of anti-aging knowledge , said Christy Carter , an aging researcher and assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine .
" The more that scientists can demonstrate similar biological profiles between rodents and humans with regards to calorie restriction , the greater the possibility that lifespan extension will translate to human as well , " Carter said .
Weiss figured it 's sensible to take steps now .
You can cut 300 to 500 calories by simply skipping dessert or substituting a turkey sandwich for fast food .
A nutritional diet and exercise are important to any weight - loss effort , Weiss and others caution .
" Our research provides evidence that calorie restriction does work in humans like it has been shown to work in animals , " Weiss said .
" The next step is to determine if this in fact slows age - related tissue deterioration .
The only way to be certain , though , is to do a long - term study . "
Others agree : more research is needed .
" I think that they 've documented a real and interesting effect of caloric restriction in humans , " said UCLA evolutionary biologist Jay Phelan .
" But they are still a long way from demonstrating that it changes human lifespan at all . "
Proven in animals
Evidence that calorie restriction boosts lifespans in rodents is solid .
Christiaan Leeuwenburgh of the University of Florida 's Institute on Aging showed in 2006 that eating just 8 percent less and exercising a little more over a lifespan can reduce or even reverse aging - related cell and organ damage in rats .
Various studies have shown that cutting calories by 20 to 40 percent significantly both extends life and , with a little exercise , leaves old animals in better shape .
Eating fewer calories also reduces age - related chronic diseases such as cancers , heart disease , and stroke in rodents .
That 's important because it suggests ways to not just make us live longer , but to allow us to age more gracefully , healthwise .
Research last year found that rats on a restricted diet are more physically fit in old age , apparently slowing the typical onset of physical disability .
The rodents also looked and probably felt better : " Rats that ate a normal diet lost a significant amount of lean muscle mass and acquired more fat , while calorie - restricted rats maintained lean muscle mass as they aged , " said lead researcher Tongjian You from the University of Buffalo .
The finding was published in the October issue of the Journals of Gerontology Series A : Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences .
Rodents are thought to be good analogues to humans .
Dogs are even better .
A 14 - year study of 48 Labrador Retrievers found restricting their diets by 25 percent starting at 8 weeks of age extended their lives by an average of 1.8 years .
For a creature that typically never gets beyond its early teens , that 's a big number .
The findings were published back in 2002 in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association .
" The study also showed that lean body conformation forestalls some chronic illnesses , most notably osteoarthritis , " said University of Pennsylvania researcher Gail K. Smith , who worked on the dog study .
Ailments typically struck the lean dogs 2.1 years later than the others .
Probably works in humans
Convincing humans to eat less , and then studying the effects over a lifetime , is considerably more challenging .
But mounting research suggests that what works for rats and dogs seems to apply to people .
Studies are under way with monkeys , which have lifespans of around 25 to 30 years , and early indications are promising , Ravussin said .
A study of humans last year found that cutting calories in human test subjects reduced oxidative damage in muscle cells .
In the journal PLoS Medicine , the researchers speculated that the effect might translate into longer life .
Researchers caution , however , that longer lifespans does not mean immortality .
The vast majority of mainstream researchers envision lifespans extending a few years .
" My estimate would be that 40 years of caloric restriction would give a 3 to 7 percent increase in longevity , so an optimistic estimate would be an additional four years or so , " said Phelan , the UCLA researcher .
But researchers are quick to point out that human nature is not conducive to life - long calorie - restriction diets .
" It 's going to be limited to a few people who are going to try to do that , " Ravussin said .
Seeking balance
" Suffering years of misery to remain super - skinny is not going to have a big payoff in terms of a longer life , " Phelan said back in 2005 when the idea of " living forever " was particularly hyped in the media .
" I once heard someone say caloric restriction may not make you live forever , but it sure would seem like it .
Try to maintain a healthy body weight , but do n't deprive yourself of all pleasure .
Moderation appears to be a more sensible solution . "
Phelan uses rodents as an example of why caution is warranted :
Mice will live longer if their diet is restricted by 10 percent , he said in 2005 .
" If you restrict their intake by 20 percent , they live even longer , and restrict them to 50 percent , they live longer still .
But restrict their intake by 60 percent and they starve to death . "
In an email interview the other day , Phelan said he stands by this assessment .
And Phelan now thinks there is " nothing " on the research horizon " that would extend lifespan in a significant amount , on the order of 10 or more years . "
Big promise ?
Other experts are optimistic that research into calorie restriction will lead to greater things .
Scientists are investigating what they call CR mimetics , or compounds that mimic the effects of calorie restriction .
" This includes naturally occurring compounds and pharmaceuticals , " explained Carter , the University of Florida researcher .
" One that has received much attention lately is a compound called resveratrol , found in red wine . "
Researchers have long pondered the French paradox : The French eat high - fat diets but live relatively long lives .
Resveratrol and other compounds in red wine are thought by many to contribute to that good life .
But testing any anti-aging drug or therapy sets up another tricky paradox : Nobody wants to invest in a 70 - year test , and the Food and Drug Administration wo n't approve a chemical 's use without thorough testing .
There 's a potential shortcut :
Researchers are testing compounds thought to thwart aging on Alzheimer 's patients to see if they slow the degradation of neurons .
And similar human trials will begin soon on diabetes patients .
" However , many of these studies are still in the development phase , still being tested in rodent models , " Carter said .
" I expect that this field will begin to explode in the next few years .
Caution is still merited given the need for extensive study of these compounds as to their efficacy and long - term safety . "
Eventually , Ravussin thinks the combined efforts of all these research angles could extend lifespans by 15 years later this century .
In a society where lifespan has already increased significantly in recent decades , many people are at least as concerned with aging well as they are with living long .
" Many researchers are focusing on the effects of CR on health - span as opposed lifespan , " Carter said .
" We know that small reductions in caloric intake , even as little as 8 percent , result in improvements in health related outcomes . "
Defcon
A well - known researcher specializing in website security has strongly criticized safety on Google , arguing the world 's biggest search engine needlessly puts its millions of users at risk .
" Google is and will be and always has been vulnerable , " Robert Hansen , CEO of secTheory , told a standing - room - only audience at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas .
" They have n't been open with consumers .
Ultimately , this all comes down the the fact that they just want to track you guys . "
At issue is Google 's policy of hosting untested third - party applications that users can automatically embed into personalized Google home pages .
During a talk titled " Xploiting Google Gadgets : Gmalware & Beyond , " Hansen and fellow researcher Tom Stracener laid out a variety of attacks that can be unleashed using the programs .
The most devastating is the ability of Google gadgets to immediately redirect victims who log into iGoogle.com to a page under the control of an attacker .
This creates a phishing hazard , particularly for less tech - savvy users who do n't know to check the browser bar .
Even if they do , the bar shows up at gmodules.com , an address many mistakenly believe is safe because it is maintained by Google .
Hansen , who frequently goes by the moniker Rsnake , said he discussed the vulnerability with Google security engineers , and they told him the redirection was a feature rather than a flaw .
Google gadgets make other attacks possible , including : the ability to :
carry out port scanning on a victim 's internal network to conduct surveillance
use cross -site request forgery techniques to force victim PCs to follow links to malicious sites ( for instance , those that host child pornography ) and
cause a victim 's browser to access a home router and change domain name system server addresses or other sensitive settings .
Hansen and Stracener acknowledged that in - the - wild attacks that use Google gadgets are rare , but they said that 's likely to change .
" Once money actually starts flowing through , once the financial incentive for malware exists , then you 're going to start seeing more of this type of thing pop up , " Stracener said .
Google representatives did n't respond to an email requesting comment for this story .
They told the Associated Press that the company regularly scans gadgets for malicious code , and in the " very rare " occasions bad applications are found , they are immediately quarantined .
The speakers took strong exception to Google 's claim .
They 've had several proof - of - concept gadgets hosted for months on Google , and so far they 've never been removed , they said . ®

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Google co-founder Sergey Brin wants to go to space and has made a $ 5 million down payment to book a seat on a future orbital space flight with Space Adventures , the space tourism company said on Wednesday .
The company said it was creating an Orbital Mission Explorers Circle of members who will each contribute $ 5 million to pay for the company to launch its first private mission to the International Space Station .
The $ 5 million will be credited to the cost of a future space flight , which could cost $ 35 million or more , Space Adventures CEO Eric Anderson said .
The down payment gives members first option on a seat on the mission .
“ I am a big believer in the exploration and commercial development of the space frontier and am looking forward to the possibility of going into space , ” Brin said in a statement .
Previously Space Adventures has bought seats on Russian missions to the International Space Station for its clients but Anderson said it would now build its own rocket for fully private missions that could start as soon as 2011 .
What Whitney did n't fully appreciate back in 2005 was how the proliferation of interest - only , negative - amortization , and other exotic mortgages would transform many prime borrowers into subprime credit risks .
As she wrote last December , the crucial mistake many lenders made was relying on FICO credit scores to gauge default risk , regardless of the size of the down payment or the type of loan .
Many prime customers who took on mortgages with 90 % or 100 % loan - to - home - value ratios ( LTVs ) are now " performing closer to subprime loans , " she wrote .
The reason :
Any borrower who 's upside down in his mortgage - i.e. , the size of his mortgage is bigger than the value of his home - is likely to make car and credit card payments before paying his home loan .
" The hierarchy of payments has totally shifted , " Whitney now says .
One of Citigroup 's problems was that of all the banks , it had the greatest exposure in dollar terms to high - LTV mortgages .
When housing prices turned south , the delinquency rate on Citi 's home loans soared - rising 53 % during the third quarter of 2007 ( over the third quarter of 2006 ) .
Whitney says it was obvious that Citi would have to shore up its balance sheet .
The bank 's $ 10.8 billion in annual dividend payments was a clear source of potential savings .
Less than three months after Whitney put out her report , Citi announced a 41 % dividend cut designed to save the company $ 4.4 billion a year .
Whitney 's current concern is that banks are n't slashing costs and cutting losses in their loan portfolios fast enough .
On the cost side , she says , banks have yet to come to terms with the disappearance of the securitization market , which she believes will stay in hibernation for the next three years .
Why does this matter ?
From 2001 through 2005 , for every dollar of bank capital used to make mortgage loans , ten were supplied via investors in mortgage securities .
All that secondary - market capital is now sidelined , but the staffing levels of bank lending departments do n't yet reflect it .
By Whitney 's reckoning , banks have laid off about 7 % of their employees ; she thinks the cuts need to reach 25 % .
" These companies have got to resize their businesses , " she says .
" Right now their expenses do not match their revenues . "
She also argues that banks need to " get real " about how they 're valuing their problem mortgage - related debt , much as Merrill Lynch has now done .
And her idea of " real " is pretty drastic .
Whereas most banks are estimating 20 % to 25 % peak - to - trough declines in housing prices , the Case - Shiller housing futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange portend a much steeper 33 % decline , she points out .
In fact , Whitney thinks the actual declines will be worse - closer to 40 % - because of the loss of the securitization market and the paucity of mortgage credit available .
And that means more defaults : " The consumer 's ability to refinance his way out of trouble has diminished greatly . "
This is where Whitney 's critics start licking their chops .
Thomas Brown , a veteran bank analyst and co-founder of bankstocks.com ( with Hill , coincidentally ) , disagrees sharply with Whitney 's contentions that banks need to rid themselves of problem loans and that their stocks wo n't rebound until the write - downs abate .
Brown counters that the numbers
Whitney keeps trotting out are actually lagging indicators .
" During the last credit crisis the stocks hit bottom in November 1990 , and the losses and nonperforming assets did n't peak until well into 1991 , " he says .
" Every cycle there 's one analyst who races to be the most bearish , and this time it 's her .
Honestly , I think we 'll look back and see that Meredith Whitney 's credibility peaked on July 15 " - the day many bank stocks hit their low point for the year ( so far at least ) .
Brown goes a step further , alleging that it's " incredibly arrogant " of Whitney to tell banks and investment banks either to unload their problem loans and mortgage securities or to " get real " about how they 're valued .
He says there 's plenty of history to indicate that holding tight may be the wisest course of action .
" In the last cycle , " Brown says , " Morgan Stanley made a fortune buying written - down commercial real estate assets from banks at 40 cents on the dollar . "
What peeves Brown most about Whitney is her unwillingness to assign a fair market valuation for the stocks she 's trashing : " The only explanation I can see is , she has no idea how to evaluate the possible downside risks . "
To be fair , Whitney has never said bank stocks are worthless .
She would buy Wachovia at $ 5 , for instance .
( It 's now $ 16 . )
But with his salvo Brown has actually restated , albeit pejoratively , a core part of Whitney 's thesis .
If she has no idea how to properly value bank stocks right now , it 's because the metrics do n't work .
Price - to - earnings ratios are useless when earnings are nonexistent .
And valuing banks on price - to - book ratios is just as futile .
Those book values - which reflect underlying assets and liabilities - are moving targets .
" Citibank has lost 50 % of its book value since last year , " Whitney says .
" The point is , I do not think we are near the end of write - downs , so I continue to see capital levels going lower , capital raises diluting existing shares further , and stocks going lower . "
Another negative : two little - talked - about regulatory changes Whitney says will stymie banks ' recoveries .
One is a new accounting rule known as FAS 141R .
Given the depth of the crisis , Whitney expects to see bank regulators arranging shotgun marriages between well - capitalized institutions and foundering ones .
Problem is , any such deals would have to happen before FAS 141R takes effect in December .
The new rule , she says , " will make it almost impossible to do bank mergers . "
The rule demands that an acquirer not only immediately mark to market the portfolio of the company being bought - and remember , bids for mortgage assets are now few and far between - but also mark to market its own portfolio as well .
" Nobody 's going to want to do that , " Whitney says .
Another regulatory change that may wreak havoc : Starting next year , the Office of Thrift Supervision will bar credit card issuers from using outside credit information to reset interest rates .
For instance , Wells Fargo could n't increase the rate on your Visa just because you were late on an electric bill .
While Whitney thinks the OTS proposal is well intentioned , she 's convinced that it will force banks to reduce the amount of credit they extend to consumers , dimming a business that has been a rare bright spot .
With their credit lines trimmed , consumers will cut back even more on spending , deepening the recession .
" When this takes effect , " she says , " it 's basically going to amount to a pay cut for the average American consumer . "
Whitney 's ability to find consumer peril in a proposal ostensibly so consumer - friendly speaks volumes about the darkness of her view .
Indeed , she 's so far out on a limb and so unequivocal in her bearishness , it 's hard to envision how she could reverse course without losing credibility .
It 's a predicament similar to the one Abby Joseph Cohen faced in 2000 and 2001 - one that left her with egg on her face when the stock market faltered .
Fitzgibbon says she recently asked Whitney how it would all end , and Whitney 's answer was fatalistic : " I 'll make a bad call , and that 'll be it . "
When I ask Whitney what 's next for her , career - wise , she is n't sure .
Getting into management holds some interest .
Joining a hedge fund - a common next step for star analysts - does not .
" All I know is , I want to do something big .
I want to earn the right to be at the table with the smartest people . "
Whatever her future holds ,
Whitney says she does n't spend time fretting about whether her epic call on banks might be wrong .
" Look , I always worry about what I might have missed , which is why I work so many hours and get so little sleep , " she says .
" But the numbers speak for themselves .
And what they 're all saying is , this is far , far from over . "

Jack and Grace were the most popular names last year Some traditional names such as Edna and Norman are in danger of dying out in England and Wales , research suggests .
Gurgle.com studied the most popular names of 1907 with those that have made the grade over the past five years .
In 1907 , 1,048 babies were named Gertrude but none were in 2005 .
Baby Normans declined from 1,991 to two .
Many babies are named after celebrities or given made - up names now , rather than being given relatives ' ones , as often happened in the past , Gurgle.com said .
The two Normans named in 2005 were in Shropshire and Tyne and Wear .
GIRLS ' NAMES OUT OF FAVOUR Gertrude Edna Ethel Irene Ada Norah Olive Richard , which was the most popular name 200 years ago , has also declined .
A total of 4,671 babies were named Richard in 1807 , but the number fell to 2,289 in 1907 and 538 in 2005 .
However , the researchers for the social networking site did find that names such as Thomas , Jack and William have remained in vogue for 200 years .
The survey also suggests a royal connection has kept names such as Elizabeth , Philip and Charles consistently popular over the past 100 years .
It also found that some names which have lost popularity have been replaced by something similar , with Olivia replacing Olive as a popular name .
BOYS ' NAMES OUT OF FAVOUR Norman Walter Percy Harold Ernest Herbert Clifford Similarly , Lily has become a modern - day Lilian and Alfred has become Alfie .
Sarah Stone , editor of Gurgle.com , said : " Not so long ago it seems we all knew a Great Uncle Harold or Aunty Irene , but sadly it seems these names could soon be lost forever .
" It is clear that modern parents are increasingly being influenced by fashions and celebrity .
However we also need to remember that there are now more choices available . "
The Office for National Statistics says the most popular baby names last year were Jack , Thomas and Oliver for boys and Grace , Ruby and Olivia for girls .

What are these ?
Piracy is a popular excuse for poor - selling PC games , and while the issue is discussed in the gaming press and between developers nearly endlessly , not much changes .
The developers and publishers still use annoying forms of DRM , the pirates still crack the games within hours , and people who are n't interested in the status quo are rarely listened to .
Cliff Harris , an independent game developer with Positech Games , actually did something about it : he asked the pirates directly why they do what they do .
The story gained much attention , and while the answers he received were n't very surprising , at least they opened a dialog .
Perhaps the most noteworthy thing is the number of responses .
" It seems a lot of people have waited a long time to tell a game developer the answer to this question , " Harris wrote on his blog .
Here 's why
The answers seemed to fall into one of six categories :
The information wants to / free anarchists think copyright should n't exist .
Games are too expensive .
The quality of gaming is too uneven .
DRM is hurting the legitimate customers .
Going to the shops is annoying .
Because piracy is easy to do with low risk for getting caught ..
Most of these issues are well - known complaints and / or justifications for piracy .
What everyone wants to learn is how to turn these pirates into gamers who are willing to pay for their entertainment .
The easiest way , according to these respondents ?
Remove DRM , or at least dial it way down .
" This was expected , but whereas many pirates who debate the issue online are often abusive and aggressive on the topic , most of the DRM complaints were reasonable and well put , " Harris explained .
" People do n't like DRM ; we knew that , but the extent to which DRM is turning away people who have no other complaints is possibly misunderstood .
If you wanted to change ONE thing to get more pirates to buy games , scrapping DRM is it .
These gamers are the low - hanging fruit of this whole debate . "
This is worth saying again , and hopefully more publishers listen .
In many cases DRM ensures that pirates get the superior version of the game , while people who purchased the boxed game have to put up with annoying piracy counter - measures .
This issue became even more surreal last month when Ubisoft used an actual crack from the piracy scene to " fix " an issue customers were having with Rainbow Six Vegas 2 .
The truth is that as long as DRM hurts gamers while pirates enjoy more stable releases , there will always be an incentive to steal .
The challenge for developers and publishers is to now listen to these reasons , and find a way to address the more reasonable complaints ( I do n't suspect # 1 will resonate much with developers ) .
If there is a spike in sales shown , then maybe things like lower prices and the convenience of digital distribution will catch on .
You can't end piracy , but if you make the act of buying and playing games less painful , you might be able to minimize its impact .
Real movement
For Chris Harris , the revelations were worth the time it took to read the masses of e-mails and comments , and the action taken has been swift .
" I 've read enough otherwise honest people complain about DRM to see that its probably hurting more than it helps .
I had planned on using the same system for Kudos 2 , but I 've changed my mind on that .
I have also removed it from Democracy 2 today .
I now use no DRM at all . "
This experiment will also result in a lower price for his games — after an internal struggle .
" Enough people out there see price as a factor to change my mind .
I halved the price of Kudos 1 a few days ago , to $ 9.95 .
I 'll keep an eye on how it does .
I 'm also strongly inclined to price Kudos 2 lower than I originally planned to . "
Harris does n't have much hope for the industry at large .
" Doubtless there will be more FPS games requiring mainframes to run them , more games with Securom , games with no demos , or games with all glitz and no gameplay .
I wish this was n't the case , and that the devs could listen more to their potential customers , and that the pirates could listen more to the devs rather than abusing them .
I do n't think that 's going to happen . "
If enough people give this story coverage , if Harris ' games see a bump in sales , if it gets a few people thinking about these issues ... it 's still possible to see positive change .
If nothing else , the smaller games like those Harris creates can perhaps benefit from this conversation .
" I 'll never make millions from [ games ] , but I think now I know more about
why pirates do what they do , I 'll be in a better position to keep doing
what I wanted , which is making games for the PC . "
Ah , the long overdue explanation of Qui - Gon 's plan .
This was a particularly tricky strip to lay out , given all the text that needed to be squeezed in there .
Transcript
Jar Jar : Thissa so scary !
Qui-Gon :
It 's okay , I tipped the odds in our favour .
Qui -Gon : I sold my blasters to some guys for the betting money before the race , and they agreed to shoot at the other racers .
R2 - D2 : You got the whole 22,375 credits ?
That 's a pretty good deal .
Qui-Gon : Well ...
I also told them I knew about a Cheddar monk they could hand in for the bounty .
Qui-Gon :
They 're coming around afterwards so I can lead them to him .
But we 'll be gone by then , right ?
R2 - D2 : Let 's just recap here .
R2 - D2 : We 've given away our only means of transportation to someone to throw a race in which , at our insistence , he is no longer competing .
R2 - D2 : We 've bet all our money on a nine - year - old driver who has never raced before , in a vehicle he built in his backyard —
Jar Jar : Whatsa never been driven before !
R2 - D2 : We 've sold all of our decent weapons to raise the money for the aforesaid bet .
R2 - D2 : And if by some bizarre unforeseen chance we do n't win ...
R2 - D2 : ... you 've agreed to hand the Queen of a planet we 're meant to be helping over to a sadistic slave - owner —
Jar Jar : And Shmi will comesa after us , muy angry !
R2 - D2 : That too .
Thank you Sally .
R2 - D2 : And a group of mercenaries , armed by you , Jim , will expect you to help them capture ... you .
Qui-Gon :
That 's about right .
{ beat}
R2 - D2 : This campaign is awesome .
A national Associated TV / Zogby International poll1 finds Republican Sen . John McCain taking a barely distinguishable 42% - 41 % lead over Democrat Sen. Barack Obama in the race for the U.S. presidency .
The difference between the candidates is statistically insignificant , but nonetheless indicates a notable turn - around for McCain .
The survey results come as Obama , fresh off what had largely been viewed as a successful tour of the Middle East and Europe , including a speech to 200,000 Germans in Berlin .
A recent Gallup Poll showed that Obama had actually gotten a bump in the polls while overseas .
But the trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive McCain campaign strategy that included a TV ad comparing the celebrity status of Barack Obama to that of Brittney Spears and Paris Hilton .
Pollster John Zogby said :
“ The McCain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade .
Huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of Obama ’s overseas trip have been trumped by McCain ’s attacks on Obama .
Loss of support for Obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about , such as the war and government eavesdropping . ”
It is not always easy for me to make the link between environmental issues and electoral politics .
However , it is clear this time around that the McCain / Republican party focus on drilling for more oil may , in fact , be gaining them some political favor in the eyes of the American voter .
McCain made significant gains at Obama ’s expense among some of what had been Obama ’s strongest demographic groups including young people , women , independents , and single voters .
So , do you think these early poll results really matter ?
Or more importantly , do you think that poll results themselves can have an impact on final voting outcomes ?
1 . This Zogby survey , commissioned by Associated TV , included 1,011 likely voters and was conducted July 31 - Aug. 1 , 2008 .
The poll ’s margin of error is +/- 3.1 percentage points .
Margins of error are higher in sub-groups .
A more complete methodological treatment can be found here .

Seeing the fly has given Mr Mustapha years of psychological torment A Canadian hairdresser who says he suffered from depression and phobias after finding a dead fly in his bottled water has lost a case for damages .
Waddah Mustapha had been awarded $ 341,775 in damages in 2005 , but the Supreme Court of Canada has now overturned that award .
The court said the bottling company , Culligan of Canada , could not have foreseen the psychological damage .
Mr Mustapha says the discovery wrecked his sleep and his sex life .
A Lebanese immigrant who owns a hairstyling business with his wife , Mr Mustapha first installed Culligan water dispensers at his home and his business in 1986 .
The family kept only Culligan water in their house for the next 15 years .
Water phobia
But in 2001 Mr Mustapha noticed one whole fly and another half fly in an unopened bottle as he was loading it onto his cooler .
After this , he began to feel nauseous and depressed , and developed a phobia for water , only being able to take showers with his head down , so the water did not strike his face .
Justice John Brockenshire found in the original damages case in 2005 that Mr Mustapha suffered a " major depressive disorder " .
In his ruling , he said : " He pictures flies walking on animal faeces or rotten food and then being in his supposedly pure drinking water . "
But on Thursday the Supreme Court confirmed , in a 9 - 0 ruling , an Ontario Court of Appeal decision , which overturned the original award .
Chief Justice Beverley McLauchlin said that " Mustapha failed to show that it was foreseeable that a person of ordinary fortitude would suffer serious injury from seeing the flies in the bottle of water he was about to install " .
The Chief Justice added : " I conclude that the loss suffered by the plaintiff was too remote to be reasonably foreseen and that consequently , he cannot recover damages from the defendant . "

Obama leads McCain among likely voters by 47 percent to 45 percent , within the poll ’s 3.1 percent margin of error .
He gained ground in the last month among independent and women voters and on the question of who could best manage the faltering U.S. economy .
Obama wiped out McCain ’s 5 - point edge in a Reuters / Zogby poll taken in August before the nominating conventions , a sign the Arizona senator could be drifting back to earth from what other opinion polls showed was a post - convention surge .
“ We ’re back to where we always thought we would be -- in a very competitive race , ” pollster John Zogby said .
The poll , taken Thursday through Saturday , follows a hectic month in the race to the November 4 election as both parties held their nominating conventions and both candidates selected their vice presidential running mates .
McCain ’s choice of Sarah Palin , an anti-abortion and pro-gun first - term governor from Alaska , as his No. 2 set off a political firestorm that helped stoke conservative enthusiasm for the Republican ticket .
But Zogby said Palin also helped solidify Democratic support for Obama .
“ For the last few weeks it ’s been all about Palin and she has been a divisive force , ” he said .
“ She has shored up the base for both candidates . ”
Obama , who struggled to solidify Democrats in August when just 74 percent backed him , now has the support of 89 percent of Democrats .
McCain ’s support among Republicans grew from 81 percent last month to 89 percent .
Nearly one - third of likely voters said the choice of Palin made them more likely to support McCain and nearly one - quarter said it made them less likely .
About 43 percent said it would have no effect .
Obama ’s selection of Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , as his No. 2 had less impact .
About 23 percent said they were more likely to vote for Obama with Biden on the ticket and 16 percent said they were less likely .
MCCAIN STILL LEADS ON ECONOMY
Half of all voters said the economy was the top issue , and the poll showed McCain narrowly led Obama on the question of which candidate could best manage the economy by 47 percent to 45 percent .
But that was a significant gain for Obama from McCain ’s 9 - point advantage last month .
The poll was taken before Sunday ’s upheaval on Wall Street with the fall of Lehman Brothers Holding and the sale of Merrill Lynch .

Obama has tried to refocus the campaign on his proposals for the economy after a Republican convention where he was heavily criticized as a liberal elitist unfamiliar with the struggles of working families .
The Illinois senator wiped out McCain ’s 5 - point August lead among independents and expanded his edge over McCain among women , two crucial swing voting blocs in November .
Obama now has a statistically insignificant 1 - point edge over McCain among independents and has a 7 - point lead among women , up from a 2 - point advantage last month .

He also gained ground among Catholics and older voters , but lost support to McCain among suburban voters and small - town residents .
Palin has made her background as the mayor of Wasilla , a town of about 9,000 residents , a key component of her political biography .
The poll found McCain and Obama were in an absolute dead heat at 45 percent when independent candidate Ralph Nader and Libertarian Party candidate Bob Barr were added to the mix .
Nader earned 2 percent and Barr 1 percent of the vote .
The telephone poll of 1,008 likely voters had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points .
The poll was taken as McCain and Obama head into three potentially crucial debates beginning on September 26 in Oxford , Mississippi .
Palin and Biden will hold one debate on October 2 in St. Louis .
Said Tsarnayev stumbled into a war .
A Chechen freelance photographer with the Reuters news agency , Tsarnayev arrived in the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , during the day on August 7 .
Traveling together with a colleague , Tsarnayev said he planned to take photographs of the environment and natural surroundings in the area for a project he was working on .
Once in Tskhinvali , he discovered a virtual army of Russian journalists at his hotel .
Speaking to RFE / RL's North Caucasus Service , Tsarnayev , a resident of the Chechen capital , Grozny , said the Moscow - based reporters had been sent from various Russian media outlets days earlier , and were preparing to cover something big .
" At the hotel we discovered that there were already 48 Russian journalists there .
Together with us , there were 50 people , " Tsarnayev said .
" I was the only one representing a foreign news agency .
The rest were from Russian media and they arrived three days before we did , as if they knew that something was going to happen .
Earlier at the border crossing , we met one man who was taking his wife and children from Tskhinvali . "
Late that night , armed conflict broke out between Russia and Georgia .
' No Relationship To Reality '
Tsarnayev 's account could not be independently confirmed .
But it is consistent with mounting indications that Russia had been planning an attack on Georgia in advance , and was just waiting for a pretext to carry it out .
Russia 's state - controlled media seemed extremely well - prepared to cover the outbreak of armed conflict in Georgia .
Television networks immediately presented elaborate graphics with news anchors and commentators appearing to stick to disciplined talking points accusing Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili of aggression , and the Georgian armed forces of genocide and ethnic cleansing .
The country 's best English - speaking officials were made readily available to Western media , where they relentlessly pushed Moscow 's line on the conflict : Russia was simply protecting its citizens and peacekeepers in South Ossetia from atrocities at the hands of Georgia 's military .
In an interview with RFE / RL in the early days of the conflict , Steven Pifer , a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who is now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington , said Moscow 's rhetoric and media narrative suggests they were preparing a large - scale operation .
" The rhetoric that is coming out of Moscow , ethnic cleansing and genocide , is just way over the top , " Pifer said .
" It 's almost approaching the point where there is just no relationship to reality .
But again , certainly the rhetoric is appropriate to a larger operation against Georgia to just stop and reverse whatever military gains the Georgians made in South Ossetia on [ August 7 ] . "
The apparently well - prepared media narrative is only part of the picture .
On August 3 , authorities in Georgia 's Moscow - backed separatist province of South Ossetia began evacuating hundreds of children to Russia .
At the time , Georgian officials said the move could be a signal that separatist authorities , and their patrons in Russia , were preparing an offensive .
South Ossetian authorities said at the time that the evacuations were a precaution in case Georgia attempted to retake the province by force -- something Moscow and Tskhinvali had been accusing Tbilisi of plotting to do .
Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on August 21 , the deputy head of Russia 's General Staff , Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , reiterated Moscow 's claims that the Georgian side was preparing to use force .
" We have complaints against the OSCE regarding the initial stage of the conflict -- they were informed by the Georgian side that there would be an invasion , but they did n't warn the Russian peacekeepers , " Nogovitsyn said .
In remarks reported by " The Washington Post , " Georgian Defense Minister Davit Kezerashvili said he gave the order for Georgian forces to " go out from their bases " at 6 p.m. local time on August 7 , just one hour before Saakashvili announced a unilateral cease - fire .
Months In The Works
Kezerashvili said the Georgian troop movement was designed to deter South Ossetian separatists , who were firing across the de facto border into Georgian - controlled villages .
But observers say the march toward war on Moscow 's side began months earlier .
In fact , hostilities began escalating soon after NATO delayed granting Membership Action Plans -- a key phase before full membership -- to Georgia and Ukraine at its summit in early April .
Less than two weeks later , Vladimir Putin , who was in the last month of his presidency , signed a decree authorizing direct relations with and assistance for Georgia 's two pro-Moscow separatist provinces , Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Later in April , Russia deployed 1,500 additional troops , some of them heavily armed , to its " peacekeeping " contingent in Abkhazia without Georgia 's consent -- an express violation of the 1994 cease - fire agreement .
Russia also began shooting down Georgia 's unmanned drone aircraft that were conducting reconnaissance over Abkhazia .
Russian military aircraft also began regularly violating Georgian airspace near the separatist territory .
In June , Russia deployed unarmed troops to Abkhazia to rebuild a rail link between Sukhumi and Ochamchira .
At the time , Moscow presented the move as a humanitarian gesture to improve Abkhazia 's transportation infrastructure .
But U.S. and Georgian officials later pointed out that the railway was used to transport military equipment and munitions into Georgia during the conflict .
Then , with everybody watching Abkhazia , the focus abruptly shifted to South Ossetia .
In July , Russia 's armed forces began massive military training exercises in the North Caucasus involving 8,000 servicemen and 700 pieces of military hardware .
Russia 's 58th Army , which would later spearhead the incursion into Georgia on August 8 , was the key unit in those maneuvers .
The 58th Army remained in the North Caucasus after the exercises .
Shortly thereafter , Georgian and South Ossetian separatist forces began exchanging artillery , mortar , and sniper fire across the de facto border .
Georgian officials accuse the separatists of instigating the exchanges , but South Ossetian authorities deny the allegation .
Pifer said is appears that Russia laid a well - prepared trap for the Georgians , and Tbilisi took the bait .
" The Georgian leadership made a mistake on [ August 7 ] .
They should have understood from what they have seen from the Russians that the Russians were looking for a pretext .
They [ the Georgians ] gave them that pretext when they decided to go in a fairly large way into South Ossetia , " Pifer said .
" The speed of the Russian response suggests that the Russians were ready , they were just waiting for the reason and they took that as the reason . "
