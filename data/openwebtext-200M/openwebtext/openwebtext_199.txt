Google 's Sergei Brin and Steve Horowitz show off multiple prototypes of the Android platform , one of which has a Palm smartphone form factor and one that has a higher - end , HTC Windows Mobile form factor .
The former shows off text messaging and Google maps ( which looks pretty great , btw ) , and the latter shows off 3G desktop - quality web browsing using webkit .
There 's also 3D OpenGL rendering , application feature sharing , and iPhone - esque finger gesturing .
If you were n't excited about Android yet , just think about how this could turn out to be the open - source iPhone .

The longest follow - up among these patients has been for 13 months .
Cytograft says the vessels hold promise for patients with damaged blood vessels from diabetes , arteriosclerosis , birth defects and other problems .
But monitoring for a much longer period will be needed before those uses could become standard , the team said .
“ This technique has a big potential in the vascular surgical field , ” said Dr. Toshiharu Shinoka , who directs pediatric cardiovascular surgery at Yale and who plans to conduct studies with Cytograft on the new vessel .
He called the technique an advance over one he used in operations on children in Japan , in which vessels were grown from cells on a scaffold that then degraded and was absorbed into the body .
Doctors not connected with the company agreed on the importance of the new technique .
“ A potential benefit may be for infants and children with congenital heart defects , ” said Dr. Deepak Srivastava , director of the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease at the University of California , San Francisco .
Unlike grafts from cadavers , he added , “ the Cytograft vessels should be able to grow as the child does . ”
The Cytograft studies were done at a leading cardiovascular center in Argentina , where medical costs are much lower than in the United States .
The patients were all receiving chronic kidney dialysis , which cleanses wastes from the blood .

As is standard for such treatment , doctors had surgically cut an artery and a vein in the forearm and joined them in a link known as a shunt , which provides access for the repeated needle punctures needed to connect a patient to a dialysis machine .
Such shunts can last up to 15 years .
But when clots and infections develop in the shunts to reduce or stop blood flow , new ones must be created .
If you ’re planning a car trip for this Fourth of July , be wary :
It ’s the most dangerous day of the year to drive .
Driving is particularly perilous if you ’re in rural Maine , which tops a new list of states that have the highest incidences of crashes on rural roads .
Traveling in a car is one of the most dangerous things most people ever do ; the lifetime risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident for U.S residents is 1 - in - 100 .
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , the top two days of the year for motor vehicle fatalities over the years 1986 - 2002 have been July 3 and July 4 .
The danger is even greater when traveling on rural roads , or those located outside of areas with a population of 5,000 or more .
The lighter traffic on these roads can lull drivers into a false sense of security , leading them to drive at unsafe speeds , distracted , fatigued , unbelted or impaired , all of which increase the likelihood of a crash .
Head - on collisions and driving off the road crashes — both of which are disproportionately deadly — are common on the two - lane , undivided highways prevalent in rural areas .
“ Millions of Americans will be driving this holiday weekend , and they would be wise to carefully consider these findings before they do , ” said CERS Director Lee Munnich , Jr. , of the University of Minnesota .
“ America ’s rural byways seem so tranquil and safe , but the reality is that they can be as lethal as they are lovely . ”
The University of Minnesota ’s Center for Excellence in Rural Safety used 2005 U.S. Department of Transportation data to compile a list of states with the most dangerous rural roads .
The results were released today .
The top 10 states with the highest proportion of their total traffic fatalities occurring on rural roads include :
Maine ( 92 percent )
North Dakota ( 90 percent )
South Dakota ( 89 percent )
Iowa ( 88 percent )
Vermont ( 88 percent )
Montana ( 86 percent )
Wyoming ( 84 percent )
South Carolina ( 83 percent )
Mississippi ( 82 percent )
Arkansas ( 81 percent )
West Virginia ( 80 percent )
“ All states need to improve rural highway safety , but the issue is particularly pressing in these states , ” Munnich said .
One of the best ways to reduce traffic fatalities is to promote seat belt usage , according to the CERS .
Timing is everything , particularly in the case of amazing photography .
Sometimes that means waiting through a whole sports game and getting lucky to catch just the right shot .
Other times than means trudging through nature for weeks to get the perfect environmental photograph .
Here are 25 examples of perfectly timed images from around the world and in various genres .
With extreme sports it is the danger and challenge that tends to excite people .
Often the most amazing and bizarre images are taken right at the moment when disaster strikes .
Sometimes these are tragic and painful though some are just plain funny .
With conventional sports there is always the opportunity for comedy but also the potential for artful photography .
The spray of sand during a long - jump or that moment before the splash when someone is diving both provide a moment of calm in a fast - paced sport that is normally impossible to see .
In war it is often hard to find or revel in humor or traditional beauty .
Instead , it is often the images that capture grave or impressive moments in time that stir us most deeply .
This can come in the form of a rocket frozen in space or the geometry of a cloud of smoke from a tank .
With people comedy tends to be the rule and other things the exception .
Humans tend to be at their most interesting when they are at their funniest .
Whether this means a young man falling into a fountain or an old woman riding a sled , it ’s worth keeping your eyes open in public places for the perfect shot !
Nature images truly span the spectrum of artistic possibility .
Sometimes animals are funny , sometimes scary , often tragic and sometimes downright strange .
Whether they be shot in a conventional park or bedroom or taken deep in the wilds , environmental images taken at just the right time can provide unique insights into nature and the relationship of humans and animals .

The majority of advertising exposure occurs when the audience 's attention is focused elsewhere , such as while flipping through a magazine or browsing a web site .
However , a new study reveals that even this incidental exposure to advertising may have a positive effect on consumer attitudes .
Forthcoming in the June issue of the Journal of Consumer Research , the study revises existing theories of exposure advertising , specifically repeated views of web - based banner ads .
" Effects of mere exposure are expected to grow in a marketplace where consumers ' attention is often focused elsewhere , " write Xiang Fang ( Oklahoma State University ) , Surendra Singh ( University of Kansas ) , and Rohini Ahluwalia ( University of Minnesota ) .
" Regardless of measured click - through rates , banner ads may still create a favorable attitude toward the ad due to repeated exposure . "
The researchers investigated whether " mere exposure effect , " a condition in which people develop a positive perception of stimuli not presented to them on a noticeable level , was also applicable to incidental advertising .
In a series of experiments , the researchers discovered that even if people could not recall the content of the ad , repeated exposure led to familiarity , which then led to positive feelings .
" Our research could have important theoretical and practical implications .
Theoretically , it enhances our understanding of the process underlying the mere exposure effect .
Practically , it provides some useful guidelines for advertisers to develop more accurate measures of banner ad effectiveness , " the authors write .
Participants had more positive evaluations toward the target banner ad as exposure frequency increased .
Surprisingly , participants also showed high levels of tolerance for banner ads on which they were not directly focused .
According to the researchers , even after twenty exposures , common wear - out effects were not apparent .
" Our results suggest that the fluency resulting from frequent passive exposure and the consequent spontaneous affective reaction provide a crucial link between exposure and positive impressions , " write the authors .
" Such spontaneous affect influenced evaluative judgments through a more complex process , likely by coloring the interpretation of the fluency experience and the nature of resulting metacognitions relating fluency with liking . "

As he walks into the anti-terrorism office , Rod Swanson picks up a bullhorn and blasts a warning of “ red badge . ”
The large room , filled with cubicles , looks like those on other floors of the FBI building in Las Vegas .
But in government jargon the office of the Joint Terrorism Task Force of Nevada is a “ SCIF ” — a secret compartmentalized information facility — which means it is constantly dealing with top - secret intelligence .
So on those rare occasions when someone who is not authorized to view that secret information is escorted in , everyone working in the office has to be alerted .
Close those files .
Clear those computer screens .
Turn those papers over .
Be careful what you say .
The investigators working there have access to all the latest anti-terrorism intelligence , and it has to be pored over every day to try to make sure no one blows up a crowded resort on the Strip , gets into nuclear supplies at the Nevada Test Site or tries to set in motion any of the other myriad scenarios that Swanson ’s team is charged with guarding against .
“ Nobody ever wants to be wrong , ” Swanson said .
“ Nobody ever wants to miss something that they should n’t have missed . ”
“ I sort of see our mission as defend everywhere , every second of the day , against every threat , ” he said .
“ We have everything that we can think of in place to maximize our opportunities to get that piece of information that might allow us to prevent something very bad from happening here or elsewhere .
“ Is it the kind of thing that keeps you up at night ?
Yep . ”
Las Vegas — with its massive tourist population , constant flights in and out from all over the world , free flow of cash , and status as the nation ’s capital of hedonism — is prone to potential terrorist activity , authorities have long warned .
“ It ’s very easy to get in and out of here , and it ’s very easy to blend in when you get here , ” Swanson said .
If an act of terrorism were to occur anywhere in Nevada , Swanson ’s FBI - run task force — which includes representatives from 20 federal , state and local law enforcement agencies — would take the lead in investigating the crime .
The task force shares intelligence with the Southern Nevada Counter - Terrorism Center , a multijurisdiction agency led by Metro Police .
Authorities have not uncovered any major threats to Las Vegas so far , but the city remains high on the list of potential terrorist targets , Swanson said .
“ There is some significant activity here , ” he said .
“ There are people who may be sympathetic to Islamic extremism . ”
Most of the activity in the valley involves fundraising and recruiting for extremist groups , Swanson said .
His team has n’t had to file any terrorism cases with the court system , but that does n’t mean it has n’t been busy .
Most of the time , he said , cases with terrorism overtones are handled in other ways , such as through deportation or more run -of - the - mill criminal charges .
Swanson , 47 , spent 11 1/2 years as an Army infantry officer before joining the FBI 13 years ago .
He worked counterterrorism cases for the FBI in Washington from 2003 to 2005 before coming to Las Vegas to take charge of the FBI ’s organized crime squad here .
He began his assignment with the Joint Terrorism Task Force in October after spending time on the front lines of the war on terrorism .
He learned firsthand how Islamic extremist groups operate during a 3 1/2 - month stint as the FBI ’s on - scene commander for counterterrorism in Iraq .
“ I have a little bit of an appreciation for other aspects of the war on terror that I did n’t know before , ” he said .
From July 1 through Oct. 7 , Swanson lived in a dorm in the heart of Baghdad ’s heavily fortified — and often under fire — Green Zone , which houses the U.S. Embassy complex .
Always armed with a handgun and an M4 semiautomatic rifle , and always wearing a protective flak jacket , Swanson spent 16 hours a day overseeing 78 federal agents and analysts assigned to counterterrorism in Iraq .
He traveled across the country investigating kidnappings of American citizens and soldiers and helping the Iraqi government put together criminal terrorism cases .
He had arrived shortly after the U.S. troop surge began .
In his last month on the job , the attacks on and around the Green Zone had nearly stopped , but “ in the first half of my rotation , ( Baghdad ) was a very dangerous place , ” Swanson said .
“ People were dying all the time . ”
Swanson was on his way to the U.S. Embassy one morning when an insurgent ’s rocket landed about 75 yards away , killing a security officer .
“ It was a little unnerving , ” he said .

CORAL GABLES , Florida ( Reuters ) - Hillary Clinton and other Democratic presidential hopefuls wooed Hispanic voters on Sunday with pledges to back a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and attacks on Republican “ demagoguery ” on the issue of immigration .

All the 2008 Democratic presidential contenders at a debate broadcast in Spanish on Univision , the country ’s largest Spanish - language television network , said they would push quickly once in the White House for a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws .
Most of the candidates condemned what they said were Republican efforts to demonize illegal immigrants and use the issue of immigration to divide Americans .
“ It is being demagogued and I believe it is being used to bash immigrants and that must stop , ” Clinton , a New York senator , said of the debate on how to handle the country ’s estimated 12 million illegal immigrants .
New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , who would be the first Hispanic U.S. president , said , “ I object to the dehumanizing of people that want to be part of the American dream . ”
He and Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd are the two fluent Spanish speakers in the Democratic field .
“ The politics of fear are the most dangerous politics in our country , and those people who deal with fear and frighten the American people on this issue ought to be dealt with accordingly , ” Dodd said at the University of Miami debate , billed as a discussion of issues crucial to Hispanic voters .
Hispanics are the country ’s biggest and fastest - growing minority group , accounting for about 15 percent of the population and at least 14 million potential voters in 2008 .
President George W. Bush won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004 , but Democrats see a growing opportunity to win over Hispanics alienated by the hard - line Republican stance on immigration .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
A USA Today / Gallup poll in June found nearly three quarters of Hispanics identified themselves as Democratic , and Clinton , the leader in national polls among all voters , held a wide lead among Hispanic voters as well .
‘ FEAR - MONGERING ’
Barack Obama , a senator from Illinois and Clinton ’s closest rival in polls , said the “ fear - mongering ” against illegal immigrants had been successful in recent months because many working Americans feel they are losing economic ground .
“ A president not only has to speak out forcefully against anti-immigrant sentiment ... but make sure all workers are taken care of , ” Obama said .
Efforts at a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws collapsed in the U.S. Congress amid a bitter debate on the future of undocumented workers and illegal immigrants in the United States , many of whom are Hispanic .
The Democrats condemned a bill passed last year by the then Republican - led House of Representatives but never approved by the full Congress that cracked down on illegal aliens and boosted border security efforts .
Richardson lampooned plans to build a fence along the Mexican border to protect against illegal immigration .
“ If you ’re going to build a 12 - foot wall , you know what ’s going to happen ?
A bunch of 13 - foot ladders , ” Richardson said .
But Clinton , Obama and Dodd defended their votes to build a wall , included in a Senate immigration bill not passed by the full Congress , as a necessary part of greater border security .
“ We ’ve got to secure our borders .
That has to be part of comprehensive immigration reform , ” Clinton said .
The questions were asked in Spanish and the candidates heard English translations through earpieces .
All the candidates answered in English and were translated for the Spanish - language audience .
Richardson complained about the restrictions on speaking in Spanish .
“ I ’m very proud to be the first major Latino candidate to run for president , ” said Richardson , adding he was “ disappointed ” that 43 million Latinos would not “ hear one of their own speak Spanish . ”
Seven of the eight Democratic contenders participated in the debate .
Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , recently returned from Iraq and did not attend .

Torture of detainees .
Secret government kidnapping .
Indefinite detention .
These ideas should not represent the United States of America .
Torture is un-American .
And we need to tell our leaders and the rest of the world how deeply we oppose our government 's unconscionable involvement in these acts .
Exactly two years after images from Abu Ghraib prison shocked people everywhere and tarnished America 's standing as a champion of freedom , the ACLU is releasing a detailed report on the United States ' failure to comply with the universal prohibition against torture – abroad and at home .
The ACLU filed the report with the United Nations Committee Against Torture , which will review the United States ' compliance with the treaty in early May .
The report , " Enduring Abuse : Torture and Cruel Treatment by the United States at Home and Abroad , " documents a systemic pattern of torture and abuse of detainees in U.S. custody abroad .
It exposes the federal government 's failure to reverse the policies that led to this abuse or to hold a single high - ranking official responsible .
The report also shows that torture and abuse is not limited to actions by military personnel overseas in the " war on terror , " but in fact is far too common at home – through pervasive prison rape , abusive conditions at supermax prisons , and taser use by local police .
The ACLU report is based on our ongoing advocacy against torture in the courts , in Congress , and through Freedom of Information Act requests that led to the compelled production by the U.S. government of over 100,000 pages of documents on the torture and abuse of detainees in U.S. custody in Guantanamo , Iraq and Afghanistan .
We are committed to holding the U.S. government accountable to human rights obligations at home and abroad .
Even as one faction of the American government , the military and the corporatocracy grow collectively more alarmed about the possibility of a US attack on Iran , the Bush / Cheney administration and its allies seem increasingly moving towards just such a new war .
Okay , so Sen. James Webb ( D - VA ) and 29 other US Senators who oppose such a mad plan have done what ?
They 've written a letter to the president telling him that he cannot attack Iran without express approval in advance from the Congress .
A letter !
Boy , that 'll stop him .
What 's the matter with these people ?
A few months back , the Senate overwhelmingly passed a resolution authored by war cheerleader Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to be a " global terrorist organization . "
In President Bush 's pathologically twisted view of his power , that resolution gave him all the go - ahead he needed , because Bush and his legal apologists claim that back on Sept. 18 , 2001 , Congress , in passing an Authorization for Use of Military Force against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan , were actually declaring a War on Terror - - a conflict without end and without borders .
Under this crazy logic , any attack on a terrorist or terrorist organization is simply another battle in that " war . "
If Sen .
Webb and his colleagues really want to stop the president from further murderous madness , they need only revoke that 2001 AUMF .
A simple resolution declaring it ended , and stating that the war on terror is not a war would do the trick .
Why has n't the Congress done this ?
Are they afraid the president will call them " soft on terror " ?
No doubt he would , but I think most Americans have grown weary of Bush 's name calling .
People are pretty aware now that the raised and lowered colored alert flags , the periodic dire warnings of impending doom , all conveniently timed to coincide with moments when the president or his allies are facing legal or political difficulties , are just cheap scare politics .
Any member of Congress with a scintilla of courage could easily make that case to constituents .
People know this president is a whack job and that the vice president is a liar .
So why does n't someone propose revoking the 2001 AUMF ?
The aircraft carriers , loaded with Tomahawk missiles and the largest bomber fleet ever assembled , are in place .
Stealth bombers are being retrofitted to carry a new 15 - ton bomb .
The army has built a base right near the Iranian border in Iraq .
There was the bizarre case of the six missing nuclear missiles .
The verbal threats against Iran are increasing .
US special forces are reportedly already operating in Iran , encouraging and perhaps participating in acts of terror against the regime and its military forces there .
Oil prices are starting to rise to unseen levels as commodities traders bet on the impact of a closing of the Persian Gulf to oil traffic .
Time grows short to stop a catastrophe .
If Congress does n't act soon to pull the legal rug out from under the president , we could well see a catastrophe .
If the US does attack Iran , the global economy will go into a tailspin as oil soars past $ 200 / barrel .
The war in the Middle East would become a vast regional conflagration .
US troops in Iraq , already thinly stretched , would come under attack from all sides .
A draft would certainly be required .
And if the Iranians respond to a US attack with asymetrical warfare by attacking targets in the US , we could see military rule at home .
This is no time for members of Congress to write letters to the president .
It 's time for them to revoke the 2001 AUMF and to tell the president that an attack on Iran would be an impeachable offense .
In fact , why wait ?
It 's time for them to impeach him now !
This is just his latest crime in the making .
And even threatening a war of aggression against a nation that does n't pose an immediate threat is a violation of the UN Charter , a treaty that the US signed years ago and is bound by .

WASHINGTON — Poor Margaret Spellings !
The secretary of education was ready to talk student loans and No Child Left Behind when interviewed by Washington Post editors and reporters last week .
So maybe she was taken aback when asked why she turned down Karl Rove when he asked her out in the early ' 80s .
( Rove later joked it took his ego " decades to recover . " )
Spellings paused , then said : " Have you met Karl Rove ?
" He was so inept and so inartful , " she added .
" I mean , I could n't even understand . "
A reporter brought up Rove to change the subject after a journalist inadvertently made Spellings cry .
When asked to describe a side of President Bush the public does n't know , the secretary started telling an old story about how then - Gov .
Bush consoled a Texas official who had broken down while eulogizing a colleague .
" Oh , I 'm going to cry just telling you the story , " she said , removing her glasses and dabbing her eyes with a napkin .
" Y'all , I can't believe you did this to me ! "
She left the interview still a little weepy and mulling the potential impact of crying in front of the press .
" Now you 'll take sympathy on me , " she said .
" Maybe . "
UCSD Researchers Give
Computers � Common Sense�
Computer Scientists Inject Context into Automated Image Annotation
October 17 , 2007
By Daniel Kane
Looking at the photo above , you see a person on a tennis court , wielding a tennis racket and chasing a ... lemon .
Right ?
Wrong .
You do n’t think it ’s a lemon .
You know it 's a tennis ball .
Computers with the latest image labeling algorithms do n't have the contextual wits to know a lemon is very unlikely in this scene .
UCSD computer scientists are looking to change that .
Image credit : UC San Diego
Using a little - known Google Labs widget , computer scientists from UC San Diego and UCLA have brought common sense to an automated image labeling system .
This common sense is the ability to use context to help identify objects in photographs .
For example , if a conventional automated object identifier has labeled a person , a tennis racket , a tennis court and a lemon in a photo , the new post - processing context check will re-label the lemon as a tennis ball .
“ We think our paper is the first to bring external semantic context to the problem of object recognition , ” said computer science professor Serge Belongie from UC San Diego .
The researchers show that the Google Labs tool called Google Sets can be used to provide external contextual information to automated object identifiers .
The paper will be presented on Thursday 18 October 2007 at ICCV 2007 – the 11th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
Google Sets generates lists of related items or objects from just a few examples .
If you type in John , Paul and George , it will return the words Ringo , Beatles and John Lennon .
If you type “ neon ” and “ argon ” it will give you the rest of the noble gasses .
“ In some ways , Google Sets is a proxy for common sense .
In our paper , we showed that you can use this common sense to provide contextual information that improves the accuracy of automated image labeling systems , ” said Belongie .
The image labeling system is a three step process .
First , an automated system splits the image up into different regions through the process of image segmentation .
In the photo of the tennis player , image segmentation separates the person , the court , the racket and the yellow sphere .
The computer scientists injected context into an automated image labeling system through a post - processing context check .
The approach strives to maximize the contextual agreement among the labeled objects within each picture .

Next , an automated system provides a ranked list of probable labels for each of these image regions .
Finally , the system adds a dose of context by processing all the different possible combinations of labels within the image and maximizing the contextual agreement among the labeled objects within each picture .
It is during this step that Google Sets can be used as a source of context that helps the system turn a lemon into a tennis ball .
In this case , these “ semantic context constraints ” helped the system disambiguate between visually similar objects .
Thanks to context information , an inaccurate cow label is correctly turned into a boat .
Left to Right : Original segmented image ; Categorization without contextual constraints ; Categorization with co-occurrence contextual constraints derived from the training data ; Ground truth .

In another example , the researchers show that an object originally labeled as a cow is ( correctly ) re-labeled as a boat when the other objects in the image – sky , tree , building and water – are considered during the post - processing context step .
In this case , the semantic context constraints helped to correct an entirely wrong image label .
The context information came from the co-occurrence of object labels in the training sets rather than from Google Sets .
The computer scientists also highlight other advances they bring to automated object identification .
First , instead of doing just one image segmentation , the researchers generated a collection of image segmentations and put together a shortlist of stable image segmentations .
This increases the accuracy of the segmentation process and provides an implicit shape description for each of the image regions .
Second , the researchers ran their object categorization model on each of the segmentations , rather than on individual pixels .
This dramatically reduced the computational demands on the object categorization model .
In the two sets of images that the researchers tested , the categorization results improved considerably with inclusion of context .
For one image dataset , the average categorization accuracy increased more than 10 percent using the semantic context provided by Google Sets .
In a second dataset , the average categorization accuracy improved by about 2 percent using the semantic context provided by Google Sets .
The improvements were higher when the researchers gleaned context information from data on co-occurrence of object labels in the training data set for the object identifier .
Right now , the researchers are exploring ways to extend context beyond the presence of objects in the same image .
For example , they want to make explicit use of absolute and relative geometric relationships between objects in an image – such as “ above ” or “ inside ” relationships .
This would mean that if a person were sitting on top of an animal , the system would consider the animal to be more likely a horse than a dog .

Analyst : Still images suggest Bin Laden video doctored to seem new David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday November 1 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Osama bin Laden video released this past September 7 , just prior to the sixth anniversary of 9/11 , has provoked widespread suspicions of fraud .
In particular , bin Laden 's beard -- which was grey and ragged in the video released just before the 2004 election -- is thick , black , and neatly trimmed in the new footage .
The video aroused widespread suspicions that bin Laden 's beard had been faked in some way , with former White House counterterrorism advisor Richard Clarke even speculating that bin Laden had shaved in order to hide out in a country like Indonesia , where Muslim men do not wear beards , and had then pasted on a false beard for the video .
More recently , it has been noted that all but a small portion of the 25 - minute video consists of still images , including the section which mentions current events , suggesting the possibility that old footage has been doctored to seem new .
Computer security consultant Neal Krawetz told NBC
News that the latest video is strikingly similar to the previous 2004 release , appearing to use the same studio setting and clothing , but that the beard itself does not appear to be false .
Other video analysts are in disagreement about whether the videos could have been recorded at the same time -- and if so , how to explain the difference in bin Laden 's beard .
Fox News spoke about the controversy to Daveed Gartenstein - Ross , vice president for research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies .
" I 'm not an expert on video analysis , " Gartenstein - Ross replied .
" I do n't have a view as to whether or not this video were pre-recorded . "
However , he expressed more self - assurance on the question of bin Laden 's beard , saying , " There are only certain circumstances under Islamic law where you 're allowed to dye your beard black .
One of those is as a tool of war , to make yourself seem like a more formidable opponent . "
" Deception itself is only allowed under certain circumstances under Islamic law , " Gartenstein - Ross continued .
" Al Qaeda may well have thought that ... it was permissible to go ahead and record a great deal of video in case bin Laden is still alive but unable to appear on video . "
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on October 31 , 2007 .

Gordon Brown 's plans to tighten the law on cannabis by increasing the penalties for possession suffered a fresh blow yesterday as the latest official figures showed the decision to downgrade the drug had been followed by a significant fall in its use .
British Crime Survey statistics showed that the proportion of 16 - to 24 - year - olds using cannabis slumped from 28 % a decade ago to 21 % now , with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004 .
Mr Brown asked the government 's advisory committee on the misuse of drugs to take a second look at the classification of cannabis in July after reports that stronger strains of cannabis - known as " superskunk " - were dominating the British market , with startling implications for the mental health of frequent users .
At the same time three Home Office ministers , including the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , publicly admitted using cannabis in their youth .
Ms Smith will have the responsibility of deciding whether to regrade cannabis as a class B drug early next year when the committee is expected to report .
The change would mean the current police policy of confiscating any of the drug found and issuing a warning on the street would be replaced by arrest and a formal caution at a police station .
But the BCS figures published yesterday showed that cannabis is beginning to lose its allure with teenagers .
The proportion of frequent users in the 16 - 24 age group , who were using the drug more than once a month , fell from 12 % to 8 % in the past four years .
Since cannabis was downgraded the proportion of young people using it has fallen each year from 25.3 % in 2003 - 4 to 20.9 % now .
Among those aged 16 to 59 , the proportion over the same period has fallen from 10.8 % to 8.2 % .
Earlier this week , a Joseph Rowntree study found that heavy cannabis use exacerbated the existing social problems of vulnerable young people but those in further and higher education who lead relatively stable lives managed their cannabis use with fewer negative effects .
The decline in cannabis consumption prompted a call from the independent UK Drugs Policy Commission to take decisions about drug classification out of the hands of ministers .
Dame Ruth Runciman , the commission 's chief , said : " We do not believe the credibility of the current system or the clarity of message has been enhanced when , in just the space of seven years , five home secretaries have sought one way or another to address the classification of cannabis . "
Good policymaking had been overshadowed by " politicking " , and much of the confusion among public and politicians stemmed from misunderstandings about the classification system .
The commission also says there is no evidence a drug 's classification deterred use , and suggested that instead of tinkering the whole classification system should be placed outside the direct control of politicians .
The Home Office said yesterday the " widespread growing use " of police powers to issue street warnings was also a likely contributory factor to a 54 % increase in cannabis seizures in 2005 .
The number of people dealt with each year by the police for possessing cannabis has doubled since the drug was downgraded .
Claims that " superskunk " , which is up to 10 times stronger than imported resin , was dominant were also undermined by police and customs seizure figures .
The latest statistics published yesterday showed that 69 tonnes of cannabis were seized in 2005 of which 49 tonnes were the traditional resin .
Although herbal cannabis seizures , of which " superskunk " is one variety , were up by 76 % - reflecting the growth of a homegrown cannabis industry - they still only amounted to 20 tonnes , less than one - third of the market .
The GOP — Grand Obstructionist Party
Looking over today ’s posts thus far , a trend emerges — Republican blocked a habeas corpus bill from coming to a vote .
They also blocked a bill to give DC residents a voice in Congress from coming to a vote .
Jim Webb ’s amendment to give troops equal time off for the time they spend in combat will be blocked from coming to a vote .
The Senate Democratic leadership is working on a funding bill for Iraq that includes a withdrawal timeline , which Republicans will block from coming to a vote .
And that ’s just from news items today .
Kevin Drum highlights the problem we ’ve been watching all year .
Republicans are n’t just obstructing legislation at normal rates .
They ’re obstructing legislation at three times the usual rate .
They ’re absolutely desperate to keep this stuff off the president ’s desk , where the only choice is to either sign it or else take the blame for a high - profile veto .
As things stand , though , Republicans will largely avoid blame for their tactics .
After all , the first story linked above says only that the DC bill “ came up short in the Senate ” and the second one that the habeas bill “ fell short in the Senate . ”
You have to read with a gimlet eye to figure out how the vote actually broke down , and casual readers will come away thinking that the bills failed because of some kind of generic Washington gridlock , not GOP obstructionism . [ … ]
Would it really be so hard for reporters to make it clear exactly who ’s responsible for blocking these bills ?
This is n’t a new problem , but it is an unprecedented ( and undemocratic ) one .
Indeed , senators have been taking advantage of filibusters for generations , but we ’ve never had a Senate minority that is as reckless and obstructionist as Senate Republicans in 2007 .
For years , Republicans , with a 55 - seat majority , cried like young children if Dems even considered a procedural hurdle .
They said voters would punish obstructionists .
They said it was borderline unconstitutional .
They said to stand in the way of majority rule was to undermine a basic principle of our democratic system .
And would n’t you know it , the shameless hypocrites did n’t mean a word of it .
The Republican minority has created a de facto 60 - vote minimum to do anything of substance in the Senate .
They ’ll allow routine up - or - down votes on renaming post offices , or those rare bills that enjoy near - unanimous support , but otherwise , it ’s filibuster time on the Senate floor .
And while the number of filibusters has been going up pretty consistently for 20 years , these Republicans appear to be in a league of their own .
Their excuses are pretty pathetic .
“ You ca n’t say that all we ’re going to do around here in the United States Senate is have us govern by 51 votes — otherwise we might as well be unicameral , because then we would have the Senate and the House exactly the same , ” said Sen .
John McCain , R - Ariz .
To which Reid responds : “ The problem we have is that we do n’t have many moderate Republicans .
I do n’t know what we can do to create less cloture votes other than not file them , just walk away and say , ‘ We ’re not going to do anything . ’
That ’s the only alternative we have . ”
McCain ’s rationale is pretty absurd .
He ’s effectively arguing :
Water down bills or we ’ll bring the chamber to a halt .
This from a man who used to say “ elections have consequences . ”
If Republicans do n’t like a bill , they can vote against it .
If it passes anyway , they can urge the president to veto it .
But holding the chamber hostage just further demonstrates why the modern GOP is unwilling to govern responsibly .
Besides , this is n’t about the GOP waiting for bipartisan bills ; it ’s about obstructionism .
Sen. Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) said a Republican colleague of his told him that a strategy has been adopted by the minority to “ prevent any accomplishment ” by the new Congress :
“ I had a Republican colleague tell me it is the Republican strategy to try to prevent any accomplishment of the Democratic Congress .
That is set in their caucus openly and directly that they do n’t intend to allow Democrats to have any legislative successes , and they intend to do it by repeated filibuster . ”
The only resolution is public outrage , which might encourage the GOP to allow the Senate to start voting on bills again , and which might happen if reporters would do their jobs .
In April , Sen. Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) said , “ The strategy of being obstructionist can work or fail … and so far it ’s working for us . ”
And it ’s failing for the rest of the country .
Cyril Mazibuko grew up in the shadows of the mountains .
Born in a small kraal at the foot of the Drakensberg range in the southern part of the KwaZulu - Natal province in South Africa , Cyril would often look up at the 3,000 - meter basalt peaks , a playground for African paragliders .
Enthralled , Cyril made a decision :
He would build his own glider and join them in the sky .
Now 26 , Cyril is the only black South African currently registered with the sport 's ruling body .
And it all started with a glider he made from plastic bags , purloined rope and baling wire , a glider that flew – sort of – though it both amazed and horrified the professional paragliders who saw it .
Like many " extreme " sports , paragliding is relatively new .
In the early 1950s British sportsman Walter Neumark was one of the first to advocate the possibilities of ultra - light gliders that could be launched by foot power alone .
A decade later the sport received a big boost when American Domina Jalbert invented what came to be the template for the modern glider .
His vision for a wing consisted of cells that were soft and supple on the ground , but became rigid when inflated by the wind .
Dalbert 's invention would eventually allow pilots to go farther than ever before , and it provided them with significantly more control in the air .
Today the average glider is a marvel of engineering .
It has more than 300 meters of steering lines , as well as between 25 to 35 square meters of ultra- light , ultra - strong porous fabrics .
And despite the gentle image of a pilot floating softly to earth , wings can move – fast .
A low - end glider can hit 50 kilometers per hour , high - end gliders top out at 65 km/h .
Paragliding is also a sport for the well - heeled .
A brand - new glider and harness can easily cost upwards of $ 4,500 .
In short , these are n't the sort of machines amateurs are supposed to build , especially not 12 - year - old boys with little formal schooling .
Cyril started small , using plastic bread bags for the wing , with lines made from orange - bag strings .
He would add weights to these early prototypes and let them go .
" Throw it into the air and it would fly , " he says proudly .
But for his glider to carry a person , Cyril needed better materials , so he improvised .
At night he and his friends would raid a local farm and make off with fertilizer bags , rope and baling wire .
He chuckles at the memory : " He ( the farmer ) never knew what was happening . "
Cyril stitched together the fertilizer bags to make his wing , using the wire for a needle and the rope as thread .
He also built himself a harness , and even added basic safety features .
" We used to see paragliders all the time , ( and I realized ) , ' Oh , there is an airbag to stop somebody from hurting his back if he crashed , ' " he remembers , " so we used to put wine bags , inflated ones , in ( our ) harness . "
And after more than a dozen attempts Cyril had a working glider .
It could carry 45 kilograms , and it flew , albeit backward and uphill .
In a strong breeze the glider could be inflated and would take its " pilot " to the top of a small hill , while he faced downhill .
With soft wind the glider served as a sort of parachute allowing the boys to jump off the top and float down gently to terra firma .
Cyril 's efforts soon drew the attention of more experienced pilots .
" It was so well imaged on what we were flying , " Jonathan " JJ " Bass says as he sips a coffee .
The 40 - year old has the easy grace of an athlete .
Bass now runs his own IT consulting company , but for several years he was a full - time paragliding instructor .
It was his students Cyril watched fly from the teeth of the uKhahlamba .
Bass remembers Cyril showing off his creations at the bottom of the hill .
" The way that it was put together was very impressive , " he says .
" There were the right number of lines , they were even in the right place . …
( The glider ) was very cleverly done . "
Cyril 's work so impressed Bass he decided to get involved .
Within a few weeks he was teaching Cyril the finer points of piloting .
And a few months later Bass scrounged up a real glider for his new friend .
Cyril took quickly to his piloting lessons .
" He was a natural talent , " Bass says .
" His passion is flying .
I mean the guy 's got it . "
By age 14 , Cyril had earned his paragliding pilot 's license .
Being a Zulu in a sport dominated by whites at the tail end of apartheid brought Cyril attention – not all of it good .
" I started flying during bad times , " Cyril recalls .
Not everyone was pleased to see a black taking to the air – especially not one who got significant help from whites .
Undaunted , Cyril earned his sporting license at age 16 and began entering distance competitions , and became known for his solid showings .
He also gained a reputation for partying .
" I was a young man , I must admit , " he says .
James Braid , who flew with Cyril , says , " He quickly became a respected pilot in the community .
But he basically became in love with girls and moved all round the country chasing them . "
More problematic , though , were the people who saw Cyril as an economic opportunity .
Abortive product - endorsement deals and a failed movie contract followed .
Eventually , depressed by his belief that he was being used at every turn , Cyril quit gliding and wandered through a series of jobs around the country .
Paragliding had enriched others , but Cyril felt it had left him with less than he started with , and he decided his time as a pilot had been a curse .
" But , " he says , " I never forgot about flying . "
His return to the air came through a chance meeting .
In late 2006 pilot and paragliding instructor Jo Chananie ran into one of Cyril 's friends and coworkers at a Durban hostel .
Jo took Cyril 's number and started pestering him to get back into the air .
Eventually he capitulated , went flying with Jo , and began to contact his old friends .
Now , several months later , Cyril is working for Laura Nelson , one of the grand dames of South African paragliding .
Cyril helps train Laura 's students .
In return Laura is easing him back into competitive flying .
Swing Paragliders has sponsored him with a glider , harness and helmet , and members of the gliding community have donated other needed items .
Cyril is on target to compete in the Eastern Cape Open this October .
After that , who knows ?
Standing on top of a hill , getting ready to launch after having helped the students into the air , Cyril says his desire to fly is still as strong as it was more than 20 years ago when he first saw a paraglider .
" I was always flying in the back of my mind , " he says , adjusting his helmet .
" I stopped flying , but I never gave it up . "

Throughout history the bow has been used for hobbies , course competitions , Olympics , hunting , fishing , big game , small game and for birds of flight .
They have also been used as offensive and defensive weapons of war and one time to win freedom .
No other weapon had the versatility and world wide impact as the bow .
Today there are three types of Bows made : the Recurve Bow , the Long Bow , and Compound Bow .
These bows are typically made in shops and in factories .
There is also a special type of bow called
the Self - Bow ( or Stick Bow ) .
A Self - bow ( See Fig. 1 ) is a bow made fr-om a single piece of wood shaped by an experienced craftsman , named a Bowyer .
At times , extra material like horn nocks on the ends or a built up handle are accepted as part of a self - bow .
The Recurve Bow
The Recurve Bow fits the image most common today of what a bow should look like .
There are many variations to the Recurve bow but they all have the same style .
The recurve curves away fr-om the holder .
If you notice the Long Bow , it only curves one way ; whereas the Recurve curves like a long bow but then curves back , thus the recurve .
Many people seeing a Recurve Bow strings it backwards and when they try to use it , it breaks .
The Recurve Bow
The Longbow
Here ’s a great video clip showing how a professional bowyer constructs a longbow ( fr - om the show How It ’s Made ) :
The longbow is the most basic bow .
It is shaped fr-om
one piece of wood and the grip is normally made using a strip of leather wound around the bow .
A small shelf is cut into the side of the bow for the arrow to rest on .
There is no bow sight .
Shooting is accomplished by aiming with the tip of the arrow at full draw pointing at the target .
Shown below is another example of a longbow .
The Long Bow
The Compound Bow
Compound bows are produced exclusively in factories .
A compound bow is a modern bow that uses a system of cables , cams and pulleys to draw the limbs back .
The limbs of a compound bow are much more rigid than the limbs of a recurve or longbow .
This enables the bow to store more energy and to release it quicker and faster than a normal bow .
Compound bows vary in length , with end to end ( nocks ) measurements of 33 to 48 inches .
The shorter length is for young shooters , and the longest is for adult use .
The compound bow uses eccentric wheels at the end of both limbs to create its power .
The bow string itself is connected to the ends of the steel cables , which are attached to the top and bottom wheels .
The draw weight is adjustable within a 15 pound range by adjusting the bolts on each limb .
The Compound Bow
The Cross Bow is illustrated for example only and in many states is considered a weapon similar to a pistol or rifle .
The Cross Bow
A Bowyer is a person who makes bows for archery competition or sport .
The term bowyer typically implies a skilled craftsman .
Laminated bows , or composite bows , the forms are commonly used for include Recurve Bows and Compound Bows .
The most important part of making a bow is ensuring the materials used are not strained past the breaking point .
Due to the large amount of energy stored in a pulled bow , failures often occur especially when using inferior materials or unskilled bowers .
Quite often when a bow fails , because there is a lot of stored - up energy , when it fails , it sounds like an explosion because of the loud cracking and some flying debris , including parts of the bow itself .
The choice of making a Long Bow , Recurve Bow or
a Compound Bow is up to you .
Try all three types of bows if you have the chance before you start building one .
Using a Recurve Bow is more the accepted traditional method .
It has fewer moving parts to adjust and it is easier to tune and maintain .
Its main disadvantage is the pull force .
The full force of
the bow is held at full draw only by your fingers so some strength training is needed to control draw force .
Using a Compound Bow is a bit more modern .
Its advantage is the let off at full pull .
The less effort allows the hold at full pull at the use of a mechanical trigger .
It also has more moving parts and a bear to setup and tune .
The two key factors that affect the choice are the size and strength of the bow and are measured by Draw Length and Draw Weight .
Draw length should be measured fr-om the nock to the lead edge of the riser at full pull .
Draw weight for a Recurve Bow is usually marked on the bottom limb , at a standard draw of 28 Inches .
Recurve Bows range form 48 inches to 70 inches long .
Most target bows will average about 66 inches in length .
The rough guide to select the length of a bow to fit you ; someone with a draw length of less than 28 inches should use a bow between 62 & 66 inches .
A person with a draw of more than 28 inches should use a bow between 66 & 70 Inches .
The draw weight of the bow is written on the lower back limb .
The weight is noted in pounds at full draw of 28 inches and looks like this : # 20@28 .
Twenty pounds of pull at 28 inch pull .
Which means at a full pull of 28 inches the force required to hold the bowstring at this length will be 20 pounds .
All bows made today use the same basic principles for construction .
For this exercise we will be building a Long Bow
How to make a long bow
Method
In order to make your longbow , you will need to start with a stave of wood ( dimensions 1.5 ″ x 1.5 ″ x the height of the intended user .
The traditional wood for making a bow is yew , for my bows I used ash and it was the easiest wood for me to find .
The stave itself can be bought fr-om a supplier , if however you plan to cut it yourself the easiest way is to split a log into quarters , you need to make sure you have a mix of both sap wood and core wood .
If available yew wood is the best wood for long bows .
Once you have the stave ( the part that will become the back ) of the bow was the part that had the bark on it .
CAUTION the bark will need to be removed without cutting the wood underneath .
Once this has been decided , you need to mark the stave see figure below and trim off the grey , shaded area using an axe , knife or saw :
In this diagram , the back of the bow is the bottom line of the stave .
The length of the ends of the bow is ½ ” and the height at the mid point is whatever feels comfortable in your hand .
However the thicker you make the bow the higher the poundage , I would also recommend that you make it slightly thicker than you think you ’ll need it , you can always cut it down .
On the back of the bow , find the mid point of the center line and mark it then draw a straight line fr-om there to each end of the bow .
Fr-om the end of these lines , mark 3/16 ″ either side of the back of the stave , and link them with the ends of the middle line .
Trim off shaded area .
On this diagram , you are making the points on the back of the bow .
The marker line at the left end of the diagram is 3/16 ″ and the one on the right is 3/8 ″ .
I would recommend using charcoal to do just remember to remove it later .
Now that you have a basic bow shape , you need to trim off the corners of the stave to give a more rounded shape .
This is best done with a spoke - shave or a plane .
In cross section , this is roughly the shape that you ’re after , ( remove the shaded areas ) .
While trimming the bow to match the diagram above , you should ensure that no bulges or dips occur along the length of the bow .
To accomplish this , continually look down the length of the bow , working forward as you do .
If bulges do occur , smooth them off by light sanding , if dips occur you will need to trim the entire bow to remove them .
It is vital that you try to keep the shape of the bow uniform on both sides at all times ; otherwise the bow will not pull correctly .
Once you have reached a stage that you are satisfied with , test the flex of the bow by placing one end on the instep of your foot , your opposite hand on the other end , and pulling the middle towards you with your other hand .
Ensure that the back of the bow is facing away fr-om you .
As you do this , you will notice some stiff areas of the bow ( sometimes it ’s easier to get someone else to do this because they can get a better view ) .
Do not try to flex the bow to far as this point , this is not the direction the bow will be bent when strung , this is just to see how much give there is in the wood .
Trim down these stiff areas so that the bow flexes evenly up and down its length .
Once you are satisfied that your bow is even and flexes nicely , make some nocks on either end to hold the string .
These should be around 2 ″ fr-om the ends of your bow and are best made using a round needle file .
Starting with the side of the bow , make a small mark at 45 degrees , so that the top of the mark is towards the end of the bow see diagram .
Repeat this on the other side of the same end of the bow , and then join them .
( See below ) Repeat this at the other end of the bow .
You could also put horn nocks on the ends , you can purchase these or you can make by hand .
Now that you have created the bow and put nocks on it , you need to teach the wood to bend .
This is very important , because if you do n’t teach the wood to bend the first time you draw the bow it will snap ( LOUDLY ) .
To teach the wood to bend , you will need to put a string on your bow that is NOT under tension .
( See below ) and use a tiller see instructions below to make one .
The way a tiller works , is the bow is placed into the space at the top so that it is horizontal with the back , of the uppermost part of the bow .
Then pull the bow string slowly down to the first notch .
While the string is in this position , examine the bow checking that it is not pulling to one side and that the overall curve is smooth with no straight areas .
Mark these stiff areas with a bit of charcoal , gently release the string to its natural position remove the bow fr-om the tiller unstring it and trim the areas marked with charcoal .
Restring the bow put it back onto the tiller and take it to the first notch again .
Repeat this as many times a necessary until no stiff areas remain on the bow and the bow curves smoothly .
Once you are satisfied take the string to the next notch and perform the same checks / actions .
It is a good idea to let the wood rest for about 15 - 20 minutes between visits to the tiller so that the sinews within the wood do not start to break .
Once you have reached the fourth notch on the tiller , you can add a little bit of tension to the string .
Repeat the slow progression through the notches of the tiller , checking for and trimming any stiff areas until you once again reach the fourth notch .
It is very important that these stages are not rushed , or the wood will strain too quickly , the sinews will start to snap and your bow will not reach its full potential or will simply break in half .
Again add a little more tension to the string repeat the checking until you reach the fourth notch .
At this point you can put the string under full tension ( see below ) and work down the tiller .
Once you have reached the draw you required for your bow you can put a couple coats of boiled linseed oil on it to protect it fr-om the weather .
Tensioning the Bow
To have a string that is not under tension , simply extend the string so that it is firmly attached in the nocks at both ends of the bow , but the wood itself does not bend .
Tension can be increased by slightly shortening the string , so that the bow bends a little when strung .
It is best to shorten the string an inch at a time to increase the tension slowly .
When the bow is at full tension , the distance between the middle of the bow ( i.e. where you hold it ) and the bowstring , should be the same as your clenched fist with the thumb stuck out .
Bow Strings
When buying bow strings , it is important to remember that three main types are available .
These are no loops , one loop and two loops .
Personally I have found that one loop strings are best because it is possible for the archer to set the length of the string to be perfect length for their own use .
To tie the second loop ( for the bottom of the bow ) you will need to use a bowers knot ( see below ) .
But I prefer to make my own strings .
Testing the Poundage
To test the poundage of a bow , attach a fishing scale to the string while the bow is on the tiller and slowly add weights to it until the string reaches the draw that you require .
This will give you the X pounds draw at Y inches required when checking your bow for competition or combat .
If the finished bow is a higher poundage than your require ( i.e. you want to use it in combat and it ’s too strong ) , then evenly trim the bow and go back through the routine of checking it on the tiller .
On the tiller you will need to draw the bow an inch further than your draw length , this is to ensure that when you fully draw the bow it will not snap .
Making a Tiller
A tiller is the piece of equipment used to train the bow to bend without breaking .
It is a vertical piece of wood with a number of notches cut into it at fixed intervals with a semi circle cut out at the top which the bow can rest in .
The whole thing is supported on a suitable base .
Bellow is a guide to making a permanent tiller , however you can make them simply fr-om a piece of scrap wood , and this would be cut in accordance to the instructions below and then held in a vice .
To make a tiller you will need a hardwood plank ( 1.5 ″ x 2 ″ x 8 ′ ) and either screws or dowels to join the pieces together .
The first notch should be 7.5 ″ fr-om the top of the tiller .
There should be a distance of 1.5 ″ between the top of one notch and the top of the next notch and enough notches to draw it to your draw length .
Join all the pieces together as per the diagram above , except for the 1.5 ″ x 1.5 ″ block which is tied onto the base piece to prevent the arm fr-om falling over .
If this piece is attached , then the tiller will not fold flat .
Safety Tips for Long Bow handling
Always remember that a loaded bow is a deadly weapon
Never show your skill by using a human target or permit someone to hold a target for you
Be sure no one is standing in front of or to the sides of the archer while bow is drawn
Shoot only at the target .
Try first shots at closer distances until comfortable
Never use arrows that are too short
Replace bowstring when it becomes worn or frayed
Always sting your bow properly
Always use finger and arm protectors
Never use a target that cannot stop an arrow
Congratulations , you have made your first bow , go out and enjoy it .

Manual for building a 40 lb pull long bow
You know what we need in the White House ?
A bitch .
We need a bitch facing down terrorists , Iran and Congress .
A bitch to order around the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Come to think of it , there ’s a bitch right now trying to save Pakistan .
Golda Meir , Queen Elizabeth , Margaret Thatcher – all great leaders .
All bitches .
It ’s unlikely , of course , that the voter who asked John McCain “ how we going to beat the bitch ? ” this week in South Carolina considered this .
She meant it as an insult , and McCain , stupidly or ignorantly , called it a good question .
When asked about it , Sen .
Trent Lott , classy guy that he is , said , “ the witch ? ”
My advice for Hillary Clinton ?
Take it as a compliment .
I ’m a bitch and proud – a Babe In Total Control of Herself .
The reality is that every woman who has ambition , business acumen and an independent way of thinking – the very qualities we admire in men – has been called a bitch .
It ’s sad the word needs to be used at all , considering how insulting it is .
A female dog .
When you actually think about what the term means , what it implies , it ’s amazing how much it ’s slipped into regular conversation .
Rappers toss it off in lyrics ;
Britney introduces herself on her new album with the term ; they do n’t even bother bleeping it out on television .
Despite what Isiah Thomas said in his sex harassment deposition , no one – black or white – should be able to say it .
That a woman would be the one to ask the question of McCain shows how robbed of import “ bitch ” has become , otherwise she would have realized how the term could boomerang .
If the voter can call Clinton a bitch , it ’s license for others to do the same to her .
If we ca n’t stamp it out , then we must embrace it .
Ten years ago , Meredith Brooks had a hit singing “ I ’m a bitch , ” and since then , smart women have known that a man who calls them a bitch is only demonstrating his own inadequacies .
Case in point : Hillary herself , who wisely said nothing during the McCain debacle .
In proper form , she subscribed to the Hollywood axiom , “ No audience , no show . ”
She ’s nobody ’s poodle .
But if I may , let me offer some more advice to Clinton – a little etiquette for bitches , if you will :
n Remember that each time you are called a bitch on the campaign trail , you are helping women across America .
As long as they are calling you a bitch , it means that some other poor woman is getting a break from being called one .
n Lead with compassion for your male counterparts .
Many still suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder and night sweats , even though it ’s been decades since the feminist movement .
n Never let them get under your skin .
And if they do , never give them the satisfaction of knowing it .
n Wear skirts often .
It ’ll flummox them even more .
And one final word from the trenches .
Being a woman who is running for office is sometimes threatening to those who are n’t used to seeing women be productive outside the kitchen and the laundry room .
The good news is , they ’ll adjust .
Ain’t that a bitch ?

WASHINGTON , Oct. 27 - George W. Bush has been in the White House for 248 weeks , through a terrorist attack , two wars and a bruising re-election .
But it seems safe to say that he has never had a worse political week than this one -- and it is not over yet .
" I think all bets are off , " said former Senator Warren B. Rudman , Republican of New Hampshire .
" Who knows what 's next ? "
The biggest question for Mr. Bush now is what he can make of the 39 months remaining in his presidency .
For this horrible week has been months -- even years -- in the making .
The 2,000th American fatality in Iraq was just the latest daunting milestone in a war that will soon be three years old .
The C.I.A. leak investigation that threatens to indict a top White House aide or two on Friday grew out of the fierce debates over the flawed intelligence that led to that war .
And Harriet E. Miers 's withdrawal of her nomination to the Supreme Court is the bitter fruit of Mr. Bush 's own frailty in the wake of all those storms -- and Hurricane Katrina -- and of his miscalculations about how her appointment would be received .
After noting the oddities of Roger L. Simon ’s latest piece on why the “ War against Islamofascism ” leads him to support gay marriage , Glenn Greenwald raises an important point that I think often goes overlooked .
Every now and then , it is worth noting that substantial portions of the right - wing political movement in the United States — the Pajamas Media / right - wing - blogosphere / Fox News / Michelle Malkin / Rush - Limbaugh - listener strain — actually believe that Islamists are going to take over the U.S. and impose sharia law on all of us .
And then we will have to be Muslims and “ our women ” will be forced into burkas and there will be no more music or gay bars or churches or blogs .
This is an actual fear that they have — not a theoretical fear but one that is pressing , urgent , at the forefront of their worldview .
And their key political beliefs — from Iraq to Iran to executive power and surveillance theories at home — are animated by the belief that all of this is going to happen .
The Republican presidential primary is , for much of the “ base , ” a search for who will be the toughest and strongest in protecting us from the Islamic invasion — a term that is not figurative or symbolic , but literal : the formidable effort by Islamic radicals to invade the U.S. and take over our institutions and dismantle our government and force us to submit to Islamic rule or else be killed .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 18 — A top House Democrat began an inquiry on Tuesday into accusations that the State Department 's inspector general repeatedly interfered with investigations into fraud and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan , including security defects at the new United States Embassy in Baghdad .
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California , the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , sent the inspector general , Howard J. Krongard , a 14 - page letter spelling out accusations made by several current and former employees of Mr. Krongard 's office who documented their charges with e-mail messages .
Some of the accusers have sought whistle - blower status , which protects government employees from being punished for reporting possible malfeasance , Mr. Waxman said .
" One consistent element in these allegations is that you believe your foremost mission is to support the Bush administration , especially with respect to Iraq and Afghanistan , rather than act as an independent and objective check on waste , fraud and abuse on behalf of U.S. taxpayers , " Mr. Waxman wrote .
He invited Mr. Krongard to respond to the accusations at a committee hearing on Oct. 16 .

I was onsite with a client teaching a training class .
We were having problems reaching some of the computers on the clients network .
Additionally we kept having duplicate IP address being assigned to workstations causing network errors .
Clients pay a fixed fee for 3 days of my time for these classes .
If we do n't finish due to client issues , its not generally my problem .
Looking at the clients network , I found they had purchased to DSL lines into their site , to provide outside Internet access , and were using two DSL modems .
These modems each was conected to its own firewall / router .
Each firewall router was using its own subnet .
All the workstations were statically assigned IP addresses on one of the two subnets .
We were unable to get the test machines to communicate with each other , because they were on separate subnets .
I explained that the two machines had to use the router to reach the other subnet .
The clients director of IT , loudly explained that he did n't have any routers on his network .
I tried gently to explain that his firewalls , were in fact acting as routers gateway - ing traffic between the two subnets .
He accused me of lying and said the software did n't work , I said it did work on a single subnet , when we did n't have IP conflicts .
I suggested that he use DHCP , he claimed DHCP did n't work on his network , ( not surprisingly since he had two different subnets on the same flat ethernet segment , and no " routers " ) .
I suggested that he purchase a router that could handle two connections for fail over , so he could utilize a single subnet , and was accused of trying to sell him something he did n't need , because everything worked " just fine " .
( Except for the IP conflicts and some machines not being able to connect to printers or shares on other systems because of the router / firewalls ) .
With any luck for that company , he has retired and no longer violating every sane practice for small networks .
The most entertaining paper that managed to creep into hep -th today is called
: the preprint was re-classified from the professional hep -th archive to gen-ph , general physics , an archive mostly dedicated to laymen 's fantasies .
Thanks God. Comment for general readers : this preprint is of course not peer - reviewed and probably wo n't get published anywhere .
Update II : Roger Highfield whom we know from his article attacking the scientific method and claiming that Einstein may have started the rot has returned .
In a new , equally breathtakingly silly article , he suggests that A. Garrett Lisi is a new Einstein .
Two months ago , I wrote about bad physicists and populism .
You may see that virtually all of the myths I described are realized in this story .
Mr Highfield has written at least one more stupidity of the same magnitude - namely that the cosmologists are bringing the Universe closer to the doom by observing it .
Sensations are much more important for him than rational thinking or the truth .
Update III : Thousands of blogs and news outlets have copied the utter nonsense from Mr. Highfield and at least tens of thousands of people are Google searching for this " new Einstein " .
It 's called mass hysteria .
Is n't it cool if a poor surfer dude ( see a snowboarding video ) finds a theory of everything ?
It is surely cool but " cool " is not the same thing as " true " . ;-)
ArsTechnica , a server dedicated to PC professionals , seems to be one of a limited number of remaining sane sources .
Update IV : Lisi 's paper has four citations .
The most famous authors referring to him are Ferrara and Bianchi who call Lisi 's construction a " ( hopeless ) attempt to unify " on page 16 of their paper .
Update V : Jacques Distler and Skip Garibaldi wrote a paper for mathematicians , explaining that there can't be any " theory of everything " that embeds gravity and other forces into any form of E8 .
My connection of everything = connection for gravity + weak force + strong force + electromagnetism + electron + neutrino + up - quark + down - quark + other - generations
If you want a lecture of a well - known physicist about the Coleman - Mandula theorem , look at MOVIE 13 by Edward Witten at the Sidneyfest .
Its author , A. Garrett Lisi , claims to have found nothing less than a theory of everything .
An exceptionally simple one , for that matter .
It may sound as a bold statement but from a genius of A. Garrett Lisi 's caliber , it should n't be surprising .
:-) This extraordinary surfer dude managed to collect five citations in the last thirteen years which is only 4 orders of magnitude below leading physicists .
Because the work is based on the E8 group that I love , you bet that I have opened the paper .
Needless to say , the visually intriguing and colorful paper is a huge joke .
The first place where I exploded in laughter was the equation ( 1.1 ) .
It says , using words , the following : That 's pretty cute ! :-)
The author is not constrained by any old " conventions " and simply adds Grassmann fields together with ordinary numbers i.e. bosons with fermions , one - forms with spinors and scalars , neglecting any traces of dimensional analysis , too .
He is just so skillful that he can add up not only apples and oranges but also fields of all kinds you could ever think of .
Every high school senior excited about physics should be able to see that the paper is just a long sequence of childish misunderstandings .
I understood these things when I was 14 .
Confirming my essay about crackpots ' common errors , Garrett Lisi is unable to falsify a wrong hypothesis even in the simplest cases .
Concerning the title , I present it as a joke but I agree with Freedom of Science that if the title is viewed seriously by some important readers and if the author allows it , it is a case of scientific fraud .
There is not a glimpse of physics in that paper .
You wo n't find anything like a " Lagrangian " , " amplitudes " , " masses " , " cross section " , " quantum corrections " , " anomalies " , " energy " , " force " , " Hamiltonian " , " entropy " , " phase transition " , " path integral " , " renormalization " , " temperature " , or other words that you expect in a particle physics paper .
When he talks about actions , they 're always wrong actions from some previous obscure papers that have clearly nothing to do with observable physics either .
Of course , the author also seems to have no clue about quantum aspects of gravity - a unification of gravity with quantum mechanics is not even attempted because the author clearly does n't know what it means .
On the other hand , you find a lot of random assignments of particles to vertices of polytopes - something that you know from papers about the octopi
It is the same kind of " unification " as if you put stickers with elementary particles on a chessboard and argue that chess is the ultimate theory of everything .
Some stickers do n't fit so you call them your predictions .
Kindergarten stuff , indeed .
Or let me give you a better analogy .
A. Garrett Lisi and his 222 close personal friends .
He needs 18 more to reproduce the roots of E8 and make his theory complete .
Click the picture for more details .
The role of the E8 group in his picture is therefore completely unphysical .
Because different components of the E8 multiplet are assumed to be particles with completely different properties , the E8 symmetry is broken at stage zero .
There is no E8 symmetry - and there can't be any E8 symmetry - that would actually relate these different particles .
Of course , the comments that this theory may be tested by future experiments are nothing else than journalists ' confusions or a politically correct lie ( because it is always OK to say an untrue thing about an " anti-establishment " outsider who is moreover a broke ) .
The theory can't reproduce even basic aspects of the observations that have been made decades or centuries ago which is why any talk about even more ambitious tests is rationally unjustifiable .
The main mathematical content in these 30 + pages is the decomposition of the fundamental representation of E8 under its F4 x G2 subgroup .
It is an elementary fact that e.g. freshmen in Prague who follow my textbook written with Miloš Zahradník know as equation ( 12.95 ) .
For A. Garrett Lisi , this single line reflecting a simple calculation that has been done a century ago and that a fraction of freshmen learns is a topic for a 30 - page paper and an impressive albeit two - dimensional movie Unfortunately , Garrett Lisi , painting himself as an E8 expert , already does n't know that E8 has a SU ( 5 ) x SU ( 5 ) subgroup .
It 's kind of amazing to be ignorant about these elementary facts for a person who is pictured as an expert .
Nude Socialist has already created a 2 - minute commercial for this nonsense .
Do n't be intimidated by the animation .
It is just a collection of points given by 8 coordinates ( being 0 , +- 1/2 , or + - 1 ) projected to a 2 - dimensional plane whose direction - i.e. the relevant coefficients - are changing with time .
The visual effect has nothing to do with physics .
And mathematicians routinely create more sophisticated animations , see e.g. turning sphere inside out Some people might be impressed by some of these formulae about the E8 group - some of which are correct - and / or the pictures .
But I assure you that the E8 group is a pretty standard material that students learn in courses of group theory .
And there are millions of pictures like that .
For example , the picture of the E8 Gossett polytope below is from Wikipedia 's article about E8 ; see also string theorist Clifford Johnson 's blog from March 2007 .
E8 is the biggest exceptional animal in the exciting ADE classification and a large portion of string theorists work with it every day .
This stuff has been known for a century or so .
For example , the E8 group itself was discovered by Wilhelm Killing ( click the picture ) in 1887 .
New insights were added by Élie Joseph Cartan ( click the picture below ) in 1894 .
The basic facts about the E8 group have nothing to do with problems that physics has been solving in the last 50 years : they are just a part of the mathematical background that high - energy physicists are supposed to know .
Garrett Lisi remembered something from math classes he was taking 15 - 20 years ago but he has forgotten virtually all of his physics classes .
Be sure that every physicist who knows basics of his field agrees with me that everything that is nice about the paper has been known for a long time .
For example , Le Monde quotes Thibault Damour and Jean Iliopoulos saying exactly the same thing .
The way how Antony Garrett Lisi combines his spotty knowledge with ambitious claims mimicks the approach of thousands of other " amateur Einsteins " .
He was just luckier because a journalist has endorsed him .
If you care how the forces and particles are supposed to be embedded into his group , it 's like this .
You start with a non-compact real form of E8 , namely E8 ( 24 ) .
You embed a G2 into it .
Its centralizer is a non-compact version of F4 .
Now , you embed the strong SU ( 3 ) into the G2 while the non-compact F4 acts as the source of a " graviweak " SO ( 7,1 ) group that contains SO ( 3,1 ) , a " gauge group " that is now fashionable in the circles of amateur physicists to " describe " gravity , and SO ( 4 ) , their source of cargo cult electroweak symmetry .
Of course , the SO ( 3,1 ) group mentioned a minute ago plays a different role ( in the vielbein formulation of general relativity ) than the Yang - Mills groups and the fact that these two kinds of a group cannot be merged is the content of the Coleman - Mandula theorem to be discussed at the end of my text .
Moreover , the fermions clearly can't arise from the connection because they have a different spin and statistics and they do n't transform in the adjoint representation .
For people like A. Garrett Lisi , it is not hard to unify everything with everything else because they do n't know any difference between different concepts in physics .
Let me repeat the same idea differently .
A unification of different forces and matter in physics is difficult because different force and matter particles have different properties , especially spin and statistics ( and other features that follow from them , e.g. non-renormalizability of gravity ) .
Garrett Lisi attacks the problem of unification by completely ignoring all these features that actually contain the whole problem .
That 's why his work is physically vacuous and meaningless .
The technical statements that the decomposition etc. can give the right spectrum , e.g. the number of generations , is also wrong .
See , for example , Jacques Distler 's post .
Jacques ' group theory looks impressive but his complaints are analogous to telling cargo cult scientists that they should change the shape of their wooden headphones , as Richard Feynman would say .
Additionally , you might think that the E8 starting point is analogous to heterotic GUTs - models such as the heterotic MSSM by Bouchard et al .
Except that it is completely crucial for physics that E8 in heterotic string theory is compact .
Non-compact gauge groups would lead to ghosts and negative probabilities .
Moreover , the whole Standard Model is embedded into the same subgroup of the heterotic E8 once it 's broken , e.g. to SO ( 10 ) .
Also , everyone knows that the fermions arise as chiral multiplets and not vector multiplets : they are simply not and cannot be a part of the gauge bundle .
Most importantly , no sane person has ever claimed that the E8 portion of the heterotic theory already contains gravity .
That would be really silly .
Also , if you have ever heard about " GUT " ( Grand Unified Theory ) , you should realize that unlike E6 and others , E8 cannot be a grand unified group because it only has real representations which is not good enough to create chiral fermions .
In string theory , E8 is only relevant because it is broken to a smaller subgroup by intrinsically stringy effects .
Needless to say , Garrett Lisi has no idea what a " chiral fermion " or even " fermion " means so he is not worried about any of these " details " .
A few years ago , such a paper would almost surely be filtered out from hep -th .
Paul Ginsparg has introduced the endorsement system which was circumvented in this case and is likely to become a complete joke in the future .
Why ?
Well , we have seen that a completely continuous spectrum of people between serious physicists and manifest crackpots has been created and the recent fashionable trend is to accept an ever broader set of passionate amateurs and undereducated , intellectually challenged loons into the physics circles .
This paper by A. Garrett Lisi had to be endorsed by someone .
If you read the acknowledgements , it is not hard to see possible answers .
Some of those people such as Lee Smolin may endorse any crackpot paper because they are both endorsers and crackpots at the same moment .
Moreover , they have a vested interest to increase the proportion of similar papers on the arXiv because this is where they belong .
As Lee Smolin recently pointed out , irrationality has been extremely useful for him in the past .
If Ginsparg wants to prevent this possible collapse of his arXiv , he probably has to fine - tune the mechanisms a little bit and make sure that people who are ready to endorse papers like this one are simply not endorsers .
Otherwise you can be pretty sure that similar papers will eventually overrun the arXiv .
Tony Smith is among the crackpots thanked to in the acknowledgements .
Next time , he may also submit his own paper supported by similar endorsers .
And maybe A. Garrett Lisi will become an endorser himself .
Really entertaining times will start afterwards : the hep -th era of the UFO abductee Jack Sarfatti , Tony Smith , Peter Woit , and their friends .
Recently I was stunned that a person who has been a string theorist could n't understand , despite months or years of working on similar questions and months or years of hearing the right answer , what the Coleman - Mandula theorem actually implies .
There seems to be a whole industry of people who are just not getting it .
So let me say a few words about the theorem .
They asked what symmetries " G " the scattering matrix of a physical theory can have .
They assume that it is a group that contains the Poincaré group as a subgroup .
If the Poincaré group is not a symmetry , the theory is dead .
If the Poincaré symmetry is broken by small effects , a theory may be partially alive or hoping .
But if it is broken by effects of order 100 percent , it is the end of the story .
Garrett Lisi 's statement that the Coleman - Mandula theorem no longer holds because the cosmological constant is nonzero while Coleman and Mandula assumed the Poincaré symmetry instead of SO ( 4,1 ) is utterly naive .
The cosmological constant is a tiny correction to the flat space , comparable to 10 ^{ - 120} in natural units , and the laws associated with the flat space must thus hold with the same accuracy .
Moreover , full - fledged generalizations of the theorem exist for spaces with a nonzero cosmological constant .
Coleman and Mandula have shown that a theory satisfying the necessary conditions above must contain a spinless excitation and they studied the scattering of several copies of such an excitation .
The scattering amplitude is constrained by the Poincaré symmetry and perhaps other symmetries .
If you require that there exist Noether conserved charges arising from symmetries that are neither internal ( scalar charges ) nor the momentum ( a vector from the Poincaré symmetry ) , you can see that it is such a strong constraint that the scattering amplitude is forced to vanish .
You can do it with various quantities and prove that a theory with these new kinds of symmetries must be non-interacting , which also means physically unacceptable and uninteresting .
The only exception - found a few years later , in the early 1970s - are spin 1/2 conserved charges associated with supersymmetry .
They also constrain the S - matrix dramatically but the interactions can nevertheless remain nonzero .
The more general theorem that takes supersymmetry into account and excludes other possible symmetries is called the Haag - Sohnius - Lopuszanski theorem .
The local Lorentz group in general relativity is sometimes used analogously to other gauge groups - when we write down e.g. anomalies in supergravity - super - Yang - Mills coupled system - but it is essential that physics of gravity is technically different from physics of Yang - Mills forces .
Gravitons have spin 2 while gauge bosons have spin 1 .
It is a technical difference that does n't spoil certain philosophical analogies between gravity and other forces .
Nevertheless , it is a huge technical difference that certainly prevents you from combining the graviton and gauge bosons into the same multiplet ( unless you have supersymmetry ) .
It might be a tempting idea to combine fields of a different spin but in field theory , it simply can't work .
That 's why all of the hundreds (? ) of papers that tried to do such a thing have failed and hundreds (? ) of similar papers will fail in the future .
Some people - see e.g. the recent paper by Nesti and Percacci - think that if they present the vielbein as a Higgs boson that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry ( which is of course possible ) , they achieve a unification of gravity with gauge forces .
That 's of course a complete nonsense .
If we use the vielbein approach to general relativity , the local Lorentz symmetry is an additional symmetry that is needed to make the new unphysical degrees of freedom in the vielbein decouple .
Besides this symmetry , there is still the old diffeomorphism symmetry of general relativity that has n't been moved closer to unification , not even by a millimeter .
Diffeomorphisms and Yang - Mills symmetries ( and , correspondingly , graviton and gauge bosons ) can only be unified if the fundamental " coordinates " in the theory carry a nonzero spin .
In string theory , it is true that the string field or the first - quantized wave function combines fields of different spins .
But the spin is only generated because the fundamental object , namely the string , is extended : extended objects such as strings simply can spin around their " axes " .
The expansion in the stringy oscillators - the Fourier modes of the coordinates and fermions over the string - generates internal angular momentum .
Alternatively , Kaluza - Klein scenarios also unify these things because the higher - dimensional metric tensor is decomposed into fields of different spins in four dimensions , including a gauge field .
See also
Why string theory contains gravity .
Additionally , gravity may be deduced from spin - two gauge invariance but not spin - one gauge invariance .
If you analyze local , four - dimensional field theories which are equivalent to point - like particles , they can't spin .
The only way how to add spin to components of a field is to have spacetime coordinates that carry spin themselves .
Again , spacetime and superspaces of various kinds ( and the space of internal string excitations may be included in this category ) are the only known spaces of this kind .
Under various assumptions , we can prove that other solutions can't exist .
Of course that one has to work a little bit to see that one can't create too many new things analogous to the superspace that would be compatible with observations - or at least with basic consistency and qualitative features of physical theories - but different from the well - known superspaces in an essential way .
But Jesus Christ , once you have a pretty well - defined candidate , it is a straightforward homework exercise to show that it can't work .
Stephon Alexander and Fabrizio Nesti , just sit down and try to derive the free particles and their leading interactions from whatever bizarre theories with mixed internally external symmeties and with frame - Higgses you consider conceivable .
I guarantee that you will fail and mature physicists know why you will fail .
Or analyze what global symmetries remain unbroken and try to follow the Coleman - Mandula procedure .
What you 're doing is just a completely childish and trivial sequence of mistakes and meaningless mathematical masturbation that puts you into the same category as Tony Smith or Garrett Lisi .
And that 's the memo .

How Trump Voters Feel About His Refusal to Commit to Transferring Power

In a familiar high - school chemistry demonstration , an instructor first uses electricity to split liquid water into its constituent gases , hydrogen and oxygen .
Then , by combining the two gases and igniting them with a spark , the instructor changes the gases back into water with a loud pop .
Scientists at the University of Illinois have discovered a new way to make water , and without the pop .
Not only can they make water from unlikely starting materials , such as alcohols , their work could also lead to better catalysts and less expensive fuel cells .
“ We found that unconventional metal hydrides can be used for a chemical process called oxygen reduction , which is an essential part of the process of making water , ” said Zachariah Heiden , a doctoral student and lead author of a paper accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society , and posted on its Web site .
A water molecule ( formally known as dihydrogen monoxide ) is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom .
But you ca n’t simply take two hydrogen atoms and stick them onto an oxygen atom .
The actual reaction to make water is a bit more complicated : 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O + Energy .
In English , the equation says :
To produce two molecules of water ( H2O ) , two molecules of diatomic hydrogen ( H2 ) must be combined with one molecule of diatomic oxygen ( O2 ) .
Energy will be released in the process .
“ This reaction ( 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O + Energy ) has been known for two centuries , but until now no one has made it work in a homogeneous solution , ” said Thomas Rauchfuss , a U. of I. professor of chemistry and the paper ’s corresponding author .
The well - known reaction also describes what happens inside a hydrogen fuel cell .
In a typical fuel cell , the diatomic hydrogen gas enters one side of the cell , diatomic oxygen gas enters the other side .
The hydrogen molecules lose their electrons and become positively charged through a process called oxidation , while the oxygen molecules gain four electrons and become negatively charged through a process called reduction .
The negatively charged oxygen ions combine with positively charged hydrogen ions to form water and release electrical energy .
The “ difficult side ” of the fuel cell is the oxygen reduction reaction , not the hydrogen oxidation reaction , Rauchfuss said .
“ We found , however , that new catalysts for oxygen reduction could also lead to new chemical means for hydrogen oxidation . ”
Rauchfuss and Heiden recently investigated a relatively new generation of transfer hydrogenation catalysts for use as unconventional metal hydrides for oxygen reduction .
In their JACS paper , the researchers focus exclusively on the oxidative reactivity of iridium - based transfer hydogenation catalysts in a homogenous , non-aqueous solution .
They found the iridium complex effects both the oxidation of alcohols , and the reduction of the oxygen .
“ Most compounds react with either hydrogen or oxygen , but this catalyst reacts with both , ” Heiden said .
“ It reacts with hydrogen to form a hydride , and then reacts with oxygen to make water ; and it does this in a homogeneous , non-aqueous solvent . ”
The new catalysts could lead to eventual development of more efficient hydrogen fuel cells , substantially lowering their cost , Heiden said .

A woman who developed multiple personalities as the result of being abused as a child has sketched her alter egos — all 17 of them .
Karen Overhill took on a range of personalities to escape the trauma , such as Sandy , 18 , a depressed binge eater , and Jensen , an 11 - year - old black boy who drew the sketch .
She had been abused by her father and grandfather during her childhood , starting with physical assaults by her dad when she was just a baby .
The mother - of - two began developing imaginary people aged between two to 34 to bear the brunt of the abuse .
Two - year - old Karen
Boo took over when she was attacked as an infant , while seven - year - old Claire was created after Ms Overhill was sexually abused on her Communion Day .
Scroll down for more ...
Ms Overhill , an American , drew the sketch after seeking help from psychiatrist Dr Richard Baer , following some disturbing episodes where she was unaware of her actions .
After giving birth by caesarian section , Ms Overhill found she did not recognise her family or friends after she awoke following anesthesia .
During a trip to a Las Vegas casino , Ms Overhill 's mind " went somewhere else " and was stunned to find the $ 25 she had arrived with had turned into $ 2,500 .
One night , she awoke to find a knife under her pillow with no recollection over how the instrument had got there .
Ms Overhill said : " It would come like a wave over me .
" When I came back to myself I 'd be exhausted .
I never knew where I 'd been or what I 'd done , so I would have to look for clues , like a bag in the car or leftovers from a restaurant .
It was amazing , but I accepted it . "
Dr Baer discovered she had dissociative identity disorder ( previously termed multiple personality disorder ) in 1993 , after Ms Overhill wrote him a letter that said : " My name is Claire .
I am seven years old .
I live inside Karen . "
Using hypnosis , Dr Baer found the personalities were male and female , black and white , and different ages .
Some were left - handed , others right - handed , and they even walked differently .
Baer explained : " Dissociating ( separating from one 's reality in the present ) is a defense mechanism .
It 's one of many we have psychologically to cope with stress .
It 's an extreme method .
" When you have the kind of abuse Karen suffered , you call on whatever coping mechanism you can . "
Ms Overhill also created a mother figure and a father figure , said Dr Baer , who has written a book , Switching Time : A Doctor 's Harrowing Story of Treating a Woman With 17 Personalities about the case .
The deliberate and systematic destruction of Lebanon 's social infrastructure by the Israeli air force was also a war crime , designed to reduce that country to the status of an Israeli - US protectorate .
The attempt has backfired .
In Lebanon itself , 87 % of the population now support Hizbullah 's resistance , including 80 % of Christian and Druze and 89 % of Sunni Muslims , while 8 % believe the US supports Lebanon .
But these actions will not be tried by any court set up by the " international community " since the US and its allies that commit or are complicit in these appalling crimes will not permit it .
It has now become clear that the assault on Lebanon to wipe out Hizbullah had been prepared long before .
Israel 's crimes had been given a green light by the US and its loyal British ally , despite the opposition to Blair in his own country .
In short , the peace that Lebanon enjoyed has come to an end , and a paralysed country is forced to remember a past it had hoped to forget .
The state terror inflicted on Lebanon is being repeated in the Gaza ghetto , while the " international community " stands by and watches in silence .
Meanwhile , the rest of Palestine is annexed and dismantled with the direct participation of the US and the tacit approval of its allies .
We offer our solidarity and support to the victims of this brutality and to those who mount a resistance against it .
For our part , we will use all the means at our disposal to expose the complicity of our governments in these crimes .
There will be no peace in the Middle East while the occupations of Palestine and Iraq and the temporarily " paused " bombings of Lebanon continue .

As our political leaders argue over the difference between a " cessation of hostilities " and a " ceasefire " , more and more children die .
The British government ( unlike the US ) has agreed to be bound by the UN convention on the rights of the child .
This is a legally enforceable international treaty which enshrines the " right to life " as one of its four core principles .
I would be very interested to know how the government justifies its actions in relation to its responsibilities under the convention and why our new children 's commissioners have remained silent on what appears to be a flagrant disregard of children 's rights , as well as a breach of our international obligations .

Observations , reflections and thinking out loud on the way up the mountain and back down again .
Sometimes people decry the lack of a good make tool in Python .
There are some make tools ( e.g. , SCons or pymake ) , but that 's not actually what people are usually thinking about .
It 's not about building code based on a system of dependencies .
We do pretty well without that anyway .
Because really people are talking about something more like rake -- something where you can put together a bunch of code management tools .
These are n't commands provided by the code , these are commands used on the code .
You can do this in a Makefile too , but none of it really has any relation to what make does -- it 's just a convention for where to put tools .
We do have the infrastructure for this in Python , but no one is really using it .
So I 'm writing this to suggest people use it more : the setup .py file .
So where in another environment someone does rake COMMAND , we can do python setup .py COMMAND .
Setuptools in particular provides an extension mechanism for this .
With it you can add new globally - available commands .
An example of this is buildutils .
This package is , sadly , unmaintained ; in part I 'm writing this blog post to encourage people to steal / remake / repair the kind of functionality buildutils provides , and provide entirely new functionality .
The basic pattern is that you create a distribution that provides the [ distutils .
commands ] entry point .
This points to a subclass of distutils.cmd .
Command ; the class is a little arcane , but not really too hard to handle .
It looks like this :
from distutils.cmd import Command from distutils .errors import * class my_command ( Command ) : description = " < help description > " user_options = [ ( ' long - option= ' , 'l ' , ' < help > ' ) , ( ' other - long - option ' , 'o ' , '< help > ' ) ] boolean_options = ' other - long - option ' def initialize_options ( self ) : self.long_option = < default > self.other_long_option = False def finalize_options ( self ) : if self .
long_option is not valid : raise DistutilsOptionError (... ) def run( self ) : do stuff ...
There 's other details as well .
It 's not a great framework , but it 's a passable one .
All the options you provide can be set in setup.cfg ( in this case under [ my_command ] ) .
This lets the package configure itself for the command .
You can also add new keyword arguments to setup ( ) , but I 'd avoid that technique ( distutils / setuptools will whine but not fail if it gets unexpected keyword arguments -- and they 'll only be " expected " if you have all the right packages installed ) .
When you add a command this way it becomes globally available .
Sometimes you do n't want that -- a command might be applicable only to code using a particular framework , for instance -- so there is another option that comes from distutils ( and is inherited by setuptools ) : -- command - packages .
This points to a package where each module is a separate command .
As a result is good practice to put all your commands in a subpackage dedicated to distutils commands .
In a setup.cfg file this then looks like :
[ global ] command_packages = buildutils .
command , other .module , ...
The commands provided do n't show up in -- help - commands ( unfortunately ) , but they do work .
Ideally I 'd like to see all the commands people write around maintenance tasks use this convention -- document extraction tools , file publishing tools , tools to create boilerplate source files and templates , tools to test and analyze code , etc .
It will make distributing and using these tools easy , and hopefully get everyone on the Good Packaging Bandwagon .
Update : Trying to put my money where my mouth is , I wrote up a little recipe for combining CSS and Javascript files in a project ( with accompanying setup.cfg ) .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
WASHINGTON - In legal papers filed today , the Bush Administration urged the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) to refuse the American Civil Liberties Union 's request that the court make public legal rulings that have been at the center of public and congressional debate over the last eight months .
The ACLU filed a motion on August 8 requesting that the FISC release the rulings with only those redactions essential to protect information that is properly classified .
The brief filed by the government today contends that the FISC does not have jurisdiction to consider the ACLU 's request at all and that the FISC should defer to the government 's determination that the rulings must be kept secret in their entirety .
The following can be attributed to Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU 's National Security Project :
" The government 's contention that the court 's legal rulings must be kept secret and that the court should essentially rubber - stamp the administration 's classification decisions should be deeply offensive to anyone committed to basic democratic principles .
We are in the midst of a critically important debate about the proper scope of the government 's surveillance authority .
This debate should not take place in a vacuum .
The public has a right to know , at least in general terms , what kinds of surveillance the court authorized and what kinds of surveillance it disallowed .
If the legal rulings contain properly classified information , that information can be redacted , but there is no good reason why these legal rulings should be withheld from the public in their entirety .
If administration officials can reference , characterize , and describe the court 's rulings - as they have done repeatedly - the public should be able to examine the rulings firsthand . "
Under a scheduling order issued by the FISC , the ACLU will file a reply to the government 's brief on September 14 .
A copy of the FISA court order , the ACLU 's motion to the FISC , the government 's response , as well as information about the ACLU 's lawsuit against the NSA and other related materials are available online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/spying
A 23 - YEAR - OLD dressed in white pyjama trousers and a black over - shirt represents two worlds in India that know almost nothing of each other .
One is fast growing , but tiny : the world of business .
Strolling through the Californian - style campus in Bangalore that serves as the headquarters of Infosys , a computer - services company , she grins and declares herself glad .
Her brother , she adds shyly , is so proud that she is an “ Infoscion ” .
He is in the rural world where 70 % of Indians reside : cultivating the family plot in Bannahalli Hundi , a village near Mysore .
Life is less delightful there .
Half the 4,000 population are brahmins , of the Hindu priestly caste .
The rest , including the software engineer and her family , are dalits , members of a “ scheduled caste ” that was once considered untouchable .
Sixty years on this is still the case in Bannahalli Hundi , says the young woman , who does not want to be named .
She has never entered the house of a brahmin neighbour .
When a dalit was recently hired to cook at the village school , brahmins withdrew their children .
Has there been no weakening of caste strictures in her lifetime ?
“ I have not seen it , ” she says .
The tale is in startling contrast to Infosys 's modernity , and she is embarrassed by it .
But it partly explains how she came to be hired by a company that is considered to be one of India 's best .
She is the beneficiary of a charitable training scheme for dalit university - leavers that Infosys launched last year .
In collaboration with the elite Bangalore - based International Institute of Information Technology ( IIIT ) , Infosys is providing special training to low - caste engineering graduates who have failed to get a job in its industry .
The training , which lasts seven months , does not promise employment .
But of the 89 who completed the first course in May , all but four have found jobs .
Infosys hired 17 .
The charity was born of a threat .
India 's Congress - led government has told companies to hire more dalits and members of tribal communities .
Together these groups represent around a quarter of India 's population and half of its poor .
Manmohan Singh , the prime minister , has given warning that “ strong measures ” will be taken if companies do not comply .
Many interpret that to mean the government will impose caste - based hiring quotas .
Quotas already apply in education and government , where since 1950 22.5 % of university places and government jobs have been “ reserved ” for dalits and tribal people .
In addition , since 1993 , 27 % of government jobs have been reserved for members of the Other Backward Classes ( OBCs ) — castes only slightly higher up the Hindu hierarchy .
Promoting the wretched
This is not enough for supporters of reservations .
Since the introduction of liberal reforms in the early 1990s , public - sector hiring has slowed and businesses have boomed .
Extending reservations to companies , they argue , would therefore safeguard an existing policy of promoting the Hindu wretched .
It would almost certainly require changes to the constitution .
But low - caste politicians are delighted by the prospect , so it could happen .
The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh , a dalit leader called Mayawati , has said 30 % of company jobs should be reserved for dalits , members of the OBCs and high - caste and Muslim poor .
Chandra Bhan Prasad , a dalit journalist , applauds this and argues that it would be in the interest of companies .
“ It is in the culture of dalits that they are least likely to change their employment because they are so loyal to their masters , ” he says .
It would also help them become a “ new caste [ sic ] of consumers ” .
Businessmen are unconvinced .
Government , in both its intrusiveness and its incompetence , is a hindrance to them .
Caste - based hiring quotas would be just another burden .
People given a right to a job tend not to work very hard .
So , in an effort to avert Mr Singh 's threat , many companies and organisations that represent them are launching their own affirmative - action schemes .
The Confederation of Indian Industry has introduced a package of dalit - friendly measures , including scholarships for bright low - caste students .
The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry plans to support entrepreneurs in India 's poorest districts .
Naukri.com , India 's biggest online recruitment service , with over 10 m subscribers , anticipates that companies will soon actively seek low - caste recruits .
It has therefore started asking job - seekers to register their caste .
Basic training
Infosys 's training scheme , as described by S. Sadagopan , the IIIT 'S director , is a Pygmalion undertaking .
Meeting the parents of his dalit students , he saw “ almost an anger in their eyes ” .
For the first month the students were unresponsive .
Their English was dismal .
Mr Sadagopan felt compelled to introduce lessons in self - presentation , including table manners .
Matters improved .
The course was based on Infosys 's 16 - week basic training , which 31,000 Indian graduates underwent last year .
The low - caste lot scored similar marks and gained confidence .
At a bonding session , filled with meditation and dancing , they wrote themselves a slogan : “ As good as any , better than many ” .
It is a moving story .
But Mr Sadagopan 's students were not all that deprived .
In the words of three , now working for Infosys , they were “ normal middle - class Indians ” .
A third of them were the sons and daughters of professionals .
The worst had grades only a little below what Infosys routinely demands of its recruits .
Almost all were from urban areas , where caste discrimination is rare .
One of them , Manjunath , says the only time he was ever reminded of his low caste was when he applied for a place at university .
Had it not been reserved for him , he says , he might have worked a bit harder — and so joined Infosys without any special help .
As for his colleague from Bannahalli Hundi , coming from one of the richer families in the village , she is its first female university graduate — of any caste .
The most that can be said for Infosys 's programme — without devaluing Mr Sadagopan 's efforts — is that it is a great opportunity for a tiny number of middle - class Indians , who happen also to be low - caste .
The same would be true of caste - based reservations .
This is because the percentage of India 's workforce employed in the “ organised ” private sector ( made up of firms that declare they have ten or more employees ) , where reservations might be applied , is also tiny : around 2 % .
And as far as anyone can tell ( companies do not ask the caste of their employees ) , members of low castes are already well represented in low - skilled jobs there .
Much of India 's heavy industry , such as steelmaking , is located where the low - caste population is high .
Tata Steel , which employs around 40,000 people in India , has its main operations in Jamshedpur , in the eastern “ tribal belt ” .
Membership of a caste , as of a guild or a church , provides businessmen with a useful network .
In the informal economy , where banks fear to tread , caste bonds tend to be affirmed through business .
The fact that most Indian companies are family - owned exaggerates this : to prevent wealth being diluted , it encourages marriages not only within the same caste , but also within the same family .
A sugar baroness of south India 's kamma caste , Rajshree Pathy , recently explained this practice to an Indian newspaper , the Business Standard : “ The PSG family produces girls , the Lakshmi Mills family produces boys , they marry each other and live happily ever after . ”
The modernisation of India 's economy has brought more dynamic change .
Among educated , urban Indians caste identity is fading .
Inter - caste marriages are increasing .
According to Jeevansathi.com , a matchmaking ( or , as Indians say , “ matrimonial ” ) website , 58 % of its online matches involved inter -caste couples .
Meanwhile , in rural India — where unions are not fixed online — intra - caste marriages remain the norm .
Business has to some degree been a laggard in this process .
Caste bonds rooted in expediency , not tradition , allow businessmen to borrow and lend money with a degree of accountability , which helps to minimise risk .
They are not an affirmation of a vocational hierarchy within the Hindu universe .
Nonetheless , in north India , where business is to this day dominated by members of ancient trading castes , like marwaris ( whose famous names include Birla , Bajaj and Mittal ) and bania ( Ambani ) , it can look pretty traditional .
Rites of passage
Harish Damodaran investigated the caste origins of many of India 's industrialists in a forthcoming book * .
He identified three main trends .
The first , which he calls a “ bazaar to factory ” route , is the passage of hereditary traders into industry .
In northern India , some castes ' monopolies have discouraged them from leaving their traditionally prescribed employment .
So members of north India 's farming castes — for example , jats and yadavs — rarely own a sugar or flour mill .
The second trend , “ office to factory ” , describes a recent movement of well - educated high - caste Hindus , including brahmins , into business .
Lacking capital , these sophisticates tended to enter the services sector , where start - up costs are relatively low .
India 's world - class computer - services industry , including companies like Infosys , is the result .
The third trajectory , “ field to factory ” , is the transition into the business world of members of India 's middle and lower - peasant castes .
This must be the path of India 's dalits , too .
But they have not trodden it yet : across India , Mr Damodaran could not find a significant dalit industrialist .
There is no strong evidence that companies discriminate against low - caste job applicants .
Upper-class Indians , who tend also to be high - caste Hindus , can be disparaging about their low - caste compatriots .
“ Once a thicky , always a thicky , ” is how a rich businessman describes Ms Mayawati .
Yet this at least partly reflects the fact that low - caste Hindus tend also to be low class ; and in India , as in many countries , class prejudice is profound .
There is , on the other hand , plenty of evidence that few able low - caste graduates are emerging from India 's universities .
Since it began registering the caste of its subscribers — almost by definition computer - literate and English - speaking — Naukri.com has added 38,000 young dalit and tribal job - seekers to its books .
That represents 1 % of the total who have registered in that time .
For reservationists , this confirms the need for quotas .
Others interpret the facts differently : reservations do n't seem to work .
And statistics support this view .
Reservations notwithstanding , low - caste Indians are getting less poor at almost the same rate as the general population .
Between 1983 and 2004 , their spending power increased by 26.7 % , compared with 27.7 % for the average Indian , according to the National Sample Survey Organisation , a government body .
Low - caste students struggle in schools without special help , which is rarely available .
Their English — the language of India 's middle class — tends to be poor .
Many drop out .
Up to half of university places reserved for low - caste students are left vacant .
So , too , are many of the university posts reserved for low - caste teachers .
Most Indians emerge from this system with an abysmal education .
Low - caste Indians perhaps almost invariably do .
A measure of this fiasco can be found at the political - science department of one of India 's prestigious post - graduate universities .
Each year it chooses 50 students , from 1,500 applications , for its master 's degree .
Successful applicants will average no less than 55 % in their undergraduate exams .
Dalit applicants scrape in with as little as 30 % .
Nonetheless , practically every student will be awarded a first - class degree .
India is failing to equip its young , of whatever caste or religion , with the skills that its companies need .
This is one of the biggest threats to sustaining high economic growth .
India 's outstanding computer - services companies — which will account for around a quarter of overall growth in the next few years — intend to hire over 1 m engineering graduates in the next two years .
It will be tough .
To recruit 31,000 graduates last year , Infosys considered 1.3 m applicants ; only 65,000 passed a basic test .
To address the skills shortage , the company is investing a whopping $ 450 m in training .
“ We are building India 's human resources , ” says Mohandas Pai , Infosys 's chief of human resources .
Alas , reservationists have other concerns .
Caste politics are pervasive .
On August 28th the Supreme Court struck down an effort by Andhra Pradesh 's government to reserve 4 % of government jobs and education places for poor Muslims .
The court is meanwhile weighing a more dramatic measure announced by the government last year : to reserve 27 % of university places for the OBCs .
To placate irate students , many of them high - caste , the government promises to increase the number of university places accordingly .
Education standards would no doubt fall further .
Even so , the policy may be unstoppable .
Since reservations for the OBCs were introduced in the early 1990s the rise of political parties dedicated to these groups has been inexorable .
So has the proliferation of the OBCs , to around 3,000 castes .
They include millions who are not poor at all .
“ A massive deliberate confusion ” is how Surjit Bhalla , an economist at Oxus Investments , a hedge fund , characterises reservations for the OBCs .
When they were awarded reservations , the OBCs were estimated to make up 53 % of India 's total population .
More recent counting suggests they are only about one - third of the population , although their 27 % reservation remains unchanged .
Moreover , by most measures , the average OBC member is no poorer than the average Indian .
“ How can you discriminate against the average ? ” asks Mr Bhalla , despairingly .
There by mistake
And despair he may .
Practically no politician dares speak out against this caste - based racket for fear of being labelled an apologist for the caste system .
Rather like guests at the Hotel California , those that join the list never leave — even one or two castes that were allegedly included by mistake .
The surpassing example is Tamil Nadu , which reserves a total of 69 % of government jobs : 1 % for tribal people , 18 % for dalits , 30 % for the OBCs and 20 % for a subset of them — members of castes once categorised by British colonisers as “ criminal tribes ” and now known more delicately as “ de- notified communities ” .
There is little opposition to this policy in Tamil Nadu , for two reasons .
It is one of India 's more literate and prosperous states .
And low - caste Hindus are unusually prominent in Tamil Nadu , which suggests to reservationists that the policy is working well .
Textiles companies in Tirupur , a T - shirt hub , for example , are mostly owned by gounders , members of a peasant caste that is officially listed as an OBC .
One defender of the policy is N. Vasudevan , chief official of the Kafkaesque vision of bureaucratic hell that is the Backward Classes , Most Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare Department in Chennai , where workers languish behind mountains of never - opened files .
Asked when it might end he replies : “ When everyone becomes equal . ”
There is an alternative view : that Tamil Nadu is more equal than most states not because it has lots of reservations but because , overall , it has been run less badly .
It has therefore delivered above - average economic growth , from which low - caste Tamils have benefited .
In addition , low - caste businessmen in Tamil Nadu have had opportunities that have nothing to do with government policy .
In contrast to north India , where commerce is dominated by members of a few business castes , south India 's business community has been more open to members of non-business castes .
According to Raman Mahadevan , a business historian , this is partly because members of the south 's main trading caste , the chettiars , chose to concentrate their investments outside India during the 19th century , in Malaya and Singapore .
Partly as a result , little large - scale industry emerged in southern India until the 1930s .
Around the same time , a popular movement against brahmins — especially lordly in the south — emboldened members of the lower and middle castes , including gounders , who were quick to convert their new assertiveness into business .
The Hindu caste system has never been rigid .
Low - caste Hindus do not accept their lumpen position in the hierarchy .
Indeed , like middle - class English families , they tend to cherish a myth of their former greatness .
By imitating the habits of a more prestigious neighbour , in dress or ritual , some low castes have sneaked a rung or two up the ladder .
More recently , in an effort to be classified as an OBC or a dalit caste , some middle - ranking castes have tried to climb a rung or two down .
Meanwhile , on the lowest rung of the ladder , dalit businessmen can be found operating in the informal economy , perhaps as small traders .
They must be especially reliant on caste as a business network .
But that reliance will change if they can expand into the organised sector .
Where businessmen can gain access to credit without having to claim kinship , caste affiliations wither .
As Mr Damodaran writes : “ A kamma sugar magnate ultimately identifies his interests with other mill - owners and not with fellow kamma cane growers or workers . ”
And his business may flourish , unfettered .
With the U.S. Dollar Index breaking decisively below its long - term support level , the sun is finally setting on the golden age of American consumption .
As America 's economic dominance fades , so too will the faith in the central thesis that has explained its apparent success and has shaped the majority of recent economic theory .
At issue is the belief that a nation can grow and prosper by borrowing from abroad in order to consume imported goods .
To consume at the pace that it has , America exchanges income producing assets , such as companies or property , or interest bearing IOUs , such as Treasury notes or mortgage - backed bonds , for foreign made clothes , toys and electronics .
Economists call these transactions " growth " .
But rather than discovering a new path to prosperity , America has simply stumbled on a short cut to financial ruin .
For years America has convinced the emerging market countries that their prosperity is a function of our consumption .
It is argued that their export oriented economies would falter if not for the insatiable American willingness to consume ( a " virtue " that is assumed to be uniquely American ) .
As the dollar falls into the abyss , this myth will be shattered .
My forecast is that over the next two to three years the U.S. Dollar index will fall to 40 ; half of its current value .
As this happens , much of America 's economic power will be transferred abroad .
The chart below approximates current per capita U.S. dollar GDP for thirty nations , including the United States , listed in descending order .
A 50 % decline in the value of the dollar will simultaneously increase interest rates , consumer prices and unemployment in the United States , while causing stock and real estate prices to fall .
Consumption , which accounts for better than 70 % of U.S. GDP , should collapse as a result , producing a significant recession .
My forecast is that U.S. GDP will contract by at least 20 % .
( The Fed may seek to mitigate the nominal decline with expansive monetary policy , but such moves will only result in an even greater contraction in real GDP . )
Assuming a 50 % decline in the value of the dollar and a 20 % fall in U.S. GDP , the above chart would look something like this :
Obviously , these projections are very rough .
Not all foreign currencies will rise in step and not all foreign GDPs will remain constant at today 's levels in local currencies .
However it is the concept that is important .
Notice how America falls from 6th place to 21st .
America 's per capita GDP falls from 58 % of Luxemburg 's , the top nation on the list , to a mere 20 % .
America 's per capita GDP falls from 14 times that of Peru , the lowest nation on the list , to only 5.6 times .
China is conspicuously absent from the list .
Its current per capita GDP is only about $ 2,200 .
However , were China to allow its currency to float freely , my belief is that the yuan would rise far more significantly than other currencies .
I have no idea how much more significantly that rise will be , but let us assume that its rise against the dollar would be double the rate of the typical currency in the Dollar Index .
That would result in China 's per capita GDP rising to $ 8,800 , just above Peru 's but still below Brazil's .
Factoring in China 's enormous population means that such a significant rise in its per capita GDP would have a profound impact on global consumption .
Consider the following table , in billions of U.S. dollars , of the GDPs of the G - 7 nations plus China :
Now consider the table with my assumptions regarding exchange rates and a 20 % decline in U.S .
GDP .
Under this scenario , China supplants the United States as the world 's largest economy , not in 30 or 40 years as is commonly believed , but perhaps as soon as before the end of this decade .
The U.S. retains its lead over Japan for second place , yet the margin declines from over 300 % to just 10 % .
( My prediction is that the yen will rise more significantly than most other currencies meaning that Japan 's GDP will likely surpass U.S. GDP as well . )
Further , the GDP of the thirteen nations sharing the euro is currently about 12.8 trillion dollars .
After the dollar 's decline it will rise to a staggering 25.6 trillion , more then twice that of the U.S .
As a result , considering the EU as a single nation , the U.S. economy would then rank forth among the world 's largest , with its GDP declining from 43 % of world GDP to only 21 % .
Current ideology holds that a recession in the United States as severe as the one I am forecasting would be catastrophic for the global economy .
But this short - sighted view overlooks the effects of such tremendous dollar gains in the GDPs of the rest of the world .
Would n't the increased consumption of everyone else offset the effects of the decreased consumption of Americans ?
It is not as if factories around the world would shut down if Americans stopped spending .
All that would change would be the nationality of the buyers .
As American consumer spending declines , foreign spending will rise to take its place .
With an explosion in foreign purchasing power , consumers around the world will see the dollar values of their incomes and savings soar .
Globally , goods will fall in price and consumers around the world will snap up the bargains .
Goods that were formerly out of reach for many foreign consumers will now be affordable .
The reverse will occur in America .
As production is diverted away from poorer Americans to more affluent foreigners , consumer prices in America will rise sharply .
Goods that Americans used to easily " afford " will now be out of reach .
As gold surpasses $ 700 per ounce , oil tops $ 80 per barrel , and wheat prices exceed $ 9 per bushel , Americans are already getting a taste of things to come .
Prices for these and other commodities are rising as a direct result of the weakness in the dollar .
As this weakness intensifies in the months ahead , commodity price increases will accelerate .
However , as their own currencies rise , many foreign buyers will actually experience price decreases .
The result will be even greater demand for commodities from abroad just as domestic demand subsides .
Further , as the world stops exporting so much of its savings to America , there will be far more capital available to foreign entrepreneurs to invest productively .
Think of the crowding out effect of so much of the world 's savings being lent to American consumers .
Now imagine the foreign investment boom that would follow as foreigners reclaim access to their own savings .
The American propensity to consume is not a unique talent .
Any nation can emulate it so long as it finds willing lenders and suppliers .
Production on the other hand is an entirely different matter .
It requires free markets , limited government , the rule of law , savings , capital and hard work .
The world economy will not be brought to its knees simply because Americans stop consuming .
Rather it is America 's service sector economy that will collapse once the rest of the world stops propping it up .
For a more in depth analysis of the tenuous position of the American economy , the housing and mortgage markets , and U.S. dollar denominated investments , read my book " Crash Proof : How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse . "
My ramblings on Lisp , Ruby and Coding .
When you think about the months in a year , what image pops into your head ?
Whenever I am trying to manipulate dates that span more than a month , I always picture something like this :
I suspect that layout of months got stuck in my mind because my elementary school calendar had a similar structure .
How do other people visualize the months of a year ?

Defense bill provides home for earmarks
The Pentagon says it does n't need any more C - 17 jets , but it is getting them — at a cost of $ 2.4 billion — thanks to the Texas congressional delegation
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon insists it has enough C - 17 Globemaster jets , which are partly manufactured in Texas and used by the Air Force to ferry troops and weapons to hot spots around the globe .
Nevertheless , lawmakers from the Lone Star State and elsewhere recently inserted in a defense authorization bill a requirement that the military buy 10 more aircraft at a cost of $ 2.4 billion .
The project is among the billions of dollars of earmarks , or special funding items , tucked into several defense measures recently approved by the House and Senate for the coming fiscal year .
The number of earmarks is down from previous years as they are increasingly criticized as legislative tricks that avoid competitive bidding and grant application processes and are performed at the behest of lobbyists .
Supporters say they allow lawmakers , rather than unelected bureaucrats , to decide where government money goes .
But the huge defense bills remain a major source of earmark funding for lawmakers seeking job - creating , home - state projects — not all of them directly related to military issues .
Texas
House members secured 46 earmarks worth more than $ 100 million in the House defense appropriations bill alone for projects that included funding for research at many of the state 's universities and institutions in the Texas Medical Center as well as money for the Johnson Space Center and border control .
In the Senate defense appropriations bill , Republican U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn of Texas inserted 27 earmarks worth $ 60 million , including funds for trauma care and border security .
Most of the earmarks are for equipment and research not included in the budget submitted by the Pentagon .
'' Every dollar that is going to a particular earmark or a C - 17 ( aircraft ) is a dollar that is n't going to other higher priority items in the federal budget , " said Steven Ellis , vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense , a watchdog group that scrutinizes earmarks .
Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England warned Congress about the ramifications of funding more C - 17s .
'' If we keep putting money into C - 17s , then frankly , money comes out of some other investment category , " he said .
But lawmakers defend programs that provide jobs and business to constituents .
650 jobs in Texas
Seven House lawmakers , including Rep. Kay Granger , R - Fort Worth , requested the C - 17 funding in the defense authorization bill .
Manufactured by Chicago - based Boeing Co. , the C - 17's main subcontractor is Vought Aircraft Industries , with plants in the Dallas area .
Boeing says the aircraft manufacturing project pumps about $ 1 billion annually into the state 's economy .
Officials with Vought said that 650 jobs in Texas were directly tied to continued production of the jet .
Defense appropriations for this fiscal year , which ends today , contain 2,646 earmarks worth $ 10.5 billion .
The House defense spending bill for next year contains 1,409 earmarks worth $ 6.5 billion , according to Taxpayers for Common Sense .
A committee of House and Senate members now must merge the House bill with the Senate defense spending measure , which has 936 earmarks worth $ 5.2 billion .
None of the defense bills has been sent to the president .
Rep. John Culberson , R- Houston , nabbed a $ 4 million earmark in defense appropriations for the Houston - based Alliance for NanoHealth , a seven- institution consortium in the Texas Medical Center that is developing technologies that , among other things , will help detect cancer and allow doctors to use drugs more effectively .
Culberson , who sits on the Appropriations Committee and whose district includes much of the Medical Center , said he added the health care research funding to the defense bill in part because " it is a larger pot of money . "
But he said that the research is also relevant to the military because the technology could be used to trace biological or chemical agents .
" This is the most exciting and revolutionary medical and scientific research that I will ever have the privilege of helping to fund , " said Culberson , who carries in his briefcase a token of the research : a carbon nanotube quantum wire , prized for its electrical conductivity .
A fan at the Pentagon
The Alliance for NanoHealth may also have an important fan at the Pentagon : Dr. S. Ward Casscells , who was tapped by President Bush this year to be assistant secretary of defense for health affairs and was the alliance 's first director when he worked at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston .
Culberson spokesman Michael Green said Casscells would ensure the nanoscience would be used to help soldiers .
However , the current alliance director , Dr. Mauro Ferrari , said Casscells was not involved when it came to the consortium applying for the earmark .
Ferrari said the earmark is used for equipment and laboratory costs not covered through standard federal research grants that are awarded on a competitive basis and evaluated by peers .
Many of the defense earnmarks are awarded to universities or think tanks for research on military - related issues .
For example , at the behest of San Antonio - based Southwest Research Institute , Rep. Charlie Gonzalez , D - Texas , added $ 2 million to the House version of the defense budget for research and development of crowd behavior software .
The organization says the equipment could be used for crowd control and urban combat planning .
But administration officials say the earmark system is not the best way to ensure that the highest quality research is performed .
In congressional testimony last year , Dr. John Marburger III , director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , said that merit review , through a competitive process refereed by scientists , engineers , and other experts , " has the best prospect for ensuring that the most important research is supported . "
Marburger said the problem of research earmarks is particularly serious in the Department of Defense .
Texas A&M to benefit
One of the major beneficiaries of these kinds of defense research grants is Texas A&M University in College Station , which gets three earmarks worth $ 3.5 million in the House defense appropriations bill , including one to develop technology to allow detection of biochemical agents in the atmosphere above the battlefield .
The earmarks were inserted by Rep. Chet Edwards , D - Waco , a Texas A&M alumnus whose district includes the university .
He also is the top Democrat from Texas on the Appropriations Committee , chairing the panel 's military construction and veteran 's committee subcommittee .
Edwards did not respond to a request for an interview .
But in a prepared statement , he said the peer review process that federal agencies require universities to go through to get research grants " can sometimes get bogged down in politics and bureaucracy . "
Michael O'Quinn , A&M vice president of governmental affairs , said that even though earmarks do n't go through the standard grant review process , they still must get approval from the Defense Department .
" It is not like we are throwing these out there and no one at DOD has ever heard about them , " said O'Quinn , who worked with Defense Secretary Robert Gates when he was president of the university .

General claims Bush gave ' marching orders ' on aggressive interrogation at Guantanamo Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 22 , 2007

Print This Email This New book says US uses ' methods of the most tyrannical regimes '
More than 100,000 pages of newly released government documents demonstrate how US military interrogators " abused , tortured or killed " scores of prisoners rounded up since Sept. 11 , 2001 , including some who were not even suspected of having terrorist ties , according to a just - published book .
In Administration of Torture , two American Civil Liberties Union attorneys detail the findings of a years - long investigation and court battle with the administration that resulted in the release of massive amounts of data on prisoner treatment and the deaths of US - held prisoners .
" [ T ] he documents show unambiguously that the administration has adopted some of the methods of the most tyrannical regimes , " write Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh .
" Documents from Guantanamo describe prisoners shackled in excruciating ' stress positions , ' held in freezing - cold cells , forcibly stripped , hooded , terrorized with military dogs , and deprived of human contact for months . "
Most of the documents on which Administration of Torture is based were obtained as a result of ongoing legal fights over a Freedom of Information
Act request filed in October 2003 by the ACLU and other human rights and anti-war groups , the ACLU said in a news release .
The documents show that prisoner abuse like that found at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was hardly the isolated incident that the Bush administration or US military claimed it was .
By the time the prisoner abuse story broke in mid-2004 the Army knew of at least 62 other allegations of abuse at different prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan , the authors report .
Drawing almost exclusively from the documents , the authors say there is a stark contrast between the public statements of President Bush and then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the policies those and others in the administration were advocating behind the scenes .
President Bush gave " marching orders " to Gen.
Michael Dunlavey , who asked the Pentagon to approve harsher interrogation methods at Guantanamo , the general claims in documents reported in the book .
The ACLU also found that an Army investigator reported Rumsfeld was " personally involved " in overseeing the interrogation of a Guantanamo prisoner Mohammed al Qahtani .
The prisoner was forced to parade naked in front of female interrogators wearing women 's underwear on his head and was led around on a leash while being forced to perform dog tricks .
 It is imperative that senior officials who authorized , endorsed , or tolerated the abuse and torture of prisoners be held accountable , " Jaffer and Singh write , " not only as a matter of elemental justice , but to ensure that the same crimes are not perpetrated again . 

Participate in a presidential frontrunner survey !
The Bureau of the Census has issued a lengthy summary of " facts " about the nation ’s 23.7 million veterans in time for Veteran ’s Day .
Considering that there are two significant ongoing armed conflicts involving U.S. forces , I expected that there would be some " facts " dealing with Iraq and Afghanistan .
Nothing was disaggregated .
Well , nearly nothing .
Where detail was provided , it rarely was framed by war as opposed to education , age or ethnicity .
One statistic I did expect was the number of troops " wounded in hostile engagements " who had been discharged from service and transferred to veterans ’ medical care .
( According to the Pentagon , total U.S. wounded from enemy action in Iraq is 28,327 and in Afghanistan 1,708 . )
But this also was not there even though that number  along with projections for future years  has to exist within the Veterans Administration ( VA ) so its staff can prepare their annual budget request .
Medical Care
Thinking these two items might be linked , I re-read the notice looking for spending just on veterans ’ medical care .
Dead last was total spending by the VA in 2006 and a breakout between medical and non-medical spending for that year .
As a veteran who uses the military medical system , I could not help but wonder if the placement of this information was nothing more than happenstance , a fading echo of the recently revealed mishandling of war wounded and not a harbinger of the how the wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan will be regarded in the priorities of future administrations .
Actually , the census report raised more questions than it answered .
Looking through the Bush administration ’s proposed Fiscal Year 2008 Budget submission turned up the following :
In 2006 , the Bush administration ’s budget request for the Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) was still less than half ( $ 31.3 billion ) the total request ( $ 75.7 billion ) for the Department of Veterans Affairs .
In 2007 , the VHA ’s budget request actually dropped from about 43 % of the total Veterans Administration proposed budget to 40 % .
Congress added $ 1.8 billion in the 2007 supplemental .
The White House however , does not seem able to fathom the long - term medical costs of the Iraq War and its Afghanistan operations .
Although it appears that VHA will be funded at $ 37.2 billion for 2008 , the administration projects a 2 % drop in funding for 2009 and a repeat of this lower level in 2010 .
That ’s just incomprehensible given that the wars are not likely to be over by then .
Supporting the Troops
The public comprehends the principle that if the nation sends its youth to war , it owes those young men and women the best medical care regardless of cost should they be wounded .
This distinction is a variation of the classic " support the troops  support the war " dichotomy that scares and scars politicians .
In an age of 15 - second sound bites , all that need be said is " Senator ( or Representative ) X voted against funding our troops in the field , " letting the silence of the syllogistic " therefore " be completed by the voter : that in refusing to vote for the military ’s budget request the congressional incumbent does n’t care about either the dead or the living .
Regardless of the precipitating event , once the armed forces are " on the ground , " the president of the United States is in the enviable position to blackmail Congress into providing funds for the troops fighting for " God , country , and the American way . "
It does n’t seem to make any difference which party controls Congress or occupies the White House .
The worst political sin is to be susceptible to the charge of " not supporting the troops . "
Ironically , even when the wars they wage are as widely unpopular as today ’s operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , presidents can blackmail the American people the same way  and they get away with it for the same reason : no one wants to be accused of not standing up for the troops or appear to be unwilling to give them the best of everything .
This stems from the belief that the United States is always justified in going to war , that God is on " our side " ( or at the very least , is not on the " other " side ) .
The Warriors
In accepting the demise of the conscript army and the emergence of the modern military professional , the American public assigned the responsibility for military defense to a class of people  the Warriors  and in typical fashion , turned their attention elsewhere .
This left as the main advocates for post- military service benefits ( other than the formal institutions of government ) the traditional veterans ’ advocacy organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) , AMVETS , and the American Legion .
In peacetime , this façade of a " caring " nation could be maintained with little more than the ritual appearance by the " commander - in - chief " ( and in election years by candidates for president ) at veterans ’ conventions and the odd extra half - billion or billion dollars in additional spending that was never enough to catch up with needed improvements in the military and veterans health systems .
Under pressure from two wars , the " center " could not sustain itself or conceal the dichotomy between excellent medicine and paralyzing administrative requirements .
Walter Reed Effect
Then came what could be termed the " Walter Reed effect " : the " fall - out " from investigative reporting by The Washington Post of substandard living arrangements for seriously wounded soldiers , of insufficient numbers of trained case workers for the number of wounded , and the expectation of hospital administrative staff that the wounded could traverse a very convoluted medical bureaucracy without substantial help .
All this , together with the seeming indifference of general officers and administrative personnel toward those with psychological trauma or more evident brain injuries , rekindled empathy for the war - wounded among large segments of the U.S. public .
Initially , this renewed concern for the warriors and the question of why their care was so remiss did not cross into questioning the war itself , perhaps because one could , in the early days , talk war without having to talk veterans .
And when veterans were mentioned , the traditional veterans groups stepped forward , as they had in the past , and generally supported the president ’s policy .
It would not be too long , however , before voices of returned soldiers , wounded or not , and of the survivors of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan were raised in protest  first singly and then collectively in new groups such as Iraq Veterans Against the War , Veterans Against the Iraq War , and even among the veterans of the Vietnam War .
As the extent of the deficiencies became clearer , as more and more members of Congress visited hospitals and saw first - hand the extensive physical and mental injuries , as they learned of the extensive treatments that would have to last a lifetime , they at last began to fathom the woeful under funding of veteran ’s health and rehabilitation costs .
The apparent callousness of top Army officials to the status quo did not sit well with the public .
This perception of official indifference acted as a catalyst to re-engage the American public on the issue of why these wars with their ever - increasing casualties had n’t ended .
Vets Find Their Voices
Veterans of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan began to find their voice - in - opposition and to take on the issue of inadequate care for the wounded .
And since the wounded remain distinctive personalities , because they are not hidden away from society , they cannot be treated as an undifferentiated class  like those who are killed and usually become , other than for their loved ones who remain , more of a statistic than a memory .
Indeed , today ’s wounded ( and today ’s 3,858 dead in Iraq and 459 in Afghanistan ) present the public with an opportunity to start to end the fighting , the dying , and the maiming that seem to be endemic in the " social contract " of modern nation states .
How ?
By bringing face - to - face those who serve with those who first asked them to serve , sent them to " care " for ( that is , to fight for ) the nation , and in so doing created a moral and even a legal reciprocal obligations to care for the wounded who " cared " for the nation when asked .
While this approach might seem to leave a huge gap through which to drive a tank army , it would strip away the sterile masks that protect those who make war from those who " do " war  at the maker ’s behest and in the name of the " people " who often have absolutely no say in the decision for war .
It ’s different today than during the Vietnam War , when even wounded veterans were sometimes reviled and taunted as " baby - killers . "
Vietnam may have been the tipping point , for that was the first U.S. television war .
The horrendous wounds from Iraq and Afghanistan have moved the public beyond the halfway point of transitioning from a warrior mentality and myth to a culture and outlook that celebrate peace .
The challenge is how to keep together the need for adequate appropriations to care for the wounded for as long as necessary with the realization that those who need long - term care once were able - bodied men and women .
Still to be traversed is the gap between the recognition of the cost of caring for the wounded and caring about  that is , rejecting  the reasons why politicians opt for war in the first instance .
Meanwhile , the number of mercenaries ( politely termed " security contractors " in the mainstream media and political debate ) just in Iraq is reportedly between 20,000 and 30,000 .
That ’s more than some countries have in their whole armed forces .
So now there is another consideration : will the public , and the Congress , in rebelling against the cost of paying for war and the war - wounded , opt for a fully mercenary force to wage our wars ?
That was what Rome did .
History records the outcome .

University of Delaware Requires Students to Undergo Ideological Reeducation October 30 , 2007 FIRE Press Release NEWARK , Del. , October 30 , 2007 — The University of Delaware subjects students in its residence halls to a shocking program of ideological reeducation that is referred to in the university ’s own materials as a “ treatment ” for students ’ incorrect attitudes and beliefs .
The Orwellian program requires the approximately 7,000 students in Delaware ’s residence halls to adopt highly specific university - approved views on issues ranging from politics to race , sexuality , sociology , moral philosophy , and environmentalism .
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) is calling for the total dismantling of the program , which is a flagrant violation of students ’ rights to freedom of conscience and freedom from compelled speech .
“ The University of Delaware ’s residence life education program is a grave intrusion into students ’ private beliefs , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ The university has decided that it is not enough to expose its students to the values it considers important ; instead , it must coerce its students into accepting those values as their own .
At a public university like Delaware , this is both unconscionable and unconstitutional . ”
intensive training from the university , including a “ diversity facilitation training ” session at which RAs were taught , among other things , that “ [ a ] racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist ( racist ) system .
The term applies to all white people ( i.e. , people of European descent ) living in the United States , regardless of class , gender , religion , culture or sexuality . ”
The university ’s views are forced on students through a comprehensive manipulation of the residence hall environment , from mandatory training sessions to “ sustainability ” door decorations .
Students living in the university ’s eight housing complexes are required to attend training sessions , floor meetings , and one - on - one meetings with their Resident Assistants ( RAs ) .
The RAs who facilitate these meetings have received their ownfrom the university , including a “ diversity facilitation training ” session at which RAs were taught , , that “ [ a ] racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist ( racist ) system .
The term applies to all white people ( i.e. , people of European descent ) living in the United States , regardless of class , gender , religion , culture or sexuality . ” university suggests that at one - on - one sessions with students , RAs should ask intrusive personal questions such as “ When did you discover your sexual identity ? ”
Students who express discomfort with this type of questioning often meet with disapproval from their RAs , who write reports on these one - on - one sessions and deliver these reports to their superiors .
One student identified in a write - up as an RA ’s “ worst ” one - on - one session was a young woman who stated that she was tired of having “ diversity shoved down her throat . ”

These competencies include : “ Students will recognize that systemic oppression exists in our society , ” “ Students will recognize the benefits of dismantling systems of oppression , ” and “ Students will be able to utilize their knowledge of sustainability to change their daily habits and consumer mentality . ”

At various points in the program , students are also pressured or even required to take actions that outwardly indicate their agreement with the university ’s ideology , regardless of their personal beliefs .
Such actions include displaying specific door decorations , committing to reduce their ecological footprint by at least 20 % , taking action by advocating for an “ oppressed ” social group , and taking action by advocating for a “ sustainable world . ”
documents relating to the assessment of student learning , for example , the residence hall lesson plans are referred to as “ treatments . ”
In the Office of Residence Life ’s internal materials , these programs are described using the harrowing language of ideological reeducation .
Inrelating to the assessment of student learning , for example , the residence hall lesson plans are referred to as “ treatments . ” letter sent yesterday to University of Delaware President Patrick Harker , FIRE pointed out the stark contradiction between the residence life education program and the values of a free society .
FIRE ’s letter to President Harker also underscored the University of Delaware ’s legal obligation to abide by the First Amendment .
FIRE reminded Harker of the Supreme Court ’s decision in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette ( 1943 ) , a case decided during World War II that remains the law of the land .
Justice Robert H. Jackson , writing for the Court , declared , “ If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation , it is that no official , high or petty , can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein . ”

“ The fact that the university views its students as patients in need of treatment for some sort of moral sickness betrays a total lack of respect not only for students ’ basic rights , but for students themselves , ” Lukianoff said .
“ The University of Delaware has both a legal and a moral obligation to immediately dismantle this program , and FIRE will not rest until it has . ”
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders , scholars , journalists , and public intellectuals across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights , due process rights , freedom of expression , and rights of conscience on our campuses .
FIRE would like to thank the Delaware Association of Scholars ( DAS ) for its invaluable assistance in this case .

Other paleontologists and experts in human evolution said the discovery strongly suggested that the early transition from more apelike to more humanlike ancestors was still poorly understood .
They also said that this emphasized the need to search more widely for fossils from the critical period at the still unknown dawn of our own genus , Homo .
The challenge to the idea of a more linear succession of the three Homo species is being reported today in the journal Nature .
The lead author is Fred Spoor , an evolutionary anatomist at University College London .
Other authors include Meave G. Leakey and her daughter Louise Leakey , the Kenyan paleontologists who are co-directors of the Koobi Fora Research Project that made the discovery .
The fieldwork was supported by the National Geographic Society .
The fossils were found east of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 2000 .
It took years to prepare the specimens , encased in hardened sediment , for study and to be sure of the identification of the species , the scientists said .
University of Utah geologists determined the dates of the fossils from volcanic ash deposits .
The most recent fossils of the habilis species known before now were 1.65 million years old or older .
Some fragments of fossils with apparent habilis attributes have been dated as early as 2.33 million years old .
In recent years , scientists not involved in the project said , discoveries were hinting at possible overlap between the habilis and erectus species .
But the implications were considered so profound that little was said about these dates , pending more conclusive evidence .
NEW YORK -- Warren Buffett advised Alex Rodriguez to
approach the New York Yankees and go around agent Scott Boras , The
Wall Street Journal reported Saturday .
The newspaper cited a person familiar with the matter , whom itdid not identify .
" A - Rod really loves being a Yankee , " Buffett was quoted assaying .
He would n't comment on the substance of any discussionswith the player .
The two became friends several years ago .
Rodriguez , on Boras ' advise , opted out of the final threeseasons of his record $ 252 million , 10 - year contract on Oct. 28 .
The Yankees had said many times that if he opted out , they wouldn ' tnegotiate because they would lose $ 21.3 million from Texas for thefinal three seasons that was agreed to at the time of the 2004trade , money to offset the $ 72 million New York owed from 2008 - 10 .
Upset with developments after he opted out , Rodriguez contacted Buffett , and the investor told him to approach the Yankees withouthis agent , the Journal said .
After speaking with the investor , Rodriguez contacted a managingdirector at Goldman Sachs that he knew , John Mallory , who then gotin touch with Gerald Cardinale , a Goldman Sachs managing directorwho has worked with the Yankees and their YES Network .
With the assistance of the two Goldman executives , Rodriguez and the Yankees negotiated a $ 275 million , 10 - year contract that is inthe process of being finalized .
" This year was a magical season , '' Rodriguez told MLB.com .
"
The way things went , we came up a little short at the end .
Butother than that , I 'm happy with the way the year went .
My wife and I finally feel like we 're New Yorkers . ''

ここからは ， 「アクセスのスピードを上げる」技術を解説していく。
その代表例が，自動メモリー・チューニング機能だ。この機能は，メモリー上に存在する，SQL文と実行計画を格納する領域「共有プール」と，一度検索したデータそのものを格納する領域「データベース・バッファ・キャッシュ」の間で，メモリーを再配分する（図6）。二つの領域にデータがうまくキャッシュされていれば，アクセス・スピードは上がる。しかし一方のメモリー領域には余裕があり，もう一方が枯渇してディスク・アクセスが発生する場合がある。そこでDBはキャッシュのヒット率を見て，この二つの領域間でメモリーの割り当てを調整する。
最近では，インメモリーDBの導入事例が増えている（図7）。これは，（1）高速なメモリーのみを使う，（2）インメモリーDBに最適化されたT-Treeインデックスを利用，（3）バッファ管理の処理が不要，といった特徴を備える。
The Bush administration loves to talk about the virtues of “ sound science , ” by which it usually means science that buttresses its own political agenda .
But when some truly independent science comes along to threaten that agenda , the administration often ignores or minimizes it .
The latest example involves the Environmental Protection Agency ’s decision to reject the recommendations of experts inside and outside the government who had urged a significant tightening of federal standards regulating the amount of soot in the air .
At issue were so - called fine particles , tiny specks of soot that are less than one - thirtieth the diameter of a human hair .
They penetrate deep into the lungs and circulatory system and have been implicated in tens of thousands of deaths annually from both respiratory and coronary disease .
The E.P.A. , obliged under the Clean Air Act to set new exposure levels every five years , tightened the daily standard .
But it left unchanged the annual standard , which affects chronic exposure and which the medical community regards as more important .
In so doing , the agency rejected the recommendation of its own staff scientists and even that of its Clean Air Scientific Advisory Council , a 22 - member group of outside experts that had recommended a significant tightening of the standards .
Stephen Johnson , the agency administrator , claimed there was “ insufficient evidence ” linking health problems to long - term exposure .
He added that “ wherever the science gave us a clear picture , we took clear action , ” noting also that “ there was not complete agreement on the standard . ”
One wonders how much evidence Mr. Johnson requires , and how “ complete ” an “ agreement ” must be before he takes action .
A 20 - 2 vote in favor of stronger standards seems fairly convincing to us ; likewise the unanimous plea for stronger standards from mainstream groups like the American Medical Association .
It 's Hard To Enjoy My Food Court Pizza With The Sound Of The Screaming Ghosts
This is from The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein , in a chapter about the 1976 - 83 dirty war in Argentina .
I always knew there was something terrifying about shopping malls :
In 1987 , a film crew was shooting in the basement of the Galerias Pacifico , one of Buenos Aires ' plushest downtown malls , and to their horror they stumbled on an abandoned torture center .
It turned out that during the dictatorship , the First Army Corp hid some of its disappeared in the bowels of the mall ; the dungeon walls still bore the desperate markings made by its long - dead prisoners : names , dates , pleas for help .
Today , Galerias Pacifico is the crown jewel of Buenos Aires ' shopping district , evidence of its arrival as a globalized consumer capital .
Vaulted ceilings and lushly painted frescoes frame the vast array of brand - name stores , from Christian Dior to Ralph Lauren to Nike ...
For Argentines who know their history , the mall stands as a chilling reminder that just as an older form of capitalist conquest was built on the mass graves of the country 's indigenous peoples , the Chicago School Project in Latin America was quite literally built on the secret torture camps where thousands of people who believed in a different country disappeared .
The Galerias Pacifico website is here .
Who wants to be in charge of adding this to its wikipedia page ?

The shapes and sizes of thousands of skulls from all over the globe point to a single origin in sub-Saharan Africa for modern humans , according to a recent study .
University of Cambridge population biologist Andrea Manica examined data from more than 4,600 male and 1,500 female skulls — all less than 2,000 years old — from academic collections across the globe , each of which was measured for 37 different structural characteristics .
The researchers found that the farther a population was located from Africa , the fewer variations in skull shape they displayed .
The same loss of variation with increasing distance from Africa has been found in analyses of DNA .
Manica argues that this strongly supports the idea that modern humans arose in Africa , probably around 200,000 years ago , and then spread to other locations around the world starting about 50,000 years ago , hardly or never mixing with other species of hominids .
Whenever a group left the ancestral African population , they took with them only a fraction of the total variation present in the cradle of humanity .
Each subsequent migration out of these departed groups would reduce variability in genes and skull shape .
Genetic data support this hypothesis , so scientists of the “ Out of Africa ” school of thought are boasting of a slam dunk .
Still , a minority of anthropologists still insist that fossils tell adifferent story , with humans evolving from groups of hominids that werespread all over the world .
The opposing team says that 2,000 - year - old skulls cannot say much about our earliest ancestors .
“ You can look at the data another way , ” says paleoanthropologist Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan .
“ Look at it specific to the environmental pressures .
There would be more variability in an African population because Africa has a less stable climate and environment . ”

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
One in 12 full - time workers in the United States acknowledges having used illegal drugs in the past month , the government reports .
Most of those who report using illicit drugs are employed full - time , with the highest rates among restaurant workers , 17.4 % , and construction workers , 15.1 % , according to a federal study being released Monday .
About 4 % of teachers and social service workers reported using illegal drugs in the past month , which was among the lowest rates .
Federal officials said the newest survey is a snapshot and was not designed to show whether illicit drug usage in the workplace is a growing problem or a lessening one .
The current usage rate is 8.2 % .
Two previous government surveys reflected a usage rate of 7.6 % in 1994 and 7.7 % in 1997 , but those studies involved a much smaller sample of interviews .
The latest study comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration , an agency within the Health and Human Services Department .
The data is drawn from the agency 's annual surveys in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 of the civilian , non-institutionalized population .
Each survey included interviews with more than 40,000 people , who were each paid $ 30 to participate .
Joe Gfroerer , an agency official , said most of the illicit drug use involved marijuana .
Anne Skinstad , a researcher and clinical psychologist , called the survey 's results " very worrisome " because there are fewer treatment programs than there used to be to assist employees and employers with a dependence on drugs .
However , testing programs for drug use are fairly prevalent , with 48.8 % of full - time workers telling the government that their employers conducted testing for drug use .
" I used to train supervisors to detect chronic use and intervene as early as possible , and that is a very good , constructive way rather than firing people , " said Skinstad , an associate professor and director of the Prairielands Addiction Technology Transfer Center at the University of Iowa .
" Some employers want drug testing .
I 'm not sure that 's the way I would like to go .
What I think I would like to focus on is employee performance . "
The study also showed that the prevalence of illegal drug use reported by full - time workers in the past month was highest among younger workers .
Nineteen percent of workers age 18 to 25 said they used illegal drugs during the past month , compared with 10.3 % among those age 26 to 34 ; 7 % among those age 35 to 49 ; and 2.6 % among those age 50 to 64 .
Men accounted for about two - thirds of the workers — 6.4 million — who reported using illegal drugs in the past month , the government said .
Men were also more likely than women to report illegal drug use in the past month — 9.7 % for men , versus 6.2 % for women .
The study also looked at alcohol use by workers .
About 10.1 million full - time workers , or 8.8 % , reported heavy alcohol use .
Heavy alcohol use was defined as drinking five or more drinks on one occasion at least five times in the past 30 days .

Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz has blunted whatever public niceties existed between his company and Microsoft with a revealing attack on Redmond 's lawsuit threats around open source software .
In his post , Schwartz recounts struggles to deal with defectors from Sun 's Solaris operating system to the open source Linux .
" Our computer business had failed to keep pace with the rest of the industry - which meant our volume systems looked expensive , " he writes .
" In combination , and with a poor track record of supporting Solaris off of Sun hardware , we gave customers one choice - leave Sun .
Many did .
Those were the dark days . "
Those upfront statements already prove rare for a public company 's CEO .
Schwartz , however , went on to charge even more sacred ground .
With business down and customers leaving , we had more than a few choices at our disposal .
We were invited by one company to sue the beneficiaries of open source .
We declined .
We could join another and sue our customers .
That seemed suicidal .
We were offered the choice to scuttle Solaris , and resell someone else 's operating system .
We declined .
And we were encouraged to innovate by developers and customers who wanted Sun around , who saw the value we delivered through true systems engineering .
We 're guessing SCO was the company that wanted to sue open source .
The second one wanting to sue customers proves trickier - Microsoft perhaps ?
And the last must be Red Hat and other open source chums , hoping to wipe Solaris .
This prelude , while interesting , may leave some wanting to know the point of Schwartz 's exercise .
Why the recap on Solaris 's woes ?
Well , Schwartz used the setup to deliver a response to Microsoft 's recent threats to sue open source software makers and maybe even its own customers .
" You would be wise to listen to the customers you 're threatening to sue - they can leave you , especially if you give them motivation , " Schwartz tells Microsoft .
" Remember , they would n't be motivated unless your products were somehow missing the mark . "
More than attacking Microsoft , Schwartz seems to be trying to ingratiate Sun with open source developers .
He wants to present Sun as a major open source force with your best interests at heart .
It 's an interesting way to make use of Microsoft 's gaffe .
Of course , not all members of the open source crowd have swallowed Schwartz 's line .
One commenter on Schwartz 's blog writes ,
Jonathan , Ballmer and Gates can certainly use a few reality checks , but your vision of the world does as well .
If you compare Microsoft 's market capitalization and earnings growth to Sun 's over the last years , it 's quite obvious that what Sun is doing is not working .
Sure , you get a lot of brownie points from the Slashdot community for all the open source handwaving , but this is not how you grow a company .
From where non-insiders like myself stand , your choice to innovate and not sue was born out of necessity : you simply did n't have the cash to do anything else .
As for the supremacy of Java , it happened way before you open - sourced the JDK , and your choice of the GPL made this brilliant move one that is completely inconsequential ( ask mobile software companies what they think of a GPL JDK ) .
Yes , Sun has done a good job at trying to reinvent itself and attempting to innovate .
You 're still alive , congratulations for that .
But you have n't grown , you keep following and copying software ideas from your competitors ( Microsoft , Google and Apple for the most part ) and most of the software you back up ( NetBeans , Glassfish , Looking Glass and more recently , JavaFX ) are being completely ignored by the industry .
Ouch . ®
" He 's never made such comments , " White House spokesman Scott McClellan said .
The comments were attributed to Mr Bush by the Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath in the upcoming TV series Elusive Peace : Israel and the Arabs .
Mr Shaath said that in a 2003 meeting with Mr Bush , the US president said he was " driven with a mission from God " .
Holy war ?
" President Bush said to all of us : ' I 'm driven with a mission from God .
God would tell me , George , go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan .
And I did , and then God would tell me , George , go and end the tyranny in Iraq ...
And I did .
" ' And now , again , I feel God 's words coming to me , Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security , and get peace in the Middle East .
And by God I 'm gonna do it . ' "
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , who attended the meeting in June 2003 too , also appears on the documentary series to recount how Mr Bush told him : " I have a moral and religious obligation .
So I will get you a Palestinian state . "
The TV series charts recent attempts to bring peace to the Middle East , from former US President Bill Clinton 's peace talks in 1999 - 2000 to Israel 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip this year .
It seeks to uncover what happened behind closed doors by speaking to presidents and prime ministers , along with their generals and ministers .
The BBC Two series , Israel and the Arabs : Elusive Peace will be broadcast on Mondays from 10 October at 2100 BST .
One of the accusations made by Tim Bray in his post I ’ve Seen This Movie is that my recent posts about the Atom Publishing Protocol are part of some sinister plot by Microsoft to not support it in our blogging clients .
That 's really ironic considering that Microsoft is probably the only company that has shipped two blogging clients that support APP .
Do n't take my word for it .
In his blog post entitled Microsoft is not sabotaging APP ( probably ) Joe Cheng of the Windows Live Writer team writes
Microsoft has already shipped a general purpose APP client ( Word 2007 ) and GData implementation ( Windows Live Writer ) .
These are the two main blogging tools that Microsoft has to offer , and while I ca n’t speak for the Word team , the Writer team is serious about supporting Atom going forward .
These two clients also already post to most blogs , not just Spaces .
In particular , Writer works hard to integrate seamlessly with even clearly buggy blog services .
I do n’t know anyone who works as hard as we do at this .
...
Spaces may not support APP , but it does support MetaWeblog which Microsoft has a lot less influence over than APP ( since MW is controlled by Dave Winer , not by an official standards body ) .
Consider that many of its main competitors , including MySpace , Vox , and almost all overseas social networking sites , have poor or nonexistent support for any APIs .
The reasoning behind Windows Live Spaces supporting the MetaWeblog API and not the Atom Publishing Protocol are detailed in my blog posts and which I made over two years ago when we were going through the decision process for what the API story should be for Windows Live Spaces .
For those who do n't have time to read both posts , it basically came down to choosing a mature de facto standard ( i.e. the MetaWeblog API ) instead of ( i ) creating a proprietary protocol which better our needs or ( ii ) taking a bet on the Atom Publishing Protocol spec which was a moving target in 2004 and is still a moving target today in 2007 .
I hope this clears up any questions about Microsoft and APP .
I 'm pretty much done talking about this particular topic for the next couple of weeks .

The total proposed American defense budget for 2008 is more than half a trillion dollars — with $ 75 billion of that set aside for research and development .
For decades , the Pentagon ’s investment in science and technology has produced widely hailed achievements like the Internet and the Global Positioning System .
It has also backed quixotic and costly failures , like space - based lasers .
And sometimes it has gone off the deep end , funding such things as psychic spies and weapons that defy the laws of physics .
The Department of Defense began systematically funding basic and applied research in a big way after World War II .
Today the Pentagon ’s investment in science R&D remains a cornerstone of the country ’s national security strategy .
Yet in the aftermath of the low - tech attacks of 9/11 , the growing insurgency in Iraq , and the threat of worldwide terrorism , technology experts both within and outside the Pentagon are questioning whether Defense Department research is producing the results that America needs .
So what are we getting for our money ?
That $ 75 billion budget covers a vast array of projects , from perfecting new weapon systems like the Joint Strike Fighter plane to studying pure physics .
Focusing on the research side of R&D , DISCOVER looked at four key areas where the military is placing its bets : hypersonic vehicles , laser technology , using information technology and neuroscience to combine human and machine on the battlefield , and employing sociology and psychobiology to combat terrorism .
Hypersonics
For two decades , unconfirmed press reports have speculated that the United States has been developing Aurora , a top secret hypersonic aircraft , sometimes dubbed the SR - 72 .
Rumors of such “ black , ” or classified , research programs are hard to squelch :
How do you prove something does not exist ?
As recently as June , an article in Defense News , a trade publication , reported that the Air Force was developing “ a stealthy 4,000 - mph plane capable of flying to altitudes of about 100,000 feet , with transcontinental range . ”
In comparison , the state - of - the - art SR - 71 stealth reconnaissance plane , which flew from 1964 to 1998 , topped out at about an airspeed of 2,200 mph and 85,000 feet , while the Concorde , the fastest commercial jet ever built , flew at a maximum speed of about 1,350 mph and an altitude of 60,000 feet .
The Aurora speculation has been fueled , in part , by the Defense Department ’s classified budget requests , estimated by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington , D.C. , to total $ 30.1 billion for 2007 , with about half going to classified R&D .
That black budget has at times led to wild speculation , despite independent analysis indicating that much of the black money flows into satellites and other intelligence assets .
According to Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists ( also based in Washington , D.C. ) , a frequent critic of government secrecy , it would be hard in today ’s world — though not impossible — to hide such a large classified program as a hypersonic aircraft .
“ In principle , it is possible to conduct a large black program , ” he says , but the reality is that the larger the program and the more people involved in it , the harder it is to keep totally secret .
“ I suspect Aurora involved a small grain of truth , and lots of wishful thinking , ” he adds .
Laser guns may first appear on the battlefield as nonlethal weapons intended to blind and disorient , as in the PHaSR prototype .

Mark Lewis , the Air Force ’s chief scientist , laughs about the persistence of the Aurora story .
“ That ’s right , we got the technology from Area 51 , ” he jokes .
In fact , Lewis says , hypersonic research really is progressing in notable ways , just not in the direction of an airplane .
Lewis is particularly enthusiastic about the X - 51 WaveRider , a hypersonic flight - test vehicle funded by the Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Pentagon ’s research and development arm .
The WaveRider gets its name from its unique approach to coping with hypersonic shock waves that form in the air as it drills through the sky .
Rather than fighting shock waves , the shape of the X - 51 allows it to maximize those waves to provide lift and funnel compressed air into its scramjet engine .
The X - 51 will most likely lead to missiles , which are substantially easier to construct and fly than piloted airplanes .
In such applications , hypersonic technology could be important for the war on terror : According to Richard Hallion , who once served as the Air Force ’s historian and is a former senior adviser for “ counterintelligence and special programs oversight , ” hypersonics could result in a missile capable of reaching its quarry before it has a chance to escape .
“ You might go after a fleeting target , a Zarqawi or an Osama bin Laden , ” he says .
Death Rays
Like hypersonics , laser weapons involve boundary - pushing technology that has been in development for years .
After more than two decades and billions of dollars of investment , there are still no deployed laser - weapon systems , which fall under the broad category of “ directed energy weapons . ”
But even as expectations have fallen , some progress has been made .
Gone is the 1980s vision of huge energy beams that would fell ballistic missiles in midflight , and fighters equipped with high - energy lasers still exist only in the realm of ambitious PowerPoint presentations .
Currently most of the research focus is on more modestly powered beams .
The Army , for example , is investing in an effort to develop solid - state lasers and says it will soon reach 100 kilowatts , about the minimum power needed to produce a deployable weapon .
The signs look good that they will meet that goal ; in February , the Solid State Heat Capacity Laser , built at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , hit the 67 - kilowatt mark .
DARPA is looking at more efficient technologies , like fiber lasers and liquid lasers , which could lead to smaller , more compact devices , while the Navy is researching a Free Electron Laser , an experimental technology that uses high - speed electrons to generate an extremely powerful focused beam of radiation .
The Free Electron Laser is still in the lab , though , and probably will not be ready until after 2020 .
The Missile Defense Agency for its part is focused more on chemical lasers , which draw prodigious energy from chemical reactions .
One such device , the megawatt - class Airborne Laser currently installed on a Boeing 747 , is intended to shoot down ballistic missiles .
Air Force researchers are also slowly developing a less powerful chemical laser , called the Advanced Tactical Laser , designed to go on C - 130H gunship .
Mark Lewis of the Air Force acknowledges that even the Advanced Tactical Laser is not ready to deploy : “ I ’m not sure it ’s even the right laser system , ” he says .
“ Ultimately , you probably want to do solid - state [ lasers ] . ”
Still , he feels that some elements of the system are providing a useful test bed for future weapons .
Despite many years of failed efforts , directed energy weapons are worth the investment , Lewis argues , because they fall into the high - risk , high - payoff category :
They may fail , but if they work , they will provide a tremendous capability .
“ If we ’re not failing a little bit , or every so often , then we ’re not being bold enough in the research that we ’re doing , ” he maintains .
But how does the military guard against ideas that are so impossible or improbable that they ’re not worth a single dime ?
A few years ago , DARPA , which prides itself on promoting far - out projects , proposed spending $ 30 million on a “ hafnium bomb , ” a type of nuclear weapon intended to release energy from atomic nuclei without either fission or fusion , using an approach similar to how energy is extracted from electrons in a laser .
DARPA pursued the project even after outside advisory panels criticized the physics as bad science , and independent researchers were unable to replicate the basic results the research was based on .
The agency abandoned the project only after Congress intervened .
DARPA , through its spokeswoman , Jan Walker , declined an interview , but Walker answered written questions .
“ A DARPA program can be very hard , but it ca n’t violate the laws of physics ( or if so , have as its purpose the discovery of new phenomenology which may in fact cause the current laws to be reconsidered ) , ” she wrote .
What Walker ’s parenthetical bureaucratese appears to be saying is that sometimes DARPA will fund projects that violate the known laws of physics .
So if current science ca n’t be used as a filter in such cases , how does DARPA decide which projects are worth funding ?
“ The issue of ‘ worth ’ goes more to whether or not the proposed program will enable revolutionary change , ” Walker replied .
Lewis , who has been at the receiving end of some strange research proposals , agrees that it ’s not the subject per se that defines something as crazy , but the approach to it .
“ I have my own litmus test , ” he says .
“ First , does this violate the laws of physics ?
That ’s the gatekeeper . ”
Second , he says , is “ what is the capability that it brings to bear , and is that an important capability ? ”
By Lewis ’s criteria , some ideas that seem wild are worthwhile to fund initially — as long as sponsors are willing to drop concepts that do n’t appear to be living up to their promise .
“ For me , the difference is that the hafnium bomb violated the laws of physics , and we had lots of really smart people who said it violated the laws of physics , ” he says .
“ Making the initial investment , one might argue , is n’t so bad , ” he continues .
“ It ’s knowing when to bail . ”
Warriors and War Machines
Tanks and missiles are the most obvious fruits of military research , but some defense analysts argue that information technology is the weapon that has most revolutionized warfare .
Modern generals never face the command and control problems that plagued , say , Napoleon .
Surveillance technologies like radar and spy satellites can warn of an approaching enemy , troops can be given orders in real time from thousands of miles away , and GPS navigation ensures they do n’t get lost .
These technologies allowed the U.S. military to sweep aside initial opposition in Iraq and Afghanistan .
According to Philip Coyle , senior adviser for the Center for Defense Information and the Defense Department ’s top technology tester during the Clinton administration , in recent years the Pentagon has increasingly relied on information .
“ Basically , you substitute electrons for armor , ” he says .
“ The idea was if you had enough information , that would make up for armor . ”
Research in advanced information technology is feeding ideas like Future Combat Systems , the Army ’s ambitious $ 200 billion program to field a series of manned and unmanned vehicles linked by a common communications network .
But Coyle now believes relying on information technology so heavily is at least partially misguided .
He notes the lesson learned from the later combat in Iraq — where homemade bombs have proved deadly to U.S. forces — is simple : “ You never have enough information to substitute for armor . ”
That ’s not the only problem .
Building that heavily linked network has proved daunting .
Costs have grown , particularly as engineers realized the limitations of their technology .
Thomas Killion , the Army ’s chief scientist , defends this work in much the same way Lewis defends the Air Force ’s high - risk ventures :
The important thing about Future Combat Systems was that the Army defined “ a vision and stuck to it [ and then over time ] calibrated it with technical reality . ”
In fact , the Pentagon is now extending its desire to manage information all the way to a soldier ’s brain , where DARPA and other research agencies are seeking to exploit neuroscience in pursuit of better battlefield technology .
This year DARPA started a project called the Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System — more catchily dubbed Luke ’s Binoculars ( a reference to Luke Skywalker from Star Wars ) — that combines advanced optics with an EEG system that monitors brain wave activity in the prefrontal cortex .
Certain patterns of activity suggest that the brain has subconsciously detected a threat , and the system will alert the soldier immediately instead of waiting for his conscious mind to finish digesting the entire scene .
DARPA anticipates field - testing a prototype in 2010 .
Luke ’s Binoculars is only one step into the world of neuroscience .
The Pentagon is also trying to expand its understanding of the brain in order to detect foes .
In an interview , William Schneider , the chairman of the Defense Science Board , a panel that advises the Pentagon ’s senior leadership , says that neuroscience can offer a window into the minds of terrorists .
“ By being able to collect and process a lot of information about individuals that can be leveraged with understanding how the brain operates , there may be things we can do that had not heretofore been possible . ”
This would include being better able to predict where an individual might be found or to anticipate his behavior .
Schneider ’s suggestion is one part of a broader report by the Defense Science Board on 21st - century “ strategic technology vectors . ”
Released earlier this year , the report highlighted “ human terrain preparation ” as one of the key areas for Pentagon science and technology .
This new piece of jargon has rapidly entered the military lexicon , with commanders and technologists alike talking about the “ human terrain ” to describe the interaction of culture , groups , and people that can , for example , lead to military forces being treated either as liberators or as unwelcome intruders .
The Pentagon does not just want to study this problem , however ; it wants to develop a system to combat it .
How can it manipulate group psychology so that insurgents , not U.S. forces , are seen by local civilians as the enemy ?
What interrogation techniques will produce the best results without alienating the local population or international allies ?
The sorts of technologies this might draw upon are diverse , Schneider says : everything from sensors that monitor the activity of people to software that would guide the actions of military commanders in the field by taking social and psychological factors into account .
The Pentagon is funding social scientists to develop “ a tool kit that helps combat teams understand the cultural context in which they must operate . ”
This kit might include handheld devices that will cue soldiers to behave in a culturally attuned manner .
According to Rear Admiral Bill Landay , who heads the Office of Naval Research , the question for this new area of research is : “ How do you pick out unusual activity out of a very long , broad view of things you see ?
We ’re putting a lot of emphasis in decision tools that focus on patterns and pattern differentiation , anomalies in behavior of people , the behavior of crowds , the behavior of organizations . ”
The Pentagon ’s vision of the future harks back to the past .
During the Vietnam War , the Defense Department tried to use social sciences — particularly anthropology — in the service of national security .
Though the most infamous of these efforts , called Project Camelot , focused on preventing insurgency in Latin America , other projects looked more broadly at using social sciences to help guide military actions , and like current efforts , they included quantitative and predictive uses of social science models .
The current research has resurrected some of this social science work .
DARPA ’s Integrated Crisis Early Warning System is nearly identical — at least in name — to a DARPA project of some 30 years ago that sought to forecast political instability .
The current work describes “ state - of - the - art computational modeling capabilities that can monitor , assess , and forecast , in near real time , a variety of phenomena associated with country instability . ”
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency has also joined in this pursuit , with research focused on tracking WMD networks .
The Army , Navy , and Air Force ( as well as the Department of Homeland Security ) have all launched programs aimed at predicting group behavior .
The goal , which one early participant called the “ widgetization of social science , ” was perhaps best summed up in 2005 by Starnes Walker , then the Office of Naval Research ’s chief scientist , who said he wanted a Star Trek–like detector that could scan for evil intent .
Is this kind of analysis and manipulation possible ?
A memoir by one Pentagon official closely linked to the Vietnam - era cultural research concluded that the military should avoid funding social science .
His warning has been forgotten : Human terrain research is growing , with the Pentagon estimating that in the 2006 and 2007 financial years , $ 74 million was allocated in this area .
Longtime national security analyst William M. Arkin is skeptical of much of the human terrain work , calling it a “ dream counterterrorism program ” that seeks to create a silver bullet to solve the problem of terrorism .
“ Those technologies are interesting and worthy of pursuit , but my guess is that they are a poor replacement for examining why it is that terrorism exists in the first place , ” Arkin says .
He points to the billions of dollars being poured into developing a biometric database in Iraq that will be used to identify and track individuals .
This sort of approach , he says , is based on “ the belief that they can make a database of the entire planet , and thereby that will set us free . ”
But he cautions that “ 9/11 was successful because it was a diabolical plot using the most conventional of weapons .
It was not successful because of some technology they acquired . ”
Human terrain research goes to the heart of the question of whether defense research is grounded in good science , or good policy .
Not everyone in the Pentagon is convinced .
“ I ’m going to be very candid on this one , ” says Lewis , while noting that the Air Force Office of Scientific Research is funding work in this area .
“ I think it ’s something we should be looking at .
I ’m also maintaining a healthy skepticism . ”
Ironically , Lewis ’s skepticism is inspired in part by the science fiction of Isaac Asimov , whose Foundation novels center on researchers who use advanced social science to predict the future , based on the behavior of large groups .
“ There ’s two important lessons that I think Asimov got right , ” Lewis says .
First , the technology failed when a dictator arose , creating a “ wild card that throws all the predictions off . ”
Second , “ in the end it turns out [ the forecasters ] were cheating .
They had n’t actually predicted it all in the past , they were broadcasting it live and updating their predictions . ”
Lewis shrugs .
“ We could n’t figure out if Ohio was going to go Democratic or Republican , and that ’s the society we ’re supposed to understand ? ”
For Arkin , the Pentagon ’s emphasis on futuristic science runs smack against the reality that no amount of science and technology can solve the problems of today .
“ Our future security is not going to be created by a force field , ” he says .
My Pencils Down article got a lot of links , which led many first - time readers to the site .
Most had little experience with screenwriting or the entertainment industry , so it ’s no surprise that the concept of residuals was , frankly , odd .
My friend Jeff often jokes ( half - jokes , I think ) that he wishes he got residuals on spreadsheets he made in 2003 .
He ’s articulating a familiar frustration :
Why should screenwriters get paid extra money years after they finish their work ?
After all , plumbers do n’t get residuals .
Neither do teachers , secretaries or auto workers .
So I want to explain why writers in film and television get residuals , and why they ’re at the heart of the ongoing WGA strike .
The standard analogies
Let ’s say you ’re a Nashville songwriter .
You write a song that Carrie Underwood records and takes to number one .
You get paid royalties for writing that song : albums sold , radio plays , the generic Christmas Muzak version .
A hit song is worth a lot of money .
A moderately successful song is worth a moderate amount of money .
Or let ’s assume you ’re a novelist .
You ’re John Grisham , and you write a legal thriller that half the folks on a given flight are reading .
You get paid a royalty for every book sold .
Like a hit song , a best - seller is worth a lot of money .
A book that does n’t sell as well earns the author less .
In both examples , the way an artist makes money is not necessarily upfront ( writing the book or song ) but over the course of years .
These creative works are annuities that keep generating money , for both the writer and the publisher .
Every year , copies are sold .
Every year , writer and publisher make money .
I ’ll stop here to say that if you do n’t think songwriters or novelists deserve royalties , I ’ve lost you .
Everything else I ’m about to say is predicated on the belief that a creator ( i.e. songwriter , novelist ) is entitled to profit from the success of his or her work .
If you disagree — if you think that once the publisher writes a check , all bets are off — thanks for reading this far .
We ’re done .
If you ’re still with me , let ’s play hypotheticals .
What would happen if songwriters and novelists did n’t receive royalties ?
It would be a lot harder to make a career in either field .
Most songs do n’t become hits .
Most novels do n’t become best - sellers .
Songwriters and novelists may only create new , money - generating work every few years .
Royalties are what pay the bills in the meantime .
Without royalties , very few people could afford to write songs or books for a living .
These pursuits would become hobbies for the rich , or patrons of the rich .
( And in fact , Western literature was largely written by the people who could afford to write . )
→ Royalties allow for a middle class .
Publishers are n’t interested in financing the American dream , however .
They simply want books and songs to sell to the world .
They have a straightforward and related interest in keeping royalties flowing :
→ Royalties allow for a larger pool of talent .
Without royalties , there would be fewer people who could maintain a career as a songwriter or novelist .
There would be fewer songs and books to publish .
It ’s in the industries ’ best interest to keep writers writing , generating new work to make the publishers money .
Residuals are royalties with special sauce
Writing a screenplay is a lot like writing a song or a novel .
The writer goes off and struggles to compose something that is a perfect combination of fresh and familiar , which will hopefully appeal to a large enough proportion of the intended audience .
Just like songs and books , most screenplays never make a cent for their creators .
Books sit unpublished ; songs go unrecorded ; screenplays remain unproduced — locked forever in 12 pt.
Courier .
But a few make it .
A few become movies .
And in the process of converting written words to filmed entertainment , a bit of legal sleight - of - hand takes place .
I ’m going to oversimplify it to make it comprehensible , but the longer , more accurate version matches the shape of what I ’m about to explain .
Whether you write a song , a book or a screenplay , you ’re protected by copyright .
More than that , you ’re acknowledged as the Author of the work , which has important ( but eye - glazingly complicated ) implications under international law , including certain inalienable creative rights .
When movie studios read your screenplay and decide they ’d like to make it into a film , they hit a few snags .
Two examples :
As the Author and copyright - holder , you the writer control the ability to make derivative works , such as a movie .
Or a sequel .
Or a videogame .
Some of your inalienable creative rights as Author ( e.g. “ no one can mutilate or distort the work in such as way as to be prejudicial to the honor or reputation of the author ” ) are potential nightmares for a company about to spend $ 100 million on a movie distributed worldwide .
So a compromise was made .
Screenwriters would sell the “ authorship ” of their screenplays to the studios , and allow themselves to be classified as employees .
Original works would thus become works - made - for - hire .
In exchange , screenwriters would get a host of benefits and protections covered by the Writers Guild of America ( the WGA ) , which as a labor union can only represent employees .
The WGA would also collect royalties on behalf of screenwriters .
Royalties were renamed “ residuals , ” since only “ authors ” collect royalties .
If this strikes you as a kludge , you ’re not alone .
It ’s graceless and awkward and weird .
It ’s completely unlike what happens in playwriting , even though playwriting and screenwriting are close cousins .
I ’ve described the process in terms of a screenwriter working on an original script by herself , but the same basic machinery applies to adaptations or television shows .
Staff writers sign contracts which perform similar legal judo , making their words the company ’s words .
In exchange for higher guaranteed payments ( “ minimums ” ) , residuals do n’t start accruing in a work ’s initial window ( theatrical release for a movie , first broadcast for a TV show ) , but rather down the line , especially when it comes out on home video .
That ’s what the current WGA strike is a largely about : the residual rate for home video , and especially work distributed through the internet .
You ’ll note that the studios are n’t talking about eliminating residuals altogether .
Even in one of their earlier proposals for “ profit - based residuals , ” they were acknowledging that writers are entitled to them .
Without some form of residuals , the charade of authorship - transference ceases to be mutually beneficial .
What ’s more , I suspect that the wiser members of the entertainment industry recognize what publishers have long understood : you want to keep a lot of writers on hand .
You never know which one is going to create the next Desperate Housewives .
Residuals are like the research and development fund for the industry .
Why you do n’t get residuals for old spreadsheets
Coming back to my friend Jeff , let ’s look at why that spreadsheet he made in 2003 does n’t earn him residuals .
When he created it for his boss , he was an employee of the company .
Copyright - wise , everything he did for them was a work - for - hire .
They owned it outright .
When a screenwriter writes a script , she ’s transferring this bundle of authorship rights to a corporation .
In exchange for these legal and creative rights , she gets paid an upfront fee and royalties ( called residuals ) .
Readers from the technology and medical fields might recognize an analogous situation with patents and intellectual property .
It ’s not uncommon for an inventor to get paid per unit for the right to use some proprietary innovation .
So it may help to think of screenplays as “ literary inventions , ” subject to a strange but industry - standardized procedure to protect both creators and corporations .
It ’s not pretty , but it gets the job done .
Why gaffers do n’t get residuals
While the process of making a movie begins with the screenwriter , it ultimately involves dozens — sometimes hundreds — of professionals , from grips to gaffers to art directors to truck drivers .
Most of the people working on a movie receive no residuals .
Is that fair ?
After all , these people work long hours , sometimes in very difficult conditions , and make a huge contribution to the finished film .
Why do n’t they get residuals ?
Because residuals are royalties paid to an author .
They ’re not a bonus .
They ’re a guaranteed payment to the writer in exchange for giving up copyright and authorship claims .
In the heated rhetoric surrounding the strike , both sides have made misleading claims about the economic status of writers in Hollywood .
The studios like to portray writers as greedy millionaires , while the WGA holds them up as middle - class victims of corporate fat - catting .
Neither is accurate .
Most writers are n’t millionaires — yet the Hollywood middle - class would be the envy of most of America .
The reductionism to “ the rich fighting the super - rich ” misses the real issue : the internet will replace television , and the industry needs to come to terms with what that entails .
The WGA strike will end with compromises over the residual rates .
The eventual IATSE strike will be about the definition of what a “ program made for the internet ” means , how much their members must be paid , and when overtime kicks in .
How to explain this to your buddy Brooks
The take - home lesson , in case you need to explain to a friend who blames “ greedy writers ” for why The Daily Show is in repeats :
Writers get royalties : for books , for songs , for literary works .
For legal reasons , studios want to be considered the “ author ” of a movie .
So screenwriters transfer “ authorship ” to the studios , in exchange for a bunch of rights , and residuals .
The studios and the WGA disagree about what rate is fair for work distributed over the internet .
Since internet distribution will eventually replace DVDs , a bad rate would result in a pay cut for writers .
That ’s why there ’s a strike .
Thanks for reading .
Feel free to pass it along , or Digg it .
The Yangtze river dolphin , until recently one of the most endangered species on the planet , has been declared officially extinct following an intensive survey of its natural habitat .
The freshwater marine mammal , which could grow to eight feet long and weigh up to a quarter of a tonne , is the first large vertebrate forced to extinction by human activity in 50 years , and only the fourth time an entire evolutionary line of mammals has vanished from the face of the Earth since the year 1500 .
Conservationists described the extinction as a " shocking tragedy " yesterday , caused not by active persecution but accidentally and carelessly through a combination of factors including unsustainable fishing and mass shipping .
In the 1950s , the Yangtze river and neighbouring watercourses had a population of thousands of freshwater dolphins , also known as Baiji , but their numbers have declined dramatically since China industrialised and transformed the Yangtze into a crowded artery of mass shipping , fishing and power generation .
A survey in 1999 estimated the population of river dolphins was close to just 13 animals .
Historically , the species had been revered and achieved nearly demi-god status among fishermen who recounted tales of dolphins being reincarnations of drowned princesses .
But in Mao's Great Leap Forward , the overthrowing of idols saw their protection lifted and they were hunted for food and their skin .
Sam Turvey , a conservation biologist at London Zoo , worked with Chinese government scientists to survey the entire 1,669 km stretch of the Yangtze river downstream of the giant Three Gorges Dam to Shanghai , a region which has been the natural habitat for river dolphins .
The team scoured the river four times in two boats during the six - week survey , using high - powered binoculars to spot the dolphins .
Sensitive hydrophones were towed behind to listen for their calls .
The researchers hoped that if any dolphins were spotted , they could be taken to a reserve in an oxbow lake which was once part of the Yangtze in the hope of boosting their numbers .
But at the end of the survey , they had neither seen nor heard any sign of the dolphins , according to their report in the journal Biology Letters .
" We passed through what were supposed to be Baiji hotspots and every day there was nothing .
The hopes of each person on the survey died at different points ; everyone had a moment of realisation that we were n't going to find anything , " said Dr Turvey .
Around half of all river dolphins were killed as a result of indiscriminate and often illegal fishing practices .
Though banned for the past 30 years , some ships still drag long lines of unbaited hooks .
" They just drift through the water snagging everything .
They slash and entangle and suffocate the dolphins , " said Dr Turvey .
Low employment in the 1980s and 1990s saw a rise in unskilled fishing .
Dr Turvey said conservation organisations had been quick to call for action to protect the river dolphin , but many were too cautious to take meaningful action .
" The loss of such a unique and charismatic species is a shocking tragedy .
The Yangtze river dolphin was a remarkable mammal that separated from all other species over 20 m years ago .
This extinction represents the disappearance of a complete branch of the evolutionary tree of life , " Dr Turvey added .

TheGardenLady received this question from Karen Meadows :
How do you layer over sod to make a garden bed ?
To make a garden where one has sod , you must remove all the sod just as you would have to remove any type of grass .
This can be back breaking work .
A slow , easier approach would be to layer over the area with several layers of black and white ( no color ) newspaper that you cover with a deep layer of mulch .
This approach can take up to a year to work .
Either way the directions for getting rid of sod are on this DIY website .
When you have finished this task – removing all roots and stones – take a sample of the soil ( as one would where ever one is making a garden ) and have the soil tested .
You can either buy your own soil testing kit or take the kit to your local Master Gardener office or your Agricultural Extension office where they will have it tested .
When the test results are in , follow directions for amending the soil for the type of garden you wish to make .
You should also always amend the soil with compost .

In my last post , I started talking about two sites that I 'm shutting down .
Today I 'm talking about the history RankTrend.com , and the lessons I learned .
RankTrend.com was an idea and a vision that I had while we were working on NaturalLinkExchange.com .
It was designed to help people who were trying to optimize their sites for search engines , but did n't really have any insight into what was actually working .
Here were the goals :
Track metrics about your site including your current rank in search engines , PageRank , AdSense income , advertising costs , visitors , etc .
This data would be tracked daily , or even more often depending on the type of data .
Track metrics using a client application the user installs so that the requests came from their computer and not our server .
Import any other metrics from other services such as AwStats .
Track events so that changes in the tracked metrics could possibly be attributed to those events .
Data - mining would allow us to transform the data into meaningful information using charts , statistical analysis reports , and correlation diagrams .
You could actually answer a question like " Which search engine can turn my advertising dollars into the most profit ? " .
Provide notifications when certain thresholds were met .
For example , I want to know when my PageRank changes , or when my site drops in the search engines .
We were successful in building a generic system that met most of the goals .
From the beginning , the system was set up to be extremely generic so that any type of data could be tracked and stored .
Here is a screenshot of the correlation diagram .
This is kind of an extreme example , but it shows which items were correlated with other items .
The wider the line , the stronger the correlation .
This is a neat report because of the algorithms it uses .
The standard correlation formula is used to determine the correlation coefficient .
For laying out the diagram , it uses a force based algorithm by simulating the edges being springs ( using Hooke 's law ) , and the nodes are electrically charged particles ( Coulomb's law ) .
It was very fun project .
Here is a screenshot of the main report .
As you can see , there are vertical lines that represent events ( in this case they were actually blog posts ) .
From this data , you 're able to see the effect of a blog post on your visitors and other metrics .
The wavy lines help stabilize the day to day changes in the data .
Here is a screenshot of the thumbnail dashboard .
This report provided a quick way to glance over every metric you were tracking for a site .
The background was color coded to the trend of the data .
If the data was improving , it would be a darker green based on the amount of improvement .
Red indicated that the value was getting worse .
The charts were actually using the Google charting API , which provided a great way to generate a lot of charts very quickly , and without increasing server load for us .
Once you got past the initial setup and started getting data , the service was admittedly very awesome .
Many of the features should be adopted by Google Analytics , and some already have been rolled out in their latest update .
The biggest problem is that Google does n't integrate the position of your keywords with the other data .
Lessons Learned
This is the important part , because it's all that remains from the site .
I learned an incredible amount while building this site , so I 'll share it with you .
The main reason we had another failed site ( depending on your definition of " failure " ) , was because we were not able to reach critical mass .
We simply did n't have an army of followers that we could use as our initial beta testers .
If you 're starting a new website , this should be your top concern !
The best site will go nowhere if nobody knows about it .
A simple UI usually means more code .
When designing how the user would configure their datasources , I designed it so that it made the most sense from a technical standpoint .
However , it did n't make sense from a user standpoint .
If I had to design it again , it would be much simpler to the user , but would take a lot more code .
Nobody said a good design was easy .

Simplicity wins .
The site had a competitor that only had a fraction of the features , and even had users pleading for new ones .
Even though we seemly filled the need , the users did n't come over in a mass exodus as expected .

Do n't do more than you need , focus on the core design .
The first iteration of the site had over a dozen options on the control panel for logged in users .
In hindsight , they must have been very confused .
This is part of keeping your UI simple , but it's also a matter of making the common parts easy to find , and the advanced features hidden .
The power users will usually find them .

Our site came out at a time when Google Analytics was still in beta .
Guess who you saw in the headlines ?
I 'm still frustrated to this day about some of the features Google Analytics is blatantly missing , but they have nothing to worry about .
When you 're giving away a " good enough " product for free , it takes a miracle to compete with that .
If we had been able to find a hidden niche , maybe we could have gotten the ball rolling , but that just was n't the case .
Conclusion
This was another fun project that I will never regret working on .
This was my first project using NHibernate , so it was a great learning experience .
It also gave me a chance to try out the Google charting API , as well as a third party charting control called ChartDirector .
This is a tough one to let go , but I want to make sure that I do a better job focusing my time instead of diluting it between many projects .

The secret powers of frogs are being exploited by scientists to create drugs that will correct disfiguring facial scars and could one day help in the regrowth of amputated arms and legs
The secret powers of frogs are being exploited by scientists to create drugs that will correct disfiguring facial scars and could one day help in the regrowth of amputated arms and legs .
Manchester University researchers are exploiting the ability of some amphibians to regrow limbs .
' Human and amphibian proteins are very similar , ' said one of the researchers , Professor Enrique Amaya .
' That means the lessons you learn from frogs and salamanders are applicable to humans .
Their embryos - spawn - are also easier to study . '
The Manchester work on tissue regeneration began 10 years ago , when Professor Mark Ferguson discovered most animals ' embryos recover more fully from cuts than adult animals .
The latter are often left scarred , but not embryos .
' The protein responsible for this recovery is known as Transforming Growth Factor Beta 3 , ' said Ferguson .
' It is present in small amounts in adults , but in large amounts in embryos , where it plays a key role in helping skin to multiply inside in a rapidly growing embryo . '
Ferguson 's team has since isolated the protein , TGF Beta 3 , and has developed ways to manufacture it artificially .
The result is a drug called Juvista .
Its development has been taken over by a university spin - off company , Renovo , which is now in phase two clinical trials .
Juvista could soon be used as a treatment for alleviating scarring during surgery , added Ferguson .
' After surgery for really severe accidents , patients can be left with disfiguring scars .
Using Juvista , which you inject into the skin during the operation , we 've found we can reduce scarring by a significant amount . '
Researchers at both centres are now working on ways to make further improvement in drugs to help scars heal after surgery .
' We are not doing this to help women who want to remove bags from under their eyes , ' said Amaya .
' We want to help people who suffered really nasty facial deformities after accidents . '
A key to this work is Manchester 's research on amphibians .
Spawn - usually from the genus Xenopus - is used to search for other biochemical agents that aid scar recovery .
In addition , some species of amphibians , mainly salamanders , are known to grow replacement limbs .
If the biochemical agents and growth factors involved in limb growth can be discovered , then it could have profoundly important medical implications , said Professor Cay Kielty .
' Limb regrowth involves blood , bone and muscle tissue growing in a very ordered manner .
If you can learn how that it happens in amphibians , you could think of replicating it in humans . '
Researchers envisage erecting bio- degradable scaffolding on a limb site , lacing these with a patient 's stem cells and then adding biochemical agents developed from their amphibian work .
The stem cells would evolve into blood , muscle and bone under the direction of these agents , while the scaffold disintegrates slowly - to form a new limb .
' It is encouraging , but it will take many years to realise , ' added Ferguson .
' However , we are close to getting medicines that will reduce scars in accident victims . '
In 1961 , Sam Jordan had just finished a six - year stint flying helicopters in the Marine Corps when he saw a want ad for an upstart airline called Air America .
“ They said they wanted pilots , ” he recalled .
“ They did n’t say anything about where the flying would be . ”
Within months , Jordan was flying helicopters in Laos , carrying medical equipment and other supplies to refugees in remote mountain villages .
In subsequent years , he flew airplanes along the Ho Chi Minh Trail , scanning for radio signals from the ground and dropping provisions from the sky .
He and other pilots developed code words for their cargo : “ Soft rice ” meant food and “ hard rice ” meant arms .

In 14 years working for Air America , Jordan was never formally told who was footing the bill for his often - harrowing flights .
But he and the other Air America pilots knew .
They called their mystery client “ the customer , ” Jordan said .
“ And the CIA was always the customer . ”
Few Americans know it , but Air America is embedded in some of the most iconic images of the Vietnam War .
In the famous photo of the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon , the helicopters lifting stranded diplomats off the rooftop belonged not to the military but to Air America .
The company was shut down after the fall of Saigon in 1975 , and the U.S. government subsequently acknowledged that Air America was a wholly owned subsidiary of the CIA .

But more than 30 years later , the government is still grappling with where that leaves Air America ’s former employees .
They worked for Air America , but does that mean they worked for the CIA ?
Jordan and hundreds of other Air America pilots , mechanics , executives and workers have spent the last two decades battling to win recognition as CIA employees -- or at least federal employees -- a designation that would entitle them to pensions and other benefits .
The CIA has fought the effort , arguing that Air America employees were hired to take part in important missions but were never officially brought into the agency .
The distinction is important to the agency , where contractors now outnumber the official workforce .
Officials fear that granting CIA status to Air America retirees would open the gates to thousands of similar claims .

Until recently , the Air America effort had seemed futile .
A lawsuit filed in the 1980s was tossed out , and efforts to enlist help from members of Congress never got off the ground .
But recent developments in Washington have given Air America workers new hope .
When Democrats won control of Congress in the fall , Sen. Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) became Senate majority leader .
Reid ’s state is home to some of the most vocal Air America retirees , and he has used his position to push legislation that would require the nation ’s top spy officials to take another look at the Air America case .
Though the legislation has yet to pass , the director of national intelligence -- a position created after the Sept. 11 attacks to oversee all 16 U.S. spy agencies -- has launched a review of whether Air America employees should win their claim and how much it would cost the government if they did .
A legendary role

It ’s hard to imagine that any other group of CIA contractors would get such consideration .
But Air America occupies a legendary position in the annals of U.S. espionage .
For nearly three decades , Air America and its CIA sibling , Civil Air Transport , served as the circulatory system for clandestine U.S. operations in Southeast Asia .
They moved supplies , weapons and spies across the treacherous terrain of China , Vietnam and Laos .
The CIA ’s air fleet was as large as those of major commercial airlines at the time .
At their peak in the mid-1960s , the CIA “ proprietaries ” employed more than 15,000 people -- most of them foreign nationals -- and operated about 200 planes .
Pilots often had to fly without navigation systems , elude enemy fire , and land on tiny airstrips cut into the sides of mountains .
At the same time , as part of its cover , the CIA operated a successful commercial airline , offering regular passenger service on flights to Bangkok , Tokyo and other destinations .

For 10 years , Air America supplied a secret army in Laos that pinned down tens of thousands of communist guerrillas who otherwise would have joined the fighting in Vietnam .
And by the time Air America was dismantled , more than 230 of its pilots and crew members had been killed .
A plaque honoring Air America hangs in the main corridor at CIA headquarters .
During the dedication ceremony , Jim Glerum , who had been one of the top CIA officers in Laos in the 1970s , gave a speech in which he got to the heart of the debate .
Air America crews “ were not CIA employees in the technical / legal sense of that word , ” said Glerum , who went on to serve as head of personnel at the agency .
“ Yet we routinely asked them to undertake missions that we could not conduct ourselves , and to accept hardship and hazards we have only rarely asked our own people to face . ”
Air America traces its origin to 1946 , when U.S. Army Gen. Claire Chennault signed a contract with the Chinese government to create a new airline .
When the communist revolution forced the nationalist government to flee to Taiwan , Chennault ’s airline became a key supply link to loyalist villages on the mainland .

It was the start of a clandestine anti-communist campaign spearheaded by the CIA that would carry on for the next quarter - century .
There are about 500 former Air America and Civil Air Transport employees living in the United States , ranging in age from the 50s into the 90s .
They keep in touch through a website , a newsletter and occasional reunions , including one in Dallas in October that drew about 40 former pilots and crew members .
For most of them , the effort to win CIA status is not a consuming cause .
After 20 years of trying , few expect to see any money .
And most acknowledge the tenuous nature of their claim .
They never had any official connection to the agency -- never signed an employment contract , never got sworn in at agency headquarters , never even got a government paycheck .
Nevertheless , those leading the effort point to government regulations dating to the 1930s that they say support their contention that working for a government - owned corporation makes you a federal employee .
They also consider it an issue of fairness , arguing that they deserve special consideration from Congress because of what they did for their country .

There is no reliable estimate of what it would cost the government to retroactively grant the former workers retirement benefits .
And expectations vary among those pressing the claim .
Jordan , 75 , figures he would stand to collect about $ 1,000 a month .
“ I do n’t think it would be very much , ” he said .
“ I ’m not going to jump off a cliff if I do n’t get it . ”
Hazardous duty
Others think their stakes are greater .

Roy Watts , 83 , who was one of the first Air America pilots , said he thought he would be entitled to as much as half a million dollars in back retirement and disability pay .
In 1954 , Watts took part in perhaps the most storied moment in Air America history , when he and two dozen other pilots made hundreds of desperate deliveries to French forces pinned down by North Vietnamese troops in Dien Bien Phu .
Despite 682 airdrops of artillery and other supplies , the communists crushed the French in a battle that marked the end of colonial rule .
Watts and six other surviving pilots were awarded the French Legion of Honor for their flights .
In a 1987 ruling , a federal appeals court said Watts had n’t met several basic requirements of being a federal employee :
He had never signed a contract with the government , was never given an oath of office , and therefore was never “ appointed ” to the civil service .
Advertisement
The CIA has relied on such rulings in its efforts to persuade lawmakers to drop their pursuit of Air America legislation .
But in some ways , it has been an awkward fight for the agency , which does n’t want to be seen as callous .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said the agency honored the pilots and crew members .
“ The courts , however , have ruled that they were not federal employees and thus are not eligible for federal retirement benefits , ” he said .
CIA officials also emphasize that Air America did not shortchange employees on the pay and benefits they were promised when they went to work for the company .
During Air America ’s heyday , the pay was n’t bad .
Pilots typically got $ 1,200 or more each month , tax free .
And if the benefits were n’t federal - government - caliber , the company did offer retirement accounts .
Most employees contributed a small percentage of their paychecks and cashed out when they quit .
Advertisement
By the early 1970s , the CIA ’s secret air empire was n’t so secret anymore .
Amid growing scrutiny from Congress and the media , CIA Director Richard Helms decided to shut it down .
As Saigon fell , Jordan and other pilots ferried as many planes as they could out of Vietnam .
The aircraft , airfields and other property were subsequently sold off , leaving $ 25 million for the CIA to return to the U.S. Treasury .
The pilots and other crew members were summoned to the company ’s offices in Hong Kong .

“ They gave us what we had coming and an airline ticket and that was it , that was the end , ” said Jordan , who is almost ambivalent about the prospect of getting a boost in retirement pay 30 years later .
“ It would be nice , of course , ” he said .
“ It would make my old age a little more comfortable .
But I ’ll survive . ”

Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel appeared on " Real Time " last night and had some tough words for the White House for " sending a military man to do a political job . "
Hagel also noted that the " Iraq war is biggest mistake in US history . "
Download Download
Maher :
Is n't a dirty trick on the American people when you send a military man out there to basically do a political sell - job ? "
Hagel :
It 's not only a dirty trick , but it 's dishonest , it 's hypocritical , it 's dangerous and irresponsible .
The fact is this is not Petraeus ' policy , it 's the Bush 's policy .
The military is -- certainly very clear in the Constitution -- is subservient to the elected public officials of this country .. but to put our military in a position that this administration has put them in is just wrong , and it 's dangerous . "
Hagel 's responses to Bill 's questions were perhaps his strongest condemnation of the White House and this war yet .
The truth is that President Bush had no choice but to make Petraeus the poster boy of The Surge ; after years and years of misleading this country , his credibility is at zero and he needs someone with a seemingly objective and non-partisan record to do the political dirty work of selling the surge continuing the occupation .
Absolutely shameful .
As Hagel makes perfectly clear , the Republican Party will pay dearly for it .
via Nonny Mouse in the UK :
BBC is remarking on how calm the public was during the ' car bomb ' attack on the Glasgow airport , how little panic or ' terror ' there was - mostly just people whipping out their mobile phone cameras and filming everything in sight .
Arrests made on the M6 motorway in Cheshire last night as well .
People got out of cars and offered to HELP the police .
Glasgow Airport is back up and running , passengers being interviewed coming off planes have said things are running smoothly , no problems .
A bit of a hassle walking around the cordoned off bits of the airport , but no one 's complaining .
Lots of smiling faces .
It 's almost psychology in reverse - the more fanatics try to terrorise the British , the more the British refuse to be terrorised .
We 're more worried about the goddamned rain at the moment .
The prime culprit for the plan , or lack of it , must be Donald Rumsfeld .
He thought the GIs could march up to Baghdad , kick out Saddam and the bad guys , leaving the good guys to take over , and Johnny to come marching home .
Rumsfeld simply lacked the intellectual vision and stamina , and covered this by a posture of cranky aggression .
Much the same might be said of Vice - President Dick Cheney , often seen as the eminence gris in this .
Take a look at a clip from 1994 riding high at YouTube , in which a younger Cheney explains why the US forces had not gone to Baghdad to topple Saddam in 1991 .
His reasons are a perfect catalogue of indictment for his subsequent policies : America would have had to act alone , causing more casualties , the Arabs would have opposed , Iraq might have broken up and divided , and this would encourage the neighbours - Saudi , Syrian , Turk and Iranian - to more mischief .
But it was n't just Don and Dick behind all this .
Proconsul Bremer , egged on by the felon Ahmed Chalabi , broke the machine beyond repair by disbanding the army , purging Ba'athists , and so wrecking the civil service .
Who was behind him ?
Bound by omerta , Douglas Feith , Paul Wolfowitz and Karl Rove all knew , but it was the other guy who decided .
In the end the responsibility lies with the man theoretically in charge , George Bush , who fell for the neocon fantasy of a new America to lead a new world in a new century .
For the British generals there are now a series of questions that they may be unwilling or unable to answer .
When did they realise all these terrible things about the malfunctioning senior ally ?
Did they mention it to the prime minister ?
If so , what was his response ?
According to the Alastair Campbell diary version of events , not much was discussed - Tony decided to go into Iraq with the Americans as far back as spring 2002 .
Gen Jackson and his fellow chiefs asked about the legality , and that was it .
As I recall , the service chiefs were keen to go in at the time , and did n't like it when some of us suggested that this was no Northern Ireland : it was no simple case of soft berets and cups of tea .
Today the risk is that Bush , egged on by militants like Fred Kagan , Jack Keane and John Bolton , will go ahead and seek to solve one , or even two , wars by starting another - via a tactical strike on revolutionary guard units in Iran .
Nothing allies , the UN or even Congress can do would stop them , because , in Bolton 's phrase about Gen Jackson , " they do not understand the full picture " .
And for picture , read vision , for the last group of irreducibles are revealing the millenarian side of the neocon movement - theirs is a higher vision of the finality of things than the rest of us .
Gens Jackson and Cross have done us a service by speaking out .
But they need to do more .
They need to set down for the record the full range of their criticisms , and where , when and how they developed .
For those now running the show , in fatigues or suits , they have to establish where today 's misshapen Anglo - American alliance has got us in Iraq , Iran and Afghanistan - and how we can restore the normal commerce of international affairs and diplomacy .
And it had better be very quick - before Cheney and co go kamikaze on Tehran .

I just turned Brad Garlinghouse ’s profile on Yahoo ’s new social network , Yahoo Mash , peanut butter brown .
The site , which began an invitation only preview Friday , is quite an homage to Facebook , but it adds one significant new wrinkle : users can edit each other ’s profiles , redecorating , changing information , and adding features .
Think the Wikipedia version of a social network .
Since the site gives you the option to undo each change made to your profile , Mr. Garlinghouse can decide he does n’t want everyone to associate him with peanut butter .
( Mr. Garlinghouse , a Yahoo senior vice president , wrote a widely discussed memo complaining that Yahoo ’s strategy was so broad and thin it was like spreading peanut butter on bread . )
If you do n’t like this game at all , you can change settings to allow just people marked as best friends or family to edit your profile , or you can keep the crayon box entirely to yourself .
Word of Mash leaked out earlier this week when a Yahoo employee invited my colleague Brad Stone to join before the trial was ready for the public .
The very first version of Mash ca n’t be accused of trying to do too many things at once .
It is focused on goofy self expression and social interplay .
The lead section is a series of fill - in - the - blank statements like “ If I were an animal , I would be , ” “ The soundtrack of my life ” and “ My celebrity look - a- likes . ”
There is also a little hand drawn figure that is modeled after a Tamagotchi or a Neopet :
You , and your visitors , feed it pet it and it changes its expression .
Users can pick and choose from a range of modules to add to their pages .
Some of the first ones , in fact are rather fun .
There is a little game where you can play paddle ball with an image of Karl Marx .
And the “ Wheel of Lunch ” is a nice use of Yahoo ’s local database : type in your ZIP code and the type of food you want , and it will display a sort of Wheel of Fortune with spaces for local restaurants .
Spin it to decide where to eat today .
Of course , Yahoo says it will allow outside developers to create modules soon , matching the hottest feature of Facebook .
Mash is trying very hard to be hip , particularly in its bountiful use of slang .
E-mail notifications of new friends start “ Woot . ” A link that turns off the color and background of a page reads , “ this is fugly . ”
And not only can you feed your pet , you can “ snorgle ” it .
For now , there are a lot of obvious features missing .
There is no way to send a private message to users .
There is no place to put useful information about yourself , such as where you went to school or where you work .
There is n’t much emphasis on video or music .
And the site is for now largely divorced from the rest of Yahoo .
The idea behind Yahoo ’s last attempt at social networking — Yahoo 360 — is that it pulled together everything users did on Yahoo : posting photos on Flickr , reviewing restaurants on Yahoo Local , bookmarking web sites on Del.icio.us , and so on .
That was n’t a bad idea , but the site was so utilitarian that no one used it .
Yahoo is trying ( very very hard ) to give Mash the irreverent feel of a Web 2.0 startup .
If this actually catches on , and people do want to keep changing each other ’s profiles , it will be easy to add more useful features later on .
[ If you have n’t been invited by a current Mash user , you ca n’t see the site at all .
But the blog by Will Aldrich , the head of the Mash team , is public . ]
Update : Brad Garlinghouse ’s profile is back to powder blue .
And he wrote this in my “ guestbook ” the Mash equivalent of the Facebook “ Wall ” :
@ Saul Hansell : hmmm , not so much on the brown ( not even close to the refined hue of Jif ! ) … but the proposed contribution appreciated none the less
I do wonder whether this game is akin inviting your friends to cover your room with graffiti .
A federal judge ordered the White House to preserve copies of all its e-mail messages , a move that Bush administration lawyers had argued strongly against .
The order , from Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. of Federal District Court , came in response to two lawsuits trying to determine whether the White House destroyed e-mail messages in violation of federal law .
Two private groups that filed suit , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive , say 5 million messages have disappeared .
Judge Kennedy ’s order is directed at maintaining backup tapes that contain copies of messages .
Abstract :
The KOM computer conferencing system was developed and used by a group of people at the Stockholm University Computing Center in Stockholm in the years 1976 - 1990 .
This paper , written by one of the people behind the KOM system , tells of how the system came to be developed and describes important occurences in the history of the system .
The first version of KOM was operating in 1977 , which means that KOM was one of the very first computer systems of the kind which is nowadays known as " social computing " .
In the middle of the 1970-s , Murray Turoff , inventor of the Emisari and Eies computer conferencing systems , came to Sweden and made some presentations of his ideas .
Palme and Tholerus listened to him , and were immediately caught by the ideas .
Another listener to Turoff was Tomas Ohlin .
A year later , Ohlin worked at the Swedish Board of Technical Development ( STU ) .
He used STU funds to finance a number of experiments with use of computer to aid ordinary people .
One of the projects which he financed was to obtain a copy of the Planet - Forum computer conferencing system , which was installed at the Stockholm University Computing Center , QZ .
Tholerus modified the program to use Swedish - language commands .
In the beginning of the 1970-s , several researchers connected to the Datalogy laboratory at Uppsala University discussed the fact that computers mainly , at that time , were used as large systems used by large organizations to control people .
Would it not be possible to design computer systems to aid ordinary people , to let them control the use of the computers instead of using computers to control ordinary people .
This is how Kiev subway looks these days .
The level of water sometimes reaches thighs , but it does n’t cause the stations to be closed .

It is a tradition now to change the build - system from lighttpd on each major release
For now we have the autotools as the user - visible build - system and scons as the system for the developers .
Currently we are testing cmake as a replacement for the scons part .
Build Systems
Before you can build a C - program you first have to find out which functions the system you compile on supports .
Not only that UNIX has various flavours , no , there is also Windows .
The natural way on UNIX is using autotools ( autoconf , automake , … ) which creates a shell script ( configure ) which generates the Makefiles which are process by make to build the application .
Using automake reduced the pain of autoconf when it was released , but it none the less is still enough pain to look for something else .
Not to forget that win32 and shell - scripts are n’t real friends .
scons
SCons going another route .
It replaces make and the autotools by a python based build - system .
You can do everything with just a few lines of python code .
Very neat .
The bad side : its development is more or less sleeping .
The unstable 0.96.9 x branch which fixes various nasty bugs is unstable since 2004 - 08 - 22 , the release of 0.96.1 .
cmake
cmake is more relaxed and does n’t want to solve the whole problem .
It does the configure checks and leaves the building to the native build - system .
On Unix it is either make or kdevelop3 , on MacOSX it is XCode and on windows it is nmake .
As extra cmake supports basic packaging and has very nice integration with test - tools like Dart .
Cross-Compiling
As a proof - of - concept I ’ve added cmake support to trunk used the openwrt SDK to build lighttpd with openwrt .
$ cmake .
$ rm CMakeCache.txt $ OPENWRT =.../ OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-x86_64-1/staging_dir_mipsel / \ CC=$OPENWRT/bin/mipsel-linux-gcc \ LD=$OPENWRT/bin/mipsel-linux-uclibc-ld make
Command Line Options
$ cmake - L . ...
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH= ... WITH_BZIP : BOOL=OFF WITH_MYSQL : BOOL=OFF WITH_OPENSSL : BOOL=OFF
WITH_PCRE : BOOL=ON WITH_SQLITE3:BOOL=OFF
WITH_WEBPAV_PROPS :BOOL=OFF
WITH_XATTR : BOOL=OFF WITH_ZLIB : BOOL=ON $ cmake -DWITH_BZIP : BOOL=ON \ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/jan/l-1.5.0-cmake/
Static Linking
To make it easier for embedded systems which do n’t have support for dlopen ( )
I added the option :
$ cmake -DBUILD_STATIC :BOOL=ON .
It will build all the modules as static libraries which are linked into the server at build - time .
server . modules is used to initialized the modules as before .

Bush made a surprise visit to Al - Anbar Province on Monday , as part of his propaganda drive to get Americans to think we should stay in Iraq because “ progress ” is being made .
The debate over al - Anbar province is driven by the Bushies ’ desire to find any ‘ good news ’ to grasp at .
Indeed , from 2003 forward , their criterion for objective reporting on Iraq was that it gave the ‘ good news . ’
When there obviously was n’t any good news , they started ignoring Iraq , as at Fox [ Republican TV ] Cable News .
Now the ‘ good news ’ appears ( I swear to God ) to be that you can “ walk ” in Iraq .
That ’s the good news .
The 7 billion people in the world walk every day , in most of the world ’s locales .
Now it is an achievement to walk .
That ’s good news of the highest order .
Only , if you are American in Fallujah you might need a company of Marines with you so that you can . . . walk .
( See below ) .
Is al - Anbar Province really paradise , as Bush suggested ?
Al - Anbar residents killed 20 US troops in July .
The total US fatalities in July were 79 according to icasualties.org , and some of those were presumably from accidents , etc .
So al - Anbar , despite being reduced to the stone age , managed to kill a fourth or more of all US troops killed in combat in July .
Al - Anbar is roughly 1/24 of Iraq by population .
So it killed six times more US troops than we would have expected based on its proportion of the Iraqi population .
That ’s what the Bushies are celebrating , that the deadly al - Anbar has been wrestled down to only killing a fourth of the US troops killed in a month .
It used to be more .
In mid-July , There were about 100 violent attacks in a single week in al - Anbar .
That ’s a bright spot .
That ’s progress .
Since the year before , there were 400 violent attacks in that same period .
Well , yes , that ’s a relative improvement .
But a hundred violent attacks in a week ?
That ’s being touted as good news to be ecstatic over ?
There were probably on the order of 1100 attacks that week in all of Iraq .
So al - Anbar generated nearly one - tenth of all attacks .
But it is only 1 /24 of Iraq by population , so it is more than twice as dangerous with regard to the number of attacks than you would expect from its small population .
Fallujah , of course , was a trouble spot for the US military .
I entertain dark suspicions that Bush had it destroyed for reasons of revenge .
The November 2004 US assault damaged 2/3s of the buildings .
Tens of thousands of former residents are still refugees .
One of the ways “ calm ” has been produced in the city is to simply forbid vehicular traffic .
Since May , if you wanted to get somewhere in Fallujah , you have had to walk .
So when the National Review tells us things are suddenly miraculously “ calm ” in al - Anbar , this is being produced artificially .
Things would be calm in most hot spots if you could ban all forms of locomotion save walking .
The problem with producing calm by banning traffic is that it leaves you with a Somalia level of economic activity .
IPS notes ,
‘ Residents say unemployment is above 80 percent .
Most of the rest who have some work are government employees .
The huge industrial area has been closed by U.S. and Iraqi Army units ‘
80 percent unemployment ?
Now that is calm .
“ Calm ” has also been produced by death squad activity .
IPS notes ,
‘ Hundreds of suspected resistance fighters are now held at the Fallujah police station .
Many have been killed on the streets ; the police speak of finding “ unidentified bodies ” .
Several of those found dead had been arrested earlier , eyewitnesses and families of several of the men killed have said . ’
So obviously if you round up a lot of young men and hold them without charge , and if you wipe out some others , “ calm ” is produced .
Another way of producing “ calm ” is to silence local journalists .
Some have been arbitrarily arrested and then let go , with instructions to report the news as the Iraqi police tell them to .
So we do n’t really know much about what is actually happening in Fallujah .
IPS quotes a local Sunni cleric :
‘ “ To say Fallujah is quiet is true , and you can see it in the city streets , ” said Shiek Salim from the Fallujah Scholars ’ Council .
“ The city is practically dead , and the dead are quiet . ’
So , all these measures – banning traffic , rounding up young men , silencing the journalists , etc. – have at least ended the attacks on US troops , right ?
Wrong .
It was only last week ; I mean , August 28 was not that long ago , but this one is already forgotten :
“ BAGHDAD — A suicide bomber detonated a vest packed with explosives in a Sunni Arab mosque in Fallujah yesterday , killing 10 worshipers , including the imam , and shattering what had been a period of relative calm for a region once the most volatile hotbed of Iraq ’s insurgency . ”
Now , if ten worshippers were killed in a church just last week in a small US city of 200,000 , would Congressmen be flocking there to proclaim how wonderful the security situation was ?
Just a month before , a bomber killed two policemen in Fallujah and wounded 11 others .
On July 23 , a female suicide bomber killed 7 policemen at a checkpoint in downtown Ramadi .
On July 8 , a truck bomb killed 23 persons at a police recruiting center in Haswa , al - Anbar province .
On Monday there was this in Ramadi :
‘ A suicide car bomb attacked an Iraqi security checkpoint on highway near the city of Ramadi in the western province of Anbar on Monday , killing two security members and wounding three others , a provincial police source said . ‘
Think Progress noticed this exchange between CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer and starry - eyed returnee from Fallujah , Rep. Charles Boustany ( R- LA ) .
“ BOUSTANY : We ’re clearly seeing some major improvements .
Clearly in the Anbar Province , we ’ve seen significant improvement .
We were able to walk the streets of Fallujah .
Sectarian deaths are down . [… ]
BLITZER : And Congressman Boustany , you say that the number of casualties is going down .
But we took a closer look — and The Los Angeles Times did as well — citing Iraqi Health Ministry numbers .
In June , it was 1,227 civilian deaths in Iraq .
In July , it went up to 1,753 civilian deaths in Iraq .
And in August , the month that just ended , 1,773 civilian deaths in Iraq .
Those numbers are going in the wrong direction .
BOUSTANY : Well , I think what I mentioned earlier , Wolf , was the number of attacks .
And , clearly , we have to look at all the metrics very carefully .
BLITZER : But statistics — you can play a lot of room with statistics .
In terms of dead people , civilians , Iraqi dead people , those numbers are high and they ’re getting worse , despite the increased military troop levels of the United States , the so - called surge having been in effect over the past couple of months .
BOUSTANY : Well , Wolf , I want to point out that just two or three months ago , I would have never thought that four members of Congress would be able to walk through the streets of Fallujah .
That ’s a major …
BLITZER : But you had a lot of security with you .
You had a lot of U.S. military protection .
BOUSTANY : We had a platoon of Marines .
BLITZER : Yes , well , a platoon of Marines is a lot of Marines to walk through Fallujah . . .
Good for Wolf !
As for Bush , he knows that good news would be the Sunni Arabs in al - Anbar gladly signing on to the al - Maliki government .
( CNN ) --
Shuffling through airport security in your socks or sitting in traffic may seem like a breeze compared with the stresses of settling in under the same roof with family .
You got through the airport gauntlet and you 're home for the holidays .
Now you have to face your family .
Tensions often run high during the holidays , but there are polite and effective ways to manage those tricky interactions .
Be assertive
Your mother expects you home for Thanksgiving and your in - laws are demanding an audience with their grandchildren .
You can't please everyone , so decide how you 're going to spend the holidays and stick to that plan .
" Sometimes it 's really about being assertive and saying , ' you know what , Tom and I are going to spend Christmas with Tom 's parents and Thanksgiving with my parents , and that 's what we 're going to do , ' " said Lizzie Post , author of " How Do You Work This Life Thing ? " and the great - great - granddaughter of etiquette expert Emily Post .
Talk about your arrangements before the visit and make the necessary preparations .
You might feel that your energetic kids will drive the rest of the extended family crazy .
Discuss it with them and be honest about your preferences .
" Do n't put it off on them by saying , ' I know the kids would bother you . '
Your host will decide whether the kids will bother her or not , " Post said .
You might decide to stay in a hotel .
If that 's the best option for you , make clear that the decision is n't based on not wanting to spend time with the family , said Dr. Nadine Kaslow , a professor in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Emory University School of Medicine .
" Sometimes you think people will be offended , and they 're actually relieved , " Kaslow added .
Be realistic , but optimistic
Do n't go into the visit assuming you 'll need a stiff drink to survive .
If you think that way , you will , Post said .
" Go in with the attitude , ' I 'm going to spend four days , a week , a weekend with my family , and I 'm really excited about it . "
Think positively , but do n't get carried away and expect everything to be perfect .
" Be realistic about what may or may not happen , " Kaslow said .
Tangled family issues are n't going to disappear for the holidays , so you want to be prepared to defuse them delicately .
Short visits are better in cases where you expect to be in close quarters with someone who nags or criticizes you .
You can ignore the criticism or try to positively counteract it .
" Sometimes the best thing to do is to turn around and praise the person who is critical , " Kaslow said .
If you 're having a hard time , plan to call a friend or go out for a walk with someone you feel comfortable with .
And if a situation is really making you uncomfortable , talk to the parties involved about how it makes you feel .
" You can stand up for yourself , and there 's a right way to do it , " Post said .

After being snubbed for some fifteen minutes in tonight 's Democratic Presidential Debate , Rep. Dennis Kucinch breaks his MSNBC - imposed silence by railing on the Bush administration 's war rhetoric on Iran .
Kucinich not only called for Democrats to reject any movement toward war with Iran , he went on to call for the impeachment of President Bush .
If the media was looking for a candidate to set themselves apart from the " front runners , " Kucinich did just that .
Kucinich : " Tim , we 're here in Philadelphia , the birthplace of democracy .
I want to know when this Democratic Congress is going to stand up for the Constitution and hold the president accountable with Article 2 , Section 4 an impeachment act .
I think that our democracy is in peril and unless the Democrats and the Congress stand up for the Constitution , we are going to lose our country . "
Now THAT'S what I 'm talkin ' about !
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
An energy company 's greedy quest for politically correct power is putting a world celebrity heritage site at risk of being lost forever .
A subsidiary of Conergy ( 604002 ) , a German renewable energy firm , has announced plans to construct an enormous wind farm in the Australian outback .
See related story .
The proposed location , the Mundi Mundi plains in New South Wales , was the backdrop for parts of " Mad Max II , " one of the films that launched Mel Gibson 's career .
Conergy wants to put up 500 wind turbines to harvest the energy generated by the incessant winds that blow through the area .
The argument in favor is that the wind farm will cut Australia 's greenhouse gas emissions by millions of tons a year , thus saving the world from the ravages of global warming .
But at what price to Australia 's cultural heritage ?
The setting helped put Australian actors on the map , created an entire genre of post - apocalyptic films , and introduced the world to a series of unforgettable characters including the Feral kid -- a precocious youth with a penchant for throwing a boomerang with razor sharp edges .
The mayhem of that child will be as nothing compared with what happens if one of those wind turbine blades lets fly !
Of course the desolation of the area is part of its attraction as a location for an operation that will supposedly power 400,000 homes .
Low population density is cited as one of the chief benefits of putting the turbines in the region .
But instead of low population density , Conergy should reconsider and put its wind farm someplace where there 's no population density , you know , some place like Nantucket Sound .
Because , as Tina Turner might have sung " We do n't need another wind farm . "

Clients paid the private detectives to intercept phone calls and e-mails
Ex -Met officers Jeremy Young and Scott Gelsthorpe even tried to hack into the New York Stock Exchange .
They received 27 months and two years respectively .
Three former Staffordshire officers were jailed for unlawfully accessing the police national computer .
John Matthews was jailed for 14 months , Anthony Wood received 10 months , and Gary Flanagan got a three - month term .
Matthews , 59 , from Stafford , used his position as a serving detective sergeant to run unauthorised checks on vehicles and individuals using the police national computer ( PNC ) .
He passed the data to his former police colleagues Flanagan , 43 , and 63 - year - old Wood , who ran private detective agency Brian Harrison Investigations in Stoke - on - Trent .
Flanagan , of Newcastle - under - Lyme , was a former detective constable who resigned in 1989 , and Wood , also from Stafford , was an ex-detective sergeant with more than 30 years ' experience .
POLICE CONNECTIONS
Jeremy Young , 43 - ex-Met Police constable Scott Gelsthorpe , 32 - ex-Met Police officer John Matthews , 59 - ex-Staffs detective sergeant Gary Flanagan , 43 - ex-Staffs detective constable Anthony Wood , 64 - ex-Staffs detective sergeant
At Southwark Crown Court , judge Paul Dogson said : " One of the distressing aspects of this case is that the good work that is done by the vast majority of the police officers in this country is damaged , I hope not severely but certainly damaged , by the misconduct of those of you acting police officers who abuse the system and those retired officers who go along with it . "
It was " that abuse of trust that so many could do but so few take " , that made him consider the offences so seriously , the judge added .
Another man , Gordon Bucher , 53 , from Hereford , was jailed for two months for aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office .
He ran another detective agency Phoenix Investigations and also unlawfully gained access to material from the PNC .
A seventh man David Carroll , 59 , from Highgate , north London , had his sentencing adjourned due to ill health .
He was earlier convicted of playing a role in the running of Young and Gelsthorpe 's company Active Investigation Services ( AIS ) .
All of the men were convicted as part of Operation Barbatus , carried out by the Met Police 's anti-corruption team .
Share prices
Gelsthorpe , 32 , of Kettering , Northants , and Young , 40 , of Ilford , east London , ran AIS - dubbed " Hackers Are Us " - for five years from 1999 - at a time when Young was still a serving police constable with the Metropolitan Police .
For much of that time , he was on sick leave from his job .
It 's clear these dishonest private investigators have a pool of illegal services they can call upon when they need them
Det Insp Kevin Hyland
AIS was paid substantial sums to investigate cheating spouses and business rivals .
Some of the work they did themselves and other aspects were contracted out .
One such " contractor " was a computer hacker based in Arizona , Marc Caron , who used viruses to gain access to people 's e-mail accounts .
One of Caron 's victims was Tamara Mellon , millionaire creator of the Jimmy Choo shoe empire .
But Caron and AIS set their sights even higher .
They tried to hack into computers at the New York Stock Exchange , hoping to get share prices 20 minutes before they were released .
Police still have not discovered who was paying them to attempt it .
Another high - profile client was waste disposal firm Atlantic Waste .
Boss Adrian Kirby paid AIS to snoop on staff at the Environment Agency investigating the company 's dumping tactics .
Miranda Moore QC said this was " the most serious and the most sustained attack " carried out by AIS .
Disabled permits
Police say AIS may have made millions from their illegal activities , but exactly how much is still being investigated .
They showed flashes of living luxuriously - Young , for example , had a birthday party for a dozen people at the Park Lane Hilton and Carroll drove a £ 100,000 Bentley .
Yet at the same time , rather than pay for parking at their expensive City of London offices , they all had forged disabled permits .
Det Insp Kevin Hyland , who led Operation Barbatus , said he was sure there were other private detectives doing the same thing .
" It 's clear these dishonest private investigators have a pool of illegal services they can call upon when they need them , " he added .

At Congo ’s independence in 1960 , Mircea Eliade , the expert on myths and religion , had this anecdote to comment about the way Congolese people lived the event , or rather turned it into a cargo cult , in the opening pages of his book “ Myth and Reality ” : “ In some villages the inhabitants tore the roofs off their huts to give passage to the gold coins that their ancestors were to rain down .
Everything was allowed to go to rack and ruin except the roads to the cemetery , by which the ancestors would make their way to the village .
Even the orgiastic excesses had a meaning , for , according to the myth , from the dawn of the New Age all women would belong to all men . ”
He then went on to add : “ We may suppose that “ mythical behavior ” will disappear as a result of the former colonies ’ acquiring political independence . ”
Eliade could n’t have been more wrong .
With political independence now in its 47th year , a far more nefarious myth has now bugged the soul of the Congolese nation :
The Holy Bible and the vicious fundamentalists totting it everywhere , even in market places and in packed and stifling “ taxis - buses . ”
After more than fifteen years of absence from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) , my homeland , I started going back there on a regular basis in 2003 , and even living in the capital city of Kinshasa for half of the year since then .
This experience was not so much a narrative of non-return than a cultural turbulence of reentry .
For instance , during the Congolese presidential electoral campaign in July 2006 , watching television one night , I was mystified to watch and hear a pastor who was being interviewed exclaim : “ This is a special country and a special people : God had prophesied on this land and its people !
Politicians better watch out . ”
Asking people around me what he meant by that admonition , they advised with condescension that I read Isaiah 18 .
And I , for one , was among those who used to claim : “ No one reads anymore in the Congo . ” I meant by this aphorism that the practice and performance of literature as experienced in the West has all but disappeared in the country .
But I was discovering that night that I needed to amend that aphorism as follows : “ The one book being read and misread in the Congo is The Holy Bible . ”
Consider this other instance :
On another one of my stays in Kinshasa , a cousin of mine , who had just converted to an evangelical sect , suddenly turned vegetarian .
As I was jokingly warning him against the danger of such a radical dietary change in a city where daily protein intake was far from granted and the very act of getting food amounted to foraging , he told me to look up Genesis 6:19 - 21 .
I did look up this passage with him :
Noah is being briefed by God who has “ determined to make an end of all flesh ” prior to his boarding of the ark :
Noah is told to bring into the ark “ every living thing of all flesh ” “ two of every sort , ” all the biodiversity on earth if that , but God adds in the last verse of this passage : “ Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten , and store it up ; and it shall serve as food for you and for them [ living things ] . ”
According to my cousin , this verse clearly shows that God meant us to be vegetarian , for , why would He tell us to take all the “ food that is eaten ” beside “ every living thing of all flesh ” ?
My cousin ’s close reading also points to the nature of The Holy Bible as an amulet in the DRC : every single passage in the Good Book , even a comma , or for that matter the actual physical printed book one carries to Sunday service , is worth its weight in gold .
All this galore could have been great materials for comic relief had it not also parasitized the political arena !
In February 2006 , after years of dictatorship and more years of the bloodiest war in Africa dubbed “ Africa World War , ” a new constitution was enacted , following the referendum that took place in December 2005 .
In the run-up to that constitutional referendum , some politicians of the opposition , especially the maverick pastors Théodore Ngoy and Gabriël Mokia , known nationwide as the country ’s most prolific “ injurologues ” ( French neologism for “ heapers of insults ” ) , who were campaigning against the new constitution , claimed that a comma in the first sentence of the first paragraph of its Article 40 was a clear opening to gay marriage — an abomination , according to them .
That paragraph states : “ One has the right to get married with the person of one ’s choice , of the opposite gender , and to set up family . ”
Now , these opponents of the constitution contended , why would the legislators put a comma between “ choice ” and “ opposite gender ” if they did n’t intend to have gays wedge into official marriage through that gaping opening while leaving the subsequent fragments of the sentence unscathed ?
Or , as Reverend Ngoy put it in one of his televised interventions , that comma is the devil ’s own highway into the soul of the Congo .
Freedom of the press is so misconstrued in the Congo that even the wackiest of fundamentalist preachers are given air time on television and , if they happen to have enough money ( which they often do ) , they ’re allowed to launch their own radio and television stations .
In the presidential electoral campaign , both the opposition parties and the incumbent ’s political party used and misused this medium , trading biblical prophecies and counter - prophecies back and forth .
On August 17 , 2006 , as the country was awaiting the publication of the results of the first turn of the presidential elections , the “ communications ” people of Jean - Pierre Bemba , the most formidable contender to the incumbent president Joseph Kabila , produced a narrative of the country on their party - owned television network “ Canal Congo TV ” ( CCTV ) .
They brought on the set this young “ prophet ” who “ had a dream ” on the outcome of the elections .
Strangely , the text of the Congolese prophet was the very text of the dream of another prophet : Daniel ( 2:31 - 45 ) .
“ Show me the dream and its interpretation ” ( 6 ) were the threatening words Nebuchadnezzar had thrown at the “ magicians , ” “ enchanters , ” and “ sorcerers ” of Babylon who were put to the ordeal of finding out not only the king ’s disturbing dream but its interpretation as well .
The biblical narrative goes on to say that “ the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night ” by God ( 19 ) , thus saving those “ wise men ” from destruction by unveiling Nebuchadnezzar ’s dream and its interpretation to Daniel as the narrative of the Babylonian kingdom : the famous messianic “ Dream of the Golden Image . ”
Duplicating Daniel ’s process , the Congolese television prophet likewise had a nightly vision too , in which God allowed him to crack open the unfolding mystery of Congo ’s future .
According to the Congolese television prophet , Nebuchadnezzar ’s dream as pertaining to the Congolese situation was to be interpreted as a narrative in six installments :
1 . The “ head of [ the ] image ” in “ fine gold ” represents the Belgian colonial regime , as gold is associated with a monarch ’s crown ;
2 . The “ breast and arms of silver ” represented the administration of Congo ’s first president Joseph Kasavubu ;
3. Mobutu ’s brutal regime was the image ’s “ belly and thighs of bronze ” ;

He would walk north two miles , pausing in the bay of a deserted fire station in Greenwich Village to call a television station and urge calm .
Three hours later he stepped into a press conference with Gov. George E. Pataki .
“ Today is obviously one of the most difficult days in the history of the city , ” he said softly .
“ The tragedy that we are undergoing right now is something that we ’ve had nightmares about .
My heart goes out to all the innocent victims of this horrible and vicious act of terrorism .
And our focus now has to be to save as many lives as possible . ”
Inevitably the question arose : How many lost ?
The mayor looked up through his glasses , aware that among the viewers of this live broadcast were the mothers , fathers , spouses , lovers and children of those who labored in the smashed towers .
“ The number of casualties , ” he said , “ will be more than any of us can bear ultimately . ”
That walk north , the spareness of his words and his passion became the founding stones in the reconstruction of the mayor ’s reputation , transforming him from a grouchy pol slip - sliding into irrelevancy to the Republican presidential candidate introduced as America ’s mayor .
The former mayor has made this day the centerpiece of his presidential campaign , aware that millions of Americans hold that heroic view in their collective mind ’s eye .
Political leadership is an uncertain alchemy , an admixture of the symbolic and substantive and the visceral .
In times of consuming trauma , psychologists and historians say , a leader must speak with a trusted voice and sketch honestly the painful steps to safety .
A leader must weave a narrative of shared loss while acknowledging consuming anger .

Joe Biden recently sat down with Newsweek to discuss his presidential campaign and his thoughts on 35 years in the Senate .
When asked about impeachment , Biden said he ’s against the idea because impeachment proceedings would paralyze Congress and take the nation ’s focus off other , more important matters .
But he has a pretty stunning Plan B .
The alternative , and it ’s taken me time to think through , I think we should be acquiring and accumulating all the data that is appropriate for possibly bringing criminal charges against members of this administration at a later date .
Somebody call Elizabeth de la Vega !
She ’s already made the case .
Oh , and you can put to rest those rumors that Biden , who is chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and one of Washington ’s most informed foreign policy experts , is campaigning in order to be named Secretary of State .
I promise you , I do n’t want to be secretary of State .
Clear enough ?
He ’s also a longtime member of the Judiciary Committee , so maybe instead of running State , Biden can be in charge of those criminal prosecutions .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign said yesterday that it would give to charity $ 23,000 it had received from a prominent Democratic donor , and review thousands of dollars more that he had raised , after learning that the authorities in California had a warrant for his arrest stemming from a 1991 fraud case .
The donor , Norman Hsu , has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Democratic candidates since 2003 , and was slated to be co-host next month for a Clinton gala featuring the entertainer Quincy Jones .
The event would not have been unusual for Mr. Hsu , a businessman from Hong Kong who moves in circles of power and influence , serving on the board of a university in New York and helping to bankroll Democratic campaigns .
But what was not widely known was that Mr. Hsu , who is in the apparel business in New York , has been considered a fugitive since he failed to show up in a San Mateo County courtroom about 15 years ago to be sentenced for his role in a scheme to defraud investors , according to the California attorney general ’s office .
Several vessels have run aground during the storm
Enlarge Image
Russian officials say four ships have sunk , including an oil tanker , and four others could break up .
The bodies of three sailors have been found .
Up to 2,000 metric tons of fuel oil have leaked from the tanker in the Kerch Strait , which links the two seas .
A big clean - up operation is under way , amid fears of an environmental disaster in the region .
At least two other ships were carrying potentially hazardous cargos when they sank , including nearly 6,000 tons of sulphur .
A new storm warning in the region was issued again on Monday .
Investigation
The Russian oil tanker Volganeft - 139 came apart after it was smashed by 108 km/h ( 67 mph ) winds and 5 m ( 16ft ) waves in the narrow Kerch Strait between Russia and Ukraine .
Russian TV showed pictures of other stricken boats
Leaking tanker
The tanker 's 13 crew were rescued after several hours .
So far , 35 sailors from the sunk vessels have been plucked to safety .
The bodies of three sailors from the stricken ships were found on Monday morning , but five others are still missing , Russian officials say .
Some 300 km ( 187 miles ) to the south - west , rescue teams are continuing their search for another 15 sailors missing after a a scrap metal ship went down near the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol .
A second oil tanker in the region is being monitored closely because its hull has developed cracks .
Yet more ships have run aground or slipped anchor and are drifting at the mercy of the storm .
Russian prosecutors say they are investigating whether the ships ' captains ignored warnings of the approaching storm .
' Sinking to seabed '
The Volganeft - 139 was at anchor when its stern tore apart in Ukrainian waters on the busy waterway dividing that country and Russia , officials said .
A regional prosecutor told local media the tanker was designed in the Soviet era to transport oil on rivers and was not meant to withstand heavy storms .
Russian environmentalist Vladimir Slivyak said the tanker accident was a " very serious environmental disaster " .
The heavy oil was sinking to the seabed and could take years to clean up , he said .
But the oil spill is small by comparison with the Prestige disaster off Spain five years ago .
Severe habitat damage was caused to beaches in Spain , France and Portugal when a tanker leaked 64,000 tons of fuel oil in November 2002 .

Si on vous demandait en 3 mois à quoi vous faisait pensez Meetic , vous diriez quoi ?
Et bien , sur le forum de psychologies .com lorsqu'une étudiante en psychologie demande aux internautes de définir en 3 mots ce qu'ils pensent de Meetic , ca fait peur ...
Olivetom :
Je dirai : légèreté , baisodrome , marchandise .
Légèreté pour la façon dont les gens vous traitent , vous balancent , vont droit au but , n'ont la plupart du temps rien à raconter d'autre que " tu cherches quoi ? " .
Baisodrome car c'est un immense bordel tout simplement , les marié ( e ) s y trompent leur conjoint(e ) , les adeptes de la sodomie et de l'épilation intégrale , qui n'osent pas ou n'accèdent pas dans leurs demandes auprès de leur compagne se retrouvent là en quête de satisfaction de base .
L'amour est plus difficile à trouver que le coup de quéquette lol mais quand on est sentimental (e ) on a du mal avec toute cette trivialité .
Marchandise , ça va assez avec légèreté .
C'est " je te parle " " je te jette " , " bisous " à tout va et puis sans crier gare même pas de ciao , pschitt envolé le keum ( ou la fille c certainement la même chose ) .

For many people going to college , they ’re scared to get involved with a major that wo n’t pay a lot .
I know I was – after strongly considering stints as both an English major and a math major , I instead got into a major with significantly higher earning potential because I did n’t want to face huge student loans with an $ 18 K job right after finishing my studies .
Interestingly , Congress addressed this very issue with the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 ; here ’s Anya Kamenetz ’s review of that very bill ( you may remember Anya as the author of Generation Debt , which I reviewed in detail a while back ) :
To my mind , the most significant student benefit in the bill is income - based repayment .
Under these proposed new rules , graduates whose earnings do n’t exceed 150 percent of the poverty line ( about $ 15,000 for a single person ) would be exempt from repaying student loans .
All borrowers could opt to repay no more than 15 percent of their income above that amount , known as “ discretionary income . ”
So if you earn $ 25,000 a year , you ’d be guaranteed to pay no more than $ 121 a month regardless of your total loan burden .
After 20 years , all remaining balances would be forgiven ( 10 years for eligible public servants ) .
This bill helps out students who are considering careers in social work and other humanities fields , but it falls just short of really helping people in another career that really need the help : teachers .
There are some teachers at the lower end of the pay scale that will benefit from this , but many teachers make just enough to be out of the higher end of this bill , unfortunately .
Let ’s use an example of a teacher making $ 33,000 a year , a reasonable number in this area .
If that person lives alone , their poverty line of income is $ 9,800 and thus 150 % of that is $ 14,700 .
That means that the teacher will have $ 18,300 of their salary that is eligible for student loan debt repayment , of which 15 % is required for student loans ( a total of $ 2,745 ) .
That means that under this bill , a teacher making $ 33,000 a year and living alone has his or her monthly student debt repayment capped at $ 228.75 .
This bill will likely help out some people in the first years of their career , and others will be helped over the entire length of their loan .
Given the balance needed between helping out low - paying professionals and also making student loans worthwhile for lending institutions and for the government , I think the bill hit a very nice spot .
The real take - home message here is that students majoring in fields that wo n’t provide a large income post - college are saved from the double whammy of large student loan payments and low salary , which for many students was enough to keep them out of a major that they may have been passionate about .
It certainly was for me , and I may have made a different choice had this law been in effect when I was a student .

“ FEAR ” , the lady used to say , “ is a habit . ”
This week , inspired in part by the lady herself , Aung San Suu Kyi , partly by the heroic example set by Buddhist monks , Myanmar 's people kicked the addiction .
Defying the corrupt , inept , brutal generals who rule them , they took to the streets in their hundreds of thousands to demand democracy .
They knew they were risking a bloody crackdown , like the one that put down a huge popular revolt in 1988 , killing 3,000 people or more .
In 1988 Burma 's people were betrayed not just by the ruthlessness of their rulers , but also by the squabbling and opportunism of the outside world , which failed to produce a co-ordinated response and let the murderous regime get away with it .
This time , soldiers are once again shooting and killing unarmed protesters ( see article ) .
Can the world avoid making the same mistake twice ?
In New York for the United Nations General Assembly , Western leaders , led by George Bush , harangued the junta , and threatened yet more sanctions .
They have probably already shot their bolt .
Western sanctions have been tried and have failed , in part because Myanmar 's neighbours have for years followed a different approach .
Its fellow members of the Association of South - East Asian Nations waffled about “ constructive engagement ” while making economic hay in Myanmar from the West 's withdrawal .
India , too , anxious about China 's growing influence , and hungry for oil and gas , has swallowed its democratic traditions and courted the generals .
Comrades - in-arms
China itself has built an ever - closer relationship .
The two countries , after all , have a lot in common beyond a shared border .
Since the 1980s a wave of “ people - power ” revolutions has swept aside tyrannies around the world .
Mercifully few regimes , and few armies , are willing to kill large numbers of their own people to stay in power .
Two big exceptions have been Myanmar and China , whose government in 1989 likewise stayed in power through a massacre .
Yet it is China that now offers the best hope the outside world has of changing Myanmar for the better .
Admittedly , it is a thin hope .
There are plenty of reasons to doubt China 's willingness to upset Myanmar 's generals .
China 's traditional posture , heard again this week , is to oppose any “ interference in the internal affairs of another country ” .
It trots out this formula so often when foreigners criticise its own behaviour that , even if it supports change , it is hard for it to utter more than platitudes , as it has this month , about the desirability of a “ democracy process that is appropriate for the country ” .
China has also been the chief beneficiary of the partial Western boycott .
Myanmar offers two of the prizes China values most in its foreign friends : hydrocarbon resources and a friendly army , willing to give it access to facilities on its coast on the Bay of Bengal .
China has become the junta 's biggest commercial partner and diplomatic supporter .
Nevertheless there are two reasons why China might now see its own interests as best served by assisting a peaceful transition in Myanmar .
The first is that China wants stability on its borders , and it is becoming obvious that the junta cannot provide it .
The generals ' economic mismanagement has helped reduce a country blessed with rich resources to crippling poverty .
Fleeing economic misery as much as political oppression , up to 2 m migrants from Myanmar are in Thailand .
And it was an economic grievance — a big , abrupt rise in fuel prices — that sparked the present unrest .
The junta has at least succeeded in cobbling together ceasefire agreements with most of the two dozen armed insurgencies lining its borders .
But the price has been lawless zones where banditry and illegal - drug production are rife .
Myanmar 's slice of the “ Golden Triangle ” on its Thai and Lao borders was for a while in the 1990s the world 's dominant heroin producer .
It has been largely priced out of that market by Afghan competition .
But it has successfully diversified into methamphetamines .
The business relies on precursor chemicals coming from China , but , just as heroin from Myanmar brought China addiction and , through shared needles , HIV and AIDS , so “ ice ” can wreak havoc .
Nobody expects any transition to democracy to be trouble - free .
But , Chinese leaders must be asking themselves , can it be any worse ?
Appealing to the Olympic spirit
China must also be wondering nervously how all this will affect next year 's Olympic games in Beijing .
Already , protests about China 's support for the government of Sudan , larded with comparisons to the 1936 Berlin Olympics , have shown that its foreign policy as well as its human - rights record at home is under scrutiny .
Myanmar is justifiably a popular cause in the West .
If China proves actively obstructive to international efforts to bring the junta to book , it may provoke calls for a boycott of the games .
It is of course wrong to assume that China can dictate to Myanmar .
In the generals ' deluded world - view , only they can preserve Myanmar 's independence .
They will take orders from no other country .
China 's role is crucial , nonetheless .
It must not blunt the impact of measures taken by other countries and provide the junta with a shield to fend off demands to do what it should .
That , at least , is easy to prescribe .
It should stop shooting protesters ; free all political prisoners , including Miss Suu Kyi ; scrap the constitutional guidelines drawn up by its farcical “ national convention ” ; and start serious talks with all groups , including Miss Suu Kyi and her party .
The aim of those talks should also be clear : to arrange a transition to civilian , democratic rule .
For their part , provided free and fair new elections are held , Miss Suu Kyi and her party should not insist on the results of the election they won in a landslide in 1990 being honoured .
And , unpalatable as it is , they should offer the generals whatever incentive they need to go quietly .
This all sounds a pipedream .
It will certainly remain so if the outside world does not unite around a set of demands , and agree on the sticks and carrots that might make deaf old soldiers listen .

Curb Your Enthusiasm is an R - rated version of Seinfeld , and is actually the only comedic sitcom to ever make me squirm in my seat .
Why ?
Because of the sole antics of one man … Larry David .
WARNING : Watching Larry David get himself into uncomfortable situations on the show Curb Your Enthusiasm can be extremely painful .
When Larry David gets himself caught in bad situations , he rarely gets out of them .
More likely than not , his character digs himself deeper and deeper into trouble throughout the course of the show .
It took a few episodes , but I finally realized that I actually enjoy this uneasy feeling I get watching him in stupid predicaments .
If you too , want to feel this discomfort while watching TV , then you should definitely watch Curb Your Enthusiasm .
Start from season 1 though .
Five Things to Look out for in Curb Your Enthusiasm :
An annoying theme song “ Frolic ” that grows on you ( I get a chuckle out of it now )
An annoying main character ( Larry David is annoying looking as well )
Great writing with plot twists like Seinfeld ( but still a show about nothing )
Very DRY humor ( no laugh track ; so it ’s up to you to figure out what ’s funny )
Documentary - style filming ( with acting that ’s just “ good enough ” for TV )
And , as an FYI , Larry David was the primary inspiration for the George Costanza character in Seinfeld .
Product Description
He ’s got it all , a loving wife , good friends , a successful career , a good home …
What could go wrong for Larry David ?
Curb Your Enthusiasm stars “ Seinfeld ” co-creator Larry David as himself in an unsparing , cinema verite depiction of his life .
Featuring real life celebrities playing themselves , the episodes are improvised by the actors from storylines by David .
BAGHDAD – As another school year begins in Iraq , parents approach it with dread , fearing for the safety of their children .
With the security situation grimmer than ever all over the country , just stepping out of one ’s house means a serious threat to life .
" God knows how we could send our kids to school this year , " Um Mohammed , a mother of five in Baghdad told IPS .
" Our financial situation is the worst ever and the prices are way too expensive for the majority of Iraqis to afford .
I might have to keep some of them at home and send only two . "
The 40 - year - old woman shed tears when she started to talk about the family ’s financial situation now compared to what it was before the US occupation of Iraq .
" My God , do n’t those Americans have any conscience ?
We were not rich before , but life was easy and we used to celebrate the school season , watching our kids trying their uniform on and looking at the colorful pictures of their new books , " she said .
Iraqis blame their government ’s failure to provide them with basic necessities on the US - led occupation that has brought such an incompetent regime to power .
The Iraqi Ministry of Education promised Iraqis a better educational year in 2007 , a promise that has been made every year for the past four years .
" The educational system in Iraq is destroyed and we are suffering all kinds of difficulties , " said Hassan , a school headmaster in Baghdad who spoke on condition that his last name and the name of his school would not be used .
" There will be a shortage of desks , blackboards , water , electricity and all educational supplies – as well as a critical shortage in the number of teachers this year . "
Teachers , like other Iraqis , have fled the country because of threats from sectarian death squads .
Some were evicted from their areas and moved to others inside Iraq for sectarian reasons .
According to Iraq ’s Ministry of Higher Education , as of February 2006 , nearly 180 professors were killed and at least 3,250 have fled Iraq to the neighboring countries .
The situation has deteriorated severely since then .
" The number of teachers leaving the country this year ( 06 ) is huge and almost double those who left in 2005 , " Professor Salah Aliwi , director - general of studies planning in the Ministry of Higher Education told reporters during an Aug. 24 , 2006 interview in Baghdad .
" Every day , we are losing more experienced people , which is causing a serious problem in the education system . "
While teachers are at risk , Iraqi families are concerned for the safety of their children as well .
" I am not sending my two boys to school this year , " Tariq Ahmed from Baghdad told IPS .
" I am sure hundreds , if not thousands , of students will be abducted and killed by militias .
I am not gambling with my boys ’ life just to support Bush ’s lies that the country is safe and sound . "
Last month , the Iraqi Ministry of Education warned of possible low attendance of pupils at schools this year , saying it expects at least a 15 percent decrease in attendance compared to previous years .
Leila Abdallah , a senior official at the Ministry of Education , told reporters on Aug. 28 there has been a 54 percent increase in exam failure rates compared to previous years .
She added that many students had not completed their last exams as they had been forced by violence to flee their homes to safer areas .
The Iraqi NGO Keeping Children Alive ( KCA ) , recently said education standards in Iraq had dropped and many schools were relying on teachers teaching at least 100 students per class .
" Owing to lack of teachers , a class now has dozens of students , a situation that is preventing teachers from giving sufficient attention to individual pupils , " Moussa Dureid , a spokesperson for the KCA , said .
According to an Oxfam International report released in July , " 92 percent of children had learning impediments that are largely attributable to the current climate of fear . "
The report added , " Schools are regularly closed as teachers and pupils are too fearful to attend .
Over 800,000 children may now be out of school , according to a recent estimate by Save the Children UK – up from 600,000 in 2004 . "
Iraqis do not feel secure despite the reassurances of US and Iraqi authorities that the security situation has improved .
" Universities are death squad headquarters , " Qutayba Assaad , a professor at Al - Mustansiriya University in Baghdad told IPS .
" They are practicing all kinds of torture inside the university and they abducted many of my colleagues because of their sect or their objections to what the clerics are doing inside universities . "
" What education are you talking about , " Kussay Kathum , a student at Baghdad University told IPS .
" This country is dead and its body is being torn apart .
They should stop schools and colleges attendance until they solve the core of the problem . "
His colleague , Sumaya agreed with him .
" Indeed they should change the whole system in Iraq before sending us to school .
It is suicide to go to colleges where the government ’s militias kill people .
It seems that our American colleagues do not care for what is happening to us . "
When using GMail I sometimes get the following error message :
Arrgh !
The page has been corrupted .
If you are running security or firewall software , you may have to disable it
This is a bad error message for a number of reasons .
They are telling me that I may have to disable my security , or firewall .
The error message is simply :
The page has been corrupted .
What does that mean ?
Is it involved in organized crime ?
money laundering ?
it does n't sound good to me , the last thing I want to do is turn of my security or firewall .
Error messages like this scare the crap out of non technical users .
This is the kind of error message that when my parents get , I receive a phone call .
Arrgh ! - also would scare my parents .
I 'm all for error messages that show a human side , but this gives the impression that Gmail is mad at me .
The thing that gets me is that this is not a security or firewall issue for me , it happens randomly , so I would guess that this is probably actually due to a bug on Google 's end .
Another thing - my parents do actually have a gmail account , so lets not think that Gmail is only for early adopters .
Plenty of non technical people are using it .

I was recently at a rather large expo , and I decided to keep track of the many different mission statements I came across .
I also kept track of the responses we got at our booth with our mission statement .
Out of all the data , there was one glaring trend .
Mission statements are so common place and so exaggerated that no one even listens to them .
What can we do about this ?
Let ’s start by breaking down what a mission statement is supposed to do .
Ideally , mission statements should do the following :
Explain your company and your purpose Mission statements are designed to help your customer understand what your business is about .
They are supposed to help align the customer with your beliefs as a company .
Intrigue and excite people
One of the primary original purposes of a mission statement was to get people excited about your company .
Companies often make big claims like “ we ’re here to save your life ” in order to arouse their customers interest .
These days , sweeping generalizations like that are all the rage .
They also get ignored by most seasoned customers .
Distinguish you from the competition
When done correctly , a mission statement will tell people why you are a bit different ( better , of course ) than the rest of the competition .
If done incorrectly , you may come off as arrogant .
Help people remember who you are
In a market filled with hundreds of companies doing hundreds of similar things , it can be very difficult to remember any single person or small business .
Your mission statement , along with all of your other materials , should be designed to help people remember who you are .
If you accomplish this well , then your mission statement was successful .
There ’s an excellent article on Guy Kawasaki ’s blog about this : 9 Best Story Lines for Marketing
What went wrong , and how to fix it :
Mission statements are too long
If you want anyone to listen until the end of your statement , it needs to be short and sweet .
Mission statements are too complicated
With everyone telling small businesses how to write a mission statement ( me too , evidently ) , they have become filled with gibberish as each writer tries to satisfy every condition of a successful mission statement .
Your mission statement should be focused to the point , which brings us to the next bullet .
Mission statements are too much about companies and not enough about customers
Many companies have mission statements that get into company heritage and history — can you think of anything more boring ?
The entire point of your mission statement needs to be about your customer .
What are they going to get from you .
Repeat after me : “ My mission is about my customer . ”
Less mission , more mantra Company mission statements are generally just a paragraph of exaggeration that is brought out in front of customers , only to disappear before getting back to the office .
Your small business needs to live and breath your mission .
Everything you do and say should reinforce your mission .
If you do n’t live by your mission , people will know immediately that you ’re not being sincere .
In a world of sensationalism , you need your mission to be as sincere and trustworthy as possible .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - U.S. sales of Sony Corp ’s PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) more than doubled in the weeks following a price cut and the launch of a lower - priced version , the company said on Friday , in a sign of changing fortunes for the game console .
Sony said it sold about 75,000 PS3 consoles in the week of October 29 in the United States , and more than 100,000 in the following week , compared with weekly sales of 30,000 to 40,000 before .
Sony cut the U.S. price of its PS3 with an 80 - gigabyte hard disk drive by 17 percent to $ 499 in mid-October .
It started selling a new model with a 40 - GB hard drive on November 2 for $ 399 in an effort to ignite demand ahead of the crucial holiday season .
Sony , locked in battle with Microsoft Corp and Nintendo Co Ltd in the global videogame market , suffered a slow start for the PS3 after its launch a year ago because of high prices and a scarcity of strong game titles .
Nintendo sold 519,000 units of the Wii in the United States in October , while Microsoft sold 366,000 Xbox 360 consoles and Sony sold 121,000 of its PS3 machines , data from market research firm NPD showed on Thursday .
More Americans seeking foreign health care

MONTERREY , MEXICO — Whipped by rising medical costs and spurred on by the globe - shrinking travel of our age , growing numbers of Americans are heading abroad to treat much of what ails them .
Uninsured , under - insured or just plain unhappy with American health care , they seek out a handful of foreign medical meccas , including Mexico , where they can get cut - rate deals on everything from face - lifts to root canals , heart bypasses to new hips .
It has been branded medical tourism , and many experts believe the trend will become one of the hottest niches in both global medicine and travel in the coming decades .
" This is about a global shift in health care services , " said Josef Woodman , whose book , Patients Beyond Borders , offers how - to advice for Americans seeking offshore medical care
More than 1 million patients worldwide , including at least 150,000 Americans , crossed international borders last year and spent $ 60 billion in the process , Woodman and other industry analysts estimate .
Such travel has a long history in Texas and Mexico .
A recent study by the University of Texas Medical Center in El Paso estimated that more than 20 million U.S. - Mexico border crossings are made for health care annually , including those of wealthier Mexicans traveling to Houston and elsewhere for hospital stays .
Americans seeking cheap medicines , dental care , cancer treatments and cosmetic surgeries have found them in Mexico .
Dentists , doctors ' offices and pharmacies advertising in English line the streets of booming Mexican cities along the Rio Grande like Nuevo Progreso , Reynosa , Nuevo Laredo and Ciudad Juarez .
But in recent years , many international health travellers have favored top - shelf hospitals in Asia for coronary care and orthopedic surgery as good as , but far cheaper than , what they could receive at home .
Thailand alone treats 500,000 foreigners each year , industry analysts say , including more than 50,000 Americans .
Several Latin American countries have long been destinations for health travellers .
Brazil and Costa Rica are noted for cosmetic surgery , Colombia for heart care .
Panama and the Dominican Republic are pushing to attract health tourists .
Mexico pursues the market
Seeing the opportunities , hospital executives and government officials in several Mexican cities have decided to grab a piece of the major - surgery market for travelling patients .
The medical centers in Monterrey — the industrial hub that 's a two - hour drive south of the Texas border and a 70 - minute plane ride from Houston — are spearheading the push .
" What we offer is closeness , quality and cost , " said Jesus Gonzalez , a Monterrey physician who is leading a push by the Nuevo Leon state government to attract foreign patients to eight city hospitals .
" Our target is the American citizen . "
A huge target it is .
About 47 million Americans — including more than 6 million Texans — were uninsured last year , according to industry and Census Bureau statistics .
Millions more carry inadequate coverage .
Many of the 12 million - plus Mexican - born residents of the United States are among the poorest and least insured .
They , and millions more Mexican - Americans , maintain family ties and cultural affinities with Mexico that make hospital stays in this country a logical option .
" The majority come because they do n't have any access to medical services at home , " said Cynthia Gonzalez , a family practice physician in the border town of Nuevo Progreso .
" Many times , even if they are insured , it comes out cheaper for them to get their care here . "
Her standard consultation fee is $ 25 , about the same as a co-payment required by some health maintenance organizations in the U.S .
Upgrades in the works
Monterrey 's Christus Muguerza hospitals , which are majority owned by the Irving , Texas - based Christus Health , expect the same considerations to attract U.S. patients for more serious procedures like heart and orthopedic surgeries .
The company has contracted with an Albuquerque travel broker to bring in American patients .
Christus Muguerza is upgrading its two older hospitals in Monterrey and two others in the northern Mexico cities of Saltillo and Chihuahua .
The company , which has smaller hospitals under construction in Reynosa , across the Rio Grande near McAllen , and in Chiapas state , plan to expand across Mexico .
Christus ' competitors , including the Dallas - based International Hospital Corp. — which owns four hospitals in Mexico — have similar plans .
Premiere Mexican - owned hospitals , like Mexico City 's American British Cowdray and the Angeles group , are ramping up , too .
" We can give them service at prices that are comparable or better than those offered in other countries — India or Thailand — and that is much closer to the United States , " said John Zipprich , the Houston - based senior vice president and general counsel of Christus Health .
If things go as planned , Christus Muguerza might one day attract international patients , including those from the Middle East , who have traditionally sought treatment at the Texas Medical Center in Houston or other U.S. institutions .
" Medical travel is going to be so important that it wo n't matter where you get care , " said Arturo Garza , the chief executive of Christus Muguerza hospitals in Monterrey .
" What will matter is the quality of care . "
U.S. hospitals benefit , too
The Texas Medical Center , a collection of 46 institutions employing more than 110,000 people , serves at least 10,000 foreign patients a year .
But those numbers have fallen dramatically because of the heightened visa requirements following the 9/11 attacks .
" The TMC hospitals are aggressively trying to maintain their business of treating wealthy foreign patients , which has suffered since the crackdown on terrorism , " said Vivian Ho , an economist at the James A. Baker III Institute of Public Policy at Rice University .
Those with insurance will continue to seek care for major illnesses in Texas , she said .
" To the extent that the uninsured seek care in Mexico , " she said , " this will actually lead to less uncompensated care being provided in Houston , which may actually be a financial benefit to us . "
Christus Muguerza hopes its High Specialty hospital in downtown Monterrey will soon be the first Mexican medical center accredited by the Joint Commission International , a branch of the Chicago - based organization that certifies American hospital and clinics .
" The JCI gives Americans a good level of comfort , " said author Woodman .
" It 's like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval . "
Created a decade ago to vouch for health care quality overseas , the agency has certified more than 100 hospitals worldwide , though only a handful in Latin America .
But as many as a dozen Mexican hospitals are in various stages of the accreditation process , said David Jaimovich , the agency 's chief medical officer .
The Internet has proved key to the growing medical tourism trend , with Web pages dedicated to the emerging industries and health travel brokers offering their services online .
Reviews of hospitals by patients and analysts offer a balance to the self - promotion of the health care providers , experts say .
" It 's a buyers ' market nowadays because the start - up clinics are going to be very careful not to screw up , " said Christopher Jones , a global health care economist in Chicago who recently formed his own company to study medical tourism .
Hospital quality in many of the countries is spotty at best .
While significant numbers of foreign physicians have been trained in the United States and Europe , nurses and other support staff have not .
Record - keeping , facility maintenance and other key factors of quality care lag American standards , some experts say .
" Countries can tout medical tourism all they want , but they do n't have the infrastructure for it , " said Woodman .
" It has to be a country that embraces a travel infrastructure .
Planning a medical trip is not the time to be working on your Spanish or Chinese . "
Many Americans harbor deep doubts about foreign health care , even some who use the medical services in Mexico .
" I 've heard of these people going on vacation and getting liposuction or whatever .
No way , " said Jennifer Jackson of Houston , who traveled with her boyfriend , Sean Montano , to the border city of Nuevo Progreso , where he underwent dental surgery .
Questions of liability , regulations
Others seem less skeptical .
" As long as the doctors are respectable and you speak to a couple of people he has worked on , I 'd have no hesitation to come down here , " said Shirley Currie , 69 , a Corpus Christi construction firm employee who has made the three - hour drive to Nuevo Progreso for years to obtain medicines and dental care .
Still , if things go wrong — as things invariably do with major medical treatment everywhere — international patients have recourse only to the legal system in the host country .
Malpractice lawsuits often go nowhere in Mexico and other countries , and even when successful rarely pay anything close to what they do in the United States .
In addition , companies that arrange and manage for overseas care for clients operate in an unregulated environment .
Though Mexican hospital standards have improved markedly in the past decade , they have a long way to go , said Lawrence Meagher , the chief executive of the American British Cowdray , or ABC , Hospital in Mexico City .
To improve the ABC Hospital 's standards , Meagher has established a formal relationship with The Methodist Hospital of Houston , and his hospital is matching its record keeping , patient care and other procedures to those of Methodist's .
But that entails a lengthy and expensive process that few Mexican hospitals can take on .
' The things we are doing are to ensure patient security , patient care and employee safety , " said Meagher .
Overcoming such hurdles will prove key to Mexico 's ability to attract a significant share of the medical tourism market .
Some hospital executives believe medical travel to Mexico will be unlikely to really take off until American insurance companies agree to pay for services here and in other countries .
That 's already happening , if still haltingly .
Some insurance plans in California — Blue Cross / Blue Shield is one of them — already pay for medical care in Mexico , most either targeting immigrants working for U.S. companies or their families .
Self - insured companies and large insurance companies alike are looking at tiered programs that would offer lower premiums for plans that would include foreign medical treatment .
" Within a year you 're going to see actual products offered to U.S. employers , " predicted Peter Maddox , Christus Health 's senior vice president for business strategy in Houston .
Maddox said that through the rest of the decade " there 's going to be huge voting pressure on Congress " to include medical travel in a comprehensive health care overhaul .
" We see tremendous pressure on the whole system in the United States for the next 10 to 15 years , " Maddox said .
Jones , the health care economist , believes that it will only take one large insurance provider to start writing less expensive policies for foreign care for medical tourism in Mexico to take off .
" It 's a good thing for America if we can get insurance premiums to come down , " he said .
" We 're getting more and more in terms of premiums and less in terms of care . "
" This is really the democratization of global health care , " he said .
" It 's freight train heading in one direction : Forward . "

Boston , MA - Researchers at MIT ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) have used the Turing Test to determine that most 2 - year - old children are not human .
The Turing Test , named after Alan Turing , consists of a human ( the Judge ) engaging in conversation with another human , and a third party ( which up to this point has always been a machine ) .
If the Judge cannot tell which is which , then the machine passes the Turing Test .
Otherwise , it is deemed just a machine .
Roger Mason and Cao Li , as part of their Doctoral thesis , have performed the Turing Test on a group of 2 - year - old children , both male and female .
The results show that of a group of 100 children , none passed the Turing Test .
Henry Farlington , one of the judges used in the experiment , commented , " It was rather simple to discern who the real human was .
The non -human kept writing gibberish , if they wrote anything at all .
It was as if someone was just banging on the keyboard with tiny little fists . "
Mason said , " This began as a study in human communication , but one of our Computer Science friends mentioned the whole concept of the Turing Test to us , and we decided to give it a go .
Little did we know that we 'd reach such an astounding result . "

This Year " We 're planning on running the experiment again , but with different age groups , " added Li . " Also , we 'd like to try with a larger sample to corroborate our findings .
We 've already had several parents offer their ' darling little machines ' to us for use in future experiments .
This scientific breakthrough may well change the world as we know it . "
Governments all over the world have begun to change Child Labor Laws , and Pro-Choice supporters are already in talks with Mason and Li to perform the same test on fetuses .

During a NewsHour discussion of the latest video from Bin Laden , Brooks began his comments by saying :
I mean , on one hand , he ’s a malevolent guy who killed 3,000 Americans .
But you read this thing , and it ’s like he ’s been sitting around reading
lefty blogs , and he ’s one of these childish people posting rants at the

( full transcript : ThinkProgress , The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer )
The tendency of right wing pundits to equate Democrats and liberals with violent criminals , terrorists and genocidal dictators is a growing trend in the media .
This latest example , however , is not from the likes of right wing pundits typically associated with violent rhetoric , such as Ann Coulter or Sean Hannity .
David Brooks is a columnist for the New York Times and a regular guest on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer .
Brooks ' comparison of Bin Laden and ' lefty blogs ' represents a breach of professional responsibility and an offense to the viewers of PBS .
We call on PBS to take these immediate actions in response to Brooks ' comment :
1 ) Publish an apology for Brooks ' comments in a major U.S. paper
2 ) Remove Brooks from his position as a pundit for The NewsHour
3 ) Air a follow - up segment apologizing for Brooks remark
PBS is a public broadcasting network operated for the good of the American people .
Pundits who equate large segments of the PBS viewing public with the most well - known mass murderer of recent history are a breach of the public trust given to PBS .
As such , they should not be allowed to continue working at PBS .
On air political pundits equating liberals with terrorists has become a
serious and recurrent problem in American broadcast and cable
television .
PBS has a responsibility to make sure this practice is not allowed to occur during their shows , and to take appropriate action each time it does .

Update [ 2007-9-9 8:27:21 by Jeffrey Feldman ] :
What Appears To Have Happened : Brooks Turned " 9th - Tier Blog " Comment By Josh Marshall Into Smear Of " Lefty Blogs "
This is an amazing part of this story that I just now managed to track down .
According to a story in the National Journal , right after ABC issued a transcript of the supposed OBL tape ( there is some doubt about its authenticity ) , Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo wrote a short piece in which he compared the transcript to the writings of a ' 9th - tier blogger . '
Noting carefully what Marshall said is a very important part of this story :
I do n't gainsay the danger or destructive power of the man .
I still remember Rick Hertzberg 's quote just after 9/11 that the attacks were as brilliant as they were evil .
( This is from memory : so I may have the precise words wrong .
But he well captured the way in which the horror and evil of the attacks were matched by their diabolical ingeniusness . )
But as an articulator of a vision , an expounder of " Islamofascism , " or whatever the new trademarked word is now , he 's about as coherent and comprehensible as a 9th tier blogger or one of those whacks sitting on a stoop in Union Square talking about fascism and Texas oil barons before they get overcome by the shakes or decide to start collecting more aluminum cans .
If my predictive powers are still working right , I 'm sure I 'll catch flack for taking such a mocking attitude toward this man who has so much American blood on his hands .
( full post here )
Indeed , Josh 's predictive powers were still working right , as Ann Althouse took him to task .
Note , however , how Althouse makes a very clear distinction in her post between the right - wingers who are using the new tape to compare OBL to Democrats and what she sees Marshall has done in his post ( it 's a long quote , but it 's important to see how Althouse responded to Marshall to understand exactly what Brooks did on The NewsHour ) :
An awful lot of the commentary on the new bin Laden tape is saying :
He sounds like a Democrat .
That 's the meme from nonDemocrats .
But let 's not go over that already well - worn ground .
Let 's read what Josh Marshall has to say : I do n't gainsay the danger or destructive power of the man .
I still remember Rick Hertzberg 's quote just after 9/11 that the attacks were as brilliant as they were evil .
( This is from memory : so I may have the precise words wrong .
But he well captured the way in which the horror and evil of the attacks were matched by their diabolical ingeniusness . )
But as an articulator of a vision , an expounder of " Islamofascism , " or whatever the new trademarked word is now , he 's about as coherent and comprehensible as a 9th tier blogger or one of those whacks sitting on a stoop in Union Square talking about fascism and Texas oil barons before they get overcome by the shakes or decide to start collecting more aluminum cans .
If my predictive powers are still working right , I 'm sure I 'll catch flack for taking such a mocking attitude toward this man who has so much American blood on his hands .
But this , I think , is only the flip side of the vaunted perch we insist on giving him , a insistence that is a paradoxical part of Bushism .
They are tacit partners in creating the world in which we now live .
From me , you 're going to first catch flak for writing " catch flack . "
" Flak " is WW II airman ’s slang for shells being fired at you in the air , so to catch a lot of flak is to feel in danger of being shot down .
However , most civilians these days have never heard of " flak , " so they use " flack " instead , which originally meant " salesman " or " huckster . "
You need to worry about this only if you ’re among old - time veterans .
When you 're showing off your expertise about fighting a war , you ought to get your war imagery right .
A flack is a press agent .
Hacks -- " writer[s ] hired to produce routine or commercial writing " -- know more about flacks and not so much about flak , but they need to try not to let it show .
( full post here )
OK , so what does this mean .
It means that prior to Brooks going on The NewsHour , two discussions in the media were already ongoing : ( 1 ) right - wing news outlets saying that the Bin Laden tape reminded them of Democratic critiques and ( 2 ) a conversation initiated by a high - profile liberal blogger comparing the rhetorical style of Bin Laden 's tape to bad writing found in less well - known blogs .
Enter David Brooks .
It would appear that what Brooks was aware of both of these discussion and simply collapsed one into the other through a misreading of Marshall 's comment .
Where Josh compared Bin Laden 's rhetoric to the bad writing found in a lower - tier blog , Brooks compared Bin Laden 's rhetoric to the " angry " style of " lefty blogs . "
The end result : Brooks used his high - profile spot on The NewsHour to turn the discussion of OBL 's tape into yet argue that mass murdering terrorists have something in common with Democrats .
Update [ 2007-9-9 9:48:8 by Jeffrey Feldman ] :
Another example of a high - profile blogger talking about the OBL tape and using language similar to Brooks , but not in any way smearing Democrats or progressive blogs .
On Sep 8 , 2007 blogger Juan Cole put up a post titled Bin Laden Brandishes Jihadi Threat against US in Iraq in which he compared the new video to " leftist rhetoric . "
Notice what Cole says , though , and how different it is from cheap right - wing one - liners about OBL being similar to the American left :
Bin Laden is stuck in the 1980s intellectually , when he was used by one superpower ( the Reagan administration ) against another ( the Soviet Union ) .
That bipolar world is gone , succeeded by a period of unipolarism .
Jihadis with $ 10 bn. in aid from the US and Saudi Arabia and a national cause are one thing .
Jihadis with no superpower patron , no united nation , and little or no money just become terrorists .
Ironically , Bin Laden has adopted the jejune leftist rhetoric of his erstwhile Soviet foes , making everything into a conspiracy of some corporations .
But instead of calling for the workers to unite and overthrow their chains , he ends by assuring us that a fundamentalist Muslim dictatorship would be benign .
So , here we see a real attempt to compare OBL 's rhetoric to something on the political left -- turning to historical examples .
What Brooks does , by contrast , is simply glom onto an already existing narrative from right - wing pundits -- the tale about " lefties " really being on the side of the terrorists rather than the side of Uncle Sam .
The point : there 's nothing wrong with talking about the left and Bin Laden in the same sentence .
The problem is doing it in a way that feeds into the story about Democrats and terrorists as birds of the same traitorous feather .
Update [ 2007-9-9 11:3:37 by Jeffrey Feldman ] :
DKos user NCJan reports in the comment thread :
George Will on ABC just compared the Democratic base to Osama bin Laden 's video !
He said that both are asking why Democrats can't end the war in Iraq .
Way to go parroting the talking points , George !
BTW : Did you notice how Bin Laden also talked into a TV camera ?
That must mean that , you know , George Will and Osama Bin Laden are doing the same thing ...

Dennis Kucinich : ' I 'm a Long - Shot Candidate ' Kucinich said he 's optimistic about moving to fifth place in N.H. poll .
Nov. 15 , 2007  --
Calling himself a " long - shot candidate , " Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio. , blasted his fellow Democratic presidential contenders during an interview with ABC News , arguing that his rivals have given in to health insurers and big pharmaceutical companies .
" I'm the one candidate who is running for president who has the ability to stand up to the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies -- the other candidates have already capitulated , " Kucinich said on ' Politics Live ' Thursday on ABC News Now -- ABC 's digital news channel .
" These insurance companies have a grip on Washington and on the Democratic Party , " he said , arguing that he is the only presidential candidate with a health care plan that is completely not - for - profit .
' Rigged Game '
The Ohio congressman said he is optimistic about his chances after a New York Times / CBS poll released this week had Kucinich in fifth place in New Hampshire with 5 percent support , but only four percentage points behind former North Carolina Sen.
John Edwards .
" I know I 'm a long - shot candidate , " he said .
" The fact that I went up to 5 percent in New Hampshire shows that I have to keep moving up .
If I can get to third place , the race starts to change a little bit . "
The poll had Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , first among Democratic likely primary voters at 37 percent support ; Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , at 22 percent ; Edwards at 9 percent ; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson at 6 percent ; and Kucinich at 5 percent -- just squeaking past the poll 's margin of error .
Kucinich beat out in the poll Sens. Joe Biden , D - Del. , and Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , who received 2 and 1 percent support , respectively .
The candidate accused the Iowa state Democratic Party of throwing support behind only the leading Democratic contenders .
" Iowa 's been kind of a rigged game .
The Iowa state Democratic Party wants to determine who the next president 's going to be , " he said .
Kucinich demurred when asked whether he thought Clinton would be electable in a general election .
" I 'm not running for president against Hillary Clinton , " he said .
" I 'm running for president so the people of this country can have jobs , health care , housing , food on the table , clothes on their kids ' backs , a decent education , that 's what I 'm about . "
Kucinich did say , however , that Clinton - era trade policies in the 1990s " took America in the wrong direction . "
" NAFTA lost this country millions of jobs , " he said .
" I 've stood behind closed plant gates where there 's grass growing in parking lots where they used to make cars and steel and washing machines and bicycles . "
' The Real Democrat '
Citing his success in informal online polls that ask people to match their key issues with presidential candidates , Kucinich said his public support is rising because he is the only candidate who voted against the war .
He 's also proposing a Cabinet - level Department of Peace , as he did during his first White House bid in 2004 .
" I'm the real Democrat in the race , and so it 's just a matter of time for that awareness to catch on , " he said .
" Will it be in time for me to win some primaries ?
Well , that remains to be seen . "
Kucinich will appear onstage Thursday night with his 2008 rivals for a Democratic debate in Las Vegas .
He said when he 's called upon he will talk about his anti-war message and his so - far failed effort in Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney over the Iraq War .
" I 'm ready to talk about the need for peace , to reject a war against Iran , to challenge the administration and to talk about impeachment , " he said .
" I 'm going to keep pushing that issue in the Congress because this is about protecting our Constitution . "
The former Cleveland mayor said he has never forgotten the poverty he grew up in , and said he still lives in a house he bought in a working - class neighborhood of Cleveland in 1971 for $ 22,500 .
" Look , I know that I 'm a long shot , but so are a lot of Americans , and they 're in a much more difficult position than I 'm in because they 're threatened with losing their jobs , their wages are stagnate , they do n't have health care benefits , their retirement 's in jeopardy or their home is in jeopardy , " he said .
Kucinich , 61 , credited his wife , Elizabeth , who is 30 years his junior , with making this campaign experience better than his failed bid in 2004 .
" I 've got a wife who is drawing her own crowd around the campaign circuit , " he said .
" It 's made all the difference in my life .
I 'm one happy candidate ! "
Kucinich said he is trailing in the polls because Americans like to back a winner , but that most Democrats agree with his views on the war , health care and the environment .
" What I stand for is central to the hopes and aspirations of the American people , and as they understand that , my support starts to grow . "

It seems that lately things have gotten a smidge slack around here .
I feel it is time to remind you of the rules that heretofore we have operated under .
You are both cute dogs , but your continued cuteness in no way negates our previous agreement .
Let me remind you of a few details of this agreement .
1 .
In exchange for room and board , you are to guard the kingdom .
That would be guarding the kingdom from any and all bad guys , robbers , serial killers , etc .
Feel free to bark maniacally at any of those that should appear in the yard .
Guarding the kingdom does NOT include barking maniacally at bunnies , squirrels , cows , sheep and invisible things that only you can see , especially between the hours of 5 am ( when I stumble out of bed to let you out ) and 8 am ( when I actually have to be out of bed to get to work ) .
( And let me take a moment here to remind you that the pizza guy is a potential bad guy .
He is not your friend .
Just because he comes bearing food does not allow him free and easy access to the kingdom .
He is potentially way more dangerous than the bunnies that you threaten to tear limb from limb . ) 2 .
All of the stuff that lives in the toy basket is yours .
Everything else is mine .
Yours includes squeaky balls , random bones , partially unstuffed stuffed animals and chew ropes .
Mine includes any and all shoes on the floor ( especially the expensive leather ones ) , underwear that missed the hamper , bras , socks , dishtowels , the remote , the cell phone , the legs of my grandmother 's antique chair and the vacuum .
Did I mention shoes ?
ALL the shoes are mine .
They come in pairs , not quads , for a reason .
3 .
The cat gets to sleep on the bed .
You do not .
You each weigh 50 pounds .
The cat weighs 12 .
You sleep smack dab in the middle of the bed with all four feet spread out covering approximately 12 square feet apiece .
The cat sleeps in a neat little ball covering about 2 square feet .
The cat does not bring fleas into the house .
You do .
You , dogs , will never be allowed to sleep on the bed .
Quit sneaking up when you think I 'm not looking .
Your 50 pounds of dogginess negates your stealth superpowers .
I know you are up there !!
4 . Speaking of the cat - when he hunkers down into that little mound , lays his ears back , squints his eyes and growls way back in his chest , HE IS NOT A HAPPY KITTY .
Leave him alone .
He does not want to play with you .
What he wants to do is poke your eyes out and shread the skin around your face .
He can do that , you know .
Five of his 6 ends are really sharp and pointy .
He has previously shown very little restraint .
Clearly he enjoys smacking you upside the head with a paw full of claws .
Do not aggrevate him .
When he takes your head off after you have cornered him , I will let him .
You have been forewarned .
5 . The cat is mean .
He will lead you down a path to destruction .
He likes to tear around the house winding you up .
He does this knowingly and intentionally .
When you chase him , I will only yell at you for careening into walls and furniture .
He knows this .
Quit falling for it .6 .
If you find something in the garbage can , assume that I intend for it to be there .
Platic tampon shells are not chew toys .
Do n't eat them .
7 . Also not for doggy consumption - anything you find in the litter box .
This is why you no longer get to kiss me .
8 .
You are allowed to sleep on the furniture .
You are not allowed to eat the furniture .
9 .
Yes , I have to leave every day to go to work .
No , you can not go with me .
That 's why there are two of you , so you can entertain each other .
The cat gets to stay in the house .
You both have to stay outside while I 'm gone .
The cat does not chew things up .
You do .
Quit whining about it .
Your porch is air - conditioned .
It 's just like inside the house minus the sofa .
If you 'd quit chewing up dog beds , it would be just like inside the house .
You have made your own proverbial bed by destroying two very expensive dog cushions .
10 .
I have opposable thumbs .
This is why I get to be in charge .
I can open cans , doors , and bags of treats .
I am the only one in the house that can operate the hose sprayer .
I 'm also the only one with a driver 's license and a car .
I win .
Being cute is no match for opposable thumbs .
While I in no way wish to suppress your rightful dogginess , I feel that these very simple guidelines will allow us to continue to co-exist in peaceful harmony .
Please know though , that should you choose to continue in willful violation of these rules , I WILL PUT THE CAT IN CHARGE .
He has just been itching for a position in management .
Much thanks ,
The Human
Wear red for Burma : Several thousand people at the demonstration in Oslo
“ Wear a red t- shirt in solidarity this friday ! ” “ Light candles in your windows on Friday night to honour the victims of the demostrations . ”
Pro-democracy protest marches in Burma have entered the tenth day .
Burmese soldiers have detained about 200 Buddhist monks and fired shots as they attempt to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters in Rangoon .
Any comments by anthropologists on the situation in Burma ?
By now I ’ve found two three four :
Monique Skidmore , medical anthropologist in The College of Arts & Social Sciences at the Australian National University ( ANU ) has been conducting research in Burma since 1994 .
In the Australian online magazine Crikey she explains , that the the current protests stretch its roots stretch back to 1962 “ when the Burmese armed forces , led by General Ne Win , usurped power from Burma ’s democratically elected government of Prime Minister U Nu. General Ne Win ruled the country by fear , informers , propaganda and isolation .
A civil war has waged since then , with estimates of the loss of life at up to 10,000 each year . ”
Today ’s street protests are furthermore “ the culmination of a campaign for democracy being coordinated by the ’ 88 Student Generation , the activist movement in exile , the labor movement ( embodied by Su Su Nway , now in hiding ) , monks , and the National League for Democracy . ”
Coordination is difficult given that most mobile phones are illegal as well as use of the internet , she writes : “ Burma ’s first blog appeared last week showing the first day of the monk protest in Rangoon .
It only took the military regime 24 hours to shut it down . ”
>> Monique Skidmore : The Burmese people have had enough
Sometimes Burma is also called Myanmar .
Myanmar is actually the official name , the BBC explains :
The ruling military junta changed its name from Burma to Myanmar in 1989 , a year after thousands were killed in the suppression of a popular uprising .
Rangoon also became Yangon .
The name change is a form of censorship , says anthropologist and editor of Anthropology Today Gustaaf Houtman in the BBC article Should it be Burma or Myanmar ?
Houtman has written a book that is available online ( free ) called Mental Culture in Burmese Crisis Politics .
Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy .
It is also available on Google Books .
Read also an interview with Houtman on The Culture of Burmese Politics .
update : In the New York Times story Karma Power : What Makes a Monk Mad anthropology professor Ingrid Jordt contributes with some orientalitic statements when she explains that the monks ’ power comes from their role in bestowing legitimacy on the rulers :
“ Legitimacy in Burma is not about regime performance , it ’s not about human rights like the West .
It is something that comes from the potency and karma bestowed by the monks .
That ’s why the sangha is so important to the government , ” she said , referring to the Buddhist hierarchy and the spiritual status that its monks can convey .
“ They are actually the source of power . ”
UPDATE : Anthropologist Gabriele Marranci tells a story that the mass media neglects to inform us : Muslims in Burma are persecuted , not only by the military , even by the ‘ peaceful ’ monks : >>
Gabriele Marranci :
The other , invisible suffering of Burma

BBC News also has a story about how Burma cyber - dissidents crack censorship and tell the world what is happening under the military junta ’s veil of secrecy .

For non facebook users more on the red shirt campaign see on these blogs at Livejournal , Dynamic Nonvilence , Sungame and in the Phuket Gazette : Red -shirt - Friday campaign sweeps Phuket and Norwegian trade union leader backs call to “ wear red ”
To those who think this might be a pointless or even stupid campaign I ’ve found this comment in a facebook group :
Nobody thinks wearing a red shirt is gonna change the situation .
Did you actually think so ?
Now THAT is really stupid .
Nobody really thought demonstrating against the Iraq war in Oslo , where I live , or any other place in the world would for that matter , would make Bush change his mind either .
Point is , we still did it , it ’s the biggest demonstration in Norwegian history .
What ’s wrong with gathering the world ?
What ’s wrong with trying to spread the word to everybody ?
What ’s wrong with showing that you care , and that you are aware of the situation and have a statement , even though it does n’t necessarily make a practical change ?
Negativity of that kind is what really is stupid .

Free Burma International Bloggers ’ Day 4.10.2007
Some form of " Just trust us " , was the operative phrase .
The NYT wonders this morning " How , exactly , has this worked , so far ? " ,
One term , frequently used by Allen , was Customer Base .
The plan is for the NAO to serve as a clearing house for law enforcement requests to access the spy satellite data upon NAO 's approval .
That approval will be granted through inhouse review , with no Judicial oversite , and no explaination forth coming to the Committee as to what , exactly , the guidelines for approval would be .
The legal staff of both Homeland Security and the NAO declined to attend the hearings , claiming , according to Chairman Thompson that they did not wish to appear on a panel that included the ACLU .
The reaction of the Committee on Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson ( D - MS ) , Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing , and Terrorism Risk Assessment Chair Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , and Subcommittee on Management , Investigations , and Oversight Chairman Christopher P. Carney ( D - PA ) was a joy to behold .
Both Republican and Democratic members of the Committee forcefully expressed their conviction that the proposed program would violate the Posse Comitatus Act .
They have sent the following letter to Michael Chertoff , Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , and Charles Allen , Assistant Secretary for Intelligence & Analysis , Department of Homeland Security regarding the Department ’s new spy satellite program .
Dear Secretary Chertoff and Assistant Secretary Allen :
As you know , our Committee held a hearing today on " Turning Spy Satellites on the Homeland . "
The Department ’s new National Applications Office ( NAO ) , charged with overseeing such a program and scheduled to begin operations on October 1 , raises very serious privacy and civil liberties concerns .
We are so concerned that , as the Department ’s authorizing Committee , we are calling for a moratorium on the program until the many Constitutional , legal and organizational questions it raises are answered .
Today ’s testimony made clear that there is effectively no legal framework governing the domestic use of satellite imagery for the various purposes envisioned by the Department .
Without this legal framework , the Department runs the risk of creating a program that – while well - intended – could be misused and violate Americans ’ Constitutional rights .
The Department ’s failure to include its Privacy Officer and the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Officer before this July , almost two years after planning for the NAO began , only heightens our sense of concern .
Privacy and civil liberties simply cannot remain an afterthought at the Department .
We ask that you provide the Committee with the written legal framework under which the NAO will operate , the standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) for the NAO – particularly those SOPs that will be used for requests by State , local , and tribal law enforcement , the privacy and civil liberties safeguards that will accompany any use of satellite imagery , and an analysis of how the program conforms with Posse Comitatus .
The use of geospatial information from military intelligence satellites may turn out to be a valuable tool in protecting the homeland .
But until the Committee receives those written documents and has had a full opportunity to review them , offer comments , and help shape appropriate procedures and protocols , we cannot and will not support the expanded use of satellite imagery by the NAO .
We appreciate your agreement to provide these materials requested above and look forward to working together to assure the American people that their privacy and civil liberties will be protected .
Sincerely , Bennie G. Thompson
Chairman Jane Harman
Chair
Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing , & Terrorism Risk Assessment Christopher P. Carney
Chairman
Subcommittee on Management , Investigations & Oversight
These Congressional Representitives seem to have developed a spine when the Constitution is at risk .
Committee on Homeland Security Letter
Jane Harmon and Sheila Jackson Lee , in particular , were livid at the high handed tactics on display by the panel , and several Republican Congressmen supported their self - proclaimed " rants " .
It is also interesting to watch Charles Allen , former CIA , go from the typical Executive Branch distain for Congress , to a growing realization that he had really screwed up and that this Committe , as well as the Chairs of others in attendance , held the power to stop this program if he was not both more forthcoming , and a lot more cooperative .
This is not over .
Executive Signing Statements come to mind as the first action the White House will take to make sure they increase the Big Brother Society they are trying to impose .
Of course , continuing the program in secret is another tactic this Administration uses so well .
The ACLU has it 's hands full trying to keep up with the extra-Constitutional activities of the Department of Homeland Security .
( Everytime I type those words I want to wash my hands - They are so Germany , 1930's . )
They sent a representative to the hearing and it was his suggestion that the Committee block the October 1st start date for this program , insisting that Congress must establish legal controls and not rely on the good will of men to control the use of military technology to spy on Americans , in violation of existing law .
This would be a good time to throw a few bucks to the ACLU .
It would also be a good time to contact your Congressional Representative and express your outrage at the further erosion of your freedoms under this government .
If we had n't gotten the reins last November , I 'm quite sure this would have gone both unheralded , and unchallenged .
Update : I just added the National Applications Office link to this diary .
Hat tip to Papicek !
Next time President Bush tells you he 's going to Crawford to be with " real Americans , " remind him that there are more World of Warcraft players in the USA than there are farmers ( though of course the two are n't mutually exclusive ) .
There are four times as many Americans living in urban than rural areas .
There are four times as many people sucking back coffee in New York city alone than make a living farming .
According to the Bureau of Labor , there are just as many people employed in Architecture and Engineering as farming , hell , 3 million people working in Computer and Mathematical jobs .
But when one of these " What does America think about culture " pieces comes on , do I ever see a mid-30's software engineer onscreen bitching about having to download BitTorrents of " The IT Crowd " ?
Fuck and no .
Four million people in the US play World of Warcraft .
And yet , do I ever hear :
ANDERSON : We stopped by the gates of Ogrimmar in Durotar , on the east coast of Kalimdor , where one local told us Hollywood just can't relate to the level - grinding life .
UNIDENTIFIED ORC :
They 've never been back here , questing Razormane or Drygulch Ravine , y'know … or farming for Peacebloom and Silverleaf .
They 're out of touch .
No .
No I do not .
Video images showed people being led from a hotel in blindfolds
Iranians arrested
The Iranians were held at a checkpoint and detained overnight .
They were freed after the Iraqi government intervened .
Iran says the men were in the city at the invitation of Iraq 's government , and that the US action was unjustified .
An aide to the top US commander in Iraq later said the US accepted that the Iranians were on official business .
Dr Saadi Othman , adviser to Gen David Petraeus , told BBC News that the incident had " nothing to do " with US President George W Bush 's speech on Tuesday , in which he strongly criticised Iran for its alleged interference in Iraq .
Blindfolded
The Iranians were detained after they had been stopped in the company of seven Iraqis carrying unauthorised weapons on Tuesday night , the US military said .
The Iranian nationals were released in consultation with the government of Iraq
US military statement
Will Bush strike Iran ?
It said an AK - 47 assault rifle and two pistols were confiscated from the Iraqis .
The group was then taken to the Sheraton Ishtar Hotel , where US troops searched the Iranians ' rooms , seizing a computer , mobile phones and a briefcase full of money .
The men were also taken away for questioning , with video footage showing soldiers leading them out blindfolded and in handcuffs .
All the Iranians were later handed over to the Iraqi government .
It later emerged that the men were energy experts and were in the Iraqi capital to help rebuild the local electricity system .
Two of them were found to have diplomatic credentials .
Iran has said it is preparing a formal protest to Iraq .
' Murderous activities '
The arrests followed President Bush 's speech , in which he criticised Iranian interference in Iraq .
Tensions between the US and Iran are running high , with the US accusing Iran of providing arms , money and military training to Shia militias in Iraq .
Iran 's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere - we will confront this danger before it is too late
US President Bush
President Bush stated that he had authorised his military commanders in Iraq to confront what he called Iran 's " murderous activities " in the country .
" Iran 's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere .
We will confront this danger before it is too late , " Mr Bush said .
The president also said the entire region would be under the shadow of a " nuclear holocaust " if Iran developed nuclear weapons .
Tehran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful .
Earlier on Tuesday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said US power in Iraq was on the verge of collapse and this would lead to " a huge vacuum " which Iran would be willing to fill .
In January , five Iranians - who the US said were linked to Iran 's Revolutionary Guard and were training militants in Iraq - were captured in the northern city of Irbil .
They remain in US custody .

Authorities say they may have trouble identifying a body found on Interstate 880 before dawn Thursday because it was repeatedly struck by passing cars for about an hour during the morning commute .
The first call to the California Highway Patrol that something was amiss came before 6 a.m .
The caller reported a dead dog .
Officers arrived at southbound I - 880 in Hayward nearly an hour later and made the gruesome discovery .
On the ground was a human ear .
The CHP immediately called for the freeway to be closed .
It was 6:50 a.m. , less than a half hour before sunrise .
The remains of the man were strewn across five lanes and 1,000 feet of highway , CHP Officer Mike Davis said .
It appeared the body was first hit at about A Street .
There was so little recognizable from the body that identifying him is likely to require someone coming forward to report a missing friend or relative , investigating officers said .
" It looked like something that comes out of a horror movie , " Davis said .
It took authorities hours to process the scene , and the highway was reopened by 10 a.m .
Davis said the man was wearing jeans , white tennis shoes and a shirt , which was difficult to identify in the condition officers found it .
They found no identification and no vehicle nearby that could have belonged to him .
The victim appeared to be between ages 30 and 50 with a crew cut .
His ethnicity was unknown .
His clothes did not appear to be that of a homeless man or a vagrant , Davis said .
He also carried money in his pocket .
Davis said , based on preliminary evidence , it appeared the man was alive before he was hit .
Since the incident , the CHP has received about 80 phone calls from witnesses or drivers reporting hair or blood on their cars , Davis said .
The CHP is asking people to call if someone they know did n't arrive home Thursday after work or did n't show up for work .
Those wishing to report a missing person or other information about the incident can call the CHP at ( 510 ) 489-1500 .
Campaigning in Oklahoma the other day , the Republican senator John McCain was asked what should be done about Iran .
He responded by singing , " Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran " , to the tune of the Beach Boys ' Barbara Ann .
( Join the hilarity and see for yourself on YouTube . )
How can any thinking person disagree ?
I mean , any country with a president who does n't shave properly and never wears a tie deserves what 's coming to it - a lot of American bombs , with a few British ones thrown in to ensure we do n't miss out on the ensuing upsurge in terrorism .
The problem is how to unload enough bombs on Iran before next year 's US election to bring about enough flag - waving to get the Republican party re-elected .
This is essential if we are to safeguard the revenues of companies such as Halliburton - particularly at a time when the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction is discovering what a shoddy job Halliburton has been doing .
In projects at Nasiriya , Mosul and Hilla - declared successes by the US - inspectors have discovered buckled floors , crumbling concrete , failed generators and blocked sewage systems - due not to sabotage but largely to poor construction and lack of maintenance .
The trouble is that the re-election of the GOP is becoming more problematic as opinion turns against George Bush 's little invasion of Iraq .
Even Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah recently condemned the US action as " an illegal foreign occupation " ; his nephew , Prince Bandar , has n't been returning calls for weeks .
More worrying is the plummeting popularity of the party , as White House corruption becomes ever more difficult to disguise .
The LA Times reports that what Representative Thomas M Davis III called a " poisonous " environment has begun to dent fundraising - an unheard - of problem for the Republicans .
So the only solution is to bomb Iran , as Senator McCain so wisely and amusingly suggests .
The real issue is whether to use regular weapons or do the job properly and go nuclear .
Nuclear bombs have the advantage of being much bigger , and they will also pollute vast swathes of Iran and make much of the country uninhabitable for years .
With a bit of luck some of the fallout will sweep into Iraq and finish off the job the US and UK have begun without incurring more costs .
But the biggest advantage of nuclear weapons is that the repercussions would be so enormous , the upsurge in terrorism so overwhelming , that the world would be totally changed .
A year before 9/11 , Paul Wolfowitz and Lewis " Scooter " Libby signed a statement for the Project for the New American Century , a neoconservative thinktank .
They rather hoped for " some catastrophic and catalysing event like a new Pearl Harbor " to kickstart their dream of a world run by US military might .
A nuclear war would do the trick in spades .
The Republican party could expect to stay in power for the next 50 or even 100 years .
Of course , a large proportion of the human race could be wiped out in the process , but that should n't be a problem as long as there are anti-radiation suits for White House and Pentagon staff .
Such a shake - up would give the US a golden opportunity to corner what 's left of the world 's oil reserves .
In 1955 Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell said the world was faced by a " stark and dreadful and inescapable " choice : " Shall we put an end to the human race ; or shall mankind renounce war ? "
Senator McCain was n't bothered by such questions ; the human race may be standing on a precipice , but the Republicans have a chance of permanent re-election .

I received a nice letter from an editor at The Scientist asking for permission to reprint a comment I wrote regarding an article about the American Chemical Society titled " Unrest At The ACS " by Andrea Gawrylewski .
They even offered to throw in a free copy of the magazine .
Other than mentioning it in my blog I had forgotten all about that comment and I assumed the issue had blown over until I was reminded of it by a piece in Open Access News , courtesy of a writer named Peter Suber , today .
There were two main issues in the ACS piece published in " The Scientist " and it may have seemed odd that someone who simultaneously endorsed high executive salaries and free , open access science could comfortably exist in the same brain .
Yet exist I do .
Open access exists too and the ACS is just beginning to discover that riling up activists about it can take their public relations efforts to a weird place .
The article made a point of noting that there were incentives for executives who make profits for their publications .
" The Scientist " is also in business to generate revenue so someone , somewhere , in their company is getting paid based on performance .
I doubt their writers work for free .
So let 's forget that part of it and assume every media company has to make money .
The real crux of the issue is whether or not a non -profit corporation can use its membership fees to engage in competitive practices that the members might not like .
On Suber 's Open Access News I saw that an ACS member , Janet D. Stemwedel , wrote a letter to the ACS asking for a clarification of editorial policies at the ACS and the financial interests involved in them .
Turns out the writer works for a site called ScienceBlogs.com , which is owned by Seed Media - like " The Scientist " they publish a science magazine ( " Seed " , since I mentioned " The Scientist " by name and I want to be fair ) and they are in business , like most , to generate a profit for their investors .
That makes two writers at for - profit magazines going after a non-profit group regarding open access and giving away material for free - which boggles the imagination in a delightful way - but she made a key point :
Especially if ACS is using its resources ( as a non-profit membership organization ) to do things like lobby against open access , it might be worth examining which members are having their interests overlooked -- indeed , which members have interests that the ACS may actively be working against ....
So the issue the ACS must decide is whether or not ACS members benefit more by open access or by the system in place at the ACS publications .
Tough call .
Obviously I think open access has value .
I wrote an article , " Sharing Research Leads To Good Citations " based on work by Heather Piwowar in which she notes a survey finding that 48 % percent of the cancer microarray clinical trials with publicly available data accounted for 85 % of the aggregate citations .
Researchers who are under review or seeking funds do well to have an impressive list of citations to their credit and open access allows less work to be duplicated by other groups and also provides greater exposure to valued research for other researchers .
So open access clearly pays for the individual scientist .
Does it pay for executives with a six - figure salary ?
Not so much .
Rudy Baum , Editor - in - Chief of Chemical & Engineering News is unsurprisingly not a fan of the concept .
I happen to think that the extreme open access model advocated by its most rabid proponents is very bad idea that will do substantial harm to the scientific enterprise , and I have written to that effect .
I know you and some members of ACS disagree .
He did come out against open access , on political - economic grounds , particularly in this editorial , " Socialized Science " , stating
Many observers believe that , if the NIH policy takes effect , other funding agencies will quickly follow suit .
In short order , all research supported by the federal government would be posted on government websites six months after publication .
His contention is if we do n't have executives with six - figure salaries managing companies and making sure they generate revenue , there wo n't be any companies in publishing .
Where would we go for publishing if no one can make money ?
Yes , the government .
A valid point but , right or wrong , his stance makes him an enemy to the hard - core open access community , which constitutes a large part of the ' bloggers ' out there .
There 's a real issue for the ACS and then there 's a perception issue .
The real issue is that the Board of Directors at the ACS has to look at NIH and general open access , and the slippery slope that they feel leads toward mandatory publishing in the NIH 's PubMed archive or some government chemistry equivalent , as a threat .
I have no problem with that .
But I am not an ACS member and that is the important distinction .
The ACS is a member - funded group so they need to keep a close eye on the way the membership is leaning there .
Perceptually , was hiring a public relations company , Dezenhall Resources , to take on the open access movement a great idea ?
No , but of the four other writers mentioned in this article - Gawrylewski , Stemwedel , Baum and Suber - three of them are being paid by big media companies who could not afford to pay them if open access for everything was actually the case .
In that sense the ACS , Wiley and Elsevier were protecting the people criticizing them now .
In this instance money is n't the source of all evil , it can also be the source of freedom .
As I wrote in my blog on this topic , I think the ACS is difficult and openly hostile to independent media like us ( I wo n't rehash that part again ) , but they may not be all wrong on this part of the issue .
There is a certain amount of protectionism in Baum 's rhetoric but there is also a certain amount of rallying around independence .
Too much of modern science is reliant on government funding .
Were publishing to go the same route , I do n't see how that would be a positive for scientists .
Ask embryonic stem cell researchers what they think about having government involvement in their field .
Then segue that into publishing .
Like all wars , this one will end but open access is here to stay .
Those numbers I cited , 48 % of the trials having 85 % of the citations , are going to be noticed more and more .
Open access availability in biology is crucial to gene studies and it could be the case in chemistry at some point as well .
I just would n't rush to eliminate the strict standards at prestige publications and replace them with a completely open access model yet .
These data points represent not so much a shifting from one power center to another but rather a change in how financial power is distributed .
In this decade , the global economy has become multipolar .
“ On the one hand , we have tremendous strengths , ” says Robert Rubin , the former Treasury secretary and now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup .
“ We ’re located in the largest economy in the world .
On the other hand , London is creating a regulatory environment that seems to me is equally as effective in terms of safety and soundness .
Hong Kong and Singapore are clearly determined to develop as centers .
The Chinese are investing in Shanghai . ”
Like automakers and consumer - products companies ( Coca - Cola derives 70 percent of it sales outside North America ) , New York ’s leading financial institutions are trying to become global operators less reliant on domestic markets .
In the last few years , the N.Y.S.E. , the iconic symbol of Wall Street , has gone public , hired an aggressive , worldly C.E.O. ( the former Goldman Sachs president John Thain ) and merged with Euronext , which owns a derivatives market in London and stock exchanges in Paris , Brussels and Amsterdam .
In its most recent quarter , NYSE Euronext derived 44 percent of its revenue and 62 percent of its operating income from outside the United States .
Nasdaq , the second - largest New York exchange , was thwarted in its bid to buy the London Stock Exchange , but is taking a stake in OMX , which operates stock exchanges in Nordic countries in partnership with a Dubai investment firm .
The big investment banks closely identified with New York are increasingly international , too .
Goldman
Sachs recently boasted that half of its revenues came from overseas .
Overseas growth is good for shareholders and managing directors , who share in the profits .
But an alliance with a Chinese investment bank does n’t necessarily translate into jobs for the messengers and support staff at Goldman Sachs in New York .
What does all this diffusion mean for New York ’s economy ?
Potentially , a great deal .
Steve Malanga , senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute , estimates that there are 175,000 securities - industry jobs in New York , which pay an average wage of $ 350,000 .
The Committee on Capital Markets Regulation notes that the securities industry accounts for 4.7 percent of the jobs in New York City but 20.7 percent of the wages .
But the impact is even larger , since the spending of Wall Street hotshots supports a huge number of other jobs .
Between 1995 and 2005 , the sector grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 percent in New York and provided more than a third of business income - tax revenues , according to McKinsey .
“ There ’s no doubt that much of the financial and fiscal and economic revival of the city in the 1990s and then again after 9/11 can be attributed to the health and in fact dominance of Wall Street internationally , ” Malanga says .
A long - term decline , in which the financial - services business slowly moves offshore or out of state over a period of years , would certainly inflict great damage .
Without a manufacturing base , New York would become more dependent on its other large sectors like tourism , health care , government and education , none of which possess Wall Street ’s capacity for spinning enormous profits .
It seems inevitable that we will see many more studies about the loss of New York ’s status .
Unless they can persuade Congress to stop globalization and the free flow of capital around the globe , there is n’t much New York ’s billionaire financiers can do to stop the city ’s relative decline .
Because of the high costs of living and doing business in New York , the city is likely to continue to lose market share .
Take the case of BATS , an alternative trading platform based in Kansas City , Mo. , that has come out of nowhere to gain a 9 percent share in the market for trading United States stocks .
“ Our location is one of the principal factors that enabled us to go from start - up to the third - largest equities exchange in the U.S. in a matter of 18 months , ” says Joe Ratterman , its president and chief executive officer .
The company ’s computers reside in a New Jersey data center , and it has two sales representatives in New York .
But the rest of its 33 employees work out of a 10,000 - square - foot office complex with views of downtown Kansas City .
In a business in which competition is based on cost — BATS appeals to investors looking to save a few pennies on trades — a start - up in low - cost Kansas City has the same advantage over the N.Y.S.E. that a Chinese manufacturer does over a competitor in Ohio .

New York has stood at such inflection points before and survived .
“ Between 1860 and 1920 , the economy changed several times , from agricultural to industrial , and from industrial to financial , ” says Thomas Kessner , author of “ Capital City : New York City and the Men Behind America ’s Rise to Economic Dominance , 1860 - 1900 . ”
“ And each time , New York City was able to take advantage of the position it had achieved in previous standing and leverage that into leadership in the new era . ”

Young scientists say Fox sold them out to bash global warming Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Hannity & Colmes focused on negative comments from global warming panel After CNN aired its heavily promoted " Planet in Peril " series examining the impact of humans on the environment and the devastating impact of earth 's rising temperatures , competitor Fox News aired a segment aimed at debunking the " Al Gore rhetoric . "
Conservative host Sean Hannity made clear his disdain for CNN 's environmental alarm when the show he co-hosts convened a panel of graduate students to discuss the program .
Several students involved say their views were misrepresented , and they are now complaining the Fox talker made them out to be a bunch of science - denying rubes .
" We ... feel like we were sold out by Fox News , " Chris Hain , one of the participants , told RAW STORY .
Hain was one of about 10 graduate students at the University of Alabama - Huntsville who watched CNN 's four - hour mini-series then participated in a focus group led by Dr. John Christy , a professor at the school and prominent global warming skeptic .
" Using their so - called " Planet in Peril " series , the network [ CNN ] is scaring you , the American public , into believing the Al Gore rhetoric , " Hannity spat introducing his segment .
" Our cameras traveled to the University of Alabama , at Huntsville , to provide a very different perspective on a subject that by no means should be considered accepted science . "
Participants said the students participated in a lively , hourlong debate with at least half the students having a positive reaction to the CNN special , despite Hannity 's characterization .
In its heavily edited segment , Fox cut students ' quotes short to mischaracterize their sentiments and accent the negative , Hain claimed .
Will McCarty , a doctoral candidate at the university , is seen in the Hannity & Colmes segment saying that the CNN special lacked data because of ratings concerns .
" This whole ( CNN ) special was more of a human interest piece .
It was not here to give us numbers , numbers , numbers , numbers " he said in comments aired on Fox .
" We ( scientists ) like that , not everybody likes that in the world , and that 's not ratings . "
McCarty tells RAW STORY those comments were cut - off to portray a negative slant ; during the discussion , McCarty says , he praised CNN's " balanced " report and said its presentation was the " logical " approach to make a complex topic engaging for the average viewer .
( Those comments did n't find their way to Fox . )
" Nobody 's going to watch physics specials on PBS that they show you in high school for fun , " McCarty said in an interview Tuesday .
" That 's not going to teach anybody anything , 1.6 - degrees - celsius per decade does n't mean a lot to most people . "
Students said they knew of Christy 's views on global warming and Fox News 's bias before agreeing to the focus group , so the slanted segment was n't a huge surprise .
The professor / moderator defended the segment , saying Fox 's presentation was no worse than what appears on any other network covering controversial subject matter .
" If you look at Planet in Peril , that 's the first example of people slanting , " Christy told RAW STORY .
" I think Fox was trying to go the other way . "

NEARLY a century has passed but the Janus face of the Weimar Republic appals and attracts as much as ever .
On the one side , hyperinflation , mass unemployment and political assassination ; on the other , dazzling creativity in the arts and sciences — not to mention myriad forms of nightlife to suit every taste , however odd .
It was indeed , as Dickens said of the French revolution , the best of times and the worst of times , the spring of hope and the winter of despair .
Did Germany 's convulsive experiment with democracy between 1919 and 1933 ever stand a real chance ?
One might well think not .
Born in chaos after the slaughter of a war lost through what many Germans wrongly construed as a “ stab in the back ” , the fledgling republic was hamstrung from the start .
It concocted a “ perfect ” constitution that gave as much scope to its foes as to its friends , and it was saddled by vengeful victors with reparations demands that were all but impossible to meet .
Towards the end of the republic 's life , one - third of the labour force was jobless .
When Hitler 's matchless ability to tap resentment and hatred is added to this poisonous mix , Weimar 's plunge into dictatorship looks to have been inevitable .
Or was it ?
The real wonder is not that Weimar failed but that it lasted as long as it did — longer , after all , than the 12 years of Hitler 's “ 1,000 - year Reich ” .
For a while , from 1924 when the currency was stabilised ( or rather re-invented ) and the economy recovered , it even seemed to be succeeding against all the odds .
In the 1928 general election , extremists of left and right were trounced and the Nazis in particular were close to despair — until , that is , the Wall Street crash and subsequent depression gave them a new , finally decisive boost .
Through all these peaks and troughs , writers and artists and composers and the rest , as though rightly aware time was not on their side , flung out one formidable modern classic after another .
The literature on Weimar is immense , but we could well do with a single , authoritative , jargon - free volume that pulls all the strands together .
Eric Weitz , a professor at the University of Minnesota , has made a valiant stab at producing one , but he does not quite succeed .
He is a reliable guide through Weimar 's political and economic maze , and a good one on the social revolution that made many women ( far from all ) less dependent on husband , hearth and home .
In one of his best chapters , Mr Weitz takes us on a ramble through the sleepless metropolis of 1920s Berlin : from the glittering cafés around Potsdamer Platz to Isherwood 's cabarets and seedy bars , from the bracing beaches of Wannsee Lake to the dank and stifling dwellings of the workers ' quarter , Wedding .
The author 's touch is less sure when he turns to literature and music .
Naturally Mr Weitz had to be selective : but does it , for instance , make sense to devote six pages alone to Thomas Mann 's “ Der Zauberberg ” and next to nothing to the bitterly satirical work of Thomas 's elder brother Heinrich , who better saw where Weimar was stumbling ?
No quarrels with the choice of the Brecht / Weill “ Die Dreigroschenoper ” as a Weimar work par excellence ; but there is next to nothing on Schönberg ( who spent 1925 - 33 in Berlin ) nor on Berg or Krenek , nor on the Kroll Opera House , which under Klemperer and Zemlinsky presented Weimar 's — perhaps the world 's — most daring repertoire and stagings .
Nor will fans of the peerless Berlin Philharmonic easily forgive Mr Weitz for identifying their orchestra as the ( more lowly ) Berlin Symphony .
More seriously , Mr Weitz 's account badly lacks a context .
We learn much about the ( astonishing ) development of social security under Weimar , about seething anti-Semitism and diplomatic blunders .
What we lack is a scene - setting chapter explaining the background to all these things .
Nor is enough sketched about life in other great European cities to explain what made Weimar unique .
Were women less liberated in London , were artists less bold in Paris ?
Why was the political left bitterly split in Germany but not in Austria , which had lost not just a war but an empire ?
Whatever the flaws , this remains an often gripping ( and splendidly illustrated ) work from which two main lessons can be drawn .
One is how quickly democracy can slip away .
In 1928 the Nazis won just 2.6 % of the vote ; five years later Hitler was in power .
The other , which Mr Weitz rams home in his last pages , is how often democracy is under most threat not from enemies abroad but from those who use its institutions and claim to speak in its name .
These lessons are hardly new .
But they are well worth stressing at a time when , in the name of the fight against international terrorism , individual liberties in democratic societies are being steadily curtailed .
But if the New York State Lottery can assign the ticket to the hospital , Ms. Fazzina said , “ that ’s certainly something we would take a look at . ”
To that , his friend , Mr. Gallo , said , “ We need to help Wayne now . ”
Before he got sick , Mr. Schenk , who is unmarried and childless , got by with a series of odd jobs , like working as a roofer and for a local ski resort .
A year ago he bought a tavern , the Orange Inn , but it has been losing money since he became ill and has been unable to work .
On the night he won the lottery , he said , he went to the tavern to buy patrons a round of drinks before he had even announced his winnings , but his bartender said , “ I ’m not going to buy a round when you ca n’t pay your electrical bill . ”
Although Mr. Schenk did not reveal his good fortune that night , the bartender relented nonetheless .
His only health care comes from Veterans Affairs , from his stint in the Marines from 1976 to 1980 , including a tour in Lebanon .
For now , he drives about 90 miles from his home to the Syracuse V.A. Medical Center , but believes he can improve his chances of survival if he seeks treatment from a specialized cancer center .
First Mr. Schenk and Mr. Gallo tried lobbying the New York Lottery for a lump sum payment , to no avail .
“ We have to abide by the rules and regulations , ” said Susan Miller , deputy director of the state lottery , adding that Mr. Schenk ’s illness “ makes us wish we could in fact do something . ”

Some attorneys think Gonzales may be ripe to be disbarred Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 30 , 2007 Print This Email
This Some attorneys looking at the ethical issues raised by the firing of 8 US Attorneys think a case could be made that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales should be disbarred , according to a report in today 's New York Observer .
" It depends crucially on what the facts are ... Given the most unfavorable interpretation , theres clearly a case for disbarment , " David Luban , a law professor at the Georgetown University told the paper 's Anna Schneider - Mayerson .
Gonzales could face trouble with the Texas Bar Association for reportedly asking his former aide Monica Goodling to discuss her recollection of the process that led to the firing of the Attorneys .
He later told Congressional committees that he had avoided discussing the controversy with any of his employees in order to allow an internal investigation to proceed .
His participation as White House Counsel in a hospital room meeting with an ill Attorney General John Ashcroft to gain legal certification for a National Security Agency spying program could also place him into additional jeopardy .
" By seeking to advance an illegal scheme with the advantage of D.O.J. approval ....
Gonzales seriously interfered with the administration of justice , " Stephen Gillers , a New York University Law School ethicist , told the Observer .
Still , others think action against the Attorney General 's ability to practice law is unlikely .
" The state - bar associations are never going to take the lead unless Congress does something , Charles Silver , a University of Texas law professor told the paper , suggesting that the case was less open and shut than the five year suspension of President Bill Clinton 's law license in Arkansas after he lied about his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky .

The US fears any incursion could destabilise the region
The vote was taken in defiance of pressure from the US and Iraq , which have called on Turkey for restraint .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the motion does not mean a military operation is imminent .
But he said Turkey needed to be able to respond to a recent rise in bomb attacks blamed on PKK rebels from Iraq .
Turkish MPs backed him overwhelmingly , by 507 votes to 19 .
As the vote was being counted , US President George W Bush strongly urged Turkey , a key ally , not to carry out the threatened action .

He said Washington was " making it clear to Turkey it is not in their interest to send more troops in ... there is a better way to deal with the issue " .
The recent deaths of 13 Turkish soldiers in an ambush blamed on the PKK has put the government under renewed pressure to respond with force .
What Turkey wants now is a convincing response from allies and neighbours , says the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Ankara .
Turkey has been calling for help in tackling the PKK for months .
Now it hopes the rest of the world will realise it is serious , our correspondent says .
' Illegal '
But the US and Iraq fear any incursion could destabilise the only relatively calm region of Iraq .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki phoned the Turkish prime minister before the vote , saying he was " absolutely determined " to remove the PKK from Iraq and pleading for more time , according to Turkey 's Anatolia news agency .
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , an ethnic Kurd , urged Turkey not to make an incursion , but also called on the PKK " to end the so - called military activity " .
The autonomous Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq warned Turkish MPs that any intervention would be " illegal " .
It has denied providing the PKK with any help .

The rebels themselves said they would meet force with force .
The chief of the PKK 's executive council , Murat Karayilan , told the Kurdish Hawlati newspaper : " Thousands of PKK guerrillas are on standby to fight Turkish army forces . "
However Syrian President Bashar Assad , visiting Turkey , said he supported the country 's right to take the action " against terrorism and terrorist activities " .
Armenian question
President Bush , speaking during a press conference , criticised the US Congress for jeopardising US relations with Turkey with a planned vote to recognise the mass killing of Armenians in Ottoman times as genocide .
" One thing Congress should not be doing is sorting out the historical record of the Ottoman Empire , " he said .
Although a congressional committee has supported the motion , its chances of passing a full vote appear to be waning .
Key Democrats in the US House of Representatives have joined Republicans to warn that US strategic interests could be damaged by the largely symbolic resolution .
And they say irony is dead ...
ABC :
In an interview with ABC News , Secretary of State of Condoleezza Rice expressed concern about Russia 's increasing military assertiveness .
" I think the rapid growth in Russian military spending definitely bears watching , " Rice said .
" And frankly , some of the efforts - for instance , Bear flights in areas that we have n't seen for a while - are really not helpful to security . " [.. ]
Russia 's military spending has increased dramatically under President Putin .
U.S. intelligence estimates that Russia now spends as much on its military as China , which has also raised alarms with its build - up .
" Russia is once again indisputably the number two military power in the world , second only to the United States , " a senior U.S. official said .
Russia arms sales have also increased dramatically under Putin .
And when it comes to arms , the list of Russian customers reads like a who 's who of U.S. adversaries , including Iran , Syria , Venezuela and Burma .
Rice said she raised this issue directly in talks over the weekend with Russian leaders in Moscow .
" The Russians , of course , say that there 's nothing illegal about these arms sales , " Rice said .
" I [ told them ] not everything that is legal in the narrowest sense is good for the international system .

No Ninja Assassin
App that silently and efficiently does exactly what needs to be done with grace and precision thanks to hours of dedicated and exhaustive studying and training . :(
The Ninja Assassin App anticipates your needs and " takes care of " anything that gets in the way of you accomplishing your mission .
Plus , he 's ultra stylish ( in his all black ninja outfit ) , uses really cool weapons ( the right tool for the job , not just the latest buzz tech .
Centuries old shuriken anyone ? ) , and is just plain awesome all around .

Great post .
So are there any apps that do the job well , just like you 'd expect them to ?

Adobe Photoshop is the Brilliant but Tempermental guy !
I KNOW it can do amazing things for me , it 's just figuring out how to make it do what I want it to do is still a mystery .
I would fire it , but there is nothing even remotely close to being as good , much less better .

Mr Not My Job
Every approach is swiftly deflected with a recommendation to use somebody else , some other tool or plug - in .
Anything you actually want to achieve is , after all , not their job contrary to what you may have read / been told .
The reality is they are a confusing extra layer between you and what you really need - which may now unfortunately not be available at all .

Okay , I 'll play the part of the contrary dinner guest , i.e. , on the positive side , some apps actually deliver on their promise .
I 'm always looking to network with that app .

My apps ?
I 've written all kinds .
Ugly , perhaps even abrasive , and not too smart ; but reliable , and gets the job done .
Hard to understand ( complex ) .
Until the two of you get to know each other , life can be painful .
Once you 're good friends , they 're nice to have around , and you do n't understand why nobody else likes them .
Pretty and simple .
Do n't do much , but can do those few things well , and look good too .

Marketing spends a lot of time concealing things .
Take this box of Whole Wheat Ritz crackers .
The # 1 ingredient ?
White flour .
Or consider the fine print read in a hurry at the end of the car ad or the fact that most bottled water comes from the tap …
Most contracts are designed to conceal as much as to reveal , which is one reason lawyers get a bad rap .
If you set out to conceal as a marketer ( airbrushing a photo , leading with your strengths , staying within the letter if not the spirit of the law ) it 's easy to invent creative new ways to achieve your goals .
It sure feels as though you can stay ahead of the game .
A different technique is starting to gain traction , though .
Working to reveal instead of conceal .
My fish monger in Grand Central has started placing signs in front of each fish .
They describe exactly where the fish came from , whether it 's healthy and how endangered it is .
You 'll never see fine print saying " previously frozen . "
They do n't have any fine print .
The first few times you visit the stand , it 's actually off putting .
It takes the romance and pleasure out of buying the fish , because you realize that there 's a cost to it .
The meat guy across the way does n't have pictures of cows being slaughtered , does he ?
But after a while , because the information is out there , because smart fish buyers already know some fish is endangered , the signs give you power .
They allow you to make smart choices .
They send a message to the customer about the honesty and intent of the seller .
They build trust .
Once you embrace the idea of revealing as much as you can ( consider Amazon 's policy of selling the cheaper used copies right next to the new ones , as well as featuring ads from competitors on the same page ) it 's a lot easier to live and thrive online .
[ Jess sends us this post from her blog .
Apparently , Monsanto has made it against the law for Pennsylvania dairies to reveal what 's in ( and not in ) the milk they sell .
Astonishing . ]
References
This is how references are done now :
This is madness .
I could make a career out of exposing references that have nothing to do with , or directly contradict , the referenced statement .
( Here 's one . )
This system of referencing makes it very hard to do this -- and I wonder if that 's not the point .
It is , by contrast , very easy to link the exact article referenced -- even the exact page in the article .
Even Jezebel does this .
Online -- assuming it 's not a pdf even though this should n't matter -- when you click on the superscript it takes you to the references , which has a further link to the actual article ( but not the statement . )
Ok -- why the extra step ?
Note that the way references are done here is antithetical to science .
Look at the reference pictured above .
What do you see ?
What is important ?
What you see are the authors and the journal , not the scientific content .
That 's what 's implied to be important .
We 're supposed to accept the science of a statement by the force of the author and journal ?
But that speaks to my later point about bias .
Subscription
Why should government or Pharma sponsored research require me to pay someone else ( the Journal ) for access to that information ?
And why only licensed academics ?
So , if I 'm a welder in Kentucky , I can't know what 's really up with Depakote for bipolar ?
I have to read some nut blogger ?
It is a simple process for a Journal to host online all articles as free text .
Or , better , scientists can publish their work on their own site ( hosted by a university , etc , if necessary . )
Neither are Journals necessary as repositories of vetted information .
There are numerous ways these scattered articles can be collated , packaged and even summarized for easy use .
Slashdot , Digg , and others are very effective in this regard ; and something similar can be done with science .
I know , Digg can be gamed .
What , Journal of Clinical Psychiatry can't ?
Where 's The Raw Data ?
Rephrasing from above : why am I not allowed to see the raw data from a government sponsored study ?
( And from Pharma -- if they agree to do a study , then they must agree to make all data public . )
You may have heard that there are rumblings about making this data accessible -- but not to everyone ; only to those with appropriate access ( academics , etc . )
Again -- why ?
Slow
This is a common lament , but it misses the point : it is artificially slow .
As in on purpose .
Articles that are submitted for peer review should simply be published in a " pending peer review " section .
Other sciences already do this .
To the criticism that doctors may act on unreviewed science , it should be noted that citing " personal communication " ( e.g. an email ) as a reference is perfectly acceptable .
Is that safer ?
Oh , and about that peer review :
Peer Review
Even with the most malicious intentions , it would be nearly impossible to create a worse system than peer review .
Peer review does not have the potential for bias ; it is specifically designed to retain bias , and to maintain the primacy of subjective opinion over objective findings .
The only people who support peer review are other peer reviewers .
If necessary , money should be diverted from pediatric AIDS research to help stop to this oligochracy .
It 's that important .
In medicine , " peer review " is the editor of a journal and three other doctors - that the author suggests as reviewers .
While ostensibly the author 's identity is unknown to the reviewers , in practice it is simple to determine authorship ( type of research ; meetings ; and even document metadata . )
Oh , and the editor knows who you are .
Most people think peer review is some infallible system for evaluating knowledge .
It 's not .
Here 's what peer review does not do : it does not try to verify the accuracy of the content .
They do not have access to the raw data .
They do n't re-run the statistical calculations to see if they 're correct .
They do n't look up references to see if they are appropriate / accurate .
So what do they do ?
They look for study " importance " and " relevance . "
You know what that means ?
Nothing .
It means four people think the article is important .
Imagine the four members of the current Administration " peer reviewing " news stories for the NY Times .
On the force of the recommendation of these three reviewers and the editor -- who , by the way , decides whether to even send it to reviewers at all , or reject it outright -- the article gets published or not .
And there is no right to an appeal .
Imagine a movie gets previewed by four people who decide if the movie is important or not , and whether it will play in theatres .
You know what you get ?
Notes On A Scandal , that 's what .
And riots .
The peer review system also promotes the perpetuation of biases .
Doctors are subtly pressed into writing articles about certain topics -- consider the Depakote madness of 2000 - 2004 ; the noradrenergic hypothesis of depression in the 70s ( where 'd that go ? ) ; and how every issue of BMJ has an article on war .
( Except July 2008 : that was the month they wrote about whether to boycott Israeli academic institutions .
Ok . )
Academic careers are made , in part , by the number and quality ( i.e. journal ) of publications , which will be influenced by what they think certain journals would publish .
" My research focuses on things my Chairman really likes . "
Ca n't wait to read more about evolutionary psychology .
Lack of Debate
There is no way to have a meaningful debate about an article within the Journal system .
How do you crowdsource a medical study ?
As an example : if I find a logical error in an article ( e.g. mistaking correlation for causation ) I can only point this out by writing a " Letter To The Editor , " which , you will be surprised to learn , goes to the editor .
Even if it is published , my Letter will have little attention .
But while anyone smart enough can critique a study , only an academic can write the Letter .
It is unnecessary to point out that the rest of the internet -- including news -- works very differently .
Disclosure of Conflict of Interest
Almost completely invalid for its intended purpose .
If a doctor does a promotional program , a " drug talk " , he has to disclose the relationship .
But if a doctor is dating a drug rep -- that relationship he does n't need to disclose .
Even more strange is that these are commercial conflicts of interest , only .
If you are a communist , or Priest of Scientology , or a serial pedophile ; these are not disclosures , even if your article happens to be " Incidence Of Pedophilia Among Communists . "
Neither is being funded by the NIH ( any surprise that NIH studies always find that the generic is the best ? )
Or being married to the Chair at Harvard .
Or having a son on the drug .
Are n't personal beliefs a bias ?
To single those out commercial interests as somehow more damaging , more biasing than any others is preposterous .
It 's not a false sense of security ; it 's a deliberate misdirection from all the other things that actually bias science .
And it sidesteps the entire point of scientific articles -- if they are truly scientific , if the articles were truly " peer reviewed " -- it should n't matter what your biases are .
I could own Pfizer .
The article on Zoloft should be able to stand on its own .
It 's worth observing that the peer reviewers are not asked to disclose any of their commercial interests .
Boring
No exposition needed .
Either less words or better words .
Abstracts As Promos
See this blog post , where it starts out , " I know , right : only ten ? " and then you have to click to get the full article ?
So my promo has really no useful information in it .
You know why ?
Because I am a blogger , that 's why .
Contrast that with the abstract from an important study on Lamictal for maintenance treatment in bipolar ( emphasis mine ) :
Conclusions
Both lamotrigine and lithium were superior to placebo for the prevention of relapse or recurrence of mood episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder who had recently experienced a manic or hypomanic episode .
The results indicate that lamotrigine is an effective , well - tolerated maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder , particularly for prophylaxis of depression .
The Conclusions seem to say Lamictal is good for preventing " mood episodes " , mania and depression -- is there any other way to interpret it ?
In fact , this study shows it is only good for preventing depression , not mania at all .
Why is it written this way ?
Because the authors want to advance the idea that Lamictal is a " mood stabilizer " and not what it actually is : an antidepressant .
You have to understand that most doctors do not read the study , they do n't even read the abstract -- they skim the abstract .
For this reason , the abstract has to be an accurate summary of the article , not a promo for an idea .
But that 's why it is written this way ; it 's not about the findings , it 's about the authors ' agenda .
What 's stupid about this is that negative findings are as important to a clinician as positive findings .
They are less important , of course , to academics whose careers depend on positive findings , and the drug companies who sponsor them .
Advertisements
Pick up a medical journal -- inside you will see drug ads .
I have n't heard many people complain that this influences the science in the journals , the way authors ' " conflicts of interest " is supposed to .
But before you respond , consider that the ads are only for one product per class .
For example , in the NEJM , there is a two - page , full color ad for Lipitor , but none for any other cholesterol drug .
Oh , my mistake -- there are two , two page ads for Lipitor ( running $ 32,000 per issue ) .
Same with one inhaled insulin ; one antidepressant ( Effexor ) ; one sleeper ( Rozerem ) etc , etc .
If having ties to Pharma influences the outcome of science , what is the effect of having a financial ties to only one Pharma company per class ? ( 1 )
Inflation In Studies
Reducing the value of something by increasing its availability is inflation .
This is magnified when the thing in question did n't have much value to begin with .
Three strategies :
The same data set , or the same thesis , is reworked into several different articles for different publications .
This may seem a benign way to pad your CV , but what it does is fool people into thinking something has more support than it actually does .
This is precisely how Depakote became a bipolar colossus .
A topic is investigated multiple times , when even one time was too many .
A finding is described as novel or at least interesting , when it had already been published years earlier by a less " important " researcher .
( nod to Glen for this one )
IF YOU THINK THIS ARTICLE IS USEFUL , PLEASE TWEET , REDDIT , ETC , IT .
AND SEND IT TO OTHERS .
NOTHING CHANGES WITHOUT MOMENTUM .

1 . I wondered if psychiatry journals , having a more limited range ( e.g. no insulin ads ) would have broader coverage of companies .
They did , sort of .
Archives , CNS Spectrums , Primary Psychiatry , etc , all had multiple antipsychotic ads ( never more than three brands , though ) but always only one antidepressant .
Not sure what to make of that .

The chief Deputy Director of National Intelligence says that Americans need to redefine privacy and must learn to trust the government with their private information :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
As Congress debates new rules for government eavesdropping , a top intelligence official says it is time that people in the United States change their definition of privacy .
Privacy no longer can mean anonymity , says Donald Kerr , the principal deputy director of national intelligence .
Instead , it should mean that government and businesses properly safeguard people ’s private communications and financial information .
In justifying this new definition of privacy , Kerr cites the growth of the Internet , and especially of social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace :
Kerr said at an October intelligence conference in San Antonio , Texas , that he finds it odd that some would be concerned that the government may be listening in when people are “ perfectly willing for a green - card holder at an [ Internet service provider ] who may or may have not have been an illegal entrant to the United States to handle their data . ”
He noted that government employees face up to five years in prison and $ 100,000 in fines if convicted of misusing private information .
Millions of people in this country — particularly young people — already have surrendered anonymity to social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook , and to Internet commerce .
These sites reveal to the public , government and corporations what was once closely guarded information , like personal statistics and credit card numbers .
“ Those two generations younger than we are have a very different idea of what is essential privacy , what they would wish to protect about their lives and affairs .
And so , it ’s not for us to inflict one size fits all , ” said Kerr , 68 .
“ Protecting anonymity is n’t a fight that can be won .
Anyone that ’s typed in their name on Google understands that . ”
Kerr ’s analogy is flawed , of course , because of the fundamental difference between government monitoring and most private transactions on the Internet .
For the most part , the information that ’s available about individuals online is there for one of two reasons ; either it ’s something that ’s publicly available ( like a newspaper article ) , or it ’s information that people have voluntarily given up in exchange for a service .
If I setup a Facebook page that others can access it ’s not the same as the government being able to monitor my private conversations and transactions .
And that , it seems , may be exactly what ’s going on :
The central witness in a California lawsuit against AT&T says the government is vacuuming up billions of e-mails and phone calls as they pass through an AT&T switching station in San Francisco , California .
Mark Klein , a retired AT&T technician , helped connect a device in 2003 that he says diverted and copied onto a government supercomputer every call , e-mail , and Internet site access on AT&T lines .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which filed the class - action suit , claims there are as many as 20 such sites in the U.S .
That ’s fundamentally different from what Kerr is talking about .
And , as a lawyer for the EFF notes , his arguments against anonymity ignore the importance that it has played in American history :
“ Anonymity has been important since the Federalist Papers were written under pseudonyms , ” Opsahl said .
“ The government has tremendous power : the police power , the ability to arrest , to detain , to take away rights .
Tying together that someone has spoken out on an issue with their identity is a far more dangerous thing if it is the government that is trying to tie it together . ”
Publius would not have survived under the regime that that Kerr is proposing and that alone should be reasons to second - guess him .
Conyers to Gonzales : No , let 's keep talking about the US Attorneys Michael Roston
Published : Thursday May 10 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) replied to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' suggestion at this morning 's House Judiciary Committee hearing that Congress focus on issues other than the firing of US Attorneys by stating that he 'd continue to investigate the matter .
" My hope is that the members will focus their questions today on the US Attorneys and related matters , " the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said in the Thursday morning hearing .
He called for a hearing at a later time to deal with oversight of Justice Department law enforcement activities .
Conyers also suggested that the White House had tried to create " a bigger Republican farm team " full of " loyal Bushies " within the Justice Department .
The Michigan Democrat warned that there was a " cover up " going on .
" One asks whether the administration is trying to cover up two simple truths : who created the list , and why ? " he asked , referring to the list of US Attorneys that were fired by the Justice Department .
Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) , the committee 's ranking minority member , then accused the Democratic members of the committee of pressing their investigation for partisan reasons and suggested that the investigation could be " wrapped up " quickly .
" For nearly two months , the White House has offered to let us interview its employees and review its documents , " Smith said of White House Counsel Fred Fielding 's offer of an " off the record " interview with key White House staff , including Karl Rove and former counsel Harriet Miers .
" We need to take that offer .
If we had accepted it , our answers may have been answered long ago . "
After a procedural objection by Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - CA ) over a protester from the group Code Pink , Conyers had the protester removed , telling her , " With the right attire you 're perfectly able to attend this hearing . "
New Mexico lawyers sought US Attorney 's ouster
In the question and answer , Conyers focused on how various US Attorneys were added to the list .
Dissatisfied with Gonzales ' reply that his former chief of staff D. Kyle Sampson had followed a process that was previously described , Conyers turned to a specific matter  the firing of the Attorney for New Mexico , David Iglesias .
The Chairman described the testimony of Matthew Friedrich , a counselor to Gonzales , who told the committee in the course of its investigation that he had met with " two prominent New Mexico attorneys " who wanted Iglesias to be removed .
Gonzales acknowledged that he was aware of the discussions and added , that he had " No reason to believe [ Friedrich 's account was ] not correct . "
On the question of Iglesias , Gonzales also said he had been contacted by Senator Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) about his lack of confidence in the US Attorney and confirmed that he had discussed voter fraud cases with Karl Rove , including those relating to Iglesias ' work .
" In a conversation he had with me , he raised concern about voter fraud prosecutions in three jurisdictions , including New Mexico , " said Gonzales , pointing to a Fall 2006 conversation .
Rep. Linda Sánchez ( D - CA ) , who chairs the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law , which is leading the US Attorneys investigation , then challenged Gonzales on the appearance of impropriety in the case of Deborah Wong Yang .
Yang stepped down from her position as US Attorney to join a firm that represented Rep. Jerry Lewis ( R - CA ) , who was being investigated within her district on public corruption charges .
Sánchez pointed out that Yang received a large hiring bonus , according to a recent New York Times article , and suggested that there appeared to be a conflict of interest .
But the Attorney General was unfazed .
He first suggested that however much they paid her , " it was a bargain , " and he then said no conflict of interest had occurred .
" I 'm presuming , knowing Deb Yang the way that I do ... she would be recused to anything related to that matter , " he said , adding that " Despite her departure , that case will continue as it should . "
Sánchez then wrangled with Republican members of the committee who objected to her referring to Rep.
Lewis a " target , " and called for her remarks to be stricken from the record .
Sánchez agreed to have the word " target " removed .
Gonzales says Bush involved in sacking Attorneys When Rep. Bobby Scott ( D - VA ) subsequently asked the Attorney General if the White House had asked the Justice Department to remove certain US Attorneys .
Gonzales repeated his earlier explanation about Rove raising concerns about voter fraud cases in three federal districts .
Gonzales then suggested that the President had been looped into one conversation on the subject .
" I 've now been made aware of the fact that there was a conversation with the President that basically mentioned [ the voter fraud cases ] in October of 2006 , " Gonzales explained , although he offered no further details .
Returning to Yang 's case , Scott then asked if former White House counsel Harriet Miers had sought to have her removed from office .
Gonzales suggested that Miers was aware of Yang 's desire to earn more money in the private sector .
" I think that Ms. Miers may have known about Ms. Yang 's concern about continuing to remain on the job for financial reasons , " he said , adding that Miers knew that Yang 's district was " very important . "
Gonzales pressed on ' 9th ' fired US Attorney The Washington Post today quoted a former US Attorney in Missouri , Todd Graves , as stating that he had been pushed out of his position after an early 2006 conversation with former top Justice Department official Michael Battle .
Battle , Graves said " made clear to me the fact I was getting a push . "
He added , " I felt like I was no longer welcome in the department . "
But when Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) queried Gonzales on the subject , the Attorney General pushed back .
" I have no basis to believe that in fact Mr. Graves , that that particular case had anything to do with Mr. Graves departure , " he said .
The Attorney General was referring to a lawsuit against the State of Missouri pertaining to its voting rolls that the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division had planned to bring , which Graves refused to sign on to .
Just before 11 AM , the Committee recessed so members could head to the House floor for a series of votes .

" Teach your children Chinese , now . . . the biggest boom over the next two decades is going to be in Asia led by China , " said Jim Rogers , commodities guru and Guinness record - holder for his epic round - the - world trip , at a meeting organised by Anand Rathi , a private brokerage , for its investors on Wednesday .
Rogers , who quit his fund manager 's job at Quantum at the age of 37 , warned investors against betting on dollar denominated assets and said he was bullish on the commodities market .
" I have hired a Chinese maid for my two - and - a - half year old daughter whose only job is to talk to her in Chinese .
. . my daughter has an account in a Swiss bank , " he said , opening his attack on the US government 's economic policies .
Rogers , famous for generating 4,200 per cent returns in 10 years on the fund under his management , said he was against further investments in " western " stock markets and favoured commodities as an investment option .
" The ( US ) central bank likes to make its printing press work as fast as possible , but that is clearly not a sustainable proposition .
. .
Stocks in the West are very expensive while on the contrary , commodities are at a stage where people do not understand them as an investment option .
" Currently , the world commodity market is poised the way the US equity markets were poised in the early ' 80s , ( on the verge of a boom . )
History tells us that bull markets run for an average of 23 years , " he pointed out .
" So the commodities markets have one more decade of bull run , " he added .
He said due to low commodity prices in the last 25 years , companies had not made capital investments to increase production , creating conditions ripe for sustained high prices in the future .
" For instance , only one new lead mine has come up in the last 25 years and only one oil - field in the last 35 ....
Countries like Malaysia , Indonesia , those in Europe and China , which were exporters until a few years ago , are likely to turn importers within the decade , " he pointed out .
Rogers advised investors to concentrate on agriculture commodities , which he said , were undervalued compared with metals and oil .
" All agriculture commodities are where people should be looking for opportunities right now while most metals and energy have gone to near all - time highs , and most agriculture products are far below their all - time highs .
International sugar is 80 per cent below its all - time high and one should look at cotton , soya - beans , maize , coffee and perhaps tea , " he advised .
He also said gold was likely to continue its bull run and breach the $ 900 - an - ounce mark and that one should not be surprised to see oil breaching the $ 150 mark in the next few years .
Fuel Ghoul is drowning in water disputes this summer !
First it was the lunacy of letting Coke and Pepsi bottle our public water , and now its become clear that the US government is plotting to capture a large percentage of Canada 's fresh water supply using the North American Free Trade Agreement !
This discussion on WonderCafe.ca serves to educate everyone on the perversions of certain US political organizations and their thirst for this most precious Canadian resource .
Travis Lupick , a reporter for an online newspaper called The Straight wrote on August 16 , 2007 about a noisy demonstration outside the Westin Bayshore hotel in Vancouver two days earlier .
It seems this dispute is the latest in a growing campaign of resistance to the proposed Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) of North America .
Police kept protesters out of the Vancouver hotel on August 14 , where international trade representatives from Canada , the US , and Mexico were holding talks .
Apparently the SPP meeting was focused on the possibility of bulk - water sales and diversions of fresh water from Canada to the US .
Do you feel like demonstrating ?
On August 20 and 21 , the SPP will host a North American Leaders ' Summit in Montebello , Quebec .
Peter Julian , MP for Burnaby–New Westminster , believes that Canada 's fresh water will once again be on the table .
The NDP has obtained a " concept paper " prepared by an American think - tank involved in the SPP .
It emphasizes Canada 's relative abundance of fresh water and proposes rewriting transboundary water­ - management agreements for the North American continent .
The author , Armand B. Peschard - Sverdrup , is director of the Mexico Project for the Washington , D.C. based Centre for Strategic & International Studies .
There is something wrong with our politicians - they are weak !
Fuel Ghoul predicts that everyone living north of the border can now expect our water to enter into the same power struggles that characterize energy and softwood - lumber negotiations .
" Decisions around forestry policy are n't made in Victoria or Ottawa , they 're made in Washington " Peter Julian told Travis Lupick , " We could be seeing the same type of thing for water policy if the SPP continues . "
Instead of directly vetting the script he would read for the Guard segment , Mr. Rather says , he acceded to pressure from Mr. Heyward to focus instead on his reporting from Florida on Hurricane Frances , and on Bill Clinton ’s heart surgery .
Mr. Rather says in the filing that he allowed himself to be reduced to little more than a patsy in the furor that followed , after CBS — and later the outside panel it commissioned — concluded that the report was based on documents that could not be authenticated .
Under pressure , Mr. Rather says , he delivered a public apology on his newscast on Sept. 20 , 2004 — written not by him but by a CBS corporate publicist — “ despite his own personal feelings that no public apology from him was warranted . ”
He now leads a weekly news program on HDNet — an obscure cable channel in which he is seen by only a small fraction of the millions of viewers who once turned to him in his heyday to receive the news of the day .
In filing his suit now — three years after the now - disputed report was first broadcast , and more than a year after he reluctantly left CBS , as his last contract wound down — Mr. Rather is following , by a matter of weeks , the announcement by CBS that it had settled a similar lawsuit by Don Imus .
Mr. Imus had sued CBS over his firing in the aftermath of derogatory remarks he made about the Rutgers University women ’s basketball team .
While some Imus associates suggested last month that his final payment was at least $ 20 million , CBS Radio has characterized that figure as too high .
Mr. Rather ’s suit seeks $ 20 million in compensatory damages and $ 50 million in punitive damages .
Among the pivotal points of contention in Mr. Rather ’s suit are the definitions of the words “ full - time ” and “ regular . ”
As quoted in the filing , Mr. Rather ’s contract — which he signed in 2002 , and which called for him to be paid a base salary of $ 6 million a year as anchor — entitled him to a job as a “ full - time correspondent ” with “ first billing ” on the midweek edition of “ 60 Minutes , ” should he leave the anchor chair before March 2006 , his 25th anniversary in the job .
As it turned out , Mr. Rather would leave the anchor chair a year early , and would indeed be reassigned to the midweek edition , known as “ 60 Minutes II . ”
When that broadcast was canceled a few months later , Mr. Rather ’s contract called for him to be reassigned to the main “ 60 Minutes ” broadcast on Sunday evening , where he would “ perform services on a regular basis as a correspondent . ”
Lonely people can be vulnerable to illness
The UCLA research , published in Genome Biology , found certain genes were more active in people who reported feelings of social isolation .
Many of the genes identified have links to the immune system and tissue inflammation - which may be damaging .
Other studies have shown clear links between lack of social support and illnesses such as heart disease .
The biological impact of social isolation reaches down into some of our most important basic internal processes - the activity of our genes .
Dr Stephen Cole , UCLA
The researchers said that quality , not quantity , of friendships , appeared to be important .
The link between genes and loneliness has been explored before - a recent Dutch study of 8,000 twins also pointed to the connection .
The UCLA research looked in more detail at which genes might be involved .
They took 14 volunteers and assessed their level of social interaction using a scoring system .
They then looked at genetic activity in their white blood cells and tried to compare the results .
In their " lonely " volunteers , various genes tended to be " over expressed " compared with those at the opposite end of the scoring scale .
These often had known links to the body 's mechanisms for fighting off disease , such producing inflammation .
Too much inflammation can damage tissues and cause disease .
Other genes , including those thought to be important in fighting viruses and producing immune antibodies , were less active compared with the non-lonely volunteers .
Dr Steven Cole , who led the study , said : " What this shows us is the biological impact of social isolation reaches down into some of our most important basic internal processes - the activity of our genes .
" These findings provide molecular targets for our efforts to block the adverse health effects of social isolation . "
Close friendships
He said the differences he found were not connected to other factors such as the age , wealth or health of the people involved , but were specifically connected to their feelings of social isolation .
They were unconnected with the size of the person 's social network .
Dr Cole said : " What counts , at the level of gene expression , is not how many people you know , it 's how many you feel really close to over time . "
He said that in future , the gene profile he 'd identified might help doctors work out whether therapies to ease loneliness were effective .
Professor Andrew Steptoe , who carries out research into the biological effects of psychological conditions at University College London , said that the findings were " plausible " .
He said : " We know that social isolation and lack of social support may compromise your health .
" We can say there is an association here , but we can't say definitively that the social isolation is causing any change in gene expression . "
Viacom is n't the only organization involved in sending out " bass - ackwards " DMCA takedown notices ; the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America ( abbreviated , for complicated reasons , as the SFWA ) is in on the fun as well .
The group has issued DMCA takedown notices for sci - fi reading lists drawn up to aid teen literacy , freely - distributed webzines , and Creative Commons - licensed material .
The debacle began a few weeks back when the SFWA contacted Scribd , a site that allows users to post documents in the same way that YouTube allows people to post videos .
SFWA alleged that numerous works on Scribd violated copyrights of SFWA members and requested that these works be taken down .
They were .
But it quickly became apparent that the USS 1701 - SFWA had a crack in its dilithium crystals .
Stories began to emerge from the blogosphere , and not the sort of Stranger in a Strange Land stuff that the SFWA exists to promote .
Nick Senger , an eighth - grade teacher and promoter of teen literacy , found his sci- fi bibliography targeted in the crackdown .
" I 'm not sure what the SFWA has to gain by requesting that the list be removed , " he notes .
" That list does nothing but encourage people to buy their books . "
The editors of a magazine called Ray Gun Revival also learned that their work had been yanked after a DMCA complaint from the SFWA .
The only problem was they had purposely released the magazine for free distribution on Scribd .
The editors had harsh words for the SFWA .
" Whether this is a misunderstanding or not is n't the issue , " one wrote on the group 's blog .
" What is apparent is that the SFWA are policing Scribd , filing takedown notices on behalf of organizations they have nothing to do with .
In our case , they ’re not only not protecting our magazine , they are harming our ability to gain the most exposure for our contributors through cool services such as Scribd . "
( In the comments to this blog entry , SFWA president Michael Capobianco apologized for the situation . )
And blogger / author / professional - loather - of - DRM Cory Doctorow notes that his own Creative Commons - licensed novel Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom had been pulled at the SFWA 's request .
Doctorow points out 1 ) that the book is specifically allowed to be redistributed free of charge and 2 ) that he has told the SFWA not to handle rights issues pertaining to his work .
The SFWA 's actions are already causing a small backlash against Doctorow .
" Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom was the first novel released under a Creative Commons license , and I 've spent the past four years exhorting fans to copy my work and share it , " Doctorow writes .
" Now I 've started to hear from readers who 've seen this notice and concluded that I am a hypocrite who uses SFWA to send out legal threats to people who heeded my exhortation . "
Because DMCA takedown notices require a sworn statement from the sender that the works in question are actually infringing ( and that the sender has the right to handle copyright issues related to those works ) , the SFWA could actually find itself in the legal equivalent of a Vogon airlock over the notices .
What appears to have happened is that the group ran a Scribd search for certain author names and then issued takedown notices for all the results —
Doctorow 's book makes a reference to Isaac Asimov , for instance , and Senger 's reading list is populated with the names of great sci- fi authors .
This , it hardly needs to be said , is a less than foolproof way to police copyrights .
Perhaps it 's time for the SFWA 's legal team to guide the ship to a starbase for some needed repairs .
I picked up Mario Galaxy last night and have been enjoying it , both as a game , and also picking it apart technically .
The level design really stands out in how it consistently surprises you with creative platforming gameplay .
But what ’s more interesting is how Nintendo is using the modest Wii hardware to achieve its graphical effects .
I could never quite tell from the YouTube previews , but it appears Mario ’s using something like stencil shadow volumes to handle all its shadows – which are always projected in gravity ’s direction .
Unfortunately this technique means unsmoothed edges and a uniform brightness for all shaded areas .
Side effects include moving platforms whose shadows suddenly blink onto surfaces when they approach , and suddenly disappear as they pass .
An element that Galaxy uses all over the place to great effect is something like a fake rim lighting shader .
From what I understand , the Wii is n’t fragment shader capable , so maybe they ’re faking it by setting an independent directional light aimed reverse relative to camera for each rimlit object ?
I ’ve read a few things about the Wii ’s Register Combiners and TEVs , and I wonder if they ’re using them for pixel shadery purposes .
It ’s all that lighting around the silhouettes of objects that helps give the characters and environments that signature plastic pop .
The fur shading is fairly nice as well , and I wonder how they ’re doing it on the Wii hardware , whether it ’s an actual shader , or they ’re doing tricks rendering a multilayered shell of increasingly translucent polygons like in Shadow of the Colossus
Anyway , I am really enjoying the game so far , and the art direction is top notch .
It ’s also great to play Mario along to a live orchestral score — too bad Nintendo did n’t make the switch in time for Twilight Princess .
The shadows are the only real graphical let - down .
It seems like they could be doing something more clever with the alleged crazy fill - rate on the Wii .
Blurred textured shadow maps for near geometry or something ?
Also , multisampling would be nice , but playing on a standard def tv is forgiving .
I ’d love to hear other people ’s insights into the graphics behind the game .
The rim lighting shading is something that could be easily applied to indie games looking for some eye candy punch …
The other day in the #haskell IRC channel , some of us were playing around with generalizing Haskell list enumeration syntax :
Prelude > [ 1..5 ] [ 1,2,3,4,5 ]
First , we defined the ( … ) operator to perform enumeration , so it can be partially applied .
( Unfortunately , we ca n’t define a ( ..) operator for this purpose , since it ’s reserved syntax . )
Prelude > let x ... y = [ x..y ]
Prelude > map (...4 ) [ 1,3,7 ] [ [ 1,2,3,4 ] , [ 3,4 ] , [ ] ]
So , how to generalize ?
Someone typed this :
Prelude > let x .... y = map ( x... ) ( x...y ) Prelude > 1 .... 3 [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ]
Interesting !
And what about five dots ?
Unfortunately , this does n’t work :
Prelude > let x ..... y = map ( x... ) ( x....y ) < interactive >: 1:28 : Occurs check : cannot construct the infinite type : a = [ a ]
Expected type : [ a ]
Inferred type : [ [ a ] ]
In the second argument of `map ' , namely `(x .... y ) '
In the expression : map ( ( x ... ) ) ( x .... y)
Of course , the problem is that ( x …. y ) has type [ [ a ] ] , so we ca n’t just use map ( x … ) , we have to map twice in order to reach the proper depth :
Prelude > let x ..... y = map ( map ( x... ) ) ( x .... y) Prelude > 1 ..... 3 [ [ [ 1 ] ] , [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] ] , [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ] ]
We could keep going , although it gets increasingly difficult to tell apart the number of dots .
x ...... y = ( map . map . map ) ( x... ) ( x ..... y ) x ....... y = ( map . map . map . map ) ( x... ) ( x ...... y ) ...
Let ’s take a step back and think about what is going on here .
First , ( 1…3 ) just means we are counting from 1 up to 3 : [ 1,2,3 ] .
At the next level , ( 1 .... 3 ) means we are counting up to ( 1 … 3 ) = [ 1,2,3 ] : first [ 1 ] , then [ 1,2 ] , then [ 1,2,3 ] .
So ( 1 .... 3 ) = [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ] .
We can illustrate it thus :
1 1 2 1 2 3
Then ( 1 ..... 3 ) means we ’re counting up to THAT : first [ [ 1 ] ] , then [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] ] , then [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ] .
Any guesses on a nice visualization ?
That ’s right , it ’s a tetrahedron !
In general , continuing this procedure gives us higher - and higher - dimensional simplices .
From this perspective , an expression like [ 1..5 ] is really giving us discrete points on a 1 - simplex , i.e. a line .
Now , the big question : can we generalize the operators ( … ) , ( …. ) , ( ….. ) , etc. into a single higher - order function which can compute this “ simplicial enumeration of order n ” , for any given n > 0 ?
At first blush this does n’t seem possible .
For one thing , there ’s a problem with assigning a type to this hypothetical higher - order enumeration function : each of the enumeration operators we made returns a different type ! ( … ) returns [ a ] , ( .... ) returns [ [ a ] ] , and so on .
So we ’d have to unify the infinite family of types [ a ] , [ [ a ] ] , [ [ [ a ] ] ] , etc. into a single type .
Secondly , there ’s the problem that each specific enumeration operator uses a different number of calls to map in its implementation .
We could try to copy and paste some code from Oleg involving overlapping instances and crazy typeclasses … but ( in this instance ) there ’s a better way .
What we ’d like to do is create a type which encompasses [ a ] , [ [ a ] ] , [ [ [ a ] ] ] , and so on .
A good first try might be :
data DeepList a = List [ a ] | Deep [ DeepList a ]
which says that a DeepList of ‘ a ’ is either a list of ‘ a ’ , or a list of DeepLists of ‘ a ’ .
Sounds good , right ?
Unfortunately , there is a subtle problem with this definition : lists in different parts of a DeepList value may have different depths .
For example , the following is a perfectly legitimate value of type DeepList Int :
Deep [ List [ 1,2,3 ] , Deep [ List [ 1,6 ] , List [ 4 ] ] ]
If we remove the Deep and List constructors , however , this corresponds to the ill - typed list value [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ [ 1,6 ] , [ 4 ] ] ] .
Since we only want values corresponding to nested list types , this ability to have different - depth lists in different parts of the tree wo n’t do .
How can we force different branches to all have the same depth ?
To the rescue come non-regular types — that is , recursive parameterized types where the type parameters on the right side are not the same as on the left .
In particular , we can use a Bush type defined as follows :
data Bush a = Leaves [ a ] | Trunk ( Bush [ a ] )
This definition is very similar to that of DeepList , but the key difference is that a Bush may consist of a Bush of lists of ‘ a ’ , rather than a list of Bushes of ‘ a ’ .
Every occurrence of the Trunk constructor adds one more nested layer to the type parameter , until finally a Leaves constructor is reached , followed by a suitably - nested list .
For example , here are some values of type ( Bush Int ) :
Leaves [ 1,2,3 ]
Trunk ( Leaves [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 6,7 ] ] )
Trunk ( Trunk ( Leaves [ [ [ 5 ] , [ 6,8,9 ] , [ ] ] , [ [ 6,19 ] , [ 20 ] ] ] ) )
You can check that something like Trunk ( Leaves [ 1,2,3 ] ) gives a type error .
So , our higher - order enumeration function can return a Bush .
But how will we deal with the ( map . map … ) ’s ?
Actually , this is easier than it looks : all we need to do is make Bush a Functor , since that ’s really what ’s going on : we just want to be able to map ( x … ) over the result of the enumeration one dimension lower , whatever that might happen to mean .
So , here we go :
import Data .
List data Bush a = Trunk ( Bush [ a ] ) | Leaves [ a ] instance ( Show a ) =>
Show ( Bush a ) where -- show Bush values without the constructors show ( Leaves l ) = show l show ( Trunk b ) = show b instance Functor Bush where fmap f ( Trunk b ) = Trunk $ fmap ( map f ) b -- add another map fmap f ( Leaves l ) = Leaves $ map f l flatten :: Bush a -> [ a ] -- flatten a Bush into a single list flatten ( Leaves l ) = l flatten ( Trunk b ) = concat $ flatten b x ... y = [ x..y ]
And now our higher - order enumeration function ( which we ’ll call simplex , for reasons which are hopefully clear ) is easy to write :
simplex :: ( Enum t , Integral a ) => a -> t -> t ->
Bush t simplex n _ _ | n < 1 = Leaves [ ] simplex 1 x y = Leaves ( x...y ) simplex n x y = Trunk $ fmap ( x... ) ( simplex ( n - 1 ) x y )
Let ’s try it out :
* Main > simplex 1 1 3 [ 1,2,3 ] * Main > simplex 2 1 3 [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ] * Main > simplex 3 1 3 [ [ [ 1 ] ] , [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] ] , [ [ 1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ] ]
It works !
Finally , I ’ll leave the explanation of the following QuickCheck properties as an exercise for the reader :
simplex ' :: ( Integral a , Integral t ) => a -> t ->
Bush t simplex ' n x = simplex n 1 x fac :: ( Integral t ) => t -> t fac n = product [ 1..n ] binom :: Integer -> Integer ->
Integer binom n k | n < k = 0 | k < 0 = 0 | otherwise = ( fac n ) `div` ( fac k * fac ( n - k ) ) prop_simplex k n = ( k > 0 ) == > ( genericLength .
flatten . simplex ' k $ n ) == binom ( n + k - 1 ) k prop_simplex_components k n = ( k > 0 ) == > ( map genericLength .
group .
sort .
flatten . simplex ' k $ n ) == map ( flip binom ( k - 1 ) ) [ k+
n -2,k+n-3..( k- 1 ) ]

Inflation is an immoral tax that leads to immoral values ~ Anonymous South American banker
Having been in the credit profession for the past 23 years , I have observed several cycles involving the loosening and then the inevitable tightening of credit - underwriting standards .
Of course , the Federal Reserve stands at the epicenter of such cycles .
While money and credit are flowing like beer at an Irish pub on St. Patrick ’s Day , everyone ends up looking like an attractive credit risk .
When it appeared that the U.S. economy was heading into a recession , after the collapse of the dot.com and telecom bubbles , the Federal Reserve opened up the taps and encouraged one and all to imbibe its tasty , low - cost credit — with the most popular " flavor " being the mortgage loan .
At this point , mortgage lenders merely became bartenders serving anyone who walked in the door .
To reach this nadir in mortgage - lending standards , it is inescapable that the " Five Cs " of credit were ignored regardless if a mortgage loan was deemed prime , Alt - A , or subprime .
This is exactly why the home - mortgage meltdown has just begun .
One aspect of my job entails analyzing personal financial statements .
Twenty years ago , without a doubt , households had much healthier financial conditions .
Back then , in proportion to household net worth , savings were much higher and debt levels ( especially automobile , credit card , and mortgage debts ) were dramatically lower .
It is alarmingly common , today , to see households with well under ten thousand dollars in savings yet half - a- million dollars in mortgage debt — not to mention thousands of dollars in credit card debt and tens - of - thousands of dollars in automobile debt .
Such households are literally one or two missed paychecks away from being destitute .
Yet , amazingly , the heads of such households are considered to be prime - level borrowers ( as long as there is adequate income to cover monthly debt service and expenses ) .
What has happened , in the sphere of personal - credit underwriting , is that risk parameters have been redefined with the word " prime " having been defined downwards .
Credit Socialism
America ’s unfolding mortgage - debt crisis did not emerge in a vacuum .
When Alan Greenspan ’s Federal Reserve pounded the federal funds rate down to 1 % , in June of 2003 , it is crucial to understand that such a low rate materialized due to the Fed ’s aggressive creation of money and credit .
In other words , America ’s monetary central planner " knew " that massive inflation was needed to " rescue " the economy from the above - mentioned dot.com and telecom implosions .
Housing was specifically targeted by the Federal Reserve to serve as " … a key channel of monetary policy transmission . "
With this colossal inflation of the money supply , I would argue that a hyperreality surfaced in the housing market — with corresponding bubbles emerging in consumer electronics and automobiles .
During such episodes of heavy inflation , people tend to lose their sense of value including suspending any fear of debt .
In his remarkable piece , Hyperinflation and Hyperreality : Thomas Mann in Light of Austrian Economics , Dr. Paul Cantor masterfully describes how central banking brings about such a destructive hyperreality :
If modernity is characterized by a loss of the sense of the real , this fact is connected to what has happened to money in the twentieth century .
Everything threatens to become unreal once money ceases to be real .
I said that a strong sense of counterfeit reality prevails in Disorder and Early Sorrow .
That fact is ultimately to be traced to the biggest counterfeiter of them all — the government and its printing presses .
Hyperinflation occurs when a government starts printing all the money it wants , that is to say , when the government becomes a counterfeiter .
Inflation is that moment when as a result of government action the distinction between real money and fake money begins to dissolve .
That is why inflation has such a corrosive effect on society .
Money is one of the primary measures of value in any society , perhaps the primary one , the principal repository of value .
As such , money is a central source of stability , continuity , and coherence in any community .
Hence to tamper with the basic money supply is to tamper with a community ’s sense of value .
By making money worthless , inflation threatens to undermine and dissolve all sense of value in a society .
To be sure , when the federal funds rate declined to the surreal level of 1 % , lenders and borrowers behaved as if they were transacting with Monopoly money .
In addition to dealing with the psychologically corrosive affects of inflation , mortgage lenders have become interwoven into what James Grant deems " mortgage socialism . "
Since FDR ’s New Deal , a veritable alphabet soup of governmental and quasi - governmental entities has served to intervene in America ’s mortgage market to slake Uncle Sam ’s thirst for putting Americans into homes regardless of creditworthiness .
For example , in 2004 , George W. Bush clung to the coattails of the emerging housing bubble and took credit for America ’s increase in the rate of homeownership .
He saw fit to take such credit as he viewed newly minted homeowners as a voting block to count on in the 2004 presidential election .
Accordingly , the alphabet soup of federally sanctioned housing - market interventionists — Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Federal Housing Administration , Ginnie Mae , Department of Veteran Affairs , etc. — served the governing plutocracy ’s political ends .
What many fail to comprehend is that socialization of mortgage credit inherently means that mortgage - lending standards have been systematically watered down .
For decades , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have been buying mortgage loans from qualified lending institutions and then securitizing bundles of such loans into mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) — which are typically sold to institutional investors .
Ginnie Mae , which is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government , does not securitize mortgage loans but does guarantee investors the timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage - backed securities insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veteran Affairs .
Freddie and Fannie also guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on their securities but do not have the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government backing them — although the assumption is that Uncle Sam will not allow Freddie or Fannie to fail .
As the housing bubble was expanding , the private sector aggressively jumped into the mortgage - lending fray with an eye toward profiting from securitizing and selling bundles of mortgage loans in the form of mortgage - backed securities — think of companies such as Countrywide Financial and Bear Stearns .
A most important aspect of these mortgage - backed securities is that they are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government .
However , and this is critical , these private brands of mortgage - backed securities were created by bundling mortgage loans that were originated using the same low underwriting standards as prescribed by Uncle Sam ’s socialized mortgage - credit hawkers .
To compete in this arena , it was essential to drop lending standards down to the lowest common denominator .
Yet , even if there were a few " old- school " credit managers expressing concern , top management — at the private firms producing these MBS products — did n’t heed such apprehensions because most of the mortgage loans were n’t being retained as they were being securitized and sold for a profit .
Hence , shoddy credit underwriting became the problem of the MBS purchasers .
Old - school credit managers , undoubtedly , are still familiar with the Five Cs of credit — which will be covered in depth below .
And when it comes to lending large sums of money related to home mortgages , each and every one of these " Cs " is important to the credit - underwriting process .
Alas , such old - fashioned underwriting is n’t conducive to rapid - paced credit creation — beloved by the MBS peddlers — and most certainly goes against the egalitarian spirit of mortgage socialism .
In an April 8 , 2005 speech , Alan Greenspan gushed about how technology has streamlined credit underwriting and made credit more accessible to all Americans .
Here is what he stated at the Federal Reserve ’s " Fourth Annual Community Affairs Research Conference " :
As has every segment of our economy , the financial services sector has been dramatically transformed by technology .
Technological advancements have significantly altered the delivery and processing of nearly every consumer financial transaction , from the most basic to the most complex .
For example , information processing technology has enabled creditors to achieve significant efficiencies in collecting and assimilating the data necessary to evaluate risk and make corresponding decisions about credit pricing .
With these advances in technology , lenders have taken advantage of credit - scoring models and other techniques for efficiently extending credit to a broader spectrum of consumers .
The widespread adoption of these models has reduced the costs of evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers , and in competitive markets cost reductions tend to be passed through to borrowers .
Where once more - marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit , lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately .
These improvements have led to rapid growth in subprime mortgage lending ; indeed , today subprime mortgages account for roughly 10 percent of the number of all mortgages outstanding , up from just 1 or 2 percent in the early 1990s .
Like a true socialist ( really , what else is a monetary central planner ) , Greenspan celebrated credit egalitarianism in this speech — in which he concluded :
As we reflect on the evolution of consumer credit in the United States , we must conclude that innovation and structural change in the financial services industry have been critical in providing expanded access to credit for the vast majority of consumers , including those of limited means .
Without these forces , it would have been impossible for lower - income consumers to have the degree of access to credit markets that they now have .
This fact underscores the importance of our roles as policymakers , researchers , bankers , and consumer advocates in fostering constructive innovation that is both responsive to market demand and beneficial to consumers .
Lately , Alan Greenspan certainly has n’t been cheering about subprime mortgages .
I wonder why not ?
The Five Cs of Credit
In days long past , creditors actually underwrote their loans to such a standard that default was unlikely .
Consequently , the Five Cs of credit were taken quite seriously by loan officers .
The Five Cs of credit are character , capacity , capital , collateral , and conditions .
What follows is a brief description of each of the Five Cs — as tailored to making personal and home - mortgage loans .
Character :
This is the general impression you make on the lender .
The prospective borrower ’s educational background and professional experience will be reviewed , along with his credit score .
It is important to manage one ’s personal credit carefully .
There is a strong correlation between past credit history and the propensity to take care of present and future debt obligations .
Ultimately , the creditor is seeking to gauge the honesty and reliability of the borrower .
In days past , a banker would have had a long - term business relationship with each customer and would have come to know each customer ’s reputation within the community .
Capacity : Honesty alone does not pay the bills .
Here again , educational background and professional experience enter the equation .
A loan officer will look at a borrower ’s current employment , job history , and skill - sets to discern stability , earnings power , and responsibility .
Most certainly , the applicant ’s current income and monthly expenses will be key factors considered in the loan - underwriting process .
Nonetheless , just because a loan applicant may have adequate current income , to make the monthly mortgage payment , does not necessarily mean he is a good risk for a long - term loan .
A spotty employment history , perhaps indicating instability and irresponsibility , certainly does not mesh well with granting a mortgage loan .
If such a person is also looking to purchase a house for the first time , he may not even understand the personal and financial commitments associated with homeownership .
Capital : A personal financial statement provides a critical snapshot as to a loan applicant ’s financial condition .
Within the balance sheet , the individual will list assets and liabilities .
After making underwriting adjustments ( mostly to the valuation of assets ) , the applicant ’s net worth can be derived by subtracting total liabilities from " as allowed " assets .
It is at this point that a lender will determine if the loan applicant has the financial strength to qualify for the loan .
A few key questions will come to the underwriter ’s mind .
For example , is the applicant too leveraged to qualify for the mortgage loan — as indicated by a high debt - to - net - worth ratio ?
Does the applicant , moreover , have sufficient liquidity ( e.g. , cash and securities ) to make a 20 % down payment ?
After making the down payment , will there remain an adequate " rainy - day " fund for the mortgagor to survive several months of unemployment which entails supporting all household expenses and debt service ?
Collateral :
In home - mortgage lending , the house is the collateral .
It is crucial to understand that a house , in most cases , is a non-income producing asset .
A house , typically , is purchased for the utility it provides as a family ’s primary shelter .
The lender will maintain a security interest ( i.e. , a lien ) in the house until the debt is fully repaid .
Should the borrower fail to make the monthly payments , foreclosure and liquidation would ensue to help repay the loan .
Conditions : Lending decisions are partially based upon the conditions of the local , regional , and national economy .
For instance , would you want to be originating long - term home loans to Detroit autoworkers ?
Some lenders may answer in the affirmative , while structuring the loans to factor in applicable economic risks , while others would deem such a proposition as too risky .
Another condition to consider pertains to the neighborhood in which a house is located .
Some lenders may prefer to make home loans related to newer houses in more affluent neighborhoods .
Thus , the value of the collateral is more likely to remain unimpaired .
Should foreclosure come to pass , the lender may stand a better chance of fully recouping the value of the loan .
Conclusion
If a loan officer does not feel comfortable with the risk profile of a loan applicant , then it is his responsibility to say " no " to the prospective borrower .
Although this may come as unwelcome news , the loan applicant eventually may realize that the loan officer kept him out of financial danger .
Declining to make a poor loan , additionally , meshes with the objective of underwriting sound and profitable loans .
The Five Cs of credit are invaluable when it comes to originating quality loans .
Regrettably , when the Federal Reserve targeted housing to reflate the U.S. economy with enormous doses of money and credit , America ’s creeping credit socialism was given fertile ground to grow into a monstrous housing bubble .
Mortgage lenders irresponsibly said " yes " to just about any borrower while Alan Greenspan cheered them on .
It is no wonder why I have seen the most debt - laden , maladjusted personal financial statements in my entire career .
In fact , the Federal Reserve ’s data support my observations as domestic household debt has increased from approximately $ 2.5 trillion in 1986 , to $ 7.7 trillion in 2001 , to $ 12.9 trillion in 2006 ( with 76 % of the 2006 figure being mortgage debt ) .
The toxic combination of mind - numbing inflation and credit socialism has crippled household finances from coast to coast .
Therefore , do not believe the talking heads who claim that the mortgage mess is limited to the subprime stratum .
As the housing bubble continues to implode , the financial fallout will result in nothing short of an international economic disaster .
The Federal Reserve ’s September 18 , 2007 one - half percent cut in the fed funds rate will not do anything to head off America ’s looming household - insolvency crisis .

PHILADELPHIA
THE great myth about divorce is that marital breakup is an increasing threat to American families , with each generation finding their marriages less stable than those of their parents .
Last week ’s release of new divorce statistics led to a smorgasbord of reporting feeding the myth .
This newspaper warned readers , “ Do n’t stock up on silver anniversary cards ” because “ women and men who married in the late 1970s had a less than even chance of still being married 25 years later . ”
And apparently things are getting worse , as “ the latest numbers suggest an uptick in the divorce rate among people married in the most recent 20 years covered in the report , 1975 - 1994 . ”
Other major newspapers ran similar articles .
The story of ever - increasing divorce is a powerful narrative .
It is also wrong .
In fact , the divorce rate has been falling continuously over the past quarter - century , and is now at its lowest level since 1970 .
While marriage rates are also declining , those marriages that do occur are increasingly more stable .
For instance , marriages that began in the 1990s were more likely to celebrate a 10th anniversary than those that started in the 1980s , which , in turn , were also more likely to last than marriages that began back in the 1970s .
Why were so many analysts led astray by the recent data ?
Understanding this puzzle requires digging deeper into some rather complex statistics .
TDC's new OV6920 CameraChip is the world 's smallest CMOS chip at just 1/18 - inch ( 1.4 mm ) .
This means that the attached camera setup is just 3.2 mm in total size — or in layman 's terms — never change outside of your own bedroom again .

Shooting at a low resolution of 328 x 250 , the chip is configurable for NTSC output and can automatically control color saturation , exposure and gain .
Sipping from a low 3.3V DC power supply , the chip will be useful in low power applications — from medical pills to spy gear to toys .
While the practical applications for tiny cameras are limitless , technological breakthroughs like this just reinforce the inevitable future :
We will all be on camera all the time ... and that Futurama 's fabled UltraPorn is on its way .

Mistakenly , Â many Americans still believe President Bush 's war on Iraq is justified because Congress supported it and funds it .
Yet , as international legal authority Francis Boyle of the University of Illinois points out , President Bush got congressional backing by lying that Hussein had W.M.D. and that Hussein was connected to 9/11 .
That 's fraud , probably the bloodiest , costliest lie in White House history .
Also , to start a war , a country needs UN Security Council approval , which Bush failed to get .
Otherwise , a nation can fight only in self - defense when attacked .
By attacking Iraq , Bush violated the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 , the Kellogg - Briand Peace Pact of 1928 , the UN Charter , the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals , and the Nuremberg Charter , Judgment and Principles , Boyle said .
As all treaties become the supreme law of the land under Article VI of the U.S. Constitution , the Bush - Cheney presidency is guilty of breaking all of the above , warmongering in spades .
In testimony defending U.S. soldiers who have refused to fight in Iraq , Boyle noted that , under Nuremberg , " a soldier has a right to absent himself or herself from committing international crimes . "
In short , if given a criminal order , the defense used by Adolf Eichmann , Hitler 's master killer , that he was only doing his job , is a phony .
Boyle testified that First Lt. Ehren Watada had the right , " if not the obligation , " to say , " I do n't want to participate in this . "
Watada faced an army court martial for not deploying with his unit for Iraq .
Watada won a victory when the judge ruled a mistrial .
Boyle believes , " A soldier has an obligation to disobey illegal orders , " which he says is printed in black - and - white in the Army 's Field Manual ( AFM ) 27 -10 .
Without Security Council authority , President Bush 's war is " a crime against peace , " Boyle says .
That 's also written in paragraph 498 of the AFM .
" Any person , whether a member of the armed forces or a civilian , who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment ( as ) ... crimes against peace , " the AFM reads .
This broad definition would seem to include trigger - happy private contractors in Iraq .
And since the U.S. has committed war crimes in Iraq , U.S. soldiers are legally within their rights not to serve there , Boyle said .
These crimes include torture of prisoners , authorized by former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and White House lawyers ; the use of cluster bombs in civilian areas ; and the firing of depleted uranium shells --- this last also a violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 .
" It 's a war crime , " Boyle said , that is " not only poisoning Iraqis , it is poisoning our own troops . "
President Bush has repeatedly said the U.S. does not torture , but he is no objective arbiter in this matter .
The International Committee of the Red Cross , with supervisory jurisdiction , says it is torture and that it is widespread and systematic .
Thus Bush and his colleagues are guilty of crimes against humanity .
Curiously , the public reaction to these crimes includes a large measure of denial .
If Congress okayed the war and funds it , many people think it 's okay .
Besides , much of the bloodshed is concealed from their view .
Fox TV , for example , runs little film footage of the real carnage in Iraq while reporting endless trivia and gossip .
Fox is also continuing its show " 24 " over Army protests that the series encourages U.S. troops to torture .
Even though a CNN - Opinion Research Corp. poll last June found 54 % of Americans do not believe the war is " morally justified " they appear content to allow Bush - Cheney to serve out their term of office .
Is that because 4 million of us have n't been forced out of our homes , and another million or so killed and wounded and two million forced to escape abroad ?
Is that because the $ 1 trillion the war is costing will be passed to our children to pay by the profligate in the White House ?
Is it because our electricity and water supplies have n't been reduced to a trickle , our hospitals are n't busting at the seams with wounded , and our streets too dangerous to walk and our unemployment has n't hit 50 % ?
So far , apart from 3,800 soldiers needlessly killed and Â 30,000 maimed , the stiffest penalty Americans are paying for Iraq is the gas price spike to $ 3 a gallon .
Why is it , the more oil Bush gets his hands on , the higher the price ?
Maybe Americans would run Bush out of office if the Geneva Conventions made price - gouging by his oil companyÂ buddies illegal .

It is a lie that Congress must pass a bill to end the occupation of Iraq .
The occupation can be ended with an announcement by Congressional leaders that there will be no more funding .
Any proposal to fund it can be blocked by 41 senators .
Bush has plenty of money for withdrawal and could be given more for that exclusive purpose .
When your television tells you the Democrats need 60 or 67 senators to end the occupation , your television is lying to you .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could if they wanted announce today that the House and Senate will no longer bring to a vote any bills to fund anything other than withdrawal .
They have many colleagues already on board with that position , not to mention two thirds of the country .
It would take 218 signatures on a discharge petition to force a bill to the floor of the House without Pelosi 's approval .
It is unlikely enough Democrats would oppose their party to fund Bush 's war in that way .
In the Senate , Reid alone could refuse to bring a bill to the floor , or another senator could put a secret hold on a bill .
And , while not all bills can be filibustered ( appropriations bills can be , budget reconciliation bills cannot ) , you can hardly claim you need 60 votes to get past a filibuster without admitting that with only 41 you could launch your own filibuster and that with 51 you could defeat any bill .
Once you understand the goal as blocking bills rather than passing them , the number of allies you need shrinks dramatically .

Think Progress points to the full - page ad in today ’s New York Times stating that tonight ’s Democratic presidential debate on CNN is sponsored by the “ clean coal ” industry .
Wow .
Are n’t euphemisms fun ?
Sort of the magical realism of the political world .
According to Think Progress , the coal industry ’s “ clean ” agenda would have us :
• Expand coal production by using government - funded technology to convert coal to vehicle fuels , thereby producing twice as much global warming pollution as gas production , and consuming huge amounts of water to boot .
•
Crank out as many new power plants as possible before limits on greenhouse gas pollution take effect .
Nearly 150 coal - fired power plants are already on the drawing board .
• Delay and weaken any limits on CO2 pollution , even though scientists tell us we need a 20 % reduction by 2020 , and an 80 % reduction in 2050 [ actually , we need more than that and faster too ] .
• Convince Congress to give coalies free “ allowances ” to emit greenhouse gases rather than force coal - fired plants to buy them in cap - and - trade auctions .
The coal industry ’s sponsorship of tonight ’s CNN debate in Las Vegas appears to be an attempt to pressure Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) , who has stood firmly against the construction of three proposed major coal - fired power plants in his home state : REID : “ I want to help Nevada become the national leader in renewable energy and energy independence .
We have vast wind , solar and geothermal resources and we ’re wasting energy every day we ’re not tapping into those free , clean , and reliable power sources …
As proposed , these coal plants are old news , the way of the increasingly distant past . ”

Mozilla has hit back at claims that multiple bugs in its forthcoming Firefox 3 browser will be ignored in order to meet release schedules .
IDG analyst Gregg Keizer reported that fixes for as many as eight in ten identified bugs would be ready in time for the scheduled release of Firefox 3 ( Gran Paradiso ) next year .
Keizer cited notes from a Mozilla development meeting to support his claims , carried in a story in the New York Times last Thursday .
" We have 700 bugs currently marked as blockers , " the notes said .
" That 's too many .
We 're asking component owners to set priorities on blockers , as a first pass of what bugs should be Beta 2 blockers .
You want it to be about 10 per cent of blockers , or what you can get done in four weeks . "
Mozilla defines a " blocker " as a flaw serious enough to justify delaying a release , or at least closer examination .
" We 'll be doing pretty much the same thing for Beta 3 , which means that something like 80 per cent of the [ approximately ] 700 bugs currently marked as blockers will not be fixed for Firefox 3 .
The hope is that by ' fixing the most important blockers ' several times , we 'll get to a point where we can cut the rest without feeling bad about the quality of the release .
And if we do feel bad , we can add an extra beta or two , " the notes added .
Mozilla developer Asa Dotzler hit back at the suggestion that Mozilla was compromising on quality in developing the next version of the open source browser .
" That claim is simply horseshit , " he wrote in a blog post .
" We 've already fixed over 11,000 bugs and features in Firefox 3 and now we 're discussing how to handle the remaining 700 issues we wanted to get fixed for Firefox 3 . "
Mozilla developer Mike Shaver said Keizer cited genuine notes but misunderstood the meaning of the term ' blocker ' .
" It appears to be an honest mistake , since a set of meeting notes did include that prediction , along with other elements that mention other approaches to the Firefox end - game , " he writes .
" But it ’s not our intent to cut Firefox blockers from the fix list against a hard numerical target or fixed deadline . "
" The ' blocking ' flag does n’t always strictly mean ' we would not ship Firefox 3 if this specific bug is n’t fixed ' .
It can also mean ' we should look at this in more detail before we ship ' " , he added .
Security bugs within the 700 flaw total will be treated as " important " .
Bugs that impair surfers ' browsing ability will also be prioritised .
Up to three beta releases of Firefox 3 are planned .
The last release was an eight alpha version of the code , released in September .
The final version of Firefox 3 is due out some time next year .
The superstructure of Firefox 3 alpha is built around Gecko 1.9 , an updated layout engine .
The browser is also due to include features held back from Firefox 2 , such as the revamped Places system for storing bookmarks and a rejigged history function . ®
The Economist 's Big Mac index is based on the theory of purchasing - power parity ( PPP ) , according to which exchange rates should adjust to equalise the price of a basket of goods and services around the world .
Our basket is a burger : a McDonald 's Big Mac .
The table below shows by how much , in Big Mac PPP terms , selected currencies were over - or undervalued at the end of January .
Broadly , the pattern is such as it was last spring , the previous time this table was compiled ( see article ) .
The most overvalued currency is the Icelandic krona : the exchange rate that would equalise the price of an Icelandic Big Mac with an American one is 158 kronur to the dollar ; the actual rate is 68.4 , making the krona 131 % too dear .
The most undervalued currency is the Chinese yuan , at 56 % below its PPP rate ; several other Asian currencies also appear to be 40 - 50 % undervalued .
The index is supposed to give a guide to the direction in which currencies should , in theory , head in the long run .
It is only a rough guide , because its price reflects non-tradable elements — such as rent and labour .
For that reason , it is probably least rough when comparing countries at roughly the same stage of development .
Perhaps the most telling numbers in this table are therefore those for the Japanese yen , which is 28 % undervalued against the dollar , and the euro , which is 19 % overvalued .
Hence European finance ministers ' beef with the low level of the yen .
' I healed my own heart with stem cells '
By Ian Rosenberg for CNN
Ian Rosenberg : " This treatment is truly amazing . "
QUICKVOTE
Has technology changed your life for the better ?
Yes , most developments improve my quality of life Yes , but I would not want to see too much more change No , technology has gone too far or View Results READ MORE STORIES LIFE - CHANGING TECH YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS
Stem cell therapy Medical research or or Create Your Own LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Two years ago Ian Rosenberg , from London , was told he had two and a half months to live .
The 59 - year - old had pioneering stem cell treatment which enabled his heart to repair damaged tissue .
I used to be incredibly active .
I climbed mountains , skied and played golf .
Then when I was 38 , I had a heart attack , which dramatically changed my life .
Two years later , in 1987 , I had surgery to remove some of the scar tissue from my heart .
After my heart attack , and even after the scars were removed , I became increasingly unwell and by 2003 , I could n't even walk up two steps .
I 'd had implantable defibrillators in my chest for nine years and every time they went off , they were weakening my heart even further .
Plus , the medication I was taking was losing its punch .
It was only when I fainted one day they eventually found my heart was in such bad shape that they told me I had only two and a half months to live .
My heart was giving up and it needed to be strengthened .
I had heard about stem cells but most or all of the cardiologists I met did n't know anything about it .
I had read about one who lived in Monte Carlo .
I made enquires and was told that while the treatment was n't light years away , it was still being tested .
In the end , I said , " Why do n't you test it on me , " and they agreed .
I 've had stem cell treatment three times since July 2003 .
I have it at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe - University Hospital in Frankfurt -- it 's not a swanky hospital but it is Frankfurt 's biggest teaching hospital .
After the first treatment , I started to get better immediately .
They take injections from the bone marrow in my hipbone .
When they have enough cells they take it to a lab for " witchcraft , " as I call it .
I do n't really know what they do there but two hours later I have a treatment that is a bit like an angiogram .
Instead of using a stent , though , they inject the cells into the arteries in my heart .
Basically , the heart regrows the dead tissue .
Even with so much scarring , my heart is pretty good now .
I can go cruising , travel to America where I spend about six months of the year and walk a lot further than previously .
I still can't play 18 holes of golf ; I do nine instead now .
Quite a few people have had the treatment .
You would be amazed at some of the stories .
It is is truly amazing .
When I came back from Germany , I thought people in the UK should be able to have the same treatment in their own country , so I started the Heart Cells Foundation .
It may not be the charity of the moment but heart disease kills people and we need to raise awareness about it .
Doctors at Barts and The London NHS Trust have launched the UK 's first large - scale clinical trial using the same treatment Ian Rosenberg had in Germany .

Following are excerpts from an interview with Arab - American psychiatrist Wafa Sultan .
The interview was aired on Al - Jazeera TV on February 21 , 2006
Wafa Sultan :
The clash we are witnessing around the world is not a clash of religions , or a clash of civilizations .
It is a clash between two opposites , between two eras .
It is a clash between a mentality that belongs to the Middle Ages and another mentality that belongs to the 21st century .
It is a clash between civilization and backwardness , between the civilized and the primitive , between barbarity and rationality .
It is a clash between freedom and oppression , between democracy and dictatorship .
It is a clash between human rights , on the one hand , and the violation of these rights , on other hand .
It is a clash between those who treat women like beasts , and those who treat them like human beings .
What we see today is not a clash of civilizations .
Civilizations do not clash , but compete .
[...]
Host : I understand from your words that what is happening today is a clash between the culture of the West , and the backwardness and ignorance of the Muslims ?
Wafa Sultan : Yes , that is what I mean .
[...]
Host :
Who came up with the concept of a clash of civilizations ?
Was it not Samuel Huntington ?
It was not Bin Laden .
I would like to discuss this issue , if you do n't mind ...
Wafa Sultan : The Muslims are the ones who began using this expression .
The Muslims are the ones who began the clash of civilizations .
The Prophet of Islam said : " I was ordered to fight the people until they believe in Allah and His Messenger . "
When the Muslims divided the people into Muslims and non-Muslims , and called to fight the others until they believe in what they themselves believe , they started this clash , and began this war .
In order to stop this war , they must reexamine their Islamic books and curricula , which are full of calls for takfir and fighting the infidels .
My colleague has said that he never offends other people 's beliefs .
What civilization on the face of this earth allows him to call other people by names that they did not choose for themselves ?
Once , he calls them Ahl Al - Dhimma , another time he calls them the " People of the Book , " and yet another time he compares them to apes and pigs , or he calls the Christians " those who incur Allah 's wrath . "
Who told you that they are " People of the Book " ?
They are not the People of the Book , they are people of many books .
All the useful scientific books that you have today are theirs , the fruit of their free and creative thinking .
What gives you the right to call them " those who incur Allah 's wrath , " or " those who have gone astray , " and then come here and say that your religion commands you to refrain from offending the beliefs of others ?
I am not a Christian , a Muslim , or a Jew .
I am a secular human being .
I do not believe in the supernatural , but I respect others ' right to believe in it .
Dr. Ibrahim Al - Khouli :
Are you a heretic ?
Wafa Sultan :
You can say whatever you like .
I am a secular human being who does not believe in the supernatural ...
Dr. Ibrahim Al - Khouli :
If you are a heretic , there is no point in rebuking you , since you have blasphemed against Islam , the Prophet , and the Koran ...
Wafa Sultan :
These are personal matters that do not concern you .
[...]
Wafa Sultan : Brother , you can believe in stones , as long as you do n't throw them at me .
You are free to worship whoever you want , but other people 's beliefs are not your concern , whether they believe that the Messiah is God , son of Mary , or that Satan is God , son of Mary .
Let people have their beliefs .
[...]
Wafa Sultan :
The Jews have come from the tragedy ( of the Holocaust ) , and forced the world to respect them , with their knowledge , not with their terror , with their work , not their crying and yelling .
Humanity owes most of the discoveries and science of the 19th and 20th centuries to Jewish scientists .
15 million people , scattered throughout the world , united and won their rights through work and knowledge .
We have not seen a single Jew blow himself up in a German restaurant .
We have not seen a single Jew destroy a church .
We have not seen a single Jew protest by killing people .
The Muslims have turned three Buddha statues into rubble .
We have not seen a single Buddhist burn down a Mosque , kill a Muslim , or burn down an embassy .
Only the Muslims defend their beliefs by burning down churches , killing people , and destroying embassies .
This path will not yield any results .
The Muslims must ask themselves what they can do for humankind , before they demand that humankind respect them .
The grid on the left represents what a participant could see , while that on the right represents the director ’s view ( Image : Keysar and Wu / Psychological Science )
When it comes to putting yourself in the shoes of others , cultures that emphasise interdependence over individualism may have the upper hand .
In a new psychological experiment , Chinese students outperformed their US counterparts when ask to infer another person ’s perspective .
The researchers say the findings help explain how misunderstandings can occur in cross-cultural communication .
In the experiment , psychologists Boaz Keysar and Shali Wu at the University of Chicago , Illinois , US , recruited 40 students .
Half of the volunteers were non-Asians who had grown up in the US , and the other half were native Mandarin speakers who had very recently emigrated from various parts of China .
Advertisement
The volunteers played a game in which they had to follow the instructions of a person sitting across the table from them , an individual known as the ‘ director ’ .
Researchers placed a grid structure between the two people consisting of small compartments , some of which contained objects such as wood blocks , toy bunnies and sunglasses ( see image , right ) .
Some of the individual compartments were covered on one side with cardboard so that they were blocked from the view of the director – only the study subjects could see the objects inside .
Off the charts
The volunteers had to follow the instructions of the director and move named objects from one compartment to another .
But – as a sneaky trick – the researchers sometimes placed two objects of the same kind in the grid .
In this case , the subjects would have to consider the director ’s view to know which object she was referring to .
For example , the grid sometimes contained two wooden blocks , one of which sat in a compartment hidden to the director .
The director would then ask the subject to “ move the wooden block to a higher square in the grid ” .
Chinese students would immediately understand which wooden block to move – the one visible to both them and the director .
Their US counterparts , however , did not always catch on .
“ They would ask ‘ Which block ? ’ or ‘ You mean the one on the right ? ” , explains Keysar .
“ For me it was really stunning because all of the information is there .
You do n’t need to ask , ” he adds .
While 65 % of the American participants asked this type of question , only one of the 20 Chinese subjects did so , equating to just 5 % .
“ That ’s a huge difference – it ’s off the charts , ” says Richard Nisbett , a psychologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , Michigan , US , who studies differences between Western and Asian cultures .
Language link
The US volunteers were also slower in reacting when asked to move an object when there was a duplicate in the grid that only they could see .
They generally took about 30 % longer to complete such instructions from the director .
In contrast , such duplicate objects did not slow the speed at which Chinese participants responded .
Keysar believes the Chinese students had an easier time understanding the director ’s perspective because they come from a more collectivist society than their US counterparts .
He speculates , for example , that compared with children in China , youngsters in the US are more likely to feel that it is “ all about them ” .
In another example , he describes how a Texas corporation “ aiming to improve productivity , told its employees to look in the mirror and say ‘ I am beautiful ’ 100 times before coming to work .
In contrast , a Japanese supermarket instructed its employees to begin their day by telling each other ‘ you are beautiful ’ . ”
Nisbett adds that in some Asian cultures people use less blunt language , making it necessary for them to read between the lines , and imagine the perspective of the individual with whom they are speaking .
He also says that the new findings could help us head off misunderstandings between people from Asian and Western societies :
“ We are less likely to step on each other ’s toes if we are aware of one another ’s cultural differences . ”
Previous research has shown that culture can influence very basic behaviours , such as how we see objects .

The Parenscript Object System ( PSOS ) is a facility for object - oriented programming in Parenscript using the same style and techniques as the Common Lisp Object System .
It consists of a set of macros in lisp and a runtime environment in Parenscript .
In the Javascript world , the Parenscript Object System is probably the most sophisticated method for object - oriented programming .
It is different from object - oriented systems that use the message - passing paradigm ( like Java , C++ ) in a few ways .
If you are not lisp - aware but ambitious , you can read chapters 15 and 16 of Practical Common Lisp , which discusses the Common Lisp Object system .

Features
PSOS is designed to be similar CLOS .
However , PSOS should not be everything that CLOS is .
It should be a fairly small library ( and currently compiles to about 10 k in Javascript ) , for example .
There are also differences between Javascript and Lisp , especially Javascript 's lack of Lisp - like symbols .
Multiple inheritance , generic functions , and basic method combination are currently implemented .
Examples
1. Different classes of people
The following is a simple example that demonstrates how PSOS can be used to obtain simple class inheritence .
This works in much the same way as other javascript class systems that are out there already .
( defclass person ( ) ( ) ( : documentation " Any old person . " ) ) ( defclass citizen ( person ) ( ) ( : documentation " A person who votes . " ) ) ( defclass politician ( citizen ) ( ) ( : documentation " A person in public office . " ) ) ( defgeneric discuss - environment ( individual ) ) ( defmethod discuss - environment ( ( individual citizen ) ) ( alert " I do n't know anything about the environment " ) ) ( defmethod discuss - enviornment ( ( individual politician ) ) ( alert " The environment is an important issue , but so is the War on Terror . " ) ) ( dicuss - environment ( new politician ) ) ; alerts " the environment is ... "
2 . An event - handling system
This is a practical example that demonstrates a way to use generic functions and classes to implement an event - handling system .

Outstanding issues
PSOS works well as a class system now , but certain ideas have not been hammered out yet .
In particular , dealing with slot definitions is currently done via a compile - time expansion rather than letting the Javascript runtime environment initiate slots .
This is primarily due to what I do know about scoping in Javascript .
Suggestions or comments about slot definitions , or PSOS in general , are welcome .

More than corporate buzzwords , these trends are redefining the nature of work for millions of Americans , as well as their counterparts all over the world .
But what are the ramifications of these trends for the people who actually do the work ?
That ’s a question that Stephen E. Humphrey , an assistant professor of management at Florida State University , poses in a new study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology .
Titled “ Integrating Motivational , Social , and Contextual Work Design Features : A Meta-Analytic Summary and Theoretical Extension of the Work Design Literature , ” the study indicates that various efforts to increase efficiency by simplifying workers ’ job responsibilities may in fact be leading to lower employee job satisfaction and productivity over time .
“ In a globally competitive marketplace , companies are trying to introduce efficiencies wherever they can to improve their financial performance for stockholders , ” Humphrey said .
“ One way they do that is by designing , or redesigning , jobs to make them more narrowly focused on specific tasks .
However , while this may improve productivity in the short term , it appears to create a new set of problems in the longer term . ”
Humphrey collaborated on the study with Frederick P. Morgeson , a professor of management at Michigan State University , and Jennifer D. Nahrgang , a doctoral student at Michigan State .
In conducting their study , the three summarized the results of more than 40 years of earlier research , comprising 259 studies and almost 220,000 workers , to analyze the effects of work design on employee attitudes and productivity .
They noted several important findings .
Among them :
-- Simplifying tasks generally led to lower performance ratings and worker satisfaction .
-- Having more autonomy on the job was related to better performance , higher satisfaction , and lower feelings of exhaustion .
-- Having a socially supportive workplace was related to greater job satisfaction , lower feelings of exhaustion , and strongly reduced the likelihood of wanting to leave the job .
-- People who work interdependently with others have better performance ratings , lower stress , lower turnover intentions , and greater work and organizational satisfaction .
-- Receiving frequent feedback from others increased job satisfaction , reduced stress and turnover intentions , and increased performance .
“ The results of this research clearly show that organizations which focus on providing job flexibility , opportunities for social interaction and performance feedback can produce highly performing , highly satisfied workers who have low levels of stress , anxiety and burnout , and who are uninterested in searching for ‘ greener pastures , ’ ” Humphrey said .
“ However , organizations that move toward the simplification and independent completion of work will find that workers will be dissatisfied with their work and will perform at a lower level over time , with higher levels of stress . ”
Unfortunately , that seems to be the direction that workplace design is headed .
“ We ’re seeing many job functions that American workers used to do -- computer programming , data entry and call center operations , for example -- being sent overseas or contracted out to other U.S. companies that specialize in those areas .
The employees who used to perform these tasks often find themselves either out of a job or in one that is less challenging and less fulfilling . ”
For corporate America , the costs of a demoralized work force , measured in decreased productivity and increased turnover , may offset many of the cost savings that they had been hoping to achieve , Humphrey added .

Japan said today it would start fingerprinting and photographing foreign visitors from next month under stringent new security measures that have been criticised by civil rights advocates .
The new measures , approved by parliament last year , are expected to take effect from November 20 , a Justice Ministry official said .
All foreigners aged 16 or older will be photographed and electronically fingerprinted when they enter Japan , under a similar system to the one introduced by the United States after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - A Dutch priest has been fined 5,000 euros ( $ 6,800 ) for ringing his church bells too loudly in the morning .
The Catholic priest began ringing the bells at just after seven in the morning soon after arriving in Tilburg about six months ago , a spokesman for the town council said .
This prompted dozens of complaints from residents and the council in the southern town agreed the priest was breaking the rules .
“ The priest can ring his bells whenever he likes but he has to keep within noise regulations .
People do n’t appreciate it , ” the spokesman said .
The priest risks further fines if he continues .
“ We are still trying to find ways to make him stop , ” the spokesman said .

The Patriot Act is a U.S. law passed in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
Its goals are to strengthen domestic security and broaden the powers of law - enforcement agencies with regards to identifying and stopping terrorists .
The passing and renewal of the Patriot Act has been extremely controversial .
Supporters claim that it 's been instrumental in a number of investigations and arrests of terrorists , while critics counter the act gives the government too much power , threatens civil liberties and undermines the very democracy it seeks to protect .
Let 's take a look at what the Patriot Act is , the support and criticism behind it and if the Patriot Act is really working .
Main Provisions of the Patriot Act
The Patriot Act 's full title is Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 .
It 's split into 10 parts , and it covers a lot of ground .
Here is a summary .
Advertisement

Title I - This section pertains to the protection of civil liberties .
It authorizes federal money to accomplish much of the act's provisions and authorizes the Secret Service to create a nationwide electronic crime task force .
This section also gives the president the authority to confiscate the property of any foreign person who is believed to have aided in a war or attack on the United States .
Such seizures can be submitted secretly to courts as evidence .
Title II -
This section broadens the ability of law - enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance on " agents of foreign powers . "
It allows the interception of communications if they 're related to terrorist activities and allows law - enforcement agencies to share information related to terrorist activities with federal authorities .
In addition , Title II authorizes roving surveillance -- that is , a court order allowing surveillance on a particular person allows officers to use any means available to intercept that person 's communications , regardless of where the person goes .
Previously , a court order would only allow a wiretap on a specific line in one location .
Further , it allows the government to order files from the providers of communications services with details about specific customers ' use of the service .
For example , an Internet service provider can be ordered to provide information on IP addresses , login times and sites visited .
Title II also allows delayed notification of search warrants , meaning a suspect 's house could be searched while the suspect is n't present , and the suspect would not be notified of the search until after it was carried out .
The wide - ranging Title II included many other relatively minor clauses .
Title II also contained the sunset clause that would have caused many of the act 's provisions to expire in 2005 had they not been renewed .
We 'll discuss more on the sunset clause later .
The prosecutor called him a “ coward ” and said the death penalty was n’t punishment enough for the crime he committed .
But yesterday – after 22 years behind bars and eight weeks of wearing an ankle bracelet – Byron Halsey walked out of an Elizabeth , N.J. , courtroom a free man .
On May 15 , Halsey ’s conviction was thrown out after new DNA tests cleared him of the gruesome murder and rape of his girlfriend ’s two children in 1985 .
The new tests , not available at the time , pointed to Clifton Hall , 49 , a next - door neighbor and the star prosecution witness .
Hall has now been charged in the heinous crime , in which nails were pounded into the brain of one of the children .
Although the conviction was overturned , Halsey , 46 , had to wear an ankle bracelet while the Union County prosecutor ’s office decided whether to retry him .
Yesterday , assistant prosecutor Albert Cernadas went before Union County Superior Court Judge Stuart Peim to ask that all charges be dismissed .
“ The only evidence against Byron Halsey is his uncorroborated confession , key portions of which have been refuted by the DNA evidence , ” Cernadas said .
“ The state can not meet its burden of proof . ”
With that , Peim dismissed the charges and told Halsey , “ I wish you the best of luck . ”
Halsey , wearing a green - gray suit , pale yellow shirt and gold tie , hugged his lawyers , Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project and Raymond Brown of Newark .
“ Thank you , your honor , ” he told the judge .
“ Can I have your autograph , please ? ”
The courtroom erupted in laughter .
“ I want to thank everyone for their prayers , ” Halsey said outside court .
“ This is the first time I ’ve been free in 22 years – plus I got that little dude off my leg , ” he said , referring to the ankle bracelet .
He thanked prosecutors for “ acknowledging the truth , ” his grandmother , whose birthday was yesterday , and God .
“ I thank my Lord , my savior , for carrying me through the years , ” he said
Asked what was the biggest change since he went to prison in 1985 , he held up his cellphone and said , “ Cellphones , man . ”
“ My niece and nephew had to show me how to work the TV and the cable , ” he added .

Apparently my previous pattern posts on Singleton and Template Method hit a nerve based on comments and traffic – thanks for reading !
I ’m now moving the series from patterns that I hate to patterns that I simultaneous love and hate , because hey , I ’m a complicated man ( and no one understands me but my woman ) .
The Visitor pattern is one that I ’ve spent lots and lots of time using and it has unquestionably been a key part of many systems I ’ve designed and used .
At the same time , there are aspects of the Visitor pattern that drive me nuts .
I ’ll try to explore both sides in this post .
Note : I ’m primarily a Java guy and this discussion of visitors is definitely Java - centric in a number of respects .
Dropping by for a visit
The Visitor pattern is typically used when you have a multi- object data structure ( often something tree - like ) and you want to traverse the data structure and implement various algorithms over it .
It will help to have an example , so I ’ll spare you the canonical Car and Shape examples .
In honor of the upcoming Simpsons movie , let ’s imagine a Simpsons game that has characters , props , etc .
Here ’s a bunch of data classes we might want to work with :
Visitor tends to be used in Composition hierarchies and is especially useful when these hierarchies are heterogeneous .
When Composition hierarchies are homogeneous ( a tree full of the same node class ) the visitor pattern is still useful but you can get many of the same benefits without it .
In our game you see a lot of different kinds of Entity objects , including some that use composition to aggregate objects at various levels in the hierarchy and a Game object that is not even an Entity but holds all the Places .
It is a key benefit of the Visitor pattern that all of the concrete data classes you want to visit do not have to share a common class hierarchy .
Now , let ’s say we want to find all characters in the game that have dialog to process .
We ’ll need to walk through all the Places , then through all the Characters in each Place and collect all the dialog .
One way is to just add the methods in all the classes involved : [ source : java ]
public class Game {
// … code managing places
public void collectDialog ( Map < Character , String > dialog ) {
for( Place place : places ) {
place.collectDialog(dialog ) ;
}
}
}</p>
public abstract class Place {
// … code managing Characters and Props
public void collectDialog ( Map < Character , String > dialog ) {
for( Character character : characters ) {
dialog.put( character , character.getDialog ( ) ) ;
}
}
}
public abstract class Character extends Entity {
public abstract String getDialog ( ) ;
}
public class Homer extends Character {
public String getDialog ( ) {
return “ Donuts .
Is there anything they ca n’t do ? ” ;
}
}
// etc for each character
// To execute :
Map < Character , String > dialog = new HashMap < Character , String >( ) ;
game.collectDialog(dialog ) ;
[ / source ]
So , that works fine .
But you might find that these sorts of methods tend to multiply .
I might need to update the movement of all Characters and movable Props in the game in a time step .
Or enter a Krazy Krusty mode where every Character turns into Krusty and some Props turn into squirting flowers .
Or you might just need to find all of a particular kind of a Prop across the game .
The problem is that each time you find a new algorithm you want to implement over this data structure , you have to change some or all of the concrete types in the data structure .
Another way to look at the commonalities between these algorithms is that they ( 1 ) navigate a data structure and ( 2 ) perform some action at ( potentially ) all instances in the data structure .
Visitor is a pattern that pulls these two items out of the data classes and replaces it with visitor - agnostic code in each data class .
The algorithm - specific code is put in a class ( the visitor ) dedicated to the algorithm instead .
Let ’s look at how the visitor pattern could be used in the example above .
I ’ll show just the visitor - related code here .
First , the concrete data classes each need to have an acceptVisitor method : [ source : java ]
public class Game {
public void acceptVisitor ( GameVisitor visitor ) {
visitor.visit( this ) ;
for( Place place : places ) {
place.acceptVisitor( visitor ) ;
}
}
}
public abstract class Entity {
public abstract void acceptVisitor ( GameVisitor visitor ) ;
}
public class Refrigerator extends Prop {
public void acceptVisitor ( GameVisitor visitor ) {
visitor.visit( this ) ;
for( Prop prop : getFood ( ) ) {
prop.acceptVisitor( visitor ) ;
}
}
}
public class Homer extends Character {
public void acceptVisitor ( GameVisitor visitor ) {
visitor.visit( this ) ;
}
}
// other Character and Prop subclasses are similar to Homer
public abstract class Place extends Entity {
public void acceptVisitor ( GameVisitor visitor ) {
for( Character character : getCharacters ( ) ) {
character.acceptVisitor( visitor ) ;
}
for ( Prop prop : getProps ( ) ) {
prop.acceptVisitor( visitor ) ;
}
}
}
public class Moes extends Place {
public void acceptVisitor ( GameVisitor visitor ) {
visitor.visit( this ) ;
super.acceptVisitor( visitor ) ;
}
}
// other Place subclasses look the same as Moes
[ / source ]
Each of these acceptVisitor methods has two responsibilities .
First , it must call back to the visitor .
This is the key to the whole pattern as this callback leverages the static type of the this object to correctly call the right method on the visitor without needing some sort of horrible if / else or switch block .
( You may know this callback by the term “ double dispatch ” . )
Second , the acceptVisitor method must traverse “ down ” the data structure to any contained elements ( we ’ll come back to this later ) .
Then we need to look at the actual visitor code itself .
[ source : java ]
public interface GameVisitor {
public void visit( Game game ) ;
public void visit( Apu apu ) ;
public void visit( Bart bart ) ;
public void visit( Homer homer ) ;
public void visit( Moes moes ) ;
public void visit( NuclearPlant plant ) ;
public void visit( SimpsonsHouse house ) ;
public void visit( Donut donut ) ;
public void visit( DuffBeer beer ) ;
public void visit( Refrigerator fridge ) ;
}
public class CollectDialog implements GameVisitor {
private Map < Character , String > dialog = new HashMap < Character , String >( ) ;
public Map < Character , String > getDialog ( ) {
return dialog ;
}
public void visit( Game game ) { }
public void visit( Apu apu ) {
dialog.put( apu , apu.getDialog ( ) ) ;
}
public void visit( Bart bart ) {
dialog.put ( bart , bart.getDialog ( ) ) ;
}
public void visit( Homer homer ) {
dialog.put ( homer , homer.getDialog ( ) ) ;
}
public void visit( Moes moes ) { }
public void visit( NuclearPlant plant ) { }
public void visit( SimpsonsHouse house ) { }
public void visit( Donut donut ) { }
public void visit( DuffBeer beer ) { }
public void visit( Refrigerator fridge ) { }
}
// To execute :
CollectDialog collectDialog = new CollectDialog ( ) ;
game.acceptVisitor(collectDialog ) ;
Map < Character , String > dialog = collectDialog.getDialog ( ) ;
[ / source ]
Here the GameVisitor defines the basic Visitor interface that each algorithm must implement .
The interface consists simply of a visit method for each concrete type .
In the CollectDialog visitor , we simply ask the characters for their dialog on those visit methods and do nothing on all the other visit methods .
So , there is clearly more code here than in the original example .
The difference is that we are now set up to add new algorithms at will without modifying any of the data classes .
So , adding Krazy Krusty mode is as simple as adding one visitor class , instead of modifying many or all of the data classes .
Another nice benefit is that you do n’t have to start from the Game class ; you can start from any class in the data structure and traverse down through the structure .
Pretty cool stuff .
Visitor lets you “ bake in ” the ability to support any number of algorithms over a heterogeneous data structure without modifying the data structure as algorithms are added .
So what ’s to hate ?
As you might expect , some of the very things that make Visitor useful also make it frustrating .
Here ’s a list of issues we ’ll explore :
Expanding data structure breaks visitors
Navigation strategies
Return values
Exception handling
Execution and use of visitors
Performance
Expanding the data structure
The first aspect of the Visitor pattern to note is that the GameVisitor interface contains a visit method for every concrete class in the data structure .
So , with the flexibility we ’ve gained in adding new algorithms , we ’ve given up the flexibility to expand the data structure without breaking our existing visitors .
In the current implementation , The addition of a new character such as Lisa would break the visitor framework because the Lisa ’s acceptVisitor method needs to call back to a visit( Lisa ) method on GameVisitor that does not exist .
If you completely control all visitors all your data structure , this may not be an issue .
It is simple to add a visit method to GameVisitor and update all existing visitors appropriately .
However , if you want a bit more insulation and protection from this kind of change , I would recommend introducing an abstract base class for your visitors that implements all visit methods with a no - op implementation .
Once you have this structure in place , the addition of a new class requires :
Adding a new data structure class
Adding a new visit method to the GameVisitor interface
Adding a new no -op visit method to the BaseVisitor interface
No other visitors are affected from a compilation point of view .
They still may need to be reviewed for whether they should override the default dummy visit method in BaseVisitor .
Another nice side effect of this change is that we can remove the empty methods in our CollectDialog ( or any other visitor ) as they are already implemented as a no op in the base class .
Navigation strategies
One gross part of the visitor pattern ( as implemented above ) is that each class with “ children ” must traverse its children in the visit method .
This means that navigation logic is distributed throughout the data structure and is likely to get overlooked as the class evolves .
Perhaps more importantly , it means that there is exactly one fixed navigation strategy hard - coded into the structure of the class .
For simple data structures with obvious traversal strategies , I think this is fine .
But it ’s certainly not the only choice .
One common option for moving this logic somewhere is to build an Iterator or Strategy that knows how to traverse the composition hierarchy .
Each data class then calls the Strategy then knows which object is the next to traverse .
You can actually even use double dispatch again to implement an Iterator as a co-operative class that works with Visitor .
This allows you to separate the navigation class hierarchy from the visitor class hierarchy .
Two big downsides to this approach is that the call sequence is much more complex and that the visit ( ) and iterate ( ) methods of every class visited so far are left on call stack .
This once culminated for me in blowing the thread stack limit on some particularly large ( but shallow ) data structures .
I do n’t really recommend this option .
Another interesting way to think about the navigation logic is that it is itself like a visitor – it is a bit of data class specific logic that must be executed to determine what children each data class contains .
Using this intuition , you can implement your navigation logic itself as a visitor that does nothing but say how to navigate when asked to visit .
You can then give the navigation visitor a more traditional “ logic ” visitor that rides along on top of the navigator .
Let ’s look at an example of this : [ source : java ]
// Will be needed inside the navigation visitor to have a common generic type
public interface Visitable {
void acceptVisitor ( GameVisitor visitor ) ;
}
public class NavigationVisitor extends BaseVisitor {
private GameVisitor logicVisitor ;
private LinkedList <? super Visitable > itemQueue =
new LinkedList ( ) ;
public NavigationVisitor( GameVisitor logicVisitor ) {
this.logicVisitor = logicVisitor ;
}
private void visitNext ( ) {
if (! itemQueue.isEmpty ( ) ) {
Visitable first = ( Visitable ) itemQueue.removeFirst ( ) ;
first.acceptVisitor( this ) ;
}
}
public void visit( Apu apu ) {
logicVisitor.visit( apu ) ;
visitNext ( ) ;
}
public void visit( SimpsonsHouse house ) {
logicVisitor.visit( house ) ;
itemQueue.addAll(house.getCharacters ( ) ) ;
itemQueue.addAll(house.getProps ( ) ) ;
visitNext ( ) ;
}
}
[ / source ]
Here we see a NavigationVisitor that holds a queue of items to be processed by the visitor .
Each visit method visits the logic visitor that is riding this navigation visitor .
It then adds any children for the current data item to the queue ( if any ) .
And finally , all visit methods must call the visitNext ( ) method to pick off the next item in the queue and visit it next .
This implements a breadth - first traversal of the data structure .
It ’s also trivial to implement depth - first and you can also change whether you visit the nodes in pre- , in - , or post - order .
You might also have some custom traversals that always need to walk Characters first or Props first or whatever .
Doing that is as easy as adding a navigation visitor .
One classic bug that occurs frequently when using a navigation visitor is the case of calling acceptVisitor with the logic visitor without using a navigation visitor at all .
Since the navigation logic no longer exists in the concrete classes , if you do n’t use a navigation visitor then you will not traverse any objects except the first one .
Return values
Return values are an area where visitors fall down a bit .
The traditional way to return or collect values while visiting is to store the state in the visitor , then provide getters to retrieve the state from the visitor at the end .
This works and is the usual way to do this but also feels repetitive and clunky after you write a few visitors .
Another cleaner way to do this was suggested recently by Ricky Clarkson by using generic visit methods that bind the return type of the visit method to the type of a visitor .
I have not tried this in my code yet but it seems like a very interesting idea .
The one place where it does n’t look so great is when the visit method does not need to return a value .
In that case , the visit method must right now return null .
Ricky suggests that allowing us to specify would be a nice way to solve this problem in Java 7 .
Exception handling
Exception handling always sucks with visitors .
You ca n’t put a visitor - specific exception on the visit ( ) methods as this would also affect the base interface and all acceptVisitor ( ) methods .
So you are left with several options :
Store as state in the visitor class Declare throws Exception ( or other more constrained type ) on all methods
Throw exceptions from your visitor , but use only RuntimeExceptions
I ’ve tried all of these at one point or another and ca n’t say I like any of them .
The first option is the weirdest in some ways since it subverts the expected use of exceptions , but probably the one I ’ve liked the best .
It allows you to store exactly the right kind of exception in your visitor and still not need to declare it on the visit ( ) methods .
The second option forces you into catching Exception on callers of all the visitors .
There are ways to trap this and rethrow the real exception ( see next item ) but this option just feels wrong .
The third option is workable but it probably depends upon how friendly you are with the idea of doing away with checked exceptions and moving instead to using mostly unchecked exceptions .
If you ’ve already done that and are mostly using unchecked exceptions in your code , then this will be easy for you .
If not , this will most likely seem weird and scary as you will start catching specific runtime exceptions when you call visitors ( none of which are declared in the signatures ) .
Execution and use of visitors
Another item of visitor weirdness is the way in which they are invoked , particularly when doing navigation via a visitor : [ source : java ]
CollectDialog collectDialog = new CollectDialog ( ) ;
NavigationVisitor nav = new NavigationVisitor ( collectDialog ) ;
game.acceptVisitor(nav ) ;
Map < Character , String > dialog = collectDialog.getDialog ( ) ;
[ / source ]
These four lines will be repeated in every visitor usage scenario .
Generally it useful to build a couple helper methods to make this cleaner .
First , it ’s useful to wrap up the middle two lines in a static method in NavigationVisitor : [ source : java ]
public static
T execVisitor ( T visitor , Visitable visitable ) {
NavigationVisitor nav = new NavigationVisitor ( visitor ) ;
visitable.acceptVisitor( nav ) ;
return visitor ;
}
[ / source ]
You can then execute a visitor with navigation with just : [ source : java ]
CollectDialog collectDialog =
NavigationVisitor.executeVisitor( new CollectDialog ( ) , game ) ;
Map < Character , String > dialog = collectDialog.getDialog ( ) ;
[ / source ]
And it can be helpful to push this code into a static method in CollectDialog itself : [ source : java ]
public static Map < Character , String > collect ( Game game ) {
CollectDialog collectDialog =
NavigationVisitor.executeVisitor( new CollectDialog ( ) , game ) ;
return collectDialog.getDialog ( ) ;
}
[ / source ]
One other nice thing you can do if you are storing exceptions within your visitor is to check for and actually throw them from the static helper method .
This makes the exception handling more normal for callers of the static method .
Another item I want to mention is that one side effect of using the Visitor pattern is that you will have lots of public visit ( ) methods in each visitor class and these methods should NOT be called by anyone outside the visitor .
The methods typically must be public to be called by data classes in a different package .
There ’s not really any workaround for this issue – it is something that should be documented in the javadoc though ( which of course , no one will read ) .
Performance
I ’ve already mentioned some memory considerations when using an Iterator in conjunction with Visitor .
You may have noticed in the visitor examples above that we are now traversing the entire data structure looking for dialog when the original implementation only looked at Characters in Places .
In my experience , this is a common occurrence with visitors .
It ’s so easy to implement a new visitor that we do n’t worry about how much extra and unnecessary work is occurring .
This is also something that ’s a little difficult to spot with a profiler because the extra overhead is spread over a bunch of methods that traverse the data structure unnecessarily so no one method shows up as a hot spot .
There are a handful of fairly easy things you can do to address visitor performance as you are building out your solution :
Add a reset ( ) method to allow reuse of visitor instances .
The visitor instance can typically be reused , thus saving the cost of constructing the visitor instance .
They ’re almost certainly not worth pooling ( like most Java objects ) but when used multiple times in the same thread , there is no reason not to reuse them .
I ’ve found that having a standard reset ( ) method on the visitor interface forces implementors to implement this behavior and makes it a common part of the visitor usage in your system .
If you are wrapping your visitors with static helper methods , those methods may be able to store and reuse visitor instances , perhaps in a ThreadLocal .
Add a mechanism to abort / terminate a visitor .
It is useful to have some way to abort the visitor execution for visitors where you are finding something and do not need to visit the entire data structure .
Depending on where navigation logic lives , there are different ways to do this .
In some cases you ’ll want some way to store an abort flag on the visitor itself and in some cases you ’ll want to build this into your navigation logic .
You will definitely want an abort mechanism if you are storing exceptions in the visitor state , as you do n’t want to continue traversing the data structure once an error has occurred .
Create custom navigators that only visit part of the data structure .
In the case of our CollectDialog visitor above , we know that we only want to visit a portion of the data structure , so we could write a navigation visitor that only visits Places and Characters and skips Props entirely .
In general , I recommend doing this sparingly for navigation cases that are frequently used or for cases that show up as performance hot spots .
The reason is that if you create a custom navigator and visitor for every algorithm , you are writing a lot of extra code and not getting the reuse benefit of the navigation logic .
One alternative might be to just have a single , very configurable navigator .
I have n’t done that before , but I imagine it would work .
Create a custom navigator with “ stop ” nodes .
One variant of the prior idea that I ’ve found useful is the notion of “ stop ” nodes .
For example , in the case of an AST ( abstract syntax tree ) generated by a parser , you may want to traverse some portion of the syntax tree but “ stop ” once you hit some kind of node .
For instance , you might traverse an AST representing a SQL query SELECT clause and “ stop ” at nodes representing aggregate functions .
Maybe this technique is a bit specialized but I found that it was perfect for some classes of visitor .
What are the alternatives
One obvious alternative is to simply hardcode the navigation and collection logic , either in the concrete objects or completely outside them in helper classes .
For simpler data structures , this makes good sense .
As we ’ve seen above , there are all sorts of consequences of using the Visitor pattern .
Another interesting future possibility in Java is closures .
The notion of passing execution logic into some sort of navigator could also be solved quite naturally using closures .
Some of the same issues with return values and exception handling still exist and are the cause for a lot of the complexity in the BGGA closure proposal for example .
Examples
I ’ve built full examples of some of the earlier code samples and you can grab them in this convenient zip to play with them yourself .
Each package contains a complete and independent version of the same code :
v1 – original non-visitor example
v2 – rudimentary visitor example
v3 – use of a visitor base class
v4 – use of navigation visitors
Thanks again to everyone that has read , commented , or emailed on prior posts .
I ’ve enjoyed the conversations and learned a lot .
A Worthwhile Reminder of the Stakes With Saudi Arabia
The official Saudi sponsorship of religious intolerance is not unknown , but every once in a while it is good to remember exactly who we are dealing with .
This is especially true in the case of Saudi - supported charities and organizations operating in the United States , who portray themselves as the face of tolerant Islam .
My most recent reminder was from the official website of Saudi Airlines , outlining what infidels can take into the country .
Tucked away in the Customs Regulations section is this : _A number of items are not allowed to be brought into the Kingdom due to religious reasons and local regulations .
These include alcoholic beverages , pork and pork products , prohibited drugs and narcotics , firearms , explosives , edged weapons and pornographic materials .
__Items and articles belonging to religions other than Islam are also prohibited .
These may include Bibles , crucifixes , statues , carvings , items with religious symbols such as the Star of David , and others .
_Let 's think about that for a moment .
NOTHING representing another religion is even ALLOWED IN THE COUNTRY .
This is not just a ban on proselytism , and goes far beyond virtually any place on the planet .
This is almost a casual , throwaway line in the middle of routine regulations .
Yet we treat the Saudi government as an entity with whom we are willing to do business , including the selling them billions of dollars of weapons to perpetrate this narrow , discriminatory theology and policy .
Now look at the other side .
Saudi - funded groups across Europe and the United States are now routinely demanding ( and seeking to gain through legal action ) special privileges for their members here .
The right to a separate public school ( New York ) , the right to refuse transport to those carrying alcohol and other items ( Minnesota ) and countless other efforts by Muslim Brotherhood - related groups carrying out the plan of peaceful conquest of the United States .
Individuals , towns and states are paying millions of dollars in legal fees ( those who choose to fight rather than cave ) to fight giving these groups privileges and exceptions that no other religion here enjoy , or should enjoy .
CAIR , ISNA and other groups claiming to speak for the Muslim world continually raise the specter of " Islamophobia " and discrimination when anything is said about their now - well documented ties to the Muslim Brotherhood , Hamas and other things they have so long denied .
Interesting that there has been so little attention paid by any of these groups to true discrimination , hate and bigotry by the country that has been one of their patrons for decades .
It is truly a mind - boggling set of circumstances , brought home by those two small paragraphs on an official government website .
I do not travel with a Bible , crucifix or other religious symbols .
But I would like to think I could if I wanted to .
Perhaps we should agree to those conditions of travel if we can ban all symbols of Islam here .
Or perhaps we should simply refuse to do business with that type of government until there is some semblance of religious tolerance .
Wo n't happen , of course , but it useful , at least to me , to remember why fighting the Brotherhood and its groups in this country is so important .
They are not agents of tolerance , but agents of the worst form of intolerance , bigotry and hatred , made worse , not better , by the fact much of it is state sponsored .
The very least we should do is refuse to do any sort of business with Islamist groups that do not publicly renounce funding from a government whose official policy is that of hatred and intolerance .

Scientists
Use the " Dark Web " to Snag Extremists and Terrorists Online
Team from the University of Arizona identifies and tracks terrorists on the Web
The Dark Web project team catalogues and studies places online where terrorists operate .
September 10 , 2007
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
Terrorists and extremists have set up shop on the Internet , using it to recruit new members , spread propaganda and plan attacks across the world .
The size and scope of these dark corners of the Web are vast and disturbing .
But in a non-descript building in Tucson , a team of computational scientists is using the cutting - edge technology and novel new approaches to track their moves online , providing an invaluable tool in the global war on terror .
Funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies , Hsinchun Chen and his Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of Arizona have created the Dark Web project , which aims to systematically collect and analyze all terrorist - generated content on the Web .
This is no small undertaking .
The speed , ubiquity , and potential anonymity of Internet media -- email , web sites , and Internet forums -- make them ideal communication channels for militant groups and terrorist organizations .
As a result , terrorists groups and their followers have created a vast presence on the Internet .
A recent report estimates that there are more than 5,000 Web sites created and maintained by known international terrorist groups , including Al - Qaeda , the Iraqi insurgencies , and many home - grown terrorist cells in Europe .
Many of these sites are produced in multiple languages and can be hidden within innocuous - looking Web sites .
Because of its vital role in coordinating terror activities , analyzing Web content has become increasingly important to the intelligence agencies and research communities that monitor these groups , yet the sheer amount of material to be analyzed is so great that it can quickly overwhelm traditional methods of monitoring and surveillance .
This is where the Dark Web project comes in .
Using advanced techniques such as Web spidering , link analysis , content analysis , authorship analysis , sentiment analysis and multimedia analysis , Chen and his team can find , catalogue and analyze extremist activities online .
According to Chen , scenarios involving vast amounts of information and data points are ideal challenges for computational scientists , who use the power of advanced computers and applications to find patterns and connections where humans can not .
One of the tools developed by Dark Web is a technique called Writeprint , which automatically extracts thousands of multilingual , structural , and semantic features to determine who is creating ' anonymous ' content online .
Writeprint can look at a posting on an online bulletin board , for example , and compare it with writings found elsewhere on the Internet .
By analyzing these certain features , it can determine with more than 95 percent accuracy if the author has produced other content in the past .
The system can then alert analysts when the same author produces new content , as well as where on the Internet the content is being copied , linked to or discussed .
Dark
Web also uses complex tracking software called Web spiders to search discussion threads and other content to find the corners of the Internet where terrorist activities are taking place .
But according to Chen , sometimes the terrorists fight back .
" They can put booby - traps in their Web forums , " Chen explains , " and the spider can bring back viruses to our machines . "
This online cat - and - mouse game means Dark Web must be constantly vigilant against these and other counter - measures deployed by the terrorists .
Despite the risks , Dark Web is producing tangible results in the global war on terror .
The project team recently completed a study of online stories and videos designed to help train terrorists in how to build improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) .
Understanding what information is being spread about IED methods and where in the world it is being downloaded can improve countermeasures that are developed to thwart them .
Dark
Web is also a major research testbed for understanding the propaganda , ideology , communication , fundraising , command and control , and recruitment and training of terrorist groups .
The Dark Web team has used the tools at their disposal to explore the content and impact of materials relating to " virtual imams " on the Internet , as well as terrorist training and weapons manuals .
Dark
Web 's capabilities are also being used to study the online presence of extremist groups and other social movement organizations .
Chen sees applications for this Web mining approach for other academic fields .
" What we are doing is using this to study societal change , " Chen says .
" Evidence of this change is appearing online , and computational science can help other disciplines better understand this change . "

After the shooting rampage at Virginia Tech , many well - intentioned people all over the country have been calling for increased gun control laws .
However , economists tend to oppose gun control laws , since such laws generally pay no attention to basic economic issues .
Let 's start with the relationship between means and ends .
The shooter had his ends : he wanted to kill many people , and he wanted it to be visible and spectacular .
He also had his means : guns and bullets .
He engaged in forward - looking behavior : he purchased the guns , bullets , chains , locks , and video equipment well in advance .
He taped himself in advance explaining what he was going to do and why he was going to do it .
Now let 's consider gun control .
Many people argue that if the shooter did not have guns and bullets , he would not have been able to shoot all of those people .
This is surely correct .
However , from that , they infer that if he did not have guns and bullets , he would not have been able to kill all of those people .
This is a whole different question .
As Mises.org readers know , in economics , we discuss the idea of substitutes .
These are goods that can be used to replace each other such as Coke vs. Pepsi , contact lenses vs. eyeglasses , Macs vs. PCs .
When a person has ends , a person can select among different means to achieve those ends .
These different means are substitutes .
Cho wanted to kill many people , and he wanted it to be visible and spectacular .
To that end , he purchases guns , bullets , chains , and locks ( to prevent survivors from escaping ) .
Would gun control have prevented this ?
Or would Cho — who apparently planned this attack for weeks , based on the fact that he acquired guns , bullets , chains , and locks for weeks — have used substitute goods ?
What would Cho 's substitutes have been ?
What others means are there by which he could engage in mass murder ?
Well , he could have purchased a knife , although that is probably a weak substitute for guns and bullets in achieving his ends .
He has to be right next to his victim , and he might be defeated in personal combat by another person .
Likewise , he could not kill a lot of people in the same time frame , and it would not be as spectacular .
Perhaps he could have resorted to convincing people to engage in mass suicide , as Rev. Jim Jones did at Jonestown , or Heaven 's Gate cult leader Marshall Herff Applewhite did in California .
However , since Cho was apparently a non-charismatic loner , this substitute would not likely have been very effective as a means to his end of mass murder .
Consider instead , though , the news we see every day from Iraq and Afghanistan .
On the day this was written , a moving car bomb killed 19 and wounded 35 in a restaurant .
Meanwhile , a parked car bomb killed several more .
That is the sort of visible and spectacular mass destruction that Cho desired , and it is not greatly difficult to produce a car bomb .
Clearly , a car bomb is a substitute means to achieving Cho 's end of a visible and spectacular killing of many students .
In fact , it is possible that Cho might even have been more effective with such a means .
After all , student traffic flows are very predictable , being based on when classes begin and end .
Had Cho built a bomb , he could have detonated it at a time and place where hundreds of students might be within the blast radius .
In fact , we see car bombings in the news almost every day , but mass shootings are so rare that we remember them all .
We remember the Columbine shooting , and we will remember the Virginia Tech shooting .
We remember 9/11 and we remember Pearl Harbor .
Why do we remember these things ?
Because they are so rare !
However , we do n't remember how many people were killed in Iraq this week , or last week , or the week before .
Why not ?
Because there are so many car bombings that we are nearly immune to news of them .
Mass shootings are extremely rare , which makes them news .
So however much some people might yearn for gun control , it seems unlikely that it would have prevented Cho from achieving his ends .
He had substitutes available , he had more than one means available to achieve his ends , and he plotted long enough to hit upon other means — especially since those other means are described in detail on TV , in the newspapers , and on the internet every day .
Economists recognize the relationship between means and ends , including the role played by substitutes .
Economists understand that when government restricts one market , consumers merely move into another market , and when government tries to foreclose one means , individuals will simply shift into other means to achieve the same ends .
However horrendous we might find the mass shootings at Columbine , Virginia Tech , and other places , the fact is that when disaffected people start planning mass mayhem , the lack of a gun will not stop them .
The 1927 Bath Township School bombing , in which 45 people were killed by a school board member , shows that guns are neither necessary nor sufficient for the commission of mass murder at schools .
Economists call for a re-thinking of the issue using economic reasoning .
As Henry Hazlitt pointed out in his great book Economics in One Lesson , good analysis requires people to look past the obvious and short - term effects on some people , and to focus on the longer - term effects to all people .
After all , those longer - term economic realities will arise regardless of the good intentions of people who call for market restrictions .
BY now , all of Wall Street understands that the private - equity gravy train has jumped the tracks .
But few seem to realize how ugly the pile - up could become .
With the buyout market in free fall , lots of attention has focused on a few obvious pressure points , like which investment banks will rack up big losses on the $ 330 billion in debt that they committed to pay for leveraged buyouts over the last year .
For the most part , though , Wall Street seems to be taking it all in stride .
James Dimon , the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase , said last month that he was “ comfortable . ”
Comfortable ?
Let me offer a more dour view : wide swaths of Wall Street , and many of the industries that serve it , are in for some serious collateral damage .
Not only has private equity been out of business for the last two months , but that activity is not likely to resume with any significance soon .
And when it does , it will be at a fraction of its recent peak .
For the past two days I 've been immersed in conversations with several principals in the Ellen DeGeneres - Mutts & Moms - Iggy the Pup fiasco .
And fiasco it is .
I 've spoken with Ellen 's publicist , Ellen 's dog trainer , the Vice President of Publicity for Telepictures ( which produces Ellen 's show ) , the attorney for Marina Baktis and Vanessa Chekroun ( owners of Mutts & Moms in Pasadena , CA ) , and several respected animal rescue experts in the Los Angeles area - many who have worked with Mutts & Moms .
For readers who are unaware of the Ellen DeGeneres / Mutts & Moms fiasco , here is a video synopsis :
This past Monday , on her popular daytime talk show , Ellen DeGeneres dissolved into tears as she recounted her experience of adopting a puppy ( Iggy ) from a pet adoption agency ( Mutts & Moms in Pasadena , CA - which to her credit , DeGeneres did n't name ) .
After two weeks , Ellen and her partner , Portia de Rossi , decided Iggy was incompatible with their household and gave Iggy to Ellen 's hairdresser ( Cheryl Marks ) and the hairdresser 's eleven and twelve year old daughters .
But the legal contract Ellen signed with Mutts & Moms forbade Ellen from giving Iggy away , and required Iggy to be returned to the Agency should Ellen decide not to keep him .
By giving 7 lb .
Iggy to her hairdresser and not returning him to Mutts & Moms as stipulated , Ellen broke her contract .
As a result , Mutts & Moms went to the hairdresser 's home , where , in the presence of the police , they confiscated Iggy , returned him to their agency , and found him another home .
Germane to this synopsis is the resultant vitriol that drove the HUMANS involved to such an impasse that rational negotiation on Iggy 's behalf became impossible .
Mutts &
Moms failed to give the hairdresser 's family its fullest consideration as legitimate adopters , and used its legal leverage to remove Iggy from a home where he was wanted .
DeGeneres used the full extent of her celebrity to ignite a fan - based frenzy that resulted in death threats to the impoverished owners of Mutts & Moms .
In addition , Baktis and Chekroun have likely lost their animal rescue business and small store .
An online petition to Free Iggy has been launched by Ellen 's supporters :
http://www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi?FreeIggy), while an earlier online petition , which asked petitioners not to adopt from animal rescue organizations until Iggy is returned , has rightfully been taken down .
Still the saddest repercussion of all is the potential for tens of thousands of dogs and cats to go unadopted , and to be euthanized , due to the anger engendered toward rescue groups as a result of this debacle .
Below are are few clarifications of inaccuracies reported by the media on this story :
1 . Iggy did not live with DeGeneres and De Rossi for the full two weeks before he was given to hairdresser Cheryl Marks .
Iggy was left in the care of Los Angeles dog trainer , Zach Grey ( UrbanTails.net ) , who reunited Iggy with DeGeneres and De Rossi after 9 days of individual and group training - at which time Degeneres and De Rossi concluded that they did n't want a young puppy - UNDERSCORING THE NEED FOR THE CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENT TO RETURN ANIMALS TO THEIR AGENCIES IF THE ANIMAL IS UNWANTED .
The fact is , DeGeneres and De Rossi did what thousands of adopters do .
They wanted a puppy , but realizing the amount of work a puppy takes , they could n't make that commitment .
Can one honestly fault Mutts & Moms for enforcing a provision that protects rejected animals ?
If Mutts & Moms were to PUBLICLY disregard this requirement , it would pave the way for anyone to overrule this safeguard and recklessly dispose of an animal .
2. Contrary to the negativity generated toward Mutts & Moms by the powerful DeGeneres camp and biased media pundits , the animal rescue experts with whom I 've spoken were complimentary toward the organization .
Ricky Whitman , Vice President of Community Resources for the Pasadena Humane Society ( PHS ) , told me she was not clearly represented in the press when quoted as saying " her group would 've handled this [ Iggy situation ] very differently . "
What Whitman actually meant is that since PHS has contracts to provide animal control services to different cities , they would have been required to remove Iggy in the presence of animal control officers and under much more stringent conditions - hence " differently . "
Whitman lauded the owners of Mutts & Moms for their rescue accomplishments , stating , " We have worked closely and well with Mutts & Moms in the past .
We have honored them for their work . "
Whitman recounted the story of a pit bull puppy who'd been raised in a small bunny hutch .
According to Whitman , Mutts & Moms was the only organization willing to accept the difficult task of rehabilitating this unfortunate animal - an accomplishment Whitman praised highly .
3 . The DeGeneres camp 's contention that Mutts & Moms went to the media FIRST does not square with the timeline of events .
On the evening Mutts & Moms confiscated Iggy from the hairdresser 's house , TMZ ( also a Telepictures product ) had been called to video the visit .
According to Keith A. Fink , attorney for Mutts & Moms , it was the DeGeneres camp who contacted TMZ - NOT the media shy , show - biz naive owners of Mutts & Moms .
Indeed , my own experience with the owners of Mutts & Moms bears witness to their abject fear of media , since their own attorney was unable to goad them into speaking with me or with the other media attempting to make contact .
4 . The " Moms " in the name Mutts & Moms does n't identify Marina and Vanessa as " moms " who rescue animals .
The " Moms " in Mutts & Moms denotes the organization 's inspired mission to adopt mother dogs from shelters once they have given birth and nursed their puppies - an arduous undertaking , since mother dogs are often euthanized after nursing their litter .
In the final analysis , this Ellen DeGeneres - Mutts & Moms - Iggy saga is a private issue between private individuals that landed on the national stage .
If Ellen intended to use her show as the platform to manipulate this matter , she has made a dangerous error in judgement .
She has crossed the regrettable line from comedy pulpit to bully pulpit and used her mega platform to attack " the little guy " - or in this case - " the little gals . "
And it 's caused significant harm .
Yesterday on the phone , Laura Mandel , Vice President of Publicity for Telepictures , described Ellen as " a real person with real emotion . "
On this there is no doubt .
But Ellen is also an incredibly powerful woman able to influence legions of fans .
Beyond her cameras are millions of viewers she knows nothing about , capable of acts she can't control .
They worship Ellen and protect her with a vengeance - and right now their vengeance is centered on two frightened rescuers who do n't deserve their wrath .
I 've read some fan comments .
Their hatred for Marina and Vanessa is shocking .
In the entertainment business , there is the long - standing concept of " a pro . " " A pro " is an entertainer who , regardless of personal travails , faces the audience and does the job .
In my opinion , Ellen is teetering between a " pro " and a woman who 's unclear about her " job . "
She 's abused her power by publicly challenging those less powerful .
Rosie O'Donnell took on the President .
Rosie also took on Trump .
Others take on corporations , like Exxon and the airlines .
But Ellen has challenged two defenseless woman with no resources - no fame , no fortune , no accolades and no ovations .
Only attorney Keith Fink has come forth to champion their cause .
Across the nation , because of this fiasco , animal rescue organizations have taken an enormous hit - for which helpless animals will bear the brunt .
To help revitalize this noble profession , I 'm calling on Ellen DeGeneres to step up and intercede .
I 'm asking her to use her brilliance , her compassion , and her enormous reach to convene a panel of rescue professionals on her own show as quickly as possible to discuss what these organizations do and how they do it .
There are lessons that need to be learned and rules that must be understood .
My hope ( though far - fetched ) is that if Ellen does choose to do this , Mutts & Moms will participate - without the caviat that Iggy be returned to Cheryl and her daughters .
There 's an important lesson for Cheryl 's daughters in all of this that has somehow been forgotten .
The fact is , a contractual rule was broken .
Sometimes the greater lesson is understanding the need to honor the rule - rather than the need to circumvent it .
On a personal note :
For those who believe I 'm holding Ellen to an unfair standard by suggesting she shield her personal issues from her viewers , I 'll answer with this .
One of the greatest gifts I 've been given in my lifetme is the opportunity to teach .
Every day I face rooms filled to capacity with adult students who care a great deal about me .
I 've faced them when I 'm happy and I 've faced them when I 'm sad .
I 've faced them after losing family members , losing beloved animals , losing relationships , undergoing surgery , and more .
But I neither share nor show my burdens .
It is not my student 's job to bear them .
Nor is it Ellen 's viewers ' job to bear hers .
We are simply there to serve .
Do n’t you hate when you ’re out at a social gathering and you ’re the only person sitting at the table who is n’t part of the conversation ?
Every time you try to say something you seem to get interrupted or ignored .
And the more you try to take part , the more awkward things get .
So you stare off into space , pretend to watch the band , or pull out your mobile phone and act like you just got a text message .
Nobody enjoys being a wallflower .
No matter how shy or introverted you claim to be , beyond our fragile , wounded egos , we all so badly want to be a part of the conversation , to be paid attention , to have as much fun as everyone else .
Sitting on the sidelines is just boring and uncomfortable .
The key to making the transition from wallflower to social adventurer is to develop strong social skills and to go in with the right mindset .
Here ’s what works for me :
1. Practice social skydiving .
Social skydiving , the art of talking to strangers , is a learnable skill .
Through practice , you can go from sexually frustrated to choosing your own adventure , by taking massive action to meet new people .
Social skydiving is the core skill of moving from the social sidelines to center stage .
If you go out to social gatherings , but are uncomfortable anywhere but in your tiny little bubble of friends , those fake text message moments are virtually guaranteed .
2 . Go out with one goal : Mind -Blowing Adventure .
When you go out , make it your goal to amuse yourself by exchanging energy with people .
This is the state of mind from which your entire social experience will flow .
Instead of “ hanging out ” , treat your social time as an intense form of play .
While it may sound a little silly to aim for “ mind - blowing adventure ” — frankly , most of your social outings will not hit that mark — this will give you the right attitude in deciding where you focus your attention .
3. Have a Plan B .
The situations in which you hold the least power are the ones which you are unprepared to walk away from .
If your only choices are to keep dragging yourself through boring beer babble or go home and channel - surf for some late - night softcore , the former almost seems like a good idea .
I like to have at least one backup plan when I go out .
One of my favourite Plan B ’s involves some solo social skydiving at a specific nightclub whose crowd I really enjoy , because I know the amount of fun I ’m going to have will be limited only by how much I interact with people .
And when you go to a venue on your own , interacting with others becomes the path of least resistance .
4. Instead of thinking acceptance , think entertainment value .
Having a great social life requires setting high standards .
It means respecting yourself enough to know that you deserve to have fun every time you go out .
We all have a social polarity .
No matter what you do , some people will get along with you and some wo n’t .
The more authentic you are , the stronger your social polarity , and the stronger you ’ll resonate with people who belong in your life while avoiding those who do n’t .
Striving for acceptance is torture .
It turns you into an energy vampire and only further annoys people who already were n’t that interested in you .
Instead of seeking others ’ approval , become the CEO of your own social life .
Invest your attention into only those people , places , and things that amplify your energy and show you a good time .
5 . Expect the full attention of the person you ’re talking to .
If you demonstrate that your attention comes cheaply , people will treat you accordingly .
Do n’t engage people that are n’t completely tuned in .
If you ’re talking to someone , guy or girl , and they ’re looking around the room , or someone comes up to them and they turn and completely shut you out , do n’t stand there waiting for the privilege of being spoken to again .
There are likely many other people begging for somebody to talk to them , so take a quick look around and dive into something new .
If I ’m talking to someone who ’s looking around while I ’m talking to them , and obviously not invested in the interaction , I ’ll often just turn around and talk to someone else , without warning .
6 . Do n’t settle for interruption .
This one ’s pretty obvious , but I see it happen all the time and people do nothing about it , and let their fun go to waste .
Here ’s the scenario :
You just started having a conversation with a cute girl .
But you ’re talking slightly across the table to each other and there are people sitting in between you .
Suddenly the people in between start talking .
And talking .
And talking .
Your conversation is interrupted , dead , and now your eyes dart from one speaker to another , like you ’re watching a verbal tennis match , poorly pretending to give a shit .
All you ’re really thinking is “ @ %*@ $ !
I was just getting to know her ! ”
In this case , take the initiative .
Either ask the person in between you to change seats or take a seat nearer the person you were talking to .
Do n’t choose to let a good interaction go to waste .
The other person will probably be too shy to make the same move .
7 . Talk to strangers .
If you ’re finding it hard to amuse yourself among your friends on this occasion , then shine your spotlight somewhere else .
Put those social skydiving skills you ’ve been working on to good use .
Take a walk around the venue and see if there are any other interesting people to roll with .
I ’ve had it happen at least half a dozen times that I go out somewhere with one or more friends and , bored with the usual “ Wow , check that one out ! ” spectating , I end up wandering around the venue , doing my own thing , and completely lose track of the people I arrived with .
8. Change venues .
If you still ca n’t find a way to amuse yourself , then cut your losses , eject , and go with Plan B .
Last Friday night , for example , I was out at a friend ’s birthday party .
I caught up with some buddies I had n’t seen in a while but was slow mixing in with the rest of the crowd .
Shyness is a choice , so I blame only myself for holding back .
Either way , I just was n’t getting into it and wanted to shake things up .
So with a few hours left in the evening , I waved goodbye , hopped in a cab , and headed to a nightclub that I know has good music and a fun crowd on Friday nights .
Within about three minutes of arriving I got approached by a girl on the dance floor .
We talked and danced for a bit , and a few minutes later she introduced me to her friend .
A couple minutes later , I was sitting at their table .
In the span of a half - hour total , I went from not really feeling it at one party , to having an awesome time somewhere else .
The key to avoiding boring , awkward social situations is to get used to talking to people you do n’t know , to focus on creating your own fun , and to respect yourself enough to know that you deserve a mind - blowing adventure .
Instead of trying to fit in with the crowd , go with the flow , do n’t try to force conversation , and let your curiosity lead you to where the action ’s at .

At least one person , a law professor in Tennessee thinks there ’s a hidden libertarian message in the Harry Potter series :
KNOXVILLE — “ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , ” the seventh and final book in the series , will be published on July 21 , and University of Tennessee law professor Benjamin Barton will be standing in line to get it .
A big fan of Harry Potter , Barton has become a true student of the series , and he says he ’s found some politically charged lessons written between the lines .
(…)
Barton wrote a paper entitled “ Harry Potter and the Half - Crazed Bureaucracy ” that was published in the Michigan Law Review in May 2006 .
The paper is being reprinted as a chapter in the book , “ Harry Potter and the Law ” ( Carolina Press ) , due out this summer .
He also has lectured on the topic at a “ Power of Stories ” seminar in Gloucester , England , in July 2005 .
In “ Harry Potter and the Half - Crazed Bureaucracy , ” Barton details the political messages he ’s discovered in the Potter books :
“ What would you think of a government that engaged in this list of tyrannical activities : tortured children for lying ; designed its prison specifically to suck all life and hope out of the inmates ; placed citizens in that prison without a hearing ; ordered the death penalty without a trial ; allowed the powerful , rich or famous to control policy ; selectively prosecuted crimes ( the powerful go unpunished and the unpopular face trumped - up charges ) ; conducted criminal trials without defense counsel ; used truth serum to force confessions ; maintained constant surveillance over all citizens ; offered no elections and no democratic lawmaking process ; and controlled the press ?
“ You might assume that the above list is the work of some despotic central African nation , but it is actually the product of the Ministry of Magic , the magician ’s government in J.K. Rowling ’s Harry Potter series . ”
Barton said he thinks the anti-government thread that runs through the Potter novels is significant because the books have great potential to sway public opinion .
I used to be in the Central American Solidarity Movement in the 80s and early 90s when we were struggling to protect the campesinos of Latin America from Right - wing death squads and CIA - run Contra terrorists .
Guatemalans , Hondurans , Salvadorans and Nicaraguans were all being murdered , tortured and imprisoned by the forces of the Right , and these governments and the Contra terrorist army , of course , had to constantly procure more weapons , police equipment , torture instruments and training .
Since Congress was , at times , cutting off funding and support for the Contras or El Salvador , etc. , other countries had to step into the breach to continue the needed support for all these nefarious activities being sponsored by the Reagan White House .
A major supplier to and trainer of all these thugs and Fascists was the State of Israel , which shocked me when I first found out , because I really had little sense of what was going on in the Middle East at that time , so I was n't aware that , with all its experience in imprisoning and torturing Palestinians , Israel was well - groomed for the job .
And , of course , Israel was part of that infamous triumvirate enabling illegal arms shipments and fund - raising for the murderous Contras attacking Sandinista Nicaragua 's villages , what came to be known as the Iran - Contra Affair .
As if it was trying to do the complete hat - trick for international villainy and support for tyranny and oppression , Israel at the same time was supporting the Apartheid government of South Africa , as the latter murdered and tortured black South Africans struggling for freedom .
Against this background , it is so utterly hypocritical and arrogant that Israel and AIPAC are attacking Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa as an anti-Semite for pointing out the parallels between Apartheid in his country and Israel 's policies against the Palestinians , that it is mind - boggling .
Mind - boggling !
If only the Sicilian Mob could throw around charges of anti-Italian racism with the wieght AIPAC does with anti-Semitism , no cop would ever be able to even ticket one of them for jay - walking .
The Mob could take over all of New York .
Now , lest we forget completely how Israel 's own Mafia - style agenda even churns up American bodies in its murder - grinders while it makes itself immune with the cloak of anti-Semitism , Ray McGovern has written an excellent article that begins to address what really happened on that fateful day of June 8 , 1967 , when the Israeli air force attacked the USS Liberty relentlessly and remorselessly for several hours :
So Who 's Afraid of the Israel Lobby ?
( original article here )
By Ray McGovern Virtually everyone : Republican , Democrat - Conservative , Liberal .
The fear factor is non-partisan , you might say , and palpable .
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) brags that it is the most influential foreign policy lobbying organization on Capitol Hill , and has demonstrated that time and again - and not only on Capitol Hill .
Seldom has the Lobby 's power been as clearly demonstrated as in its ability to suppress the awful truth that on June 8 , 1967 , during the Six Day War : Israel deliberately attacked the intelligence collection ship USS Liberty , in full awareness it was a U.S.
Navy ship , and did its best to sink it and leave no survivors ;
The Israelis would have succeeded had they not broken off the attack upon learning , from an intercepted message , that the commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet had launched carrier fighters to the scene ; and By that time 34 of the Liberty 's crew had been killed and over 170 wounded .
Scores of intelligence analysts and senior officials have known this for years .
That virtually all of them have kept a forty - year frightened silence is testament to the widespread fear of touching this live wire .
Even more telling is the fact that the National Security Agency apparently has destroyed voice tapes and transcripts heard and seen by many intelligence analysts , material that shows beyond doubt that the Israelis knew exactly what they were doing .
The Ugly Truth
But the truth will out - eventually .
All it took in this case was for a courageous journalist ( of the endangered species kind ) to listen to the surviving crew and do a little basic research , not shrinking from naming war crimes and not letting senior U.S. officials , from the president on down , off the hook for suppressing - even destroying - damning evidence from intercepted Israeli communications .
The mainstream media have now published an exposé based largely on interviews with those most intimately involved .
A lengthy article by Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter John Crewdson appeared in the Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun on Oct. 2 titled " New revelations in attack on American spy ship . "
( http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/world/chi-liberty_tuesoct02,0,6015776.story [ 1 ] )
To the subtitle goes the prize for understatement of the year : " Veterans , documents suggest U.S. , Israel did n't tell full story of deadly 1967 incident . " ...............
A Marine Stands Up
On the evening of Sept. 26 , 2006 , I gave a talk on Iraq to an overflow crowd of 400 at National Avenue Church in Springfield , Missouri .
A questioner asked what I thought of the study by John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago and Stephen Walt of Harvard titled " The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy . "
The study had originally been commissioned by The Atlantic Monthly .
When the draft arrived , however , shouts of " Leper ! " were heard at the Atlantic .
The monthly wasted no time in saying thanks - but - no - thanks , and the leper - study then wandered in search of a home , finding none among American publishers .
Eventually the London Review of Books published it in March 2006 .
I had read that piece carefully and found it an unusual act of courage as well as scholarship .
That 's what I told the questioner , adding that I did have two problems with the study : First , it seemed to me the authors erred in attributing virtually all the motivation for the U.S. attack on Iraq to the Israel Lobby and the so - called " neo-conservatives " running our policy and armed forces .
Was Israel an important factor ?
Indeed .
But of equal importance , in my view , was the oil factor and what the Pentagon now calls the " enduring " military bases in Iraq , which the White House and Pentagon decided were needed for the U.S. to dominate that part of the Middle East .
Second , I was intrigued by the fact that Mearsheimer and Walt made no mention of what I believe to be , if not the most telling , then perhaps the most sensational proof of the power the Lobby knows it can exert over our government and Congress .
In sum , in June 1967 , after deliberately using fighter - bombers and torpedo boats to attack the USS Liberty for over two hours in an attempt to sink it and kill its entire crew , and then getting the U.S. government , the Navy , and the Congress to cover up what happened , the Israeli government learned that it could - literally - get away with murder .
I found myself looking out at 400 blank stares .
The USS Liberty ?
And so I asked how many in the audience had heard of the attack on the Liberty on June 8 , 1967 .
Three hands went up ; I called on the gentleman nearest me .
Ramrod straight he stood : " Sir , Sergeant Bryce Lockwood , United States Marine Corps , retired .
I am a member of the USS Liberty crew , Sir . "
Catching my breath , I asked him if he would be willing to tell us what happened .
" Sir , I have not been able to do that .
It is hard .
But it has been almost 40 years , and I would like to try this evening , Sir . "
You could hear a pin drop for the next 15 minutes , as Lockwood gave us his personal account of what happened to him , his colleagues , and his ship on the afternoon of June 8 , 1967 .
He was a linguist assigned to collect communications intelligence from the USS Liberty , which was among the ugliest - and most easily identifiable - ships in the fleet with antennae springing out in all directions .
Lockwood told of the events of that fateful day , beginning with the six - hour naval and air surveillance of the Liberty by the Israeli navy and air force on the morning of June 8 .
After the air attacks including thousand - pound bombs and napalm , three sixty - ton torpedo boats lined up like a firing squad , pointing their torpedo tubes at the Liberty 's starboard hull .
Lockwood had been ordered to throw the extremely sensitive cryptological equipment overboard and had just walked beyond the bulwark separating the NSA intelligence unit from the rest of the ship when , he recalled , he sensed a large black object , a tremendous explosion , and sheet of flame .
The torpedo had struck dead center in the NSA space .
The cold , oily water brought Lockwood back to consciousness .
Around him were 25 dead colleagues ; but he heard moaning .
Three were still alive ; one of Lockwood 's shipmates dragged one survivor up the hatch .
Lockwood was able to lift the two others , one - by - one , onto his shoulder and carry them up through the hatch .
This meant alternatively banging on the hatch for someone to open it and swimming back to fish his shipmate out of the water lest he float out to sea through the 39 - foot hole made by the torpedo .
At that Lockwood stopped speaking .
It was enough .
Hard , very hard - even after almost 40 years ............( source )
So this is our so - called strategic ally , Israel , our noble friend and guide in a sea of so - called radical Islam in the Middle East .
It is clear that this is an abusive relationship , one of convenience at best , where Israel has , and will again , eagerly shed American blood to further its colonial geopolitical ambitions , while the White House in turn tries to use Israel as a pawn in its own chess games .
Meanwhile our psycho-American Armageddon Evangelicals want to see Israel serve as Cosmic cannon fodder in their great and delusional war against Satan .
The losers from all this darkness of purpose are the Jewish people , the American people , and the rest of the Middle East .
Why did the jet go down ?
No bodies were found
Who owned the jet ?
Who owned the jet at the time of the alleged rendition flights ?
At least one plane supplied by Richmor has become known as a possible transport of suspects in CIA extraordinary rendition operations .
The Gulfstream jet in question is owned by Assembly Point Aviation , an Albany , New York company owned by Phillip H. Morse , a part owner of the Boston Red Socks and a successful catheter salesman .
The plane in question sported two different license tags , one was N85VM , and the other was N227SV .
These two tags correspond to the Gulfstream with the serial number 1172 .
This plane has made over 50 trips to Guantanamo with trips throughout the Middle East , Europe , as well as domestic flights in the US for Red Sox events .
A terror connection ?
Final note :
Advocates for detainees and human rights groups said the ruling was an important development in the legal battle over Guantánamo .
They said it could reshape what have been frequent legal conflicts over administration plans to send detainees to countries where they say they face torture or mistreatment .
“ It is the only time a court has said the government does not have the unfettered right to do what they will with these people , ” said one of Mr. Rahman ’s lawyers , Joshua W. Denbeaux .
The ruling was the latest illustration of the hurdles the government faces in its effort to reduce the number of detainees at Guantánamo .
State Department officials have said their efforts to repatriate many of the remaining 330 Guantánamo detainees have been hampered by resistance from some countries and by the government ’s own concerns about human rights issues .
In other cases , lawyers for detainees have tried to block transfers based on human rights concerns but have failed .
Detainees ’ lawyers said yesterday that they knew of no other case in which a judge had barred a transfer .
Some lawyers said yesterday that they expected an appeal and that it was far from clear how appeals judges would view the ruling .
Erik Ablin , a Justice Department spokesman , said the department had argued that the judge lacked the power to issue the injunction .
The government , he said , is “ reviewing the district court order and considering its options . ”
Cynthia Smith , a Defense Department spokeswoman , said officials worked to ensure that mistreatment of transferred detainees did not occur and investigated accusations of mistreatment .
“ Detainees are not repatriated to countries where it is more likely than not that they will be tortured , ” Ms. Smith said .
Author under gag order assails producer , ABC for ' Path to 9/11 '
Peter Lance

The following editorial was authored by Peter Lance , whose 1000 Years for Revenge was among several books that formed the basis for ABC 's controversial documentary " Path to 9/11 . "
Read RAW STORY 's interview with Lance at this link .
Last Wednesday , in a front page LA Times Calendar piece  Clinton and the missing DVD ,  reporter Martin Miller gave voice to the latest series of charges from the mini-series  neo-con writer / producer Cyrus Nowrasteh who now claims that out of deference to Hillary Clinton , ABC is shelving the five hour mini-series which was hyper-critical of her husbands counter - terrorism record .
Nowrasteh , an Iranian - American who wrote the much criticized Showtime docudrama The Day Reagan Was Shot , has enjoyed a second career over the last year , working the right - wing lecture circuit and giving interviews to conservative webmags like FrontPageMag.com charging that ABC had watered down his original vision and that hes received death threats  for speaking out .
In his latest FrontPage booking , Nowrasteh whines ,  Last year at this time it was a coordinated effort from the Clintons , Sandy Berger , the DNC , and the far - left loony blogosphere to swamp ABC with emails and phone calls and threats to get them to block the broadcast , or recut the movie .
Since then its been more subtle .
I know there have been phone calls to top execs at Disney from President Clinton himself , and friends of the Clintons , of which there are many in Hollywood . 
Seemingly without challenge , the LA Times  Miller reported that  The $ 40 million ABC miniseries , which recently received seven Emmy nominations  is listed as currently unavailable on Amazon.com .
 With no date for the release , questions are being raised about whether political pressure is behind its current status as a stalled or discarded DVD project .
Miller seemed so taken with Nowrasteh that he elevated him to the status of First Amendment gladiator :  Whatever anybody may think about me or this movie ,  he quotes Cyrus ,  This is a dangerous precedent , to allow a movie to be buried I think the town needs to stand up .
The other side of The Path to 9/11 story
As the author of one of the three books on which The Path was based , Im now weighing in  despite a gag order - to suggest that ABC may have other reasons for shelving Nowrastehs Clinton bash ; a mini-series that virtually blames 9/11 on the ex-Presidents failures to get bin Laden , yet gives a pass to Bush 41 for failing to stop the first World Trade Center bombing and Bush 43 for  The Day Of ;  arguably the greatest defense failure in US history .
How do I know this ?
First because my book 1000 Years For Revenge , was one of the three works on which ABC based the mini .
They acquired it for a quarter of a million dollars in 2005 under threat of litigation , after theyd lost the book in a bidding war with NBC .
Nowrasteh then proceeded to launder most of my critical findings on negligence by the FBI and the two Bush administrations and give Path a twisted pro-Bureau slant through the eyes of ex-ABC News correspondent John Miller , who now works as Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI .
Like Miller I was a former correspondent for ABC News .
In the mid 1980s , I won two Emmys for my investigative reporting on 20/20 and multiple awards for reporting on Nightline and World News Tonight .
After almost a decade as a screenwriter , I returned to investigative reporting full time after Sept. 11 .
Ive published three investigative books for HarperCollins on the failures of the FBI and Justice Department on the path to 9/11 including Cover Up : What The Government is Still Hiding about the War on Terror ( 2004 ) and Triple Cross : How bin Ladens Master Spy Penetrated the CIA , the FBI and the Green Berets ( 2006 ) .
1000 Years , which ABC bought , was read by 9/11 Commission Chairman Tom Kean , who arranged for me to testify in March of 2004 .
Kean became an advisor to ABC for The Path and in early 2005 , ABCs Touchstone Television division entered into a competition with NBC to acquire the book .
The bidding war Nowrasteh begged me to let him convince  me that he would be the best interpreter of my work , which was hypercritical of the FBIs New York Office ( NYO ) and the Office of The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York ( SDNY ) , the two bin Laden offices of origin . 
At the end of January , 2005 , he met me and proffered a copy of 1000 Years , which he had dog-eared and underlined throughout .
He said that he was interested in telling all three of the untold intersecting stories from the book : the saga of how Ramzi Yousef , the original WTC bomber , had set the 9/11 plot in motion in Manila in 1994 , concocting the planes as missile scenario later executed by his uncle Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ( KSM ) ;
the story of FBI special agent Nancy Floyd whod almost stopped Yousef as he built the first WTC bomb in 1992 only to have her career tanked by superiors in the NYO ; and
the Ronnie Bucca tragedy .
An ex-Green Beret and firefighter with the FDNYs elite Rescue One , Bucca later became a fire marshal and had top secret security clearance via an Army Reserve M.P. unit where he was posted at The Defense Intelligence Analysis Center at Bolling AFB in D.C.
There , he saw the raw intelligence on how the FBI had burned Floyd and blown multiple opportunities to stop bin Ladens juggernaut on Bush 41s watch .
More important , he uncovered probative evidence of an al Qaeda mole in the FDNY in 1999 only to have the intel rejected by Det. Lou Napoli , an NYPD cop assigned to the NYOs Joint Terrorist Task Force .
It was Napoli and his hapless partner FBI Special Agent John Anticev , whom , I reported , had failed to track members of Yousefs bombing cell in the fall of 1992 after Floyd got a tip from undercover asset Emad Salem .
It was a lead that could have led straight to Yousefs Jersey City bomb factory and interdicted the plot which killer six and injured 1000 a month into Clintons presidency .
Napoli and Anticev were Salems control agents , but rarely available to debrief him , so Floyd ( working Russian counter - intelligence ) had to do all the heavy lifting .
For an overview of my findings in all three books click here .
During Cyruss pitch to me he brought up John Millers Hyperion / Disney book The Cell which covered much of the same ground .
 This guy didnt even mention Nancy Floyd ,  Nowrasteh snapped , disparaging Miller .
It was a glaring sin of omission .
Like telling the story of John Dillingers takedown without mentioning FBI agent Melvin Purvis .
The only book  ABC wants Later when NBC upped the ante in the bidding war , Cyrus sent me this e-mail bad mouthing the competition : NBC is out " mopping up " every book they can get their hands on acquiring nearly a dozen properties .
The impression I get Peter , is that your book is pretty low on the totem - pole of NBC priorities .
ABC asked last week if there are any books I 'm interested in and I told them one :  1000 Years For Revenge by Peter Lance !
That 's it .
That 's all .
The only book I 've asked them to go after .
You 're it .
On our project you 'll be working directly with me .
Period .
On their project you 'll just be another participant in the gang - bang .
- Cyrus Ultimately , I decided to sell the book to Kevin Reilly , then President of NBC , who had acquired it earlier when he was at FX .
The deal was for a $ 50,000 up front option against another $ 200,00.00 when the mini-series aired .
For the next three months I worked as a consultant to NBCs exec producer Graham Yost ( Band of Brothers ;  Speed ) .
NBC paid me $ 65,000 of the anticipated $ 250 K , but in June of 2005 , due to a ratings slump , the project was shelved .
Rewriting  History  Now , in July as the cameras began rolling on what ABC first called  the History Project ,  something told me that I should get a look at Cyruss script .
When I turned to the first page of  Night One ,  I saw that Nowrasteh had lifted much of my book , scene by scene , dialogue for dialogue .
Hed even titled the first two hours ,  The Mozart of Terror ,  the name Id coined for Yousef .
But beyond the hijacking of 1000 Years , what was most galling , was how Cyrus , hungry for some book on which to hang his story , had now embraced The Cell , the very book hed bad - mouthed to me and elevated John Miller , who was about to take a job as chief FBI flak , to a lead character .
Worse , hed taken the hapless Det. Lou Napoli  who had ignored Ronnie Buccas warnings and failed to follow the WTC bombers  and turned him into a lead member of the FBI posse out to stop bin Laden , a bullpen of real and fictional characters now led by John ONeill .
Unable to legally acquire my book , Nowrasteh had simply appropriated it and used what he wanted from it and then set up The Cell with its pro-FBI slant as the based on underlying work for his re-telling of  History . 
It was such a wholesale lift that I convinced L. Stanton Larry Stein , one of LAs top entertainment litigators , to represent me against my former network .
In October , 2005 he wrote this letter to ABC :  It is particularly insidious that in much of his script Mr. Nowrasteh mirrors Mr. Lances accurate portrayal of FBI failures  then , by utilizing the character of Mr. Miller as a narrative device , he ends up turning FBI failures into successes .
 One of the most glaring examples is a long sequence at the end of the two - hour script ( encompassing 45 of 238 scenes and 22 of 96 script pages ) in which Mr. Nowrasteh  per John Millers point of view  recounts the capture of Ramzi Yousef , the original World Trade Center bomber and architect of the 9/11 attacks on whom Mr. Lance reported uniquely in his Book .
 The incident , Mr. Lance accurately reported , was directed entirely by agents of the State Departments Diplomatic Security Services ( DSS  ) and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA  ) with minimal FBI involvement .
Yet Mr. Nowrasteh , per Mr. Miller , has John ONeill , the FBI official elevated to the role of central hero in the mini-series , directing the Yousef takedown operation  when , in fact , as Mr. Lance reported , the FBI had no up - front involvement in the apprehension of Yousef .
 The distorted pro-FBI slant in the script is particularly troubling in light of the fact that Mr. Miller recently took a job as chief spokesman for the FBI in Washington , D.C. 
It would have been bad enough if ABC had emphasized the drama and minimized the documentary  aspects of the mini , but network brass claimed that it was strictly fact - based , with " The 9/11 Commission Report " as its primary source .
In a July 2005 Variety piece announcing that Gov. Kean had been signed on as an advisor , ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson compared Path to its seminal ABC pic The Day After .
Variety quoted Path exec producer Marc Platt as promising that his miniseries will not be a Hollywood - style overdramatization of the events leading to 9/11 . 
" If you read the ( Commission ) report , sadly , it reads like fiction , " he said .
" It 's riveting and compelling just based on the facts .
One need not bring anything more to it .
The events speak for themselves . "
The settlement and the gag order Finally , after months of negotiating with ABC , Larry Stein called me in December of 2005 to say that my former network had agreed to pay a settlement of $ 250,000.00 to acquire the mini-series rights to 1000 Years For Revenge .
But the deal contained a non - disparagement  clause and gag order .
In order to keep me from telling the real truth behind their distortion of my work , ABC would hold off paying me the final $ 50 K until a month after The Path to 9/11 aired .
Though imdb.com properly credits my book as one of the three source works for the mini-series , ABCs website mentions only The Cell and Sam Katzs book Relentless Pursuit which ABC was to forced to buy after I informed Katz that Cyrus had lifted  Relentless  for his coverage of the Yousef arrest .
Until now Ive been silent about all of this , but given Nowrastehs allegations , its time the full truth came out .
For me the conflict with ABC was never solely about the theft of a book .
It was a matter of principle .
It represented the utter distortion of an investigative reporters work by a networks entertainment division .
In 1000 Years , I was equally critical of the FBIs failures across three administrations , yet Nowrasteh chose to put virtually all of the blood on Bill Clintons hands .
In his fifth script draft , just days before production began , he utilized every possible opportunity to slam Clinton , National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and Secretary of State Madeline Albright , but in the last two hours , on the day of 9/11 , he left George W. Bush virtually unscathed .
The script never even included the deer in the headlights  performance by Dubya , the Commander in Chief who stayed in a Florida schoolroom for almost 10 minutes after hed been told by his Chief of Staff that  America is under attack . 
The missing war games and the F - 16s Cyrus dramatized multiple scenes with Lt. Col Dawn Deskins , the mission crew chief at NEADS -- The Northeast Air Defense Sector of NORAD -- who was monitoring the hijackings of AA and UA flights that fateful morning .
But he never mentioned the fact that at least three war games were in progress and that Deskins became confused .
Though he referenced  F - 15 Eagles  which streak across the sky to establish a combat air patrol of Manhattan ,  Cyrus failed to underscore the significance of the two fighters being scrambled out of Otis Air National Guard ( ANG ) base on Cape Cod , 188 miles from Ground Zero ; arriving too late to interdict UA # 175 which had hit the South Tower .
By the time hed written the script , Nowrasteh had read my second 9/11 book Cover Up and he knew  per a Dec. 5 , 2003 Bergent Record story quoting his advisor Gov. Tom Kean - that there were two F - 16s from an identical ANG base in Atlantic City which could have reached Manhattan in under eight minutes that day .
But they were never scrambled by NEADS or NORAD ; a glaring omission left out of Keans 9/11 Commission Report that any desk assistant for ABC News could have uncovered with a simple search on Google .
Predictably , the script ended with actual video of Bush addressing a joint session of Congress of Sept. 20th 2001 :  I will not forget this wound to our country and those who inflicted it .
I will not yield ; I will not rest ; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people .
Per Cyruss stage direction :  As CONGRESS stands ; applauds  he FADES TO BLACK .
Asking ABC to set the record straight
Five years after the greatest mass murder in US history , the network that I served proudly as a correspondent used my investigative work to whitewash the true story and spun it in a way that favored the current administration .
As part of my settlement , I demanded a meeting with ABCs mini-series vice president Quinn Taylor .
He agreed to see me in his office in Burbank on the Disney lot in late February of 2006 , six months before  The Path aired .
I warned him that ABC might look foolish using my book which was highly critical of the Bureau and then fronting the docu- drama with John Miller , the FBI s chief PR man .
I urged Taylor to fix the wholesale distortions in Nowrastehs script and warned that history would judge the network harshly  given its celebrated news division -- if it put out what amounted to a valentine to the very Bureau that blew multiple chances to prevent the attacks .
Taylor smiled and assured me that we had lawyers in my office each night before we shot to insure that this script was factually bulletproof .
Ive been over every line of dialogue and stage direction with a fine tooth comb . 
I suspect now , in the cold light of day  that ABC has come to its senses .
Surely someone in the news division , which boasts savvy correspondents like Brian Ross , has filtered word of the scripts factual holes up to the Disney brass .
If the Path to 9/11 was released on DVD in the form that it was telecast , the Clintons wouldnt be the only losers .
ABCs well - earned reputation for news excellence could be irreparably harmed as well .
After all , the average viewer doesnt easily separate fact from fiction when the ABC logo appears on the lower third of the screen .
On the sixth anniversary of 9/11 , its time for ABC to own up to the great disservice it did to this country in rewriting history  for its project .
And Cyrus Nowrasteh , ought to come clean about how he turned ABCs most important mini-series since The Day After , into a work worthy of Leni Riefenstahl .
Former FEMA director Brown among critics of California wildfire response RAW STORY

This A 52 - page GAO report , released on June 1 , 2007 , warned of the Bush Administration 's inability to effectively handle a disaster like the wildfires currently blazing in southern California , given how substantially increased funding for the United States Forest Service , and the Department of the Interior , was being allocated .
President Bush , presiding over FEMA during the much criticized handling of Hurricane Katrina 's aftermath in 2005 , promises those affected by the fires that " they can rest assured that the federal government will do everything we can to help put out these fires , " in addition to approving reconstruction grants for uninsured residents and business owners .
" I want the people in Southern California to know , " says Bush to reporters , " that Americans all across this land care deeply about them . "
" If you do n't have goals and strategies for carrying them out , you 're in a reactive mode rather than a proactive mode , " says the GAO 's Robin Nazarro , lead author of the report , to the Huffington Post .
" They say they are using 5 to 10 year averages , but each year the fires gets worse , so they 're always underestimating what they need . "
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino says , in response to questioning on Bush 's post - Katrina disaster response etiquette : " We have learned those lessons and those lessons are being applied . "
Former FEMA director Michael D. Brown , however , laments the fact that National Guardsmen that could currently be assisting with the efforts in California have instead been occupied in Iraq .
Said Brown in a telephone interview with WJLA - TV ,  The White House needs to recognize that we are overstretched and that there is a problem . 
Continues Brown :  They need to increase the size of the regular Army and stop relying so much on the National Guard . 
" The fact is that there are plenty of people on the ground , " rebuts current FEMA director R. David Paulison to CNN .
The Orange County Register indicted the federal government , while lauding Governor Schwarzenegger 's efforts to the contrary , on limits put on the use of DC - 10 planes used to drop fire retardant on affected areas , citing " bureaucratic overkill . "
" If we had more air resources , " says Orange County fire chief Chip Prather to the Los Angeles Times , " we would have been able to control this fire . "

So we know you stumbled upon this supposed technology .
How long did it take you guys to realize what you thought was going on here ?
It took us an awful long time to be honest , because the first thing when you get an anomalous reading on a system in a lab , the first thing that you do is obviously question your test equipment .
We obviously went out and we looked out and looked at the way we are testing it and systems we were using to make analysis and so on .
And after a fairly extended period of testing in different ways -- I should make the point that when we discovered this we were n't generating , the systems did n't run away with themselves .
What we noticed was at certain speeds the speed range for magnetic systems that we were getting substantially different energy results -- which is unexpected .
So we spent a good six months ourselves just looking at the systems and not full - time six months .
We would n't jump on it and say , you know , this is the solution to the world 's energy crisis .
We did it in a fairly calm , rational manner and over a course of the six months we began to realize that hey this , these readings are not due to some measurement anomaly and that these readings are real .
There are these energy anomalies at certain speed ranges with certain magnetic configurations and that 's pretty much how we managed to convince ourselves that it was worth pursuing .
You just mentioned , to quote , that this is the solution to the world 's energy crisis .
Do you think that is actually the case ?
Do you think that this will end the world 's energy crisis ?
I do n't ... I mean ...
My own background just to explain to you is providing technology into the UK Royal and gas industries .
So I know the energy industry pretty well .
I do n't think there is a single solution to the energy crisis .
I think that certain energy demands have certain needs .
We have no doubts that what we have can play a very significant role .
However , there is one thing sitting in Dublin here with a claim on a technology that nobody believes .
Making that a commercial reality is a long and difficult road .
So we are not naive enough to say that we will have a massive impact in the short frame of time , but we can see that it 's possible and that 's what we 're dedicated to .
It 's interesting that you mention that it's a technology that no one believes and I 've seen some of the videos where I think it was you or one of your colleagues refers to the technology as being " absolutely impossible . "
That would be me .
[ laughs ]
Why do you think that this is so difficult to pitch to people ?
From the simple point , we 're all believers up to the notch of pretty well qualified engineers .
You know , we have very classical university training and we 've worked months of our lives in a classical engineering and technology environment .
And so , the only way I can describe how I would feel about this technology is that if I 'd be looking at this technology from the outside I 'd be going , " Hocum !
This is complete and utter rubbish !
This is the most incontrovertible law of physics and if this was untrue then the universe would n't work . "
So I understand the skepticism , I would be very much and like everybody else .
I 've seen these kind of claims come and go over the years .
So I understand it and an awful lot of what we 're about is to try and at least erode people 's disbelief .
Because we can't make this a viable commercial technology without obviously people accepting that it 's real .
Right , and in the US the USPTO , our patent office , actually requires people to send in physical working samples of supposed perpetual motion machines because they have historically received so many claims for patents to this system .
[ laughs ]
We work with a pretty large U.S. patent firm .
We took the decision that because of the company , we have so many battles to fight , and the last thing we wanted to do was to fight a battle with a patent office .
So from the patent perspective we do n't make claims that would violate classic Newtonian dynamics .
However we have constructed a portfolio of patents that do protect us .
So we 're making claims that protect the technology ...
So we 're not concerned about our patent position or having to fight because even that statement about the patent office is not necessarily true according true according to our patent agents .
But again , we have n't felt the necessity to make claims in our patents of you know overunity or anything that could be deemed scientifically controversial .
That does n't mean that we do n't believe in the claim , it simply means that we can protect the technology without having to go through that step .
How many people do you have working on this Orbo technology right now ?
Head - count in the company is 21 full time staff and we would have anywhere between probably 5 and 15 people working on the contract at any one time and they would be in partner organizations or direct contracts to the company .
It 's very substantial for a very little company 's operations .
You guys are operating strictly on VC right now ?
Or what are your other means of income ?
Since we went public last August we stopped all works with the forensic and expert witnessing simply because we would not be credible , we'd be too easily -- we 're presenting obviously to the prosecution .
It would be too easy to be discredited with a claim like this publicly in the eyes of the court .
So it 's currently no revenues at all and we will attempt to make no revenues until the technology is validated .
How are you paying your employees for the time being ?
Is this from cash reserves ?
We 're operating via private investment , which we took through this all last year .
So that 's the company , let 's talk a little bit more about the technology that you guys have supposedly developed here .
Laws of thermodynamics basically state that you can't achieve 100 % efficiency in any apparatus and that there are always transfers of heat and energy in any system .
But obviously you guys are claiming 100 % + efficiency .
Do you have a statistic or number of what you estimate the energy efficiency level of your machine is ?
Is it 110 % or 150 % ?
It varies from configuration to configuration .
I think the largest efficiency that we would have physically measured would be about 485 % .
These numbers can be misleading .
For example we might be getting 485 % per joule , which means were getting 4.85 J out , but there could be a configuration that 's could be delivering 130 % efficiency yet delivering 10 joules .
So , the technology itself is pretty well researched in terms of punch line efficiency it 's 485 % , but that would n't be the optimum output of the system .
Obviously we 're more focused on direct power output of a device than the punchline numbers .
485 to 1 is 4.85 , but we could easily say , 10 to 12 joules off of a system is going to have a lower punch line efficiency .
And power output is obviously the key factor , energy output is obviously the key factor .
So you guys have been trying to bring the scientific community into the fold .
Obviously kicked off by the full page ad in The Economist and there 's the open invitation ...
[ laughs ]
It was a brave decision .
Well , it definitively opened you guys to a lot of criticism .
My publication is definitely not excepted from that .
I think it 's one of those claims to where you 're just going to have to put up with the lumps .
We knew it .
Again , the only way I can describe this is that we did n't set out to do this .
We stumbled upon it .
I would n't believe a word of it if I was n't working here and so in deciding the best route for the company was to go and do this , what they call a slap in the face of science .
We had no illusions at all of how it looked or how it would be conceived , what we would be called and so on .
But at the end of the day we have to face that , but it 's a relatively easy thing to face when you know what you have is real because , you realize there is an end to it and we can get on with the business of business .
I think part of the reason why people did n't and do n't take it seriously is partly because there is no [ credible ] university affiliated with the research .
The fact that you guys were not out to actually invent this new science and that there was no big name physicist behind it at the time is , I think , what is most damaging to your credibility .
To be fair , I do n't think of there 's an awful lot of what we could have done with respect to credibility .
But the other thing to recognize in terms of the August thing [ running the ad in The Economist ] is that we achieved our objective , and our objective was to get qualified scientists engaged .
As much as we get an awful lot of criticism , and obviously the event the last couple of weeks have n't helped , the bottom line for us is that process has started and that process will end with very qualified people doing the analysis .
So were quite happy to sit here -- happy is the wrong word -- but we 're quite willing to sit here and take the smirks or the laughs or the cries of fraud and so on because August was a big victory for us because our biggest concern in doing all of this , is , well , what if no scientist responds ?
That would have been a disaster for us .
The fact that we got ridiculed , that was going to happen anyway .
Since this open invitation to invite scientists to review the technology under their own means and their own circumstances , that they see fit --
We 're obviously covering all of their direct costs and paying them a nominal fee to do it .
But they 're deciding the details of the process .
It is and will be seen to be at the end of it , a fair process .
We 're not paying them massive consulting fees , which is one of the concerns that we had .
We tried to structure it in such a way that when the results arrive , and obviously we are very confident in what the results are going to be , that people could look at the process and say , it was a fair process .
Although we 're obviously keeping it pretty non-disclosed , but in the end of it when these guys report , people will be able to see how much they were paid , the level of testing , and where they 've gone through .
And so they can see that the report , whatever it says , was fair .
I understand that some 5,000 scientists applied to be a part of this .
No , we had 5,000 total applicants .
It was an online thing .
So when you rule out the Bart Simpsons who had applied we had 1,000 qualified people , of which about 500 who would be qualified scientists , and 500 qualified engineers .
And so how many people have actually accepted this challenge and are currently working on this ?
We 've signed contracts with 22 of them .
There is a copy of the contract on the website , and 22 of them are involved in an analysis of the technology .
Do you know when they are expecting to publish their results ?
Because I know that was one of the requirements as well , that they publish once they 've made their conclusions about it .
The straight answer to it is no .
We 're not in control of the process .
All we can do is facilitate it .
So , while I think a lot of people will say , well this should easy , it actually is n't a simple process and also it's not a simple process on the technical level .
There are a lot of energies that need to be looked at .
It 's also such a big claim that these guys need to be 100 % sure about what they do , whether they prove us right or wrong .
It 's a thorough of process , it 's a slow process , and we have n't set a time limit on it , and neither do we know how long it 's going to take .
So , I 'd like to talk about the demo .
I would n't .
[ laughs ]
Yeah .
Well you knew this was coming .
[ laughs ]
[ laughs ] .
I 've done nothing but talk about it , but go on ...
I 'd like to know why you think it failed -- and not the reasons that you 've already given .
We 've definitively heard that it was ball bearings , or it was mechanical failure , it was the heat from the lights .
We heard all that .
We know .
I want to know why you think it failed , in the sense that why did the other two backups that you guys brought not work ?
Or why were you not able to relocate the demo to another location that did n't have these issues ?
Or why was it not thoroughly tested enough , and so on ...
I 'm not going to tell you anything that if you have read some of this stuff that you have n't heard .
The simple fact of the matter , just to state , is that this is not production technology and so you know anybody who works in the prototype world will understand that there are always issues .
But with respects to what happened , we brought three systems to us from Dublin , three component systems , we do n't move them in their operational way , we stripped them down .
They are very , very simple and there is not huge configuration to them , but they are very sensitive configurations because there are lots of magnetic loads and so on .
We got one of the systems working on the Tuesday night which was the Tuesday before we were going live on Wednesday evening .
We started to install that in the demo case and began to notice problems .
It was n't working .
That being the prime problem .
We then took the classic engineering process of stripping it down and testing , testing , testing , and what we found was that in that prototype was that the bearings , while not visibly damaged but the friction had more than quadrupled in them , which would have been a killer in a this type of system that we were planning to show .
And under pressure we just kept plugging in all the spare bearings we had .
Now , these are not standard bearings you might buy from your local hardware store .
These are very , very low friction bearings used in the watch industry .
Our analysis of what happened is that the heat allowed play in the system that damaged the bearings to the point where the extra friction in the bearings did n't allow the technology to happen .
Whether people believe that or do n't believe it , there is n't a lot that I can say other then that 's what happened .
As this is supposedly scientific phenomena that -- by your terms -- redefines the laws of physics , should n't this be demonstrable consistently ?
Of the machines that you brought , which by all appearances looked like a very simple closed system , why did only one machine work ?
First of all , we only planned to get one machine working just in the time frame .
The spare bearings that we had we took from the other systems , so at the end of the day we ended up on Thursday morning with six bearings of which we had damaged five for whatever reason .
We were pretty sure we know the reasons whether people believe them or not .
I then had to make the decision to defer because the reason that actually happened has nothing to do with the bearings , the reason it happened was just the ridiculous time frame that we were doing it in .
So we will be doing a demo , again .
Obviously people will believe it when they see it and I can understand the skepticism about that .
It is a deferral , our guys are currently in the process of rebuilding some more robust systems and changing some parts to prevent the engineering thing from happening again and we 'll be back out in the near future with it .
So do you have a time - frame that you 're looking at for the next demo ?
What we 've decided to do this time , is rather then beating ourselves with a stick , we 're going to get it running in a location and then we are going to announce that people can watch it online .
So we are actually physically getting it operating , it will be the same .
The principle behind London , which was clearly a failed demo , was that it was n't for for a sequence of webcams to people to watch , but it was equally physical , so that people could go there .
We put in some PCs so they could chat about it and so on .
So the principle will be identical , that it 's both a physical location where people can go view it .
Obviously not everybody can do that , so people can watch it online and chat directly with people there and discuss theories of where batteries might be hidden and so and so on .
It 's a deferral , we have decided that we will only announce it when it 's actually live and in place this time which is a mistake that we made last time .
We should have done that but did n't .
I think another thing that might have raised some eyebrows about the London demo was that it was taking place in an art gallery of sorts .
And , again , as I mentioned earlier , this kind of level of scientific community credibility that I think maybe some people had expected this demo to show up in the university setting with a far more controlled environment then what you would think of as your normal London art gallery .
I mean the thing about Kinetica is that it's a kinetic gallery .
So that the stuff they do is kinetic art , and obviously our technology is kinetic in nature .
The other thing about it is that is very open plan .
It 's glass on three sides , the demo case was suspended five feet in the ceiling , and we had invited some skeptics to come along and test it because if you 've seen the device there is virtually nowhere to hide a battery , and there are obviously ways to transmit energy , but they are relatively easy to resolve .
So the intention was to be open , and that intention will remain .
The other thing that people need to understand is , to be honest , if it had gone as planned I would be expecting to have the conversation with you now and you going , " How did you trick us ?
How did you hide the batteries ? "
So , no demo is ever going to be deemed as conclusive proof of this kind of requirement and neither should it be because it does n't answer all the questions .
But for us it 's only a process of erosion where we 're saying , look we will demonstrate the technology .
Obviously we did n't last time , but we will be doing it .
We do n't expect that to be a slam dunk for anybody .
We do expect it to at least erode some people 's views of why we 're doing this , and how we could n't possibly have what we claim to have .
But at the end of the day , our general analysis was that at the heart of the Steorn general watching community , the people who think that we 're a fraud would use it as a definitive proof we 're a fraud , and the people who believed us would use it as definite proof that they believed us .
The audience was intended to be wider then that .
But there is no demo that is going ( and neither is it designed by us ) to be perceived as conclusive evidence .
Conclusive evidence is the views of the scientific community and that 's an issue that 's in hand with us and that 's ongoing .
You mentioned inviting skeptics to come to the demo and I 've actually read one of the reports of one of the skeptics that you invited , someone who identifies himself as Doctor Mike .
Doctor Mike , yes .
His quote about the technology was : " My conclusion ... "
I believe that it was all spinning my head .
[ laughs ]
Right ... what he said was that , " My conclusion after going through all this is that Steorn is neither hoax nor scam .
It is delusion .
The reason it seems surreal is because it is surreal -- we are the real part of someone else 's imagination . "
How can I criticize .
We invited the guy to come from Canada to see something .
He did n't see it .
It 's his opinion .
He has no other basis , he has nothing else to work on , other than sitting and having a chat with us .
I can't possibly criticize , Doctor Mike for what he said .
It 's exactly what I would have said , I probably would have been harsher if I had been in his shoes .
I do n't necessarily want to talk specifically about Doctor Mike , but I feel that is probably what a lot of people feel at this point .
You 've been very open about your process , which is more than what you can say about a lot of snake oil salesmen who might try to peddle a perpetual motion machine .
But at the same time that I think that a lot of people just seem to think that what it really comes down to is that you guys have convinced yourselves that these are true phenomena , and that you actually believe it , whereas it 's not necessarily the case .
Again , obviously if I 'm delusional , whatever answer I give is going to be based on my own delusions .
The only thing that I can say -- I can say a couple of things about it .
First thing is that the answer that anybody looking at us and wants to know will ultimately be delivered contractually .
It 's going to happen whenever it happens from a bunch of scientists .
So unless they 're delusional as well , if they agree with us then we deal with that at the time .
If you stand back from the failed demo and say ok , I do n't think anybody should believe this -- I would n't believe this in the circumstances , demo or no demo -- there is a process that 's in place that 's a real process where real scientists are going to draw a conclusion and that conclusion will be made public .
The other side of it which I think is why people have taken the delusional route is because an awful lot of people had expected us to rig the demo .
They expected us to have a hidden battery or whatever it is .
If we were in that business , believe me , there would have been a spinning wheel .
But we 're just not in that business , the business of scamming people or rigging demos .
It failed , it 's prototype technology .
Huge disappointment to us .
We 'll redo it .
But the answers to the question -- the demo does n't answer the question , it provides some thoughts from supporting evidence when it happens .
But the answer to the question will be done by professionals and then were either be found to be delusional or not .
So what happens --
I mean , I was expecting a lot more criticism [ from everyone ] to be honest .
So what happens if you can't prove this supposed technology ?
If you can't figure out a way to convince people .
But we have .
We have .
There are lots of tactical things that we 'll be doing , such as demos -- and obviously we 'll have to respond to the failure of that demo and probably do more than we 've intended to .
We 're a small company and maybe we 're slightly overstretched in doing it , but we have to do it .
But the jury process is happening , they will have to report -- they will either have to say yay or nay .
Ok , so you can say how long will it take ?
I do n't know .
But the point of the matter is that there will be an end to the process and an answer will be provided .
Now that answer , if it's what we think it will be , will obviously raise more criticism and so and so on .
But we 've got lots of other things that we are doing to address that .
There is going to be no defining moment in my opinion where people go , " It 's true ! "
Even if these 22 scientists -- who are really top scientists -- turn around and say , " By Jove they 've done it ! " .
We as a company will still have to drive that message home in other ways .
The purpose of the London demo -- which has clearly backfired on us -- was part of that process .
We 're going to have to do more things like that in a more creative way and a more convincing way .
But none of these things and themselves are going to convince anybody .
People are still going to think we 're delusional or scam artists , or whatever the latest theory on it is .
But , again , the answers will come .
I know an awful lot of people have said to us , that 's an excuse to raise more money and drag this out .
We have n't raised a dime since last August and we 've said quite simply we will commercialize this is no way , we are not going to sell film rights or book rights whatever the latest scam theory on it is .
We 're sitting here like everybody else waiting for the results of the jury and we will do other things to try and support the premise that we 've made -- understanding completely how ridiculous it sounds .
So then assuming that your technology does then proves itself to be true .
What happens then ?
What happens then is that 's in many ways is the smallest hurdle for us because obviously we believe it 's true -- whether we are delusional or not will be found out ultimately .
What we have to do then is actually make money from it and get it into the market .
We 've chosen a kind of open - source model .
We do have a developer forum for people , were putting in learning modules about how you go about doing this .
The concept is very simple , but once it 's validated this released in an open - source way with a very comprehensive database of e-learning , designs and so on .
So people can go off and do this for themselves from a hobbyist level through to a commercial entity level .
And the purpose of that is just to understand is to ensure widespread adoption .
Typically if you believe this kind of stuff is possible you expect people to run off to the biggest company in the world and to do big fat licensing deal and retire off to the Maldives .
We believe that there is a far more effective way to get it into market which is to release it to everybody in exactly the same way .
Whether you are the biggest or the smallest company in the world you get access to it , and if you can go off and you can develop products to market fast , then you 'll win , we 'll win .
So then I guess the only other thing I 'd like to know is what you have to say to everyone in the technology community who feels as if they have been toyed with or led astray .
I do n't think that anybody in the technology community ever believed it .
So I do n't think we 've been toying with them .
I think it would be an unfair assessment , I think people in the technology community would probably scoff at how naive we were trying to do the demo in such a short time frame and we failed the thing .
But we have n't toyed with anybody .
If we were toying with people we would have rigged the demo and we were never going to do that .
We 're genuine about this .
We fundamentally believed in what we have and we fundamentally believe in it 's impact and what it can do .
We just move on , it 's as simple as that .
I do n't think that anybody in the technology community will believe this until it is validated and until they can build one themselves or buy one in stores .
Well whether or not they believe it -- and I do agree that almost everyone does not believe it and that everyone has been extremely skeptical about it .
But the fact between the ad , the demo , and the PR campaign that has gone on inbetween those two bookends , Steorn has raised a lot of awareness and attention --
I do n't think we have done any PR in between .
To be fair , I have no problem marketing what we believe in .
I 'm not going to be apologetic for August because it was hugely successful for us .
We went out to attract the attention of a critical world of science -- a rightly critical world -- we got it and now they are off doing their job and they 'll deliver an answer .
With respect to the demo , yeah we can't complain .
When you shoot yourself in the foot , you do n't ask yourself was the gun loaded , you just ask what were you aiming at .
We can have no complaints .
But I do n't accept that we were toying with people .
We have a technology , we 're putting more than our money behind this .
We 're putting everything behind this , our reputation and everything behind it , because we believe .
That does n't mean that other people believe , but we do believe , and we do believe in the medium term that this technology will make it to market and that is what we are interested in .
The rest is noise .
So what are you guys planning to do going forward that will improve this process for the general public who is paying close attention to what you 're up to ?
Obviously we are going to have to redo the demo .
There is no question that we are not going to do the demo .
We will , as I said before , not pre-announce it this time .
We will get it set up properly , but the ground rules will be identical .
The ground rules will be physical public access to the device , online webcams so it will be as open as possible .
If anybody has seen the intended device and then realizes that it's , well , not impossible obviously to hide a certain energy source , it becomes quite a convoluted process .
So we are going to try and demonstrate the technology in it 's simplest , simplest format in a place with public access where people can watch online and talk to people there .
That will be one thing we have -- and to invite skeptics along .
We have to do that .
We have to embrace the skepticism .
But equally to understand , these are not intended to be slam dunk results , because they wo n't be .
There will always be issues and rightfully so a simple demo , no matter how long it lasts , is n't proof of the claim .
Proof of the claim is scientific analysis .
But we are going to have to do other things as well .
I wo n't go into details , but the biggest mistake that we 've made and obviously we have to learn from our mistakes was to pre-announce the London demo .
We 've paid the price for that , we wo n't do it again .
But we will be doing probably an awful lot more than we had intended .
Basically when it happens we 'll be letting people know .
It will not be that far away .
Sean , I really appreciate taking some time to talk to us .
And I appreciate you being very candid in speaking about this stuff .
No problem Ryan , I know how crazy all this stuff sounds .
[ laughs ]
I do n't know what to say to people other than ...
I guess all that I can really say is that at the end of the day the key issue outside the demo and marketing and all that stuff , the answer is coming and we 'll know .
And it is never our intention to toy with people , and that 's the first time I 've heard that said .
It just does n't make an awful lot of sense .
I do n't want to accuse you of toying with people .
But I think that people feel as though they have been toyed with , and I 'm asking on account of that .
Which is a fair point , I guess .
I 've met an awful lot of disappointed people .
People who came , who believed , who wanted to see history made .
Disappointed skeptics , people like Doctor Mike who we dragged half way around the world -- and all I can do is apologize to them and say look it did n't work , but we are going to do it again .
It 's not the end of the Steorn story .
Unfortunately , I 'm sure that many people wish they 've never heard of us again but we 'll be back and we 'll be back in the not to distant future .
Well , we 'll be waiting .
Alright .
Cheers Ryan .
Thanks .

Lead Found In Lipstick Posted by Pile ( 8766 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Toys made in China are n’t the only products laced with dangerous heavy metals : lipstick manufactured in the United States and used daily by millions of American women also contains surprisingly high levels of lead , according to new product tests released today by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics .
The lead tests were conducted by an independent laboratory over the month of September on red lipsticks bought in Boston , Hartford , Conn. , San Francisco and Minneapolis .
Top findings include :
More than half of 33 brand - name lipsticks tested ( 61 percent ) contained detectable levels of lead , with levels ranging from 0.03 to 0.65 parts per million ( ppm ) .
None of these lipsticks listed lead as an ingredient .
One - third of the tested lipsticks exceeded the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ’s 0.1 ppm limit for lead in candy – a standard established to protect children from directly ingesting lead .
Lipstick products , like candy , are directly ingested into the body .
Nevertheless , the FDA has not set a limit for lead in lipstick , which fits with the disturbing absence of FDA regulatory oversight and enforcement capacity for the $ 50 billion personal care products industry .
The good news is that the tests show it is possible to make lipstick without lead : 39 percent of lipsticks tested had no detectable levels of lead , and cost does n’t seem to be a factor .
Some less expensive brands such as Revlon ( $ 7.49 ) had no detectable levels of lead , while the more expensive Dior Addict brand ( $ 24.50 ) had higher levels than some other brands .
Among the top brands testing positive for lead were :
- L’Oreal Colour Riche “ True Red ” – 0.65 ppm
- L’Oreal Colour Riche “ Classic Wine ” – 0.58 ppm
- Cover Girl Incredifull Lipcolor “ Maximum Red ” – 0.56 ppm
- Dior Addict “ Positive Red ” – 0.21 ppm
Lead is a proven neurotoxin that can cause learning , language and behavioral problems such as lowered IQ , reduced school performance and increased aggression .
Pregnant women and young children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure .
Lead easily crosses the placenta and enters the fetal brain where it can interfere with normal development .
Lead has also been linked to infertility and miscarriage .
“ Lead builds up in the body over time and lead - containing lipstick applied several times a day , every day , can add up to significant exposure levels .
The latest studies show there is no safe level of lead exposure , ” said Mark Mitchell , M.D. , MPH , president , Connecticut Coalition for Environmental Justice .
“ The cosmetics industry needs to clean up its act and remove lead and other toxic ingredients from their products , ” said Stacy Malkan , author of the just - released book , “ Not Just a Pretty Face : The Ugly Side of the Beauty Industry . ”
“ Repeated , daily exposures to low levels of lead add up – and they add up on top of lead from paint and drinking water , which is especially a problem in low income communities .
There ’s no excuse for lead in lipstick or toys .
Companies should act immediately to reformulate lead - containing products , ” Malkan said .
The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics is calling on the industry to reformulate products to remove lead , to require suppliers to guarantee that raw materials are free of lead and other contaminants , and to join the campaign in demanding that the FDA more strictly regulate personal care products .
The full report , “ A Poison Kiss : The Problem of Lead in Lipstick , ” including complete test results , is posted at www.SafeCosmetics.org.

The number of American children and adolescents treated for bipolar disorder increased 40 - fold from 1994 to 2003 , researchers report today in the most comprehensive study of the controversial diagnosis .
Experts say the number has almost certainly risen further since 2003 .
Many experts theorize that the jump reflects that doctors are more aggressively applying the diagnosis to children , and not that the incidence of the disorder has increased .
But the magnitude of the increase surprises many psychiatrists .
They say it is likely to intensify the debate over the validity of the diagnosis , which has shaken child psychiatry .
Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme mood swings .
Until relatively recently , it was thought to emerge almost exclusively in adulthood .
But in the 1990s , psychiatrists began looking more closely for symptoms in younger patients .
Tornado and Rainbow Over Kansas

Explanation :
The scene might have been considered serene if it were n't for the tornado .
Last June in Kansas , storm chaser Eric Nguyen photographed this budding twister in a different light -- the light of a rainbow .
Pictured above , a white tornado cloud descends from a dark storm cloud .
The Sun , peeking through a clear patch of sky to the left , illuminates some buildings in the foreground .
Sunlight reflects off raindrops to form a rainbow .
By coincidence , the tornado appears to end right over the rainbow .
Streaks in the image are hail being swept about by the high swirling winds .
Over 1,000 tornadoes , the most violent type of storm known , occur on Earth every year , many in tornado alley .
If you see a tornado while driving , do not try to outrun it -- park your car safely , go to a storm cellar , or crouch under steps in a basement .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia may deploy its newest Iskander tactical missiles in neighboring Belarus in response to U.S. plans for a missile shield in eastern Europe , Russian media quoted a senior general as saying on Wednesday .
Asked if the missiles could be deployed in response to the U.S. shield , Major - General Vladimir Zaritsky , head of Russia ’s artillery and missile forces , was quoted as saying by Itar - Tass news agency : “ Why not ?
Under the right conditions and with the corresponding agreement of Belarus , it is possible . ”
“ Any action inevitably causes a reaction , ” Zaritsky said .
“ And this is just the case with the elements of U.S. air defense in the Czech Republic and Poland . ”
A Belarussian defense ministry spokesman said there had been no discussion of any such deployment in the ex-Soviet state wedged between Russia and three European Union states .
But spokesman Vyacheslav Remenchik said in Minsk that Belarus planned to purchase and incorporate the Iskander in one of its missile brigades by 2020 under its military program .
Washington plans to place 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic as part of a shield it says is designed to protect Europe from missile attacks by “ rogue states ” such as Iran and North Korea .
Russia has said this would upset the strategic balance and pose a threat to its security .
In July , Moscow proposed the two countries use the Russian - operated early warning Qabala radar in Azerbaijan as an alternative to the U.S. missile shield .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said during a visit to Moscow last month the Qabala radar could not replace the U.S. missile shield .
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko , accused in the West of crushing fundamental rights , has repeatedly denounced the proposed U.S. shield .
Though he has fallen out with Moscow over increased energy prices , he has offered to work together with the Kremlin to act together to oppose the proposal .
The Iskander missile is able to deliver a 480 kg ( 1,058 lb ) conventional payload within a range of up to 400 km ( 250 miles ) .
Zaritsky said Iskander missiles were now fully in line with the Intermediate - range Nuclear Forces Treaty ( INF ) .
But he said : “ Should Russia take a political decision to quit the INF treaty , we will boost the military capabilities of these missiles , including their range . ”
Asked if Russia could eventually raise Iskander ’s range to over 500 km , which is banned by the INF treaty , Zaritsky said : “ Who knows what the motherland may order ? ”

How did a simple street artist go from painting grains of rice to directing a movie with two Oscar Winning Legends ?
The answer to this question can be summarized in one word - chutzpah ( and barrel loads of it at that ! )
I ’m guessing a few of you do n’t know this term - it means audacity or nerve .
The classic definition is that given by Leo Rosten :
“ that quality enshrined in a man who , having killed his mother and father , throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan . ”
I ’m not saying for a second that this is what Bret Carr would do but he certainly possesses the same qualities .
I spoke to Bret on the phone last week and am finding it impossible to keep his incredible story to myself .
Many people in the same position would have been overpowered with the feelings of despair but Bret had other ideas - to manifest his dreams .
Here ’s his story - be prepared to be literally stunned at the lengths one man will go to for the success of his vision .
Bret Carr moved to Los Angeles and began work as a street artist painting pictures on rice grains for tourists .
But his real ambition was to make movies that change people ’s lives .
Bret incredibly managed to get two Oscar winners to give him their time and energy for free and created the movie RevoLOUtion which he starred and directed in .
It was released to the general public in April 2006 .
This is amazing in itself but you ’ll have to believe me when I say it ’s only the beginning of the feats that Bret pulled off .
Bret endured more difficulties then you could ever imagine along the way and the making of RevoLOUtion was a complete rollercoaster ride .
All of these feats I ’ll give to you in kind of a ‘ chutzpah list ’ called “ The Rise of RevoLOUtion ” .
Prepare to be shocked .
First things first here ’s the lowdown on what RevoLOUtion is about :
The Odd Plot – A Boxer that Stutters
RevoLOUtion is the fictional story of Lou , a stuttering ex-boxer who can only speak normally when starting trouble protecting the Brooklyn neighborhood in which he lives .
Lou transforms from violent , extreme stutterer into a great , powerful communicator .
Awareness magazine note :
“ The viewer so identifies with Carr ’s Oscar Caliber performance , that they are taken on a near death psychological journey with “ Lou ” , and come out having had their own awakening . ”
The Rise of RevoLOUtion
I ’m going to share with you 8 phenomenal stories that many would consider seemingly impossible that perfectly demonstrate the sheer audacity and nerve that Bret possesses .
1. Giving up a $ 250 million Inheritance
The Chutzpah of Carr was evident from a very early age - at 18 he left his family where he was vice president of a billion dollar holding company ran by his grandfather , Victor Posner .
He gave up a 250 million dollar inheritance , and then exposed him on front page of Wall Street Journal as a child molester to protect his sister .
He could n’t get her away from him , because Posner had 4 gun toting bodyguards that would chase her down and take her car back every time Carr got her out .
Both Carr and his sister had no money so Carr had the audacity to take the initiative .
This story goes a long way in explaining why Carr is so passionate about getting this film out .
Carr grew up in a relatively dysfunctional household and found a way out of reliving that drama - RevoLOUtion .
A tough decision to make … not for Carr !
2. Enlisting the help of Oscar Winner Redeker and Funding RevoLOUtion
Pic Left : The Deer Hunter , 5 times Oscar Winner written by Quinn Redeker , writer of RevoLOUtion
Bret Carr got in touch with Quinn Redeker , the writer of the five time Oscar Winner The Deer Hunter starring Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken , to help him realize his dreams .
Redeker laughed off any suggestion of help , that was until Bret shared his amazing techniques that would be embedded in the film .
Truly inspired by Carr ’s vision Redeker waived his usual 6 figure fee ; so Carr set about his task armed with only passion and a small organized crew of technicians getting them to work for free .
( You might be rightly getting the impression now that Bret can be very persuasive )
The out of pocket expenses were funded in a rather bizarre fashion - Carr is a talented street artist who can capture dreams on single grains of rice , which he would then sell to tourists .
The 300,000 dollar production was also very hard to obtain - Bret had to explain to Kodak that he was making the first film in 3 decades from the guy who liberated a generation of Vietnam Veterans with The DEER HUNTER , and how dare anyone want to charge him for the production .
Let ’s be honest , he ’s got a point , The Deer Hunter is a masterpiece with an immense cult following .
Kodak caved in and Bret got the $ 300,000 funding .
Bret has shown one way of producing a film with no money whatsoever and how to attract Oscar Winners - Could you have done the same ?
3. Getting Bill Conti , the composer of the Rocky Soundtrack for free
Carr was struggling to get composers for the soundtrack to RevoLOUtion , with even those who only had a history in commercials charging hefty prices .
So Bret and his team took the task upon themselves singing themes and going around in circles always ended up always bellowing out the ROCKY theme .
The solution was obvious but still a bit of a pipe dream .
They sent the movie to Bill Conti , the composer of the Oscar Winning Rocky Soundtrack , there was after all nothing to lose .
Bill ’s response was that HE COULDN ’T TURN AWAY FROM THE PERFORMANCE and HAD TO DO THE THEME .
With absolutely no money
Bret needed to get Bill an orchestra , he managed to persuade 20 musicians to come together for 400 bucks and the rest is history .
. .
Another Oscar Winner on board for the meager sum of $ 400 .
Go Bret !
4. Filming with Burt Young - ‘ You Got Balls Kid ’
Surely you ’ve seen the legendary movie Rocky -
Who has n’t ?
Then you ’ll all remember the character of Paulie , Rocky ’s brother - in - law played by Burt Young .
Carr ’s producer Mary Helen ran into Burt Young in the street and they managed to persuade him to shoot for an hour the next day , he possibly accepted because he was playing the role of an angry stutterer .
When Bret told Burt when and where he wanted to shoot Burt ’s response was the classic “ YOU GOT BALLS KID ”- Sylvester Stallone eat your heart out - one of the most famous Rocky quotes !!
Carr organized a crew to meet outside Burt ’s broadway play in front of a police station without permits .
And even got the cops to help shoot .

Clearly Bret has huge balls - Keep the Hollywood legends coming Bret !
5. Jane Fonda and Kumar Pallana Saga
Which Hollywood legend would Bret target next ?
Carr still wanted to reshoot some scenes for RevoLOUtion and set about enrolling the help of the legendary Hollywood actress and writer Jane Fonda .
Despite being told by the powerful agency courting Carr , not to bother her , Bret got Jane ’s email from a journalist and sent her the movie .
Jane declined the reshoot due to her hip operation and pending bus tour but instead gave a quote on the film :
“ Intense film , an extraordinary performance ”
She ALSO included in her email , brilliant reshoot notes which Carr implemented with Kumar Pallana , the iconic Indian character actor who stole the Spielberg Film “ Terminal ” from Tom Hanks .
Carr ’s team checked out Kumar on IMDB , he was 30 minutes outside of Hollywood , they met up , he then signed and starred .
6. Hard Hitting Agent Joe Klien gets RevoLOUtion the recognition it deserves
After being rejected 5 years in a row utilizing different cuts of the movie , Carr created a pseudonym and personality , JOE KLIEN , a hard hitting agent who did n’t take no for an answer .
Bret via his alter ego ‘ Joe Klien ’ , got the movie into slamdance , an irreverent film festival .
From this platform RevoLOUtion has won Jury Prizes and distinctions at 15 international film festivals .
Carr got representation from Jon Sheinberg , a Hollywood agent turned manager and son of Syd Sheinberg , ex-President of Universal for 20 years .
After being rejected 5 years in a row utilizing different cuts of the movie , Carr called up the head of the IFP who runs a work in progress screening each year of 5 of the worlds best undiminished films .
Historically the program discovered Brothers McMullan ,
She ’s gotta have it , and many others .
Carr was rejected , but authorized by Shienberg who did n’t have time to represent him as hoped for , Carr created a pseudonym and personality , JOE KLIEN , a hard hitting agent who did n’t take no for an answer .
Here ’s the gist of how the conversation went :
“ Hello , put the Executive Director on the phone please .
This is Joe Klien from Jon Sheinberg ’s office . ”
“ Michelle Byrd ?
This is Joe Klien , I work for Jon and Syd Shienberg .
You know who they are do n’t you . ”
“ Yes ” “ Well let me remind you .
Syd discovered a filmmaker named Steven Spielberg .
NOW we represent Bret Carr , whose film FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT ( RevoLOUtion ’s name at the time ) was rejected …
“ Sir , first of this an organization and we have a screening committee which I ’m not part of .
I run the organization .
Secondly selections are closed .
The deadline is firmly over . ”
Joe , “ Let me tell you what .
If you do n’t take that tape home and make a decision yourself on Bret Carr ’s movie , you are committing soul murder of the most important Cinematic Voice since Steven Spielberg .
Do you understand me . ”
Michelle Byrd , “ Are you threatening me ? ” Joe , slamming his fist on the table , ( Bret told me he was so in character he scared himself with the flesh smacking wood ) :
“ You ’re goddamn right I ’m threatening you , I ’m threatening you with being haunted by killing a masterwork .
What I ’m really doing though , is talking to you like I ’d talk to the head of a studio fighting for the LIFE of a filmmaker who has risked EVERYTHING to make the most powerful movie any of us in this office has ever seen .
A movie that changes lives .
And if you do n’t take that tape home and have an answer for me , at your authentic discretion …
A yes or a no… after that movie has been watched by YOU personally tonight , then you will be responsible for crushing the most powerful motion picture visionary I have ever seen , and flushing thirty five years of this masterfilmmaker life down the toilet .
DO YOU COMPREHEND WHAT I AM SAYING TO YOU ?! ”
Michelle , meekly , “ Yes , sir . ” Joe , “ Do we have an understanding that I will hear from you no later than 10 am my time tomorrow ? ”
Michelle , “ Yes , sir . ” 9 am next day , Michelle , “ We would be honored to have Bret ’s movie in our festival . ”
The Result
Bret via his alter ego ‘ Joe Klien ’ got the movie into slamdance , an irreverent film festival .
From this platform RevoLOUtion has won Jury Prizes and distinctions at 15 international film festivals .
Yet another example of steely chutzpah .
7. Quest for Distribution
Carr wanted Distribution after being turned down by everyone so he shot a 20 dollar short PASSION OF THE HEIST .
He emailed to 3000 people , and within days it was forwarded all around Hollywood and reported on the radio from Marty Grove who also is a writer for the Hollywood Reporter .
He made Bret FILMMAKER OF THE MONTH .
However , the distribution deal fell through , as the company ’s finances did n’t come together .
Restless Carr relentlessly with no money and no distributor cracked on and filmed another short starring LOU BENEDETTI … FARANHEIT 6911 costs 20 dollars and makes it onto the front page again , of the HOLLYWOOD REPORTER - BUT …
Despite all this success and relentless effort to get distribution Carr had no distributor UNTIL … he stumbled across an inheritance from his newly rich mother .
8. Crazy Experiment that Shocked Studio Execs :
The Drugs Test
Carr came into a lot of money - $ 300,000 left to him in an inheritance , however in another bizarre twist he had to take a drug test to convince his newly rich mother that his addiction to perfecting RevoLOUtion was n’t actually a drug addiction .
Carr naturally put all of this money into the NY and LA release of the movie in a revolutionary ingenious idea .
Take a look below :
The Experiment
Bret then had the audacity to promote RevoLOUtion in a way that was to take the movie world by storm , you ’d think it would be better to take things one step at a time .
This video clip has managed to get 556 diggs within 16 hours of being posted on digg.com .
It has way over 10,000 views on YouTube
Cary Berglund , NBC Reporter :
“ Imagine if every dollar you had to pay to see a movie was with the confidence of 20/20 hindsight ”
The revolutionary experiment , pay what you think it ’s worth , is an all new approach to ticket sales and has the potential to revolutionize the movie theatre experience .
Bret Carr explains the logic behind his hot idea :
“ I walk out of 90 % of everything I ever see , that ’s why I wanted to give the power to the audience to be able to decide how much they like the film ”
The result of the experiment was exceptional - the NY and LA release was double the average box office take outgrossing 90 % of the Studio Independents along the way .
You ’d think Bret would just be happy to finally get his film out to the public but instead he creates a whole new approach to movie - going .
Overview of The Rise of RevoLOUtion . . .
These 8 sensational stories clearly demonstrate the chutzpah Bret possesses -
How much balls can one guy have ?
The length and breadth Bret Carr will go to to get his movie the exposure it deserves is astonishing .
SO …
The Future of RevoLOUtion
Despite the sheer chutzpah evident in Bret Carr ’s nature the major problem holding back RevoLOUtion is the problem of distribution .

Ms Tequila is in dispute with MySpace over selling her songs
Visit her page and you get some audio bubblegum to entertain you - apparently a track from her eagerly awaited debut album , for the multi-skilled Ms Tequila is a singer as well as a model .
Now she has become the latest online celebrity to come into conflict with a social network site .
The row blew up after MySpace asked her to remove a link that let visitors buy songs from a competing service , pointing out that " we retain the right to block or remove content that violates our terms of use , including unauthorized commercial transactions " .
The unauthorized commercial transaction here was that Ms Tequila 's profile included a widget - a small piece of code - that took visitors to the Hooka music service instead of the MySpace - approved Snocap .
This egregious attempt to make money without giving a cut to News Corporation , MySpace 's parent company , was duly noticed and punished .
Money trouble
Tila Tequila is clearly a talentless but astonishingly ambitious celebrity wannabe , her profile revealing that she was " in an adult relationship " before she was 16 , and " experimented with drugs and a hardcore lifestyle " when she moved from Houston to New York at the age of 18 .
But we cannot fight only for the rights of those of whom we approve , and a campaign for freedom of expression must include the freedom of those who we find offensive , uninteresting or just a little sad .
It must even include their right to make money by selling sanitized pop to an uncritical audience .
For the conflict between Tila Tequila and MySpace , like its earlier argument with Billy Bragg over rights to music uploaded onto the service , highlights an increasingly important issue that faces all net users .
Tila Tequila 's problems with MySpace are just one sign of how the comprehensive privatisation of our online experience limits our freedom of expression .
The services we are all using and increasingly dependent on , like Flickr and YouTube and FaceBook , are not there to make our lives better or enhance the quality of public participation .
They are there to make money for their founders and owners .
Just as the purpose of commercial television is not to make good TV programmes but simply to deliver an aggregated audience to advertisers , so the real point of social networks is not to transform our ways of life but to find new contexts within which we can be exposed to approved commercial messages .
In its early days access to the internet was governed by " acceptable use policies " which prohibited commercial activity of any type .
This was reasonable because the network was built , paid for and managed by university departments , government agencies and the military .
When it was privatised in the 1990's all sorts of commercial uses were permitted , and today it is as much as part of the capitalist economy as any shopping mall .
Space race
However , in the process of privatisation we have given up an important third space , somewhere between the university network and YouTube , a space which we can all use equally and which is dedicated to the public good .
We have lost the online equivalent of parks and roads and shopping streets , where the limits on what we can reasonably say and do are set by society as a whole and not by the commercial interests of one company .
MySpace blocks " unauthorised " buying and selling
If I try the same thing in the nearby Grafton shopping centre I will be asked to stop .
One space is public , the other private .
The difference between the shopping street and the mall is one of ownership .
The street is council - owned and managed for the public good , while the mall is a private area to which people are granted access on certain conditions .
But the real problem with MySpace , YouTube and Flickr and the many other social spaces , sharing tools and online collaborative mechanisms is not that they are privately owned , it is that there is no public service ethos behind them .
There never can be as long as they are owned by companies that must pursue shareholder value above everything .
Common good
It is important that we have and maintain online spaces which offer us the same degree of freedom as the high street , not just for freedom of expression but also for freedom of commerce , since the market matters too .
This does not have to mean a state - owned online social network , although it could do .
We 're all familiar with mutual enterprises and co-operatives that are dedicated to the public , and to charitable foundations that serve the public interest .
On common ground people have more freedom
Tila Tequila 's problems with MySpace are just one sign of how the comprehensive privatisation of our online experience limits our freedom of expression .
In her case it involved commercial activity , but there are equally limits on free expression that go far beyond what the law would require .
One approach to this would be to regulate all such networks , and in the long term we may find that competition policy is applied to MySpace 's commercial links as much as it is to Microsoft 's marketing strategy , but for the moment this is not on the horizon .
A better bet would be to encourage the development of new online spaces , common land on the internet that we can all share , where the freedoms we want when we walk down the street are also available to us online .
Because the best way pressure MySpace to open up is to provide users with an open alternative .
Now that open source and free software are well established , well understood and increasingly viewed as a viable alternative to closed , proprietary systems , perhaps its time to focus on open spaces and online freedoms .
Even if it does give Tila Tequila an opportunity to sell her ghastly music .

BLACK SUMMER is a superhero novel .
Mostly .
William Christensen is a betting man , and a while back he made me three bets .
He bet me I could n’t get a new spin out of the zombie story .
He bet me I could n’t write a fantasy story .
And he bet me I could n’t get a new angle on the superhero story .
Since I returned to Marvel Comics a couple of years ago , I ’ve been tasked with thinking about superhero fiction kind of a lot , with a mandate as a sort of walking one - man R&D department .
So , with BLACKGAS and WOLFSKIN already under my belt , I sat down to think about this .
And now I own several of William Christensen ’s internal organs .
Which is just as well , as many of mine are failing fast after having written this .
I ’ve always had a political take on superhero fiction , from the days of STORMWATCH and THE AUTHORITY .
Comes of being a cranky Englishman who enjoys such Communist enterprises as national health care and more than two political parties .
And , as almost no - one has failed to notice over the last year , posing political questions in superhero fiction has come back into vogue .
So , in thinking about this , I had that on my side .
But , obviously , I was going to be generating a world from scratch , and did n’t have access to the populist appeal of well - known characters beating each other up in pursuit of political argument .
The advantage , however , was that I was n’t bound to expressing the argument in terms of those long - running characters and their relationships .
And the more I thought about this , the more one question loomed :
If we invite or condone masked adventurers to fight crime outside the law , do we get to draw a line where they stop ?
Condoning their activity is much the same as giving them carte blanche to fight crime wherever they perceive it to be .
This leads to a much bigger question than , say , asking if superhuman combatants in America should be registered with a Federal agency .
In fact , it leads to this :
If a self - identified crimefighter lives in a country where a President can be said to have prosecuted an illegal war and therefore can be said to have killed a great many people in the enactment of his criminal enterprise …
What does that masked man do ?
If he ’s a man using the name John Horus , with the same destructive power as a fleet of Apache helicopters , then the answer is obvious .
And so BLACK SUMMER opens with John Horus killing the President of the United States .
That ’s the question .
What happens when a superhero ’s pursuit of justice leads him to the inexorable conclusion that he must kill his President to save his country ?
There used to be seven of them .
The Seven Guns , politically - aware young scientist - adventurers who created strange new technological abilities for themselves and who put on masks and helmets and took to the streets to fight a corrupt police force and criminal private security firms in their West Coast city .
The latter situation not being a million miles away from reality in some places .
One died .
The man who co-designed their enhancements was killed by bad cops .
One was crippled and withdrew .
The others drifted apart .
Once they were heroes , with the fire of youth .
But now they ’re pushing thirty and falling apart .
The Seven Guns — and their co-designer and mentor , Frank Blacksmith — were at the cutting edge of physics and technology .
They turned exotic science into what they called gun-enhancements — special abilities that also wired into unique handweapons .
Because everyone they were going to fight was already armed , and they already had shoot - to - kill orders .
In terms of superhero fiction , this reaches back to its roots : the Shadow had twin .45s and Doc Savage always packed a machine - pistol .
John Horus did n’t have a gun .
He walks surrounded by a network of floating “ eyes ” that render him both unkillable and incredibly dangerous .
He was always the most powerful of the Guns , and also always the Good Man , the one who could be trusted , the one who believed most passionately in justice for all .
What interests me the most about John Horus is that , although he Is genuinely frightening , the possibility exists that he ’s actually entirely right .
That a good man cannot stand idly by and do nothing .
Not that that is a comfort to poor Tom Noir , missing a leg after the carbomb explosion that killed his fellow Gun and lover Laura Torch .
He has n’t switched his enhancements on in over a year .
They may not even work anymore .
Of the surviving Guns , Tom the grieving alcoholic cripple is going to be the first target for anyone intending to suppress further attempts by the gun-enhanced to strike at the fabric of American society .
Because , as we all know , when America responds to an attack on its government , it does n’t do so quietly or politely .
This is the freedom of doing a piece of superhero fiction outside the auspices of company ownership or the weight of continuity : the big questions can be asked in a very direct and brutal manner .
In this world , masked adventurers on the run are not going to be pursued , tricked and trapped by their estranged colleagues .
Every last one of them is going to be hunted by the combined forces of the US military structure .
It is , to my mind , what would always happen — the streets of America would be secured by soldiers and gun emplacements and helicopters against the threat of the flying superhuman .
And for those who think I ’m being anti-American , consider this : in Britain , we ’d just have the SAS kill them in their beds .
You people are young , and have not let learned how to do business .
So that ’s the set - up : John Horus , most beloved of the original Seven Guns team of superhuman streetfighters , has killed the President of the United States for arranging an illegal war .
He has a plan , and that plan is even more frightening .
He has set himself up as the protector of America .
And the authorities cannot take the chance that the other Guns are not involved .
The country is now at war with its own heroes .
In a situation like that , there are no sides .
Not any more .
It ’s about who survives and who does n’t .
It ’s about whether the idea of America lives or dies .
It ’s about where you draw the line .
– Warren Ellis

United Airlines is under fire for a viral video that shows them removing a passenger forcibly from an airplane bound for Louisville Kentucky .
Here are the bullets :
The plane was already loaded and full .
The airline needed to fly four employees to Louisville Kentucky on the plane .
The employees needed to go to prevent another plane from departing late .
The airline offered $ 800 in compensation to the first four people who would volunteer to give up their seats .
No one took the offer .
The airline went to a lottery , drawing for people at random .
These four people were asked to leave the plane , and they would receive the compensation .
One of the passengers refused to leave .
It 's unclear how things escalated , however he was removed by security officers .
Reports are conflicting about whether the officers were police officers , TSA workers , or airline staff .
The gentleman was literally physically dragged down the aisle receiving while screaming in protest and physically abused in the process .

Richmond Council says the curfews do help cut anti-social behaviour
The teenager said the use of dispersal zones in Richmond , south - west London , breached his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights .
Unaccompanied under -16s found in zones after 9 pm can be held and escorted home , whether badly behaved or not .
The Home Office said it would be appealing against the ruling .
The police and Richmond Council had argued that curfew zones reduced anti-social behaviour .
The High Court ruled that the law did not give the police a power of arrest , and officers could not force someone to come with them .
...
They should n't be allowed to treat me like a criminal just because I 'm under 16
Teenager known as " W "
Curfews ' demonise young '
One area 's fight for order
Lord Justice Brooke said : " ...
All of us have the right to walk the streets without interference from police constables or CSOs unless they possess common law or statutory powers to stop us .
" If Parliament considered that such a power was needed , it should have said so , and identified the circumstances in which it intended the power to be exercised . "
In a statement after the ruling the boy , known in the case as " W " and described as a " model student " , said : " Of course I have no problem with being stopped by the police if I 've done something wrong .
" But they should n't be allowed to treat me like a criminal just because I 'm under 16 .
" I am very happy with the outcome it is a good victory .
I 'm glad that the police can't just use force against us anymore .
" I am happy that I wo n't get into trouble with the police just for being young . "
These powers provide the police with a powerful tool to tackle intimidation and anti-social behaviour by groups of people
Home Office spokeswoman
Q&A : Teenage curfews
BBC Home Affairs correspondent Rory McLean said the test case ruling had major implications for the government 's anti-social behaviour policy and may require legislation in order to deal with the issue .
A Home Office spokeswoman said dispersal zones already in place and future applications were unaffected by the judgment .
" These powers provide the police with a powerful tool to tackle intimidation and anti-social behaviour by groups of people , " she said .
" Whilst not limited to young people , ' teenagers hanging around ' is a big cause of concern to the public as cited in the British Crime Survey . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
What about law abiding citizen 's human rights ?
Pauline Yates , Suffolk
Send us your comments
During the case heard in May , Javan Herberg , appearing for the teenager , said the curfew zones violated the human rights of " wholly innocent " young people .
He told the court that more than 400 zones had been introduced under the 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act .
While this case involved Richmond , its implications could be much wider , he said .
The Home Office , backed by lawyers for the police and council , argued the application for judicial review should be dismissed and said the zones did not breach human rights or common law .
They said the 15 - year - old could not bring the claim because he had never been stopped by police inside a dispersal area .
The boy was backed by civil rights group Liberty .
Alex Gask , Liberty 's legal Officer acting for " W " , said : " This is a victory for the presumption of innocence , and the right of everyone , no matter what their age , not to be subjected to coercive powers without good cause " .
Debates Of Our Time
Robert Samuelson :
One of the big debates of our time involves the causes of economic growth .
Why is North America richer than South America ?
Why is Africa poor and Europe wealthy ?
Similarly , why do white Americans tend to have more money than black Americans ?
Oh , if only there were some unbelievably obvious , historically - based reason staring us right in the face .
Sadly , however , there is not .
Maybe we 'll never know the answer .
BUT : In fairness to Samuelson , he suffers from the same affliction as Thomas Friedman — a large , furry parasite that has attached itself to his upper lip and sucked his brain out through his nose .
AND : For a less snide , more rational examination of this , see Ken Silverstein .
I myself would add to Samuelson 's reading list something about the estimated eight million people worked to death in the Imperial City of Potosi .
A reader writes :
I went to hear Barack Obama speak tonight in San Francisco .
The crowd was huge , the lines were long , and ( reportedly ) the Secret Service was slowing things down by searching everyone exhaustively at the door .
It was painfully obvious that I probably was n’t going to be admitted in time to hear the speech .
Then the police cleared the street next to the one I was waiting on , putting up “ do not cross ” tape .
Childishly , I thought “ I may not get in to hear the speech , but at least I ’ll see the motorcade ” .
When the motorcade did come roaring down the street , it suddenly stopped .
Someone had told Senator Obama that huge lines of supporters had little or no hope of getting in to the main event .
He left his motorcade , walked on foot down the street towards the crowd , and gave a ten minute impromptu speech for those waiting in line .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The nation 's three biggest banks have agreed on the structure of a backup fund of at least $ 75 billion in an effort to help stabilize the credit markets , according to a person involved in the discussions , The New York Times reported Saturday .
Representatives from Bank of America ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and J.P. Morgan Chase ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) reached an agreement on a simpler plan late Friday , according to the Times .
Previous versions in the two nearly two months of negotiations had been considered unfeasible .
The proposed fund could begin operating by the end of the year , and the banks would start to ask about 60 financial institutions to contribute to it by Friday or early next week , the Times reported .
The group of banks have said they created the fund to buy shaky mortgage - backed securities .
While it does n't change the fundamental problem facing the mortgage market - rising delinquencies on subprime mortgages - the fund could increase confidence in some better - quality mortgage - related debt .
AFP
WHATEVER your opinion of the health of America 's economy was a couple of days ago , it should now be a lot gloomier .
The monthly jobs figures for August , released on Friday September 7th , were worse , far worse , than anyone expected .
The economy lost 4000 jobs last month , the first monthly loss of jobs since August 2003 .
Already jittery financial markets headed down .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 250 points or 1.87 % .
The dollar sank at the prospect of weaker economy and lower interest rates .
The monthly employment figures tend to have an outsize impact on financial markets .
But this time Wall Street 's reaction seemed justified .
Not only were the overall figures far worse than expected — Wall Street 's seers had forecast some 100,000 new jobs — but revisions to prior months suggested that the job market has been weakening for a while .
The new figures suggest that over the past three months the economy , on average , created 44,000 jobs a month , far fewer than are necessary to keep the jobless rate stable , and well below the monthly job growth of 147,000 between January and May .
The unemployment rate , which comes from a different set of figures to the jobs numbers , remained at 4.6 % — but only because the number of people who described themselves as being in the labour force fell sharply .
There are some reasons to believe that this report exaggerates the bad news .
Government jobs , for instance , fell for the third month in a row .
That is extremely unusual and may well be made up in September 's figures .
It is not unheard of for monthly payrolls to fall for a month , and then rebound .
But the basic message — that America 's labour market was weakening well before the recent financial turmoil — is hard to deny .
( The payroll figures are based on surveys conducted in the middle of each month .
Thus August 's figures do not reflect the full brunt of the past few weeks ' credit crunch ) .
For months , solid job growth , rising incomes and low unemployment have been the foundation for an optimistic assessment of the economy 's prospects .
With jobs plentiful , the argument went , even a sharp housing bust need not derail the broader economy .
That foundation may now be crumbling .
There is little doubt that the housing market was worsening , once again , before the August turmoil .
The pace of new home construction plunged in July , while the stock of unsold homes rose to a 16 - year high .
Now it seems that the labour market was weakening too .
A weaker labour market , in turn , is likely to worsen the housing bust as more people find it hard to pay their mortgages .
Pile a sharp tightening in credit conditions on top and recession seems all too plausible .
That spectre is why it is all but certain that the Federal Reserve will cut the federal funds rate , its benchmark short - term interest rate , on September 18th .
The speculation now is whether the cut will be a modest quarter - point , bringing the funds rate down to 5 % , or a more aggressive half percentage point cut .
Unfortunately , if the employment figures are a harbinger of what is to come , it may already be too late to stave off a nasty slowdown .
ハッカーとオープンソース を読みました。 これはとても良い記事です。 ここまで正面から自由を語ってくれたまつもとさんに感謝したいですね。
少し感じたことを書いてみます。
ハッカーがフリーソフトウェアを愛する最も大きな理由は、経済的なものではなく、自由です。ハッカーは自分が理不尽と感じる理由で行動が制限されることを大変嫌います。
（フリーソフトウェア派の）ハッカーの考え方を表現した文として、
これぐらい私が共感できるものはありません。
面白そうだと思ったら、すぐにソースコードを眺めて、
ソースコードがあれば、すぐにいじりたくなってきて、
うまくいったら、それを他人にも見せたくなってくる、
それがハッカーというものだと思うのです。
しかし、私には極めて不可解なことは、 世の中にはそうでない人も結構たくさんいるってことです。
フランスにはあんまりいませんが、 日本にはいっぱい棲息しているという印象を持っています。
とどのつまり、自分の首を絞めることになるのに、
なぜかソフトウェアを不自由にしてしまったり、
不自由なソフトウェアを安易に受け入れたりします。
もちろん、自分がそうしたいわけじゃないけど、
仕事で決められているから仕方がないとか、
全然開発する能力がないので、気にもしませんとか、
そういうのだったら理解できます。 悲しいけれど、理解できます。 しかし、全く誰に強制されているわけでもないのに、
不自由な道を選ぶ人もいます。 私には全然理解できません。 そんなの、どこがどう楽しいのか、ちっとも分かりません。
ソースコードをいじるのが好きな人が、 なぜか他のソースコードをいじることが好きな人を封じてしまう。 これって、一体何？ 世の中には私には理解できないことがいっぱいあります。
でも、そのおかげでストールマンは、プログラミングに割く時間があまり取れないそうです。彼の膨大なエネルギーを純粋にプログラミングに向けることができたらどんな偉大なことが実現できていただろうかと考えると、すごくもったいないような気がします。
ここのところは、言いたいことは分かる気もするけれど、
根本的に私とまつもとさんが違う部分なのかなあ。
私の観点からは、「RMSは自分だけでハックだけやることを放棄したおかげで、それを凌駕するハックの成果をあげることが出来た」と言いたいですね。 いくらRMSとは言え、今の GNU プロジェクト の成果はRMSが10人いても到達できない規模と品質を備えています。
もしも彼だけだったら、今でもまともに使いものになる自由なOSは手に入っていなかったでしょう。
しかもRMSの影響力は彼自身のプロジェクトであるGNUだけに留まりません。
FFII のような政治団体をはじめとして、 あちこちに影響を与えていて、 そのおかげで彼が望む自由な世界により一層近づいています。 ソフトウェアだけ見ても 、GNU 以外でも彼の影響を受けたソフトウェアは数え切れません。 もしも彼が自分だけでハックしていたら、果して彼が望む世界に少しでも近づいていたでしょうか。 私にはそうは思えません 。
ハッカーにもいろんな種類がいる、というのを昔から感じてきましたが、
「 自分で手を動かしたい派」と「自分が嬉しい状況にしたい派」がいるように思います。
もちろんコードを書くのが好きな人で、自分で書くのがそれほど好きとは言えない、って人はそんなにいないでしょうけれど、
「何が何でも自分自身でやりたい」と思う人ばかりではありません。
確かにあんまり面白いネタがあると飛びついてしまいますが、
最終的に自分が欲しいものが手に入ったらいいという考え方もあるのです。
私自身はちょうどそういう感じです。 私は 「 自分でやった方が早い 」 「待っていても手に入らない」と感じると、
すぐに行動してしまう癖がありますが、 逆に、他人に任せた方がいいと思うときは、自分ではあんまりやりません。
根がずぼらなので、怠けているのが好きだってのもあるでしょうが、
自分でやることに拘りがないのだと思います。 実際、最近はGRUBなんて、完全に他人に任せきりです。
自分が介入しなくてもうまく動いてくれるなら、
それで最終的に自分が望んでいた物が得られるなら、 全く構わないんです。
そういう目で眺めると、 私にはRMSの選択は非常に正しかったのだと思えるのです。
追記：もう少し書くと、偏見かもしれませんが、日本のハッカーの多くは、ハックの対象が極めて限定的で、コンピュータしか見ていない気がします。 それに対して、 私が出会ったアメリカ人やカナダ人やヨーロッパ人のハッカー達は、
しばしばそれ以上の領域にハッキングの意識を持っていると感じました。 私が思うに、RMSがやったことは社会に対するハックなんですね。
だから、彼はコンピュータ上でハックできなくても、
ハックという行為そのものができていないとは感じていないんじゃないかと想像します。
Start with the simplest , most basic fudge .
Newspapers and the TV news constantly report on various plans for the “ withdrawal of American troops ” from Iraq , when what ’s being proposed is the withdrawal of American “ combat troops ” or “ combat brigades . ”
This is n’t a matter of splitting hairs ; it ’s the difference between a plan for full - scale withdrawal and a plan to remain in Iraq in a different military form for the long term .
American combat brigades only add up to perhaps half of the troops we presently have in that country .
There is , in fact , quite a gap between withdrawal from that embattled land and the withdrawal of some American troops , while many of the rest hunker down on the enormous , all - but - permanent military bases the Pentagon has built there over the last four years  while defending the largest embassy on the planet , now nearing completion ( amid the normal woes that seem to go with American construction and “ reconstruction ” ) in Baghdad ’s heavily fortified but distinctly insecure Green Zone .
And yet , thanks to the carefully worded statements of leading Democratic ( and Republican ) politicians now criticizing the Bush administration , as well as generally terrible reporting in the mainstream media , most Americans who do n’t make it to the fine print or who do n’t wander widely on the political Internet would have no way of knowing that withdrawal is n’t withdrawal at all .
Ira Chernus , TomDispatch regular and author of Monsters To Destroy , takes a careful look at the leading Democratic candidates for president and raises a few crucial , if largely unasked , questions about the nature of the positions they are taking on the Iraq War .

The Democrats ’ Iraqi Dilemma
Questions unasked , answers never volunteered
by Ira Chernus
Pity the poor Democratic candidates for president , caught between Iraq and a hard place .
Every day , more and more voters decide that we must end the war and set a date to start withdrawing our troops from Iraq .
Most who will vote in the Democratic primaries concluded long ago that we must leave Iraq , and they are unlikely to let anyone who disagrees with them have the party ’s nomination in 2008 .
But what does it mean to “ leave Iraq ” ?
Here ’s where most of the Democratic candidates come smack up against that hard place .
There is a long - standing bipartisan consensus in the foreign - policy establishment that the U.S. must control every strategically valuable region of the world  and none more so than the oil heartlands of the planet .
That ’s been a hard - and - fast rule of the elite for some six decades now .
No matter how hard the task may be , they demand that presidents be rock - hard enough to get the job done .
So whatever “ leave Iraq ” might mean , no candidate of either party likely to enter the White House on Jan. 20 , 2009 , can think it means letting Iraqis determine their own national policies or fate .
The powers that be just would n’t stand for that .
They see themselves as the guardians of world “ order . ”
They feel a sacred obligation to maintain “ stability ” throughout the imperial domains , which now means most of planet Earth  regardless of what voters may think .
The Democratic front - runners know that “ order ” and “ stability ” are code words for American hegemony .
They also know that voters , especially Democratic ones , see the price of hegemony in Iraq and just do n’t want to pay it anymore .
So the Democratic front - runners must promise voters that they will end the war  with not too many ideologically laden ifs , ands , or buts  while they assure the foreign - policy establishment that they will never abandon the drive for hegemony in the Middle East ( or anywhere else ) .
In other words , the candidates have to be able to talk out of both sides of their mouths at the same time .
No worries , it turns out .
Fluency in doublespeak is a prime qualification for high political office .
On Iraq , candidates Dennis Kucinich and Bill Richardson do n’t meet that test .
They tell anyone and everyone that they want “ all ” U.S. troops out of Iraq , but they register only 1 - 4 percent in the polls and are generally ignored in the media .
The Democrats currently topping the polls , on the other hand , are proving themselves eminently qualified in doublespeak .
Clinton : “ We Got It Right , Mostly , During the Cold War ”
Hillary Clinton declares forthrightly : “ It is time to begin ending this war .
Start bringing home America ’s troops within 90 days . ”
Troops home :
It sounds clear enough .
But she is always careful to avoid the crucial word all .
A few months ago she told an interviewer : “ We have remaining vital national security interests in Iraq .
What we can do is to almost take a line sort of north of , between Baghdad and Kirkuk , and basically put our troops into that region . ”
A senior Pentagon officer who has briefed Clinton told NPR commentator Ted Koppel that Clinton expects U.S. troops to be in Iraq when she ends her second term in 2017 .
Why all these troops ?
We have “ very real strategic national interests in this region , ” Clinton explains .
“ I will order specialized units to engage in narrow and targeted operations against al - Qaeda and other terrorist organizations in the region .
They will also provide security for U.S. troops and personnel and train and equip Iraqi security services to keep order and promote stability . ”
There would be U.S. forces to protect the Kurds and “ our efforts must also involve a regional recommitment to success in Afghanistan . ”
Perhaps that ’s why Clinton has proposed “ that we expand the Army by 80,000 troops , that we move faster to expand the Special Forces . ”
Says her deputy campaign manager Bob Nash , “ She ’ll be as tough as any Republican on our enemies . ”
And on our friends , he might have added , if they do n’t shape up .
At the Take Back America conference in June the candidate drew boos when she declared that “ the American military has done its job .
They gave the Iraqi government the chance to begin to demonstrate that it understood its responsibilities .
It is the Iraqi government which has failed . ”
It ’s the old innocent - Americans - blame - the - foreigners ploy .
More importantly , it ’s the old tough - Americans - reward - friends - who - help - America ploy .
We should start withdrawing some troops , Clinton says , “ to make it clear to the Iraqis that we ’re going to look out for American interests , for the region ’s interests . ”
If the Iraqi government is not “ striving for sustainable stability we ’ll consider providing aid to provincial governments and reliable non-governmental organizations that are making progress . ”
Clinton ’s message to the Iraqi leaders is clear :
You had your chance to join “ the international community , ” to get with the U.S. program , and to reap the same benefits as the leaders of other oil - rich nations  but you blew it .
So , now you can fend for yourselves while we look for new , more capable allies in Iraq and keep who - knows - how - many troops there to “ protect our interests ”  and increase our global clout .
The draw - down in Iraq , our signal that we ’ve given up on the Maliki government , “ will be a first step towards restoring Americans moral and strategic leadership in the world , ” Clinton swears .
“ America must be the world ’s leader , ” she declared last month .
“ We must widen the scope of our strength by leading strong alliances which can apply military force when required . ”
And , when necessary , cut off useless puppet governments that wo n’t let their strings be pulled often enough .
Hillary is speaking to at least three audiences : the voters at home , the foreign - policy elite , and a global elite she would have to deal with as president .
Her recent fierce criticism of the way President Bush has handled Iraq , like her somewhat muddled antiwar rhetoric , is meant as a message of reassurance to voters , but also to our elite  and as a warning to foreigners :
The next President Clinton will be tough on allies as well as foes , as tough as the old cold warriors .
“ We got it right , mostly , during the Cold War .
Nothing is more urgent than for us to begin again to rebuild a bipartisan consensus , ” she said last year in a speech that cut right to the bottom line : “ American foreign policy exists to maintain our security and serve our national interests . ”
That ’s what the bipartisan consensus has always believed .
Obama and Edwards : Do n’t Tread on Us
That seems to be what Barack Obama , another loyal member of the foreign - policy establishment , believes too .
“ The single most important job of any president is to protect the American people , ” he affirmed in a major foreign - policy statement last April .
But “ the threats we face can no longer be contained by borders and boundaries .
The security of the American people is inextricably linked to the security of all people . ”
That ’s why the U.S. must be the “ leader of the free world . ”
It ’s hard to find much difference on foreign policy between Clinton and Obama , except that Barack is more likely to dress up the imperial march of U.S. interests in such old - fashioned Cold War flourishes .
That delights neoconservative guru Robert Kagan , who summed up Obama ’s message succinctly : “ His critique is not that we ’ve meddled too much but that we have n’t meddled enough .
To Obama , everything and everyone everywhere is of strategic concern to the United States . ”
To control everything and everyone , he wants “ the strongest , best - equipped military in the world .
A 21st century military to stay on the offense . ”
That , he says , will take at least 92,000 more soldiers and Marines  precisely the number Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has recommended to President Bush .
Like Hillary , Barack would remove all “ combat brigades ” from Iraq , but keep U.S. troops there “ for a more extended period of time ”  even “ redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq ”  to support the Kurds , train Iraqi forces , fight al - Qaeda , “ reassure allies in the Gulf , ” “ send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria , ” and “ prevent chaos in the wider region . ”
“ Most importantly , some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan to stop Afghanistan from backsliding toward instability . ”
Barack also agrees with Hillary that the Iraqi government needs a good scolding “ to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability .
Only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely .
No more coddling , no more equivocation . ”
But Obama offers a carrot as well as a stick to the Iraqis : “ The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels .
The United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq . ”
What , however , does “ permanent ” mean when language is being used so subtly ?
It ’s a question that needs an answer , but no one asks it  and no answer is volunteered .
John Edwards offers variations on the same themes .
He wants a continuing U.S. troop presence “ to prevent a genocide , deter a regional spillover of the civil war , and prevent an al - Qaeda safe haven . ”
But he goes further than either Obama or Clinton in spelling out that we “ will also need some presence in Baghdad , inside the Green Zone , to protect the American embassy and other personnel . ”
Around the world , Edwards would use military force for “ deterring and responding to aggressors , making sure that weak and failing states do not threaten our interests , and maintaining our strategic advantage against major competitor states that could do us harm and otherwise threaten our interests . ”
His distinctive touch is to stress coordinated military and civilian efforts for “ stabilizing states with weak governments .
I would put stabilization first . ” “ Stabilization ” is yet another establishment code word for insuring U.S. control , as Edwards certainly knows .
His ultimate aim , he says , is to ensure that the U.S. will “ lead and shape the world . ”
Running for the Imperial Presidency
The top Democrats agree that we must leave significant numbers of U.S. troops in Iraq , not only for selfish reasons , but because we Americans are so altruistic .
We want to prevent chaos and bring order and stabilization to that country  as if U.S. troops were not already creating chaos and instability there every day .
But among the foreign policy elite , the U.S. is always a force for order , “ helping ” naturally chaotic foreigners achieve “ stability . ”
For the elite , it ’s axiomatic that the global “ stability ” that keeps us secure and prosperous is also a boon for the people we “ stabilize . ”
For this to happen in Iraq , time must be bought with partial “ withdrawal ” plans .
( It matters little how many foreigners we kill in the process , as long as U.S. casualties are reduced enough to appease public opinion at home . )
This is not open to question ; most of the time , it ’s not something that even crosses anyone ’s mind to question .
Well , perhaps it ’s time we started asking such questions .
A lost war should be the occasion for a great public debate on the policies and the geopolitical assumptions that led to the war .
Americans blew that opportunity after the Vietnam War .
Instead of a genuine debate , we had a few years of apathy , verging on amnesia , toward foreign affairs followed by the Reagan revolution , whose disastrous effects in matters foreign ( and domestic ) still plague us .
Now , we have another precious  and preciously bought  opportunity to raise fundamental issues about foreign policy .
But in the mainstream , all we are getting is a false substitute for real public debate .
With an election looming , the Democrats portray themselves as the polar opposite of the Republicans .
They blame the Iraq fiasco entirely on Bush and the neocons , conveniently overlooking all the support Bush got from the Democratic elite before his military venture went sour .
They talk as if the only issue that matters is whether or not we begin to withdraw some troops from Iraq sometime next year .
The media report this debate in excruciating detail , with no larger context at all .
So most Americans think this is the only debate there is , or could be .
The other debate about Iraq  the one that may matter more in the long run  is the one going on in the private chambers of the policymakers about what messages they should send , not so much to enemies as to allies .
Bush , Cheney , and their supporters say the most important message is a reassuring one : “ When the U.S. starts a fight , it stays in until it wins .
You can count on us . ”
For key Democrats , including congressional leaders and major candidates for the imperial presidency , the primary message is a warning : “ U.S. support for friendly governments and factions is not an open - ended blank check .
If you are not producing , we ’ll find someone else who can . ”
The two sides are hashing this one out in a sometimes strident , sometimes relatively chummy manner .
The outcome will undoubtedly make a real difference , especially to the people of Iraq , but it ’s still only a dispute about tactics , never about goals , which have been agreed upon in advance .
Yet it ’s those long - range goals of the bipartisan consensus that add up to the seven - decade - old drive for imperial hegemony , which got us into Vietnam , Iraq , and wherever we fight the next large , disastrous war .
It ’s those goals that should be addressed .
Someone has to question that drive .
And what better moment to do it than now , in the midst of another failed war ?
Unfortunately , the leading Democratic candidates are n’t about to take up the task .
I guess it must be up to us .

The American version of the Santa Claus figure received its inspiration and its name from the Dutch legend of Sinter Klaas , brought by settlers to New York in the 17th century .
This Dutch - American Saint Nick achieved his fully Americanized form in 1823 in the poem A Visit From Saint Nicholas more commonly known as The Night Before Christmas by writer Clement Clarke Moore .
Moore included such details as the names of the reindeer ; Santa Claus 's laughs , winks , and nods ; and the method by which Saint Nicholas , referred to as an elf , returns up the chimney .

Americans who feel bored and underpaid do work hard -- at surfing the net and catching up on gossip , according to a survey that found U.S. workers waste about 20 percent of their working day .
REUTERS / Sherwin Crasto
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) - Americans who feel bored and underpaid do work hard -- at surfing the net and catching up on gossip , according to a survey that found U.S. workers waste about 20 percent of their working day .
An online survey of 2,057 employees by online compensation company Salary.com found about six in every 10 workers admit to wasting time at work with the average employee wasting 1.7 hours of a typical 8.5 hour working day .
Personal Internet use topped the list as the leading time - wasting activity according to 34 percent of respondents , with 20.3 percent then listing socializing with co-workers and 17 percent conducting personal business as taking up time .
The reasons why people wasted time were varied with nearly 18 percent of respondents questioned by e-mail in June and July said boredom and not having enough to do was the main reason .
The second most popular reason for wasting time was having too long hours ( 13.9 percent ) , being underpaid ( 11.8 percent ) , and a lack of challenging work ( 11.1 percent ) .
“ While a certain amount of wasted time is built into company salary structures , our research indicates that companies with a challenged and engaged workforce can expect more productivity in return , ” said Bill Coleman , chief compensation officer at Salary.com .
While the amount of time wasted at work seems high , Coleman said the numbers have improved , with the amount of time wasted dropping 19 percent since Salary.com conducted its first annual survey on slacking at work in 2005 .
Then workers reported wasting 2.09 hours of their working day .
“ I think ( the decline ) is really a result of the economy and that there ’s more business , more work available and less time to sit around wondering what you are going to do with your day , ” Coleman told Reuters .
The Platonic picture may be pleasing , but it is hard to square with what we have learned from neuroscience .
Everything that gives each of us our personal identities — consciousness , character , memories and so on — seems rooted in the electrochemical processes of our brains .
As Bertrand Russell observed , “ A virtuous person may be rendered vicious by encephalitis lethargica , and . . . a clever child can be turned into an idiot by a lack of iodine . ”
The dependence is most cruelly apparent in cases of Alzheimer ’s disease , where the dissolution of the self proceeds in direct proportion to the physical deterioration of the brain .

Where does this leave those who , while secular in outlook , still pine after immortality ?
A little more than a century ago , the American philosopher William James proposed an interesting way of keeping open the door to an afterlife .
We know that the mind depends on the physical brain , James said .
But that does n’t mean that our brain processes actually produce our mental life , as opposed to merely transmitting it .
Perhaps , he conjectured , our brains allow our minds to filter through to this world from some transcendent “ mother sea ” of consciousness .
Had James given his lecture a few decades later , he might have used the radio as a metaphor .
When a radio is damaged , the music becomes distorted .
When it is smashed , the music stops altogether .
All the while , however , the signal is still out there , uncorrupted .
James ’s idea of immortality may sound far - fetched , but for him and other scientifically minded thinkers of his time it had one great virtue .
It explained the existence of what were thought to be psychic phenomena : ghostly apparitions , communications from the dead at séances and seeming cases of reincarnation .
Alas , little of this supposed evidence for an afterlife has held up under the scrutiny of rigorous investigation .
In the 1970s , a new hope for survivalists emerged : the near - death experience .
In the best - selling book “ Life After Life , ” a doctor and parapsychologist named Raymond A. Moody Jr. presented a number of cases in which patients who had flat - lined and then been revived told of entering a long tunnel and emerging into a dazzling pool of light , where they communed with departed loved ones .
In 1988 , the atheist philosopher A. J. Ayer had such an adventure when he choked on a piece of smoked salmon and his heart stopped for a few minutes .
Soon afterward , Ayer reported that his near - death experience , in which he saw a red light that seemed to govern the universe , “ slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death . . . will be the end of me . ”
But he later dismissed it as a hallucination caused by a temporary lack of oxygen in his brain .
The most interesting possibilities for an afterlife proposed in recent years are based on hard science with a dash of speculation .
In his 1994 book , “ The Physics of Immortality , ” Frank J. Tipler , a specialist in relativity theory at Tulane University , showed how future beings might , in their drive for total knowledge , “ resurrect ” us in the form of computer simulations .
( If this seems implausible to you , think how close we are right now to “ resurrecting ” extinct species through knowledge of their genomes . )
John Leslie , a Canadian who ranks as one of the world ’s leading philosophers of cosmology , draws on quantum physics in his painstakingly argued new book , “ Immortality Defended . ”
Each of us , Leslie submits , is immortal because our life patterns are but an aspect of an “ existentially unified ” cosmos that will persist after our death .
Both Tipler and Leslie are , in different ways , heirs to the view of William James .
The mind or “ soul , ” as they see it , consists of information , not matter .
And one of the deepest principles of quantum theory , called “ unitarity , ” forbids the disappearance of information .
( Stephen Hawking used to think you could destroy your information by heaving yourself into a black hole , but a few years ago he changed his mind . )
Anorexic and hairy prostitutes all the rage in Moscow
Brothel owners try to attract customers with unusual novelties .
Girls looking like beautiful models go out of fashion slowly but surely .
Satiated with most sophisticated pleasures , moneybags are ready to pay thousands of dollars for a night with ugly prostitutes .
Wealthy men are willing to pay for sex with hairy , bearded and anorexic women , MIGnews.com.ua reports .
Anorexic and hairy prostitutes all the rage in Moscow
Victims of anorexia enjoy the biggest demand on the sex market in Moscow nowadays .
Anorexia is mainly caused by the desire to lose weight , so typical of all women , especially models .
Nowadays there are dozens of brothels in New York employing the girls fired from modeling businesses for excessive thinness .
A night with a barebone woman costs up to 2,000 dollars .
Prostitutes with burnt faces , broken noses , disproportionately big heads and other birth defects are extremely popular In Japan .
A young girl named only as Mimiko , who has a cleft lip and a cleft palate , claims that her sex life has become much more intense after she began working as a prostitute .
In Moscow , men start to prefer women with excessive hairiness .
A woman reportedly known as Fatima , a native of the former Soviet republic of Georgia , has her entire body covered with soft hair and even wears a beard .
Fatima charges 500 dollars a night for such unique looks .
The woman suffers from a rare disease : she has an increased level of male hormones in her body .
She would spend her life as a lonely virgin unless she became a prostitute .
Those going in for unusual sex say that prostitutes suffering from physical deformities or drawbacks welcome their every client with gratitude and show real passion in bed , which cannot be observed with other plain - looking workers of the sex industry .
Psychologists say that men with certain psychological problems are attracted by women with birth defects .
As a rule , such men are shy and secluded individuals having certain difficulties in everyday communication with other people .
They need to find someone weaker physically and morally to make themselves feel better .
A woman with a physical defect is a perfect match for such men , whereas they will not feel any sexual desire to a woman looking like a fashion model .
The people suffering from this deviation are not to be referred to as sex maniacs .
They do not cause anyone any harm .
Quite on the contrary , they can make happy a woman who has been suffering from a serious lack of human attention and care before .
Novy Region
I ’ve never been much of a camping enthusiast .
It ’s not that I do n’t appreciate all the great gadgets associated with camping , and I certainly enjoy hiking , fresh air , and getting away from it all .
But after toting all our high - tech apparatus into the middle of nowhere , setting up a tent , and rolling out the sleeping bags , I invariably think to myself : this is an awful lot of work for very little comfort .
At home I would have had a nice squishy mattress , a flush toilet , clean water , and no mosquitoes .
Why am I doing this again ?
Then it comes time to build a fire and I discover some cruel corollary of Murphy ’s Law at work .
On those rare days I ever have to attempt this task , it ’s always windy , damp , or both .
Of course , I know that when matches fail , I can always bring out some specially flammable substance designed expressly for the pyrotechnically challenged .
But the latest rage in fire - starting equipment is actually centuries old and uses no chemicals , sparks , or even metal components .
Meet the fire piston : a deceptively simple tool that uses compressed air to start a blaze in just seconds .
Light Me Up
A fire piston is a small cylindrical object usually made of wood , bone , or plastic .
It consists of two main parts : an outer casing , which is hollow but closed on one end , and the piston itself — a rod or plunger that fits the hole in the casing perfectly and whose tip reaches almost , but not quite , to the stoppered end of the tube .
The tip of the piston has a small indentation or hole , and just behind the tip is usually a gasket of some kind to ensure an airtight seal — perhaps a rubber O-ring or simply some waxed string .
In other words , very basic parts that require little technological sophistication to create .
To use a fire piston , you put a tiny piece of tinder in the indentation at the tip of the piston , and perhaps apply a dab of grease to the gasket for lubrication .
Then you place the plunger into the tube and smack it down rapidly .
This compresses the air inside , which raises its temperature .
Within less than a second , the temperature at the tip of the piston can reach more than 800 °F ( about 425 °C ) — enough to turn the tinder into a glowing ember .
The pressure also , conveniently , works as a spring that forces the piston back out of the casing .
Transfer the ember to a larger pile of tinder , blow for a few seconds , and poof !
You ’ve got fire .
Pressure Cooker
In an earlier version of this article , I made the rookie mistake of believing something I read on some random webpage , and then compounded the problem by repeating that claim .
The claim was that fire pistons work according to a principle called Charles ’s law , but that is not only wrong , it ’s pretty much the opposite of right .
( Charles ’s law has to do with the relationship between a gas ’s pressure and its temperature , as in rising temperatures make the gas expand . )
I hereby repent of my faulty reporting .
In fact , what ’s going on is an adiabatic heating process , in which the rapid compression of the air increases its temperature as the pressure increases , and the system does n’t leave that heat anywhere else to go .
You can approximate this effect by inflating a tire with a manual tire pump — yet another piston design — and notice that the pump gets hot as you use it ( although that type of design does provide an outlet for most of the heat ) .
This very principle is what makes diesel engines work : the fuel is ignited by rapidly compressed air , not by a spark as in conventional internal - combustion engines .
In fact , some people believe Rudolf Diesel may have gotten the idea for his engine from seeing a fire piston being demonstrated .
No one knows who invented the first fire piston .
Although the device was patented in England in the early 1800s , a similar design ( albeit made from different materials ) was apparently in use long before that in Indonesia , the Philippines , and several other southeast Asian nations .
The prevailing theory is that in the process of hollowing out a long tube to make a blowgun , a hunter inadvertently ignited some sawdust .
In any case , just as fire pistons were beginning to catch on in Europe , matches hit the scene , and quickly took over as the most popular method of making a flame .
And so fire pistons were all but forgotten — at least in the western world — for the better part of two centuries .
But under certain conditions , matches are still no match for a fire piston .
Because fire pistons create a watertight seal , they ’re virtually weatherproof .
And because you ’re working with a glowing ember rather than an open flame , wind can actually work in your favor .
You do , of course , have to have dry material to burn , but that ’s pretty much a given if you ’re going to start a fire by any means .
I first heard about fire pistons in an email from one of the many readers who regularly supplement my list of interesting things to research .
After browsing a few websites — and , especially , watching some videos of the devices in action — I was simply astonished .
I could n’t believe that something so simple , effective , and useful was n’t part of every camper ’s gear .
It might have been , had matches not been invented at just the right ( or wrong ) time .

Russian President Vladimir Putin attacked US foreign policy and urged a revival of traditional values Thursday in a hawkish speech that laid out a route for Russia to follow long after he steps down next year .
Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers the annual state of the nation address to the Federation Council , the upper house of parliament in Moscow 's Kremlin Thursday , April 26 , 2007 . [ AP ]
Making his last annual address to lawmakers , Putin said he was suspending Russia 's commitments under the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and linked the move in part to US plans for a missile shield in eastern Europe .
He gave no clear answer to the question preoccupying Kremlin - watchers and investors who Putin would endorse as his replacement when his second and final term ends next March .
But he set the tone for Russia 's next presidency , announcing a spending splurge on housing , pensions , defense and mammoth infra-structure projects including a canal to link the Caspian and Black Seas .
In a swipe at opposition groups who have taken to the streets alleging he is backtracking on democracy , the president railed at " extremists " and said foreign cash was being used to upset Russia 's political stability .
However , the thread that ran through his 72 - minute address was what he called Russia 's moral state .
" Our nation 's spiritual unity and the moral values which unite us are as important a factor in our development as political and economic stability , " he said , urging greater efforts to preserve Russia 's culture and language .
First deputy prime ministers Sergei Ivanov and Dmitry Medvedev , the men regarded as front - runners for Putin 's job , sat side by side listening to the speech along with lawmakers , religious leaders and ministers in the Kremlin 's Marble Hall .
Putin confirmed next year 's address would be read by a different president .
" It is premature for me to come out with political last wills and testaments , " he added , to applause .
In his seven years as Russian leader , Putin has overseen steady growth in incomes and a return to political stability after years of turmoil .
But relations with the United States have soured dramatically and his critics say he is turning Russia away from the West and tightening state control over all areas of life .
Google Earth has been released for the first time back in 2001 , 16 years ago , and since then it has progressed tremendously .
Nowadays , the famous computer program released by Google renders a 3D representation for Planet Earth , which is accurate since it is based on satellite imagery .
Together with the maps program , Google Earth is one of the most popular services offered by Google .
Google Earth and Google Pro
Earth Google is a mix between Google Earth and Google Earth Pro. Google Earth Pro was originally intended to become the business update of Google Earth with bonus features such as a movie maker or a data importer .
The merger between the two is known as Earth Pro .
The tools of Earth Pro are free and better .
The most recent version of the Earth Pro software , version 9 has been released for the Chrome search engine back in April .
The new version included a Voyager feature , which is used to see guided tours of cities and places .
The use of the Pro version of Google Earth
The new version for Desktop is used for creating and viewing maps on PC , Mac and Linux .
It is also used for its Movie Maker to produce media collateral .
Users also choose Go Pro to compute areas and certain distanced by using the program ’s measurement tools ; it is also used to visualize and manipulate GIS data and travel back in time using historical imagery .
General improvements are the high - resolution displays , better security and performance when making movies .
The Movie Maker tool has been updated for other new video formats .
A Web Inspector tool has also been added as a bonus for KML balloons ( an international standard file format used by the OGC ) .
The KML format allows users to display geographic data in apps .

Scientists have been measuring the frequency of solar flares
It shows that for the last 20 years , the Sun 's output has declined , yet temperatures on Earth have risen .
It also shows that modern temperatures are not determined by the Sun 's effect on cosmic rays , as has been claimed .
Writing in the Royal Society 's journal Proceedings A , the researchers say cosmic rays may have affected climate in the past , but not the present .
" This should settle the debate , " said Mike Lockwood , from the UK's Rutherford - Appleton Laboratory , who carried out the new analysis together with Claus Froehlich from the World Radiation Center in Switzerland .
This paper re-enforces the fact that the warming in the last 20 to 40 years can't have been caused by solar activity
Dr Piers Forster
" All the graphs they showed stopped in about 1980 , and I knew why , because things diverged after that , " he told the BBC News website .
" You ca n't just ignore bits of data that you do n't like , " he said .
Warming trend
The scientists ' main approach on this new analysis was simple : to look at solar output and cosmic ray intensity over the last 30 - 40 years , and compare those trends with the graph for global average surface temperature , which has risen by about 0.4C over the period .
Temperatures have continued rising irrespective of cosmic ray flux
But that cycle comes on top of longer - term trends ; and most of the 20th Century saw a slight but steady increase in solar output .
However , in about 1985 , that trend appears to have reversed , with solar output declining .
Yet this period has seen temperatures rise as fast as - if not faster than - any time during the previous 100 years .
" This paper reinforces the fact that the warming in the last 20 to 40 years can't have been caused by solar activity , " said Dr Piers Forster from Leeds University , a leading contributor to this year 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment of climate science .
Cosmic relief
The IPCC's February summary report concluded that greenhouse gases were about 13 times more responsible than solar changes for rising global temperatures .
But the organisation was criticised in some quarters for not taking into account the cosmic ray hypothesis , developed by , among others , Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis - Christensen of the Danish National Space Center .
FEELING THE HEAT
Three theories on how the Sun could be causing climate change
In graphics
Their theory holds that cosmic rays help clouds to form by providing tiny particles around which water vapour can condense .
Overall , clouds cool the Earth .
During periods of active solar activity , cosmic rays are partially blocked by the Sun 's more intense magnetic field .
Cloud formation diminishes , and the Earth warms .
Mike Lockwood 's analysis appears to have put a large , probably fatal nail in this intriguing and elegant hypothesis .
He said : " I do think there is a cosmic ray effect on cloud cover .
It works in clean maritime air where there is n't much else for water vapour to condense around .
" It might even have had a significant effect on pre-industrial climate ; but you cannot apply it to what we 're seeing now , because we 're in a completely different ball game . "
Drs Svensmark and Friis - Christensen could not be reached for comment .
Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2007 September 22
Explanation :
Is this what will become of the Earth 's surface ?
The surface of the Earth is broken up into several large plates that are slowly shifting .
About 250 million years ago , the plates on which the present - day continents rest were positioned quite differently , so that all the landmasses were clustered together in one supercontinent now dubbed Pangea .
About 250 million years from now , the plates are again projected to reposition themselves so that a single landmass dominates .
The above simulation from the PALEAOMAP Project shows this giant landmass : Pangea Ultima .
At that time , the Atlantic Ocean will be just a distant memory , and whatever beings inhabit Earth will be able to walk from North America to Africa .
Stephan Wessels has put up a very large tutorial showing the complete test driven development of a game in Squeak .
It covers quite a few things new Squeakers will want to know such as using SUnit to do test driven development , using Morphic to create Squeak widgets , using the debugger , and packaging the code with Monticello .
It 's a great tutorial and I 'm sure will become a popular resource .
However , despite the awesome effort ( which I do appreciate ) , I have some problems with it .
As with many other Squeak tutorials , it makes the mistake of using a standard Squeak image as you 'd find on Squeak.org .
This only helps further propagate the impression among newbies that Squeak is ugly , old fashioned , and lacking in all the features they expect from a more modern IDE .
What you see in the screenshots is not a Squeak I 'd use .
Plain black code , ugly fonts , no intellisense , no use of the Refactoring Browser , no Shout Workspace .
Most developers who use Squeak would have a plethora of extra tools and utilities installed that make developing a much nicer experience than what you see in this tutorial .
Do yourself a favor and start your Squeaking with a real developer 's image loaded with all the proper goodies like the SqueakDev image maintained by Damien Cassou .
Squeak.org still has n't figured out that its core audience should be developers , not children .
They do n't seem to realize the base image they distribute actually scares away more people than it encourages to join the community .
Though they do have a link to Damien 's SqueakDev image , they do n't encourage it like they do the base image , a mistake that leads new developers to open up Squeak for the first time , browser a tutorial or two , and toss it aside as a silly toy , never having seen the real power or beauty that is Smalltalk .
So all you developers out there using Squeak , please , stop showing people ugly images .
Marketing matters , looks matter , and that stuff scares people away .
Load up some decent fonts , setup the minimum required goodies like Shout , the Refactoring Browser , and ECompletion .
And if you are n't using these goodies , you should be , and you should n't be making tutorials without them because it gives people a false impression of what Squeak is .
Squeak is an awesome development environment that sadly does n't come out of the box that way , you have to start with the right box or learn to build your own .
Squeak.org could learn a lot about marketing Squeak by looking at how rubyonrails.org markets Rails .
If there 's one thing Ruby does vastly better than Smalltalk , it 's marketing .
Smalltalk continues to languish not because of technical merits , but because of bad marketing .
Beaten by Java , and now beaten by Ruby , by marketing alone .
The fighter jets allegedly caused sonic booms as they flew over the cities of Sidon and Tyre , as well as the towns of Bint Jbeil and Marjayoun .
Israel has so far made no comment on the Lebanese claims .
Israel has been criticised by the UN for making a number of overflights in Lebanon in recent weeks .
Israel says they are necessary to monitor activities by the Lebanon - based Hezbollah militants .
' Hezbollah stronghold '
Lebanese police said six Israeli aircraft violated Lebanon 's airspace at 0700 GMT , according to the AFP news agency .
Police said the jets swooped low over the port cities of Sidon and Tyre as well as the Bint Jbeil region , a Hezbollah stronghold .
Last August 's UN ceasefire followed a resolution by the world body that ended a 34 - day war between Israel and Hezbollah .
The array will be able to image large sections of the sky at once
Funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , the finished array will have 350 six - metre antennas and will be one of the world 's largest .
The Allen Telescope Array ( ATA ) will be able to sweep more than one million star systems for radio signals generated by intelligent beings .
Its creators hope it will help spot definite signs of alien life by 2025 .
First light
The ATA is being run by the Seti Institute and the Radio Astronomy Laboratory from the University of California , Berkeley , US
" For Seti , the ATA 's technical capabilities exponentially increase our ability to search for intelligent signals , and may lead to the discovery of thinking beings elsewhere in the Universe , " said Seth Shostak , senior astronomer at the Seti Institute in a statement .
On 11 October , the first 42 dishes of the array started gathering data that will be analysed for signs of alien life and help with conventional radio astronomy .
The first test images produced by the array are radio maps of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy .
Mr Allen provided the funding for the first stages of the array
Rather than being hand built , each six - metre antenna is made of a mass - produced dish and off - the - shelf components .
Behind the scenes , digital signal processing software is used to analyse data and clean out man-made interference that would otherwise make the captured information useless .
The layout of the array has also been carefully plotted so the instruments work in unison to take a single snapshot of huge swathes of the sky .
The ATA 's creators claim that even with only 42 antennas on - stream , the instrument already rivals larger instruments in its ability to carry out brightness , temperature and point source surveys .
When all 350 dishes are gathering data , the ATA 's creators say it will allow the gathering of data on an " unprecedented " scale .
The finished instrument will be able to study an area of the sky 17 times larger than that possible with the Very Large Array in New Mexico .
Mr Allen has provided Seti and Berkeley with a $ 25 m grant to fund the initial construction work on the instrument .
Other sponsors are being sought for the other $ 25 m needed to complete the project .
It is expected to help improve understanding of such phenomena as supernovas , black holes , and exotic astronomical objects that have been predicted but never observed .
The array is situated in Hat Creek , California , and lies about 290 miles ( 470 km ) north of San Francisco .

Cesc Fabregas celebrates his equaliser for Arsenal against Man Utd
Gallas turned Wayne Rooney 's half - hit effort into his own goal on the stroke of half time to give United the lead .
Cesc Fabregas ' cool finish put Arsenal level two minutes after the break , but Cristiano Ronaldo slid home Patrice Evra 's cross nine minutes from time .
But Gallas then scrambled in Gael Clichy 's cross to earn a point .
The Frenchman 's equaliser allowed Arsenal to set a new club record of 25 games unbeaten in all competitions .
The opening 45 minutes proved an anti-climax until Gallas diverted Rooney 's tame shot in on the stroke of half - time .
Arsenal had reasonable penalty claims ignored by referee Howard Webb after 15 minutes when Nemanja Vidic tugged Alexander Hleb 's shirt as they tangled in the area .
United had a good chance seconds later when Bacary Sagna failed to react to Ronaldo 's cross and Ryan Giggs , perhaps caught by surprise , could only turn a close - range effort wide .
Owen Hargreaves was outstanding in shielding United 's defence from Arsenal 's attacking threat , but he was powerless as the Gunners almost went ahead after 35 minutes .
Gallas escaped the attentions of the United rearguard to glance Fabregas ' free - kick against the legs of Edwin van der Sar .
606 : DEBATE I think Arsenal showed championship qualities today
Apollian
United 's Brazilian midfield man Anderson is clearly a talent , but he demonstrated an unsavoury side to his nature that predictably infuriated the crowd .
He flamboyantly demanded referee Webb show yellow cards to Arsenal players , then rolled in ridiculous fashion after a foul by Fabregas that earned the Spanish youngster a booking .
United staged a smash - and - grab in first - half stoppage time , Ronaldo crossing for Rooney , who failed to make a proper connection but saw Gallas provide a crucial deflection past Manuel Almunia .
The gauntlet was thrown down to Arsenal - but they picked it up to equalise two minutes after the restart .
Emmanuel Eboue played in Emmanuel Adebayor , who was blocked by Van der Sar , but Sagna crossed the loose ball for Fabregas to slide in a composed finish .
Arsenal had started to dominate possession , but it was United who had the next big chance after 63 minutes .
Giggs found Rooney in space in the area , but he headed wastefully wide when he should have at least worked keeper Almunia .
Both managers made changes in the final 15 minutes , Wenger sending on Theo Walcott for Eboue , while Ferguson replaced the subdued Carlos Tevez and Anderson with Louis Saha and Michael Carrick .
The changes worked better for United as they took a vital lead with nine minutes left .
Walcott failed to track Evra , and when Saha played him in he crossed perfectly for Ronaldo to score .
Evra then enjoyed a huge piece of luck when he sliced substitute Eduardo da Silva 's cross against his own bar with Van der Sar helpless .
Arsenal pressed forward and got the draw they deserved when Clichy 's cross sparked a goalmouth scramble which ended with a shot from Gallas which , even though Van der Sar clawed it out , had clearly crossed the line .
Arsenal : Almunia , Sagna , Toure , Gallas , Clichy , Eboue ( Walcott 74 ) , Fabregas , Flamini , Rosicky ( Eduardo 80 ) , Hleb ( Silva 80 ) , Adebayor .

* giggles and adjusts seating position *
Yours truly had a few too many glasses of wine which led to me being very relaxed , no VERY relaxed .
We spent some of the early evening playing a very naughty game which Alex will tell you all about later on A - Rouse.com . 😉
Then we decided to jump in to bed .
One thing led to another and we ended up with me on all fours and Alex pumping in to me .
I was turned on that I began to buck back against him until he was really hammering in to me .
My hair was hanging down in front of my face and I must have looked like a head banger for more than one reason . 😉
I came and then I came again , my pussy was so wet that Alex slipped out and I collected up some of my fluid and worked it around my anus which was pouting , slightly open .
My finger eased inside without any obstruction , my sphincter being relaxed and open .
Alex watched from behind as I moved my finger in and out of my ass .
Then I grabbed hold of him .
I wanted to feel him inside my ass so much that I took a firm hold of his hard cock and pushed him straight in to me .
FUCK !
That was ever so slightly painful .
I pushed him inside me right up to the hilt , his groin pressing against my buttocks .
He immediately knew what I had done and asked if I was OK .
Gently I withdrew my ass off his cock and said “ No not really ” .
Stupid me , too eager and ready to pleasure and I managed to hurt myself .
* Tutt , tutt *
This has taught me a valuable lesson about being careful no matter how horny you are .
Today my ass feels as if I have been using Fiery Jack on it .
Lol
And gym has been forgone due to the fact that the thought of having a bicycle seat anywhere near my ass this morning is frightening .
So beware , and lube , lube , lube !

MOSCOW --
A new manual for Russia 's history teachers succinctly distills President Vladimir Putin 's drive to rekindle patriotism , retelling events of the past six decades according to the Kremlin 's preferred storyline : Russia is a great power that should n't be ashamed of its past .
Backed by support from the president himself , the book , which rails against U.S. hegemony , is raising fears among some historians that the Kremlin is -- quite literally -- trying to rewrite history in a way that risks breeding ultranationalism and whitewashing the darkest chapters of Russia 's past .
Mr. Putin gave the manual a presidential boost last month , inviting its author along with a number of historians and teachers to his residence to talk history .
Though he said students should be allowed to draw their own conclusions , he made clear that events should be portrayed in a way that fuels national pride .
The manual 's publication comes as the Kremlin is trying to restore Russians ' sense of pride after the anarchic 1990s .
In recent years , celebrations marking the Red Army 's victory over Nazi Germany have been cranked up , the authority of the Czarist - era Orthodox Church has been boosted and patriotic youth groups have become increasingly vocal about Russia 's resurgence .
The moves have complemented an increasingly assertive Kremlin foreign policy and a flat rejection of Western criticism that Moscow is moving to undermine democratic institutions .
The new teachers ' manual is the clearest sign yet that the drive to inculcate the Kremlin 's view of the world is reaching Russia 's millions of schoolchildren .

( CNN ) --
Six years after the worst terror attacks on U.S. soil , three in 10 Americans believe the United States and its allies are winning the global war on terror -- one of the main justifications cited by the Bush administration for the war in Iraq .
An American flag hangs from the Pentagon on Tuesday , the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks .

According to a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted Friday to Sunday , about half of the 1,017 adult Americans questioned said they believe neither side is winning the war on terror , while 19 percent said the terrorists have the upper hand .
The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
A separate poll conducted August 6 to 8 found that 61 percent of the 1,029 adult Americans questioned said they were not satisfied with the way things were going in the war on terror , and 38 percent felt safer from terrorism than before the 9/11 attacks .
Thirty - two percent of the respondents said they felt less safe than before the attacks , and 29 percent felt as safe now as then .
The poll also had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Nearly 3,000 people were killed September 11 , 2001 , when hijacked planes slammed into the World Trade Center 's twin towers , the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania .
The attacks shocked a country that had largely felt insulated against terrorism , at least on its home turf .
Six years later , 57 percent of those questioned in the September poll believed terrorists would find a way to launch attacks no matter what the U.S. government did .
Forty percent said they would n't .
Watch how this year 's poll results compare to past years »
Nearly two - thirds of those questioned said the United States would never return to normal , while 30 percent said eventually , things would go back to the way they were .
Across the country Tuesday , various cities held ceremonies or moments of silence to mark what President Bush has called the day that changed America forever .
The president and first lady Laura Bush as well as Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife , Lynne , participated in a moment of silence on the White House South Lawn at 8:46 a.m. , the moment the first plane hit the World Trade Center 's north tower .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , FBI Director Robert Mueller , members of the House of Representatives and Senate , and other dignitaries also took part .
Most wore black or other dark colors under a sky of cloudy gray .

Earlier , the president attended a service at St. John 's Episcopal Church in Washington .
In New York , bells began ringing at St. Patrick 's Cathedral at 8:46 a.m. to honor victims of the attacks .
A slow parade of police , firefighters and members of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey marched to ground zero , the site of the fallen towers , accompanied by the droning of bagpipes .
The New York Fire Department lost 343 members , the New York Police Department 23 officers and the Port Authority 37 people in the attacks .
After a moment of silence , led by Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and the tolling of a bell , family members and friends began reading the names of the 2,603 victims who died at the World Trade Center .
Rain rippled the surface of a reflecting pool at the ground zero memorial , where people placed flowers along the edges .
The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence before the opening bell at 9:29 a.m .
At 9:38 a.m. , a ceremony was held at the Pentagon to mark the moment when a hijacked plane hit the building , killing 184 people .
In brief remarks before the wreath - laying ceremony , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the United States would stop at nothing to defend its citizens and values .
" Let there be no doubt that anyone wishing to revisit harm upon this country will find , in the men and women of this department , adversaries who have found clarity of purpose in their grief , a strength of resolve in their anger , " Gates said .
" The enemies of America , the enemies of our values and our liberty , will never again rest easy , for we will hunt them down relentlessly and without reservation . "
Near Shanksville , Pennsylvania , a steady rain fell as dozens participated in a memorial ceremony for the 40 passengers and crew aboard United Airlines Flight 93 , which crashed into a field after passengers attempted to wrest control of the aircraft from four hijackers .

YO LA TENGO
They chose the name " Yo La Tengo " ( Spanish for " I have it " ; or referring to a female - gender object or person , also " I 've Got Her " ) in an effort to avoid any connotations in English .
The name came from a baseball anecdote .
During the 1962 season , New York Mets center fielder Richie Ashburn and Venezuelan shortstop Elio Chacón found themselves colliding in the outfield .
When Ashburn went for a catch , he would scream , " I got it !
I got it ! " only to run into Chacón , who spoke only Spanish .
Ashburn learned to yell , " ¡Yo la tengo !
¡ Yo la tengo ! " instead .
DUBAI - Airbus scored first blood in its head - to - head battle with US rival Boeing at the world ’s third biggest air show Sunday , winning orders from Emirates worth more than 20 billion dollars .
Airbus executives said the order — for 70 midsized A350 XWB ( Extra Wide Body ) aircraft and 11 A380 Superjumbos — was the biggest in the European constructor ’s history .
Boeing won orders for 3.2 billion dollars from the world ’s fastest - growing airline , bringing Emirate ’s total outlay for new planes to over 23 billion dollars .
‘ Emirates airlines is placing great faith in our A350 XWB and A380 programmes as well as our company and we are rightfully proud , ’ said Tom Enders , Airbus president and CEO .
Emirate ’s chairman and chief executive , Shaikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum , made the announcement at a news conference at the opening of the Dubai air show .
The airline ordered three more A380s and firmed up an existing option on eight more , bringing its total order for the giant European airliner to 58 .
It also said it had an option to buy 50 more of the A350 XWBs .
‘ The A350 XWB and A380 ( superjumbo ) will play an important role in supporting Emirates ’ and Dubai ’s growth plans , ’ Maktoum said .
‘ As the leading airline for the 21st century , it made sense for Emirates to choose the A350 XWB — an aircraft designed with 21st century technologies , ’ he said .
Asked about his company ’s preference for the A350 over the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner , he said : ‘ We looked at the two planes , their seating , their capacities ...
I ’m not saying that Emirates will never look at other planes .
We always have the option of looking elsewhere . ’
The airline announced it had ordered 12 Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft at a cost of 3.2 billion dollars .
‘ Emirates will soon be the largest operator of 777s worldwide , ’ Scott Carson , Boeing executive vice president , told reporters .
When asked why Emirates chose the Airbus A350 over his firm ’s Dreamliner , Carson replied : ‘ We did not have the airplane that they wanted at this time . ’
Rolls Royce , which supplies the engines for the A350s , will reap downstream benefits of 8.4 billion dollars should all the options be exercised .
The first of the A350s will be delivered to Emirates in 2014 .
Another European planemaker ATR announced an order for 10 72-500 regional transport aircraft worth 183 million dollars from Malaysian company Maswings .
ATR said it had received orders for a total of 88 planes since the beginning of this year .
‘ It ’s the best year since 2005 , when we took orders for 90 planes , ’ said the company ’s chief Stephane Mayer .
His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Vice - President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai , opened the show , which is hosting 850 exhibitors from 50 countries , a 40 percent increase from when the two - yearly event was last staged in 2005 .
More than 140 aircraft are on display at the five - day exhibition in the emirate .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices shot to an all - time high above $ 92 a barrel on Friday as the tumbling dollar and Nigerian output disruptions helped extend a rally that has lifted prices nearly 30 percent since August .
Worries that supplies may come up short ahead of the Northern Hemisphere winter have fueled the rise , drawing a fresh wave of speculative money from investors .
U.S. crude settled up $ 1.40 at $ 91.86 a barrel , off the record $ 92.22 struck during electronic trading earlier .
Oil was closing in on its inflation - adjusted high of $ 101.70 seen over the course of April 1980 , a year after the Iranian revolution and at the start of the Iran - Iraq war .
London Brent gained $ 1.21 to $ 88.69 a barrel .
“ Fresh highs are now attracting fresh buying , especially following yesterday ’s violation of the futures highs just above the $ 90 level , ” said Jim Ritterbusch , president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena , Illinois .
Prices jumped past $ 90 a barrel after a U.S. government report on Wednesday showed a sharp drop in crude stocks in the world ’s biggest energy consumer .
Oil got a boost on Friday after a rebel attack on a oil rig in OPEC - member Nigeria operated by Italian firm ENI shut 50,000 barrels per day of production .
Traders were also eyeing new U.S. sanctions against Iran , the No. 4 oil exporter , which is at odds with the U.N. Security Council over its nuclear program .
Washington accuses Tehran ’s Revolutionary Guard of spreading weapons of mass destruction .
TUMBLING DOLLAR
Unprecedented weakness in the U.S. dollar has been another factor supporting dollar - denominated commodities .
In anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may cut interest rates next week , the dollar hit record lows against the euro and a basket of currencies Friday .
Moves by central banks to cut interest rates and pump billions of dollars into financial markets to ease a credit crunch have added fuel to oil ’s rally .

Oil ’s drive to record highs has stirred concern from consumer governments , and the administration of President George W. Bush said Friday oil prices were “ way too high . ”
But U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said the nation ’s strategic oil stockpiles would not be used to reign in prices .
Analysts say the wider economic problems may be dragging down demand in the giant U.S. market , while there are some signs of a growth slowdown in China , the world ’s second largest consumer .
China ’s apparent oil demand grew at the slowest rate in 20 months in September , up just 0.3 percent from a year earlier .
Despite worries from big oil importers , members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have said they are unlikely to hike production at a meeting next month in Saudi Arabia .
The cartel has agreed to increase output by 500,000 barrels per day starting November 1 , and members insist prices are not being driven by a supply shortfall .
Data from Lloyd ’s Marine Intelligence
Unit showed OPEC ’s oil exports , excluding Angola , jumped 1 million bpd in the first two weeks of October versus the last two weeks of September .
Microsoft founder Bill Gates looks to have lost his title as the world 's richest man , toppled from top spot by the Mexican telecoms tycoon Carlos Slim .
Three months ago the cigar - chomping Mr Slim quietly slipped past legendary US investor Warren Buffett to take second place in the global wealth league .
Now , thanks to a surge in the shares of his America Movil group , Mr Slim has claimed pole position , according to the Mexican online financial publication , Sentido Común .
It was Sentido Común 's founder , Eduardo Garcia , who highlighted Mr Slim 's rapidly rising wealth in April , although by his calculations the Mexican had not only beaten Mr Buffett in the wealth stakes by then but also edged past Mr Gates .
Now , however , Mr Garcia says there is no doubt that the little - known Mexican has finally captured the coveted top slot , following a surge in America Movil 's shares over the second quarter .
This is estimated to have boosted his fortune to an estimated $ 67.8 bn ( £ 33.6 bn ) - equivalent to 8 % of Mexico 's gross domestic product - compared with $ 59.2bn for the Microsoft mogul , putting him in the lead by a decisive $ 8.6bn .
" When I put Slim ahead three months ago Forbes bumped him up to second place ( in world rankings ) a few days later , " Mr Garcia told Reuters .
" Let 's see if the same happens again . "
Shares in Mr Slim 's mobile phone empire surged by 27 % over the second quarter , compared with a 5.7 % rise for Microsoft .
Mr Slim 's bank , Inbursa , also saw its stock jump by 20 % .
Mr Gates has headed the Forbes list of the world 's wealthiest for more than a decade .
But , like Mr Buffett , he is rapidly becoming as well known for giving his money away as he is for accumulating it .
Both he and the " Sage of Omaha " have promised to give most of their money to charitable causes .
Less than half way into the debate on MSNBC tonight , front runner Hillary is showing her Neocon credentials .
She refuses to commit to removing all troops from Iraq by the end of her first term , if elected president .
She also defended the recent Israeli attack on Syria .
Then arrogantly ( just like Bush did during his recent press conference ) refused to answer the question on whether Israel should be free to attack Iran .
Hillary tonight is showing she would be different when it comes to Iraq , Iran , and the Middle East .
She would a pawn of the neocons and the Israeli lobby .
To be fair , none of the other major candidates refused to answer the question on Israel .
They are all afraid of the powerful " Lobby .
" Update , 10:15 pm : Now Hillary totally refused to answer another question .
This time on whether she would raise the salary cap on the social security tax .
She gave and kept repeating a generalized , vacuous statement on " fiscal responsibility . "
Tim Russert made several efforts to get an answer on the question .
She just keeps repeating the same phrase : " fiscal responsibility . "
It 's incredible how stubornly she insists on " not negotiating " what she would do .
What does that mean ?
She is stuck on stupid .
Apparently she can't get past her talking points , which makes her sound like a robot with a fuse malfunction .
Obama , for the record , answered the question .
Does it matter , though ?
Final analysis : Chris
Matthews is beside himself with contempt for Hillary 's flip - flops tonight .
On her final question of the evening , Hillary gave a typical Clintonian response .
Billary was asked who she would cheer if the Chicago Cubs and New York Yankees made the World Series ( she is a fan of both teams since she grew up in Illinois and obviously represents NY State in the Senate ) .
Hillary 's response was that she would take turns cheering for both teams .
For the first time Hillary did not win a debate .
Some analysts ( after the debate ) kept saying that she was acting as if she had already been elected president .
They also agreed that Obama did not do what he had to make up ground .
I agree .
He is too much of a gentleman .
Ms. Clinton is obviously trying to play safe .
It might just be the opening the other candidates need .
At least one analysts thinks Edwards might have made inroads tonight .
Chris Matthews agrees .
New Jersey ( TGW ) – New Jersey could become the first state to ban plastics bags , under a measure introduced into the New Jersey state Assembly .
The bill would force supermarkets and other stores with more than 10,000 square feet of space to ban plastic bags .
" Plastic bags may be cheap and convenient , but they have costly long - term environmental consequences that just can't be ignored , " Assemblyman Herb Conaway , a sponsor of the measure .
" We need to get these bags out of the waste stream because they are polluting our soil and our water . "
San Francisco became the first city last year to ban plastic bags , and New York is considering similar measures .
Many countries have also banned plastic bags , because of environmental concerns .

This WGA strike sucks , to be sure .
If it goes on for more than three months ( which is looking increasingly likely ) , pilot season wo n't happen , no new shows will be created , no new seasons will come back , and we 'll be stuck with the dregs of reality TV for a full year .
Yep , that means no last season of Battlestar Galactica , no new season of Lost , and no new episodes of The Office .
It 's no small thing , and not just because you 'll be inconvenienced by marathons of Overweight Celebrity Chili Cook - Off Island or whatever the networks will throw up when they run out of new programming .
TV is not disappearing anytime soon , but clearly , it 's going to be replaced by either the internet or some TV / internet hybrid .
Like the music industry , the TV industry realizes that their tried - and - true business model is about to be useless , and it 's lashing out in panic .
Unlike the music industry , who stupidly attacked its fans , the TV industry is attacking its own creative source : writers .
But the WGA would n't be striking if this was n't important .
We talked to both sides to get at the root of the trouble .

Eric Appel , who 's written for Crank Yankers and The Andy Milonakis Show and consulted for MTVs Human Giant , told me :
" New media is where television is going .
In a few years cable is just gonna be the internet .
And unlike TiVo where you can skip the advertisements , in [ new , network - run ] streaming players you 're forced to sit through the ads .
The networks are making money on that , and the studios do n't want to give writers any of it . "

Imagine if the recording industry decided that the internet was merely a way to promote CDs and that no songs sold online counted when paying musicians .
Their argument would be that people were just checking out those songs and might go buy the CD later , at which point the artist would get paid .
This is essentially the argument the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ( AMPTP ) is making .
Here 's what a spokesperson told me :
" New media has proven to be an effective and cost - effective promotional and marketing tool for both films and television but there is not enough marketplace data to judge its true potential , ultimate impact on traditional media or viability as a business . "
Basically , they claim they do n't make any money off the internet so there 's nothing to share with the writers , and since " each new month brings new ways to produce , distribute and consume media and entertainment " they do n't want to agree to give writers any new media residuals .
As it stands , writers get a small percentage of revenue if a show is successful and reruns often , which is why Jerry Seinfeld drives a gold - plated flying car between his mansions in the Hamptons and Dubai .
At the moment , they are n't paid any residuals for new media distribution , despite the fact that online content delivery is the future .

The problem with this logic is that if new media really did n't bring in any money , there would n't be a problem .
The writers are asking for a percentage of profits from new media - a percentage of nothing is nothing , after all .
So what this battle basically boils down to is the producers trying to move away from a residuals system , one in which writers are paid once for their work and get nothing for creating huge hits .
It 'll make them a whole lot more money and writers a whole lot less .
And it 's not just the livelihood of writers at stake ; this same issue is going to come up with actors and directors as well in the near future .
It 's a battle for how business will be done in TV's new age , and one that will affect the entertainment that all of us consume for the foreseeable future .
Welcome to No Marriage !
Being a man in this world can prove to be difficult when faced with the numerous complications that women often practice .
Some people have the natural ability to physically attract the opposite sex and be in total control , while others are left in the dark .
And a link .
Being observant of how women act in the presence of the public and yourself could give you the upper hand , or not .
So , to avoid even the slightest bit of oppression , it is absolutely necessary to learn and recognize every last trick in existence .
As long as you realize that she is doing that then you will always hold the upper hand .
A NEW YOU will awaken here !
The UN says Iran is using the Natanz facility for enrichment
Mr Ahmadinejad said Iran would continue its drive in spite of UN sanctions .
Enriched uranium can be used for power stations but also for nuclear bombs .
The West has accused Iran of trying to develop weapons - a charge Iran denies .
A BBC correspondent says there is some scepticism about Iran 's claim , with the UN believing it is short of the 3,000 .
IAEA plan
" We have more than 3,000 centrifuges working and every week a new set is installed , " Mr Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by Iranian news agencies .
" [ The world powers ] were thinking that with each resolution the Iranian nation would retreat .
But after each resolution the Iranian nation presented another nuclear achievement . "
TIMELINE : IRAN ENRICHMENT
2003 : Enrichment programme that had been hidden for 18 years is uncovered by IAEA Feb 2006 : Iran reported to Security Council 5 Feb 2007 : Diplomats confirm Iranian claims to have set up more than 300 centrifuges in two cascades 9 April : Iran claims to be enriching uranium on an " industrial scale " .
IAEA and Russian officials are sceptical 19 April : IAEA document confirms that Iran running more than 1,300 centrifuges in eight cascades 2 September : Iran claims to have 3,000 centrifuges running
Q&A : Iran nuclear issue Iran ' flexing muscles '
The installation of 3,000 centrifuges is seen by Iran as a key medium - term goal - which it had hoped to reach by March this year - for its nuclear programme .
There has been no independent verification of Iran 's claim .
The UN has already imposed two sets of sanctions and the US is leading the call for a third set if Iran 's uranium enrichment does not halt .
Only last week the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said it had agreed a plan with Iran to clear up key questions about its past nuclear activities , calling it a " significant step forward " .
The IAEA has said 3,000 centrifuges would represent a point of no-return for an industrial - scale production of enriched uranium .
But it also suggested last week that Iran had 1,968 operational centrifuges - significantly short of the breakthrough President Ahmadinejad has now announced .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says on the one hand Iran seems to be trying to defuse the situation in talks but , on the other , the president is saying Tehran has now mastered uranium enrichment and the issue should be set aside .
The US and UN are not going to accept that , our correspondent says .
A number of Western diplomats have criticised the IAEA 's plan , accusing Iran of trying to delay the imposition of further UN sanctions while increasing its nuclear capabilities .
US President George W Bush also recently stepped up the pressure with a new warning that Iran 's nuclear programme put the region under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust .
Key meetings of the UN and IAEA on the Iranian issue are scheduled over the coming weeks .
A recent International Institute for Strategic Studies report said if Iran could operate 3,000 centrifuges smoothly , one bomb could be produced within nine to 11 months .
The pollsters are n't asking about them :
My New Hampshire phone rings ( caller ID 000-000-0000 WTF ?) and I pick it up out of curiosity .
" This is ( talking like a magpie so I have n't got a clue what the name of the company is ) Research .
Would you like to be part of a poll for the Democratic presidential primary candidate ? "
I agree and the woman rapidly reads the list of candidates .
" Clinton , Obama , Edwards , Dodd , Biden and Richardson . "
I say , " Kucinich . "
The woman on the phone says " Who ? " I say , " Kucinich .
Dennis Kucinich . "
I hear coaching in the background - apparently the call is being monitored .
" I 'm sorry , but Dennis Kucinich is not on our list .
Is there anyone on the list I gave you who you would vote for ? "
So there you have it .
Kucinich is down in the polls because he is n't included in the polls . . . and you can forget about Gravel , too .
From market curmudgeon Bill King , who tells it like it is :
" Ironically , or rather idiotically , traders poured into stocks on Blankfein ’s assertion that Goldie is doing well because Goldie is short mortgage - backed securities and CDOs .
Blankfein believes the financial situation will worsen : “ ... many institutions do n’t understand what the credit crunch is going to do to earnings and their balance sheets . ”
So what we have is a huge rally because Goldie will profit from the US economy and financial system going to hell .
And people pay fortunes to go to Ivy League schools and B - schools to learn how to play the new economy !?!?!
Apparently a critical mass of traders believes that not only what is good for Goldman is good for America but as long as Goldman profits everything else is immaterial ...
Wal - Mart admits that customer visits declined in Q3 ; but food sales increased 5.3 % and pharmacy sales jumped 7.9 % .
Thank God for food & drug inflation that is not recorded in official inflation !
Recession , inflation , dollar collapse , financial system implosion – no problemo , Goldie is making money so pour into stocks !
And let ’s be merry and jiggy now because Wal - Mart is booking Christmas sales weeks before Thanksgiving and food inflation is virulent enough to significantly boost revenue ! "
Lately we ’ve been talking about a lot of great new features in the latest development trunk of WebKit – features like web fonts , client - side database storage , CSS transforms and CSS animation .
These features will likely make it to an official release someday .
But I ’d like to take a step back and talk about some older features , namely all the great stuff in our recent stable release .
Apple recently released Mac OS X 10.5 “ Leopard ” , including Safari 3 .
The latest Safari is also included in Mac OS X 10.4.11 , the latest update to Tiger .
A corresponding version is available as the latest Safari for Windows Beta , including the new features and lots of stability and usability improvements .
Apple ’s site can tell you a lot about the new end - user features of Safari 3 .
But a lot of the goodness is on the inside , in the WebKit engine that powers Safari .
Here ’s a list of ten of the most exciting engine enhancements since the Safari 2 version of WebKit , with lots of details and demos .
These features are all included in the WebKit that comes with Safari 3 – you do n’t have to download nightlies or anything else to get them .
1. Enhanced Rich Text Editing
As you browse the web with a WebKit 3 based browser , you will get a complete and functional rich text editing experience on the new read - write web .
Here ’s a sweet demo of our improved editing support , just click the text and editing controls appear .
Specifically , we have worked together with developers of RTE libraries and applications to improve compatibility .
WebKit 3 fixes many bugs , and supports additional text editing features like links and lists .
We now have support from web applications like WordPress , Google Docs , GMail , Blogger , and many more .
We ’ve also improved editing to support libraries like TinyMCE and FCKeditor .
We expect even more web apps and toolkits to add support over time .
2. Faster JavaScript and DOM
We have greatly improved the speed of JavaScript and DOM operations , both critical to the performance of today ’s rich web applications .
You can see this on a number of benchmarks .
To gather the results below , I tested on a MacBook Pro ( 2 GHz Core Duo , 1 GB RAM ) .
For the WebKit 2 results , I used Safari 2.0.4 on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger .
For the WebKit 3 results , I used Safari 3.0.4 on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard .
i-Bench JavaScript Processing –
The primary benchmark that Apple marketing has used is the JavaScript i-Bench .
While you can download it yourself , it ’s a bit of a pain to set up .
Most of the other benchmarks listed below are easier to run yourself , but are not as realistic and comprehensive in their coverage .
WebKit 2 – 1.99 sec
WebKit 3 – 0.87 sec
WebKit 3 is 2.3 times as fast !
– The primary benchmark that Apple marketing has used is the JavaScript i-Bench .
While you can download it yourself , it ’s a bit of a pain to set up .
Most of the other benchmarks listed below are easier to run yourself , but are not as realistic and comprehensive in their coverage .
1.99 sec 0.87 sec WebKit 3 is Celtic Kane Javascript Speed Test 2007 –
This popular benchmark is easy to try in the browser and covers a variety of JavaScript and DOM processing tasks .
WebKit 2 – 1276 ms
WebKit 3 – 624 ms
WebKit 3 is 2 times as fast !
– This popular benchmark is easy to try in the browser and covers a variety of JavaScript and DOM processing tasks .
1276 ms 624 ms WebKit 3 is pentestmonkey MD5 test – This test times various cryptographic checksums coded in pure JavaScript .
Run it here ..
I ’m reporting only the MD5 numbers – the other changes are similar .
WebKit 2 – 8.352 sec
WebKit 3 – 3.794 sec
WebKit 3 is 2.2 times as fast !
– This test times various cryptographic checksums coded in pure JavaScript .
Run it here ..
I ’m reporting only the MD5 numbers – the other changes are similar .
8.352 sec 3.794 sec WebKit 3 is JavaScript Raytracer –
The full mode of this JavaScript Ray Tracer is a test of many parts of the browser including JavaScript , DOM and layout .
WebKit 2 – 853.594 sec
WebKit 3 – 48.48 sec
WebKit 3 is 17.6 times as fast !
If you try other JavaScript and DOM benchmarks on the web , you ’ll see similar results – speedups of 2 x or more .
These are speedups you will really feel on advanced web applications .
3. Faster Page Loading
WebKit 3 also offers significantly improved raw page loading speed .
Unfortunately it ’s hard to find good benchmarks in this area .
The best we know of is the HTML i-Bench which is a pain for the casual user to set up , but which is based on real web content .
Some have argued that page loading benchmarks are unfair because browsers dispatch the load before painting , and Safari will sometimes even do it before the first layout .
But the HTML i-Bench is one of the few tests to factor this out – it forces a layout and scrolls to ensure a paint .
Here ’s the numbers :
WebKit 2 – 2.95 sec
WebKit 3 – 2.06 sec
WebKit 3 is 1.4 times as fast !
In addition , independent researchers confirm that Safari 3 ’s page loading is really fast .
4. SVG
WebKit 3 features a major new technology – SVG ( Scalable Vector Graphics ) .
SVG is an XML markup language for graphics that allows rich interaction and which can be mixed directly with XHTML .
Here ’s some whizzy demos :
We have n’t profiled and optimized SVG quite as much as the rest of the engine , but early tests seem to indicate that it already has blazing performance .
Look for this exciting new technology to see even more use on the web over time , now that it is supported by WebKit , the Gecko engine inside Firefox , and the Presto engine inside Opera .
5. XPath
Another major brand new technology in WebKit 3 is XPath , the XML Path Language .
XPath is a W3C standard query language that lets web developers efficiently find particular elements in the document .
Since XPath is a programming language , it ’s hard to show a pretty demo , but this tutorial goes in depth and has a few examples .
XPath is used in AJAX toolkits like TIBCO General Interface , and can be used by CSS query engines for improved performance , as in dojo.query .
6. New and Improved XML Technologies
In addition to the big new features of XPath and XVG , we have lots of new and improved XML technologies :
The XSLTProcessor JavaScript API for XSLT , and many XSLT fixes and improvements including support for external entities .
The DOMParser API .
The XMLSerializer API .
Incremental rendering support for XML .
Proper support for named character references in XHTML .
Much more complete and compatible XMLHttpRequest , including support for event listeners , incremental updates for persistent server connections , parsing of more XML MIME types , support for more HTTP methods .
7. Styleable Form Controls
WebKit 3 introduces the ability to customize the look of form controls with CSS .
We still use standard looking native form when no custom styles are applied , but we have the ability to customize the look to better support sites with a strong visual identity .
Here ’s a few simple examples :
Select with custom colors ( one ) Select with custom colors ( two ) Select with custom colors ( three )
Button with bold text
Here ’s some older , more advanced examples for styleable text fields .
On other sites , you can find demo pages for styling all sorts of form controls .
8. Advanced CSS Styling
We have added many advanced CSS features that let content authors make better - looking sites with less effort .
These include experimental WebKit features or early implementations of CSS3 .
Here ’s a quick demo of some of them ( you ’ll only see the fancy stuff with a WebKit 3 based browser ) :
Text - stroke and text - shadow WebKit supports multiple columns .
This is a test of multiple columns , so it should really lay out in two columns .
Multi-column layout is a CSS3 module .
And hey , as an added bonus , why not use text - stroke / fill ( WebKit extensions ) and text - shadow ?
Those make for a nice fancy heading .
And while we ’re at it , there ’s also border - radius and box - shadow for box decorations .
In addition to the features shown here , many more CSS 2.1 , CSS 3 , and WebKit experimental features are included .
We support CSS Media queries , and lots of background improvements like background - origin and background - clip , multiple backgrounds ( since Safari 2 , but still only supported by WebKit ) , box - sizing and more .
Another cool new feature is border - image , which lets you make resizable control backgrounds using a single image – there ’s some demos in this sample code for the iPhone in the buttons section .
See this Safari CSS reference document for a complete list .
9. Reduced Memory Use
The latest stable WebKit has enabled significantly reduced memory use , compared to the Safari 2 version .
We have made many kinds of improvements .
Pages containing large amounts of text are stored more efficiently .
JavaScript code generates smaller data structures .
And most significant of all , we ’ve revamped the way we handle the memory cache .
The cache is now much better at holding the data that ’s truly critical for faster page loading , but less of the data that can easily be recomputed , like decoded image data .
Memory use is something that is notoriously hard to measure .
The browser has many caches , and many sites on the live web server .
The best way I could find to measure repeatably was by looking at memory use after running through the HTML i-Bench , but your results on other sites may vary .
Here is what I saw :
WebKit 2 – 26.7M RPRVT memory
WebKit 3 – 23M RPRVT memory
WebKit 3 uses 14 % less memory !
Improving memory use will remain an important focus for future releases .
10 . Web Developer Tools
One of the best WebKit improvements is the availability of Web Developer tools , the Web Inspector and the Drosera JavaScript debugger .
I ca n’t really describe these better than the original blog posts , so here ’s some screenshots and links to the original posts :
Web Inspector :
Drosera :
Conclusion
So that ’s it , ten huge new features in WebKit 3 .
Grab Mac OS X Leopard , the 10.4.11 update to Mac OS X Tiger , Safari 3.0.4 Beta for Windows , or your favorite other WebKit - based browser to check them out for yourself , along with thousands of smaller features and bug fixes .
Kids will cheat on tests .
Anyone involved in education knows that , as do most people who are not .
Sometimes , when there is an incentive to do so , teachers will even help their students to cheat on tests .
That incentive could be financial , or prestige ( or a lack of it ) .
This makes anything that depends upon standardized tests suspect … unless you can make those tests impossible to cheat .
Human ingenuity being what it is , that may not truly be possible … but you can make it incredibly difficult for them to do so .
In my previous article on education I wrote a tiny bit about it , but I thought it was worth a more in - depth look .
If you want to change the world , you have to change the schools .
The first topic toward that goal that I ’m going to cover is how to make it impossible to cheat on tests :
Writing The Tests
The first part of making tests that are nearly impossible to cheat is to move the writing of the tests a step back from people with a direct association with the person taking the test .
That has the added benefit of keeping teachers from giving extraordinarily easy or difficult tests for the same class .
So how do you do this ?
You create groups , maybe at the district level , but probably at the state level , of people with knowledge in the field to be tested .
These groups are likely to be mostly , if not all , people trained in education … either people who have been teaching for quite a while , or at least people with a degree in education , with a minor in whatever field .
You then have these groups write far more questions than will show up on the test .
For a test that is 20 questions , for example , you should have at least 100 questions .
Depending on the material , this could end up with similar questions , just written differently ( subjects like history might require this ) , or it could be a lot of truly different questions ( math , for example ) .
These questions would be entered into a computer , along with the right answer , if there is one ( English questions may have more than one right answer , for example ) .
This provides a master list of questions for the test .
Administering The Tests
When it comes time to administer the tests , the students would sit down at a computer , which would be connected to the central database ( or a local copy ) that contains all the questions .
These computers would be essentially dumb terminals , only able to run the program that administers the tests , to prevent hacking and / or accessing the internet to try to use Google to find the answers .
Each student would get 20 questions selected randomly from the 100 total available ( from the example above ) .
That makes it nearly impossible to have a cheat sheet small enough to hide … because you would have to have the whole question AND answer written down .
It also makes one a lot harder to create , since you can only put down the answers to the questions you received , though of course people would get together to compile larger lists when possible … it still increases the effort required considerably .
Having the test administered by a computer also makes it considerably easier to detect patterns of cheating .
If , at one school , students get average scores until after one particular student ( or group of students ) takes a test , that could easily indicate cheating .
If one teacher ’s class always gets the same questions right and wrong , that might also be a sign of cheating … or an indication of what areas they need to teach better , thus improving education as a side effect of trying to detect cheating .
Grading The Tests
All of the answers to the questions would also , obviously , be entered into the computer .
These answers could then be graded by someone who is not connected in any way to the student , quite possibly without even having any idea who the student is ( ie only having an id number for the test they ’re grading , not knowing whose test it is ) .
Having someone not connected grading the tests removes any possibility of the grade being affected by the teacher liking , disliking , or even feeling sorry for a student .
It limits it to only grading answers to questions , with no social aspect involved .
The plan outlined above removes any chance for a teacher to let people slide through , or grade them extra harshly to make them fail .
It also makes it easy to tell a teacher what area of their subject they may be neglecting , based on students missing more questions than normal in that area .
This is not to say , however , that all , or even the majority of teachers do these things … and many of those who do may do so subconsciously , not intentionally .
A lot of teachers get into it because they have a passion for teaching , and the thought doing those things is repulsive .
Even acknowledging this , though , it ca n’t hurt to remove the ability and the temptation to do so .
Freeing teachers from having to write and grade tests also gives them the ability to focus more on the actual teaching … not to mention increasing their free time considerably .
They would still be able to easily see the resullts of their students , so they could know if someone needed extra help , or if they had n’t covered an area well enough .
And in the mean time , people trained in analysis could look at the numbers , and quite possibly come up with solutions to various problems by looking at how different variables cause scores to rise or fall , things such as teacher experience , school policies , and possibly even from which school the teacher got their degree , not to mention standard things like student demographics ( age , ethnicity , gender , etc. ) .
So … comments are welcome .
I ’d like this to serve as a starting point for discussion on how effective you , the readers , think this would be , and any improvements you could suggest .
Depending on the number and quality of suggestions , I will either update this post with the best suggestions , or write a follow - up …
If you leave a website , and I use your suggestion , I will link to it .
Otherwise , I will just use your name you leave in the comments .
Forensic mathematics of DNA matching
Charles H. Brenner , Ph.D.1
A typical DNA case involves the comparison of two samples  an unknown or evidence sample , such as semen from a rape , and a known or reference sample , such as a blood sample from a suspect .
If the DNA profile obtained from the two samples are indistinguishable ( they " match " ) , that of course is evidence for the court that the samples have a common source  in this case , that the suspect contributed the semen .
How strong is the evidence ?
If the DNA profile consists of a combination of traits that figure to be extremely rare , the evidence is very strong that the suspect is the contributor .
To the extent that the DNA profile is not so rare , it is easier to imagine that the suspect might be unrelated to the crime and that he matches only by chance .
DNA profile probability
DNA Profile Allele frequency from database Genotype frequency for locus Locus Alleles times allele observed size of database Frequency formula number CSF1PO 10 109 432 p= 0.25 2 pq 0.16 11 134 q= 0.31 TPOX 8 229 432 p= 0.53 p2 0.28 8 THO1 6 102 428 p= 0.24 2 pq 0.07 7 64 q= 0.15 vWA 16 91 428 p= 0.21 p2 0.05 16 profile frequency= 0.00014
The allele 10 at the locus CSF1PO was observed 109 times in a population sample of 432 alleles ( 216 people ) .
Therefore it is reasonable to estimate that there is a chance p=0.25 that any particular CSF1PO allele , selected at random , would be a 10 .
Similarly , the chance is about q=0.31 for a random CSP1PO allele to be 11 .
Prior to typing the suspect , if we assume that he is not the donor of the evidence then we can think of him as someone who received a CSF1PO allele at random from each of his parents .
The chance to receive 10 from his mother and 11 from his father is therefore pq , and to receive 11 from mother and 10 from father is another pq , so the probability to be 10,11 by chance is 2 pq .
Hence about 16 % of people have the 10,11 genotype at the CSF1PO locus .
At the TPOX locus , since both alleles are the same there is only one term  pp or p2 , which represents the combined probability of inheriting the allele 8 from each parent .
Hence about 28 % of people have the same TPOX genotype as does the evidence .
It is to be expected that the proportion of TPOX 8,8 people is still 28 % even if attention is restricted only to people who have a particular CSF1PO genotype such as 10,11 .
Therefore the chance for a person to have the combined genotype in the two loci is 28 % of 16 %  about 4 % .
The calculations for the THO1 and vWA loci are similar , and taking them into account whittles the overall chance for a random person to have the combined genotype from 4 % down to about 1/7000 .
product rule
The profile frequency is sometimes referred to as the random match probability , or the chance of a random match .
verbal explanation
either the suspect contributed the evidence , or an unlikely coincidence happened  the once - in - 7000 coincidence that an unrelated person would by chance have the same DNA profile as that obtained from the evidence .
A shorter summary is " common source , or unlikely coincidence . "
Fallacies
" Prosecutor 's fallacy "
correct statement vs. prosecutor 's fallacy Correct statement Prosecutor 's fallacy
The chance is 1/7000 that some ( particular ) person other than the suspect would leave a stain like the actual stain .
The chance is 1/7000 that someone ( anyone ) other than the suspect left the stain .
are obviously different when shown side - by - side , but there is some similarity .
For example , both statments might carelessly be paraphrased by the ambiguous statement
The chance is 1/7000 for someone other than the suspect to produce the observed evidence .
Maybe this is how the " prosecutor 's fallacy " got started .
It seems logical therefore that DNA evidence alone cannot be a proof  some additional information is necessary .
However , the amount of additional information that is necessary might be a very small amount .
For example , add to the DNA matching evidence ( of 7000 to one ) the mere knowledge that the suspect was arrested before his DNA type was known , and you have something like a proof .
" Defense attorney 's fallacy "
Laboratory error
Besides " common source " , and " unlikely coincidence " , a third possible explanation for a match between suspect and evidence is error .
The chance of an error that would cause a spurious match  mishandling the evidence , PCR contamination  although unquantifiable , is probably very small .
Nonetheless , it seems likely that the chance of error is often much larger than the extremely small random match chances ( such as 1 in 108 ) that occur , so it may be more realistic and more fair in such cases to say " same source , or ( unlikely ) error " rather than to say " same source , or unlikely coincidence . "
Microvariants
Sometimes the defense points out that there are sequence variations in most alleles , so the suspect 's allele 10 and the evidence allele 10 , which were reported by the analyst as matching , may in reality be different .
That 's true , but irrelevant since the difference is undetectable to the analysis methods used .
The analysis and statistics are consistent in treating " match " merely to mean " same category , " so the statistical conclusion of " either common source , or once - in - 7000 coincidence " is still correct .
Limitations
The method of calculation described above makes several assumptions , and in some cases some of those assumptions may be false so it is important to be aware of them .
There is a more thorough discussion of all these issues in " The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence " .
relatives
The analysis above assumes that if suspect is not the donor , he is unrelated to the donor .
But common sense shows immediately that if the suspect can make a case that a relative of his , especially his brother , is the donor , then that goes a long way towards explaining away the coincidental similarity between the suspect and the evidence .
The defense always needs to be aware of this possibility .
There are other computations that can be made to deal with situations where relatives of the suspect ( even distant relatives ) may be worth considering .
heterogeneous population
The application of the product rule presumes that the relevant loci and population be in Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium .
These population genetic concepts have been found to hold to a reasonable degree of accuracy for major populations and typical forensically used loci .
For mixed populations and inbred populations the product rule is not as accurate .
To the extent that the product rule is inaccurate , the error usually works against suspect , unfairly exaggerating the strength of the evidence .
Omitted topics
It is beyond the ambition of this section to discuss computations for DNA identification when the evidence consists of a mixture ( " Interpreting DNA mixtures " ) from several people , or how to analyze when the suspect is found through a database search , or how to analyze relationship cases including paternity and missing bodies .
When I was visiting my daughter at her college , she asked me about a terrifying story that ran in this newspaper on Oct. 2 , reporting that the Arctic ice cap was melting “ to an extent unparalleled in a century or more ” — and that the entire Arctic system appears to be “ heading toward a new , more watery state ” likely triggered by “ human - caused global warming . ”
“ What happened to that Arctic story , Dad ? ” my daughter asked me .
How could the news media just report one day that the Arctic ice was melting far faster than any models predicted “ and then the story just disappeared ? ”
Why were n’t any of the candidates talking about it ?
Did n’t they understand : this has become the big issue on campuses ?
No , they do n’t seem to understand .
They seem to be too busy raising money or buying votes with subsidies for ethanol farmers in Iowa .
The candidates could actually use a good kick in the pants on this point .
But where is it going to come from ?
Generation Q would be doing itself a favor , and America a favor , if it demanded from every candidate who comes on campus answers to three questions :
What is your plan for mitigating climate change ?
What is your plan for reforming Social Security ?
What is your plan for dealing with the deficit — so we all wo n’t be working for China in 20 years ?
America needs a jolt of the idealism , activism and outrage ( it must be in there ) of Generation Q .
That ’s what twentysomethings are for — to light a fire under the country .
But they ca n’t e-mail it in , and an online petition or a mouse click for carbon neutrality wo n’t cut it .
They have to get organized in a way that will force politicians to pay attention rather than just patronize them .
Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy did n’t change the world by asking people to join their Facebook crusades or to download their platforms .
Activism can only be uploaded , the old - fashioned way — by young voters speaking truth to power , face to face , in big numbers , on campuses or the Washington Mall .
Virtual politics is just that — virtual .
Maybe that ’s why what impressed me most on my brief college swing was actually a statue — the life - size statue of James Meredith at the University of Mississippi .
Meredith was the first African - American to be admitted to Ole Miss in 1962 .
The Meredith bronze is posed as if he is striding toward a tall limestone archway , re-enacting his fateful step onto the then - segregated campus — defying a violent , angry mob and protected by the National Guard .
Above the archway , carved into the stone , is the word “ Courage . ”
That is what real activism looks like .
There is no substitute .
As a " language lawyer " , it 's fun to learn new languages and see how they differ in subtle ways .
Here are some of the many ways Ruby is different from Python , etc .
Most of these are n't necessarily good or bad , they 're just different .
Looking at the differences , it 's fun to try to peek into the design decisions behind the languages .
If you 've noticed more interesting differences , post them below as comments !
In Ruby , Classes , modules , and constants must begin with an upper case letter .
Actually , this reminds me of Haskell .
Ruby uses " end " instead of indentation .
That 's fine unless you 're a Python programmer like me who keeps forgetting to type " end " ;)
Ruby does n't have true keyword arguments like Python .
Instead , if you pass " : symbol => value " pairs to a function , they get put into a single hash .
Python can act like Ruby using the " ** kargs " syntax , but Ruby cannot act like Python ; it cannot explicitly declare which keyword arguments are acceptable in the function signature .
Ruby is like Perl in that the last value of a function is its implicit return value .
In Python , if there is n't an explicit return statement , the return value is implicitly None .
Ruby does not make a distinction between expressions and statements like Python does .
Hence , you can do :
a = if 5 > 6
7
else
puts " hi "
end
This is like Scheme and ML .
Ruby is much more clever than Python at figuring out how to translate end of lines into statements .
For instance , the following works in Ruby , but not in Python .
a = 2 +
2
Python would require parenthesis .
I 'm still trying to figure out the proper style for when you should use parenthesis in function calls and when you should leave them out in Ruby .
The distinction is idiomatic .
Ruby 's string interpolation syntax is ' " foo # { 2 + 2} " ' .
Python uses ' " foo %s " % ( 2 + 2 , ) '.
The syntax for declaring a class method ( what Java calls a static method ) is strange , since Python uses " self " for something very different :
def self.my_class_method
puts " hi "
end
I must admit that " @a " is easier to type than Python 's " self. a " without any significant loss in readability .
Single quoted strings in Ruby are like single quoted strings in Perl or like raw strings in Python .
They get less interpretation .
Instance variables are never directly accessible outside the class in Ruby , unlike in Python or even Java .
In Python , you may use a publically accessible member on day one and change it to a property on day two behind everyone else 's back .
In Ruby , you use an attribute on day one .
Fortunately , the syntax is very convenient , " attr_accessor : name " .
This is much more succinct that explicit getters and setters in Java .
Ruby has protected and private members , which Python and Perl purposely chose to leave out .
A private member in Ruby is even more private that a private member in Java .
If you have two instances of the same class , in Java one instance can access the other instance 's private members , but that 's not true in Ruby .
Ruby uses modules as mixins instead of using multiple inheritance to support mixins .
Ruby embraces what Python calls " monkey patching " .
Python programmers generally try to avoid using eval , but I do n't think that 's the case in Ruby .
Ruby uses to " items << item " to append to a list .
Python uses " items.append ( item ) .
PHP uses " items [ ] = item " .
This is one place where every language does it differently .
Ruby has " %w { foo bar bat } " , which is like Perl 's " q ( foo bar bat ) " .
Python does n't have a construct for this , but you can use " ' foo bar bat '.split ( ) " .
Ruby makes heavy use of symbols , like Scheme and Erlang ( which calls them atoms ) .
Python does n't have symbols , so strings are used instead .
Ruby uses " elsif " , whereas Python uses " elif " .
Ruby does n't need a colon in control structures , but it does require an end of line or a semicolon .
Hence , to do a one liner in Python , it's :
if 11 > 10 : print " yep "
if 11 > 10 ; puts " yep " ; end
whereas in Ruby it 's :
As everyone knows , Ruby supports blocks .
Personally the use of " |a , b| " to denote arguments to the block seems really strange to me .
Who uses 's pipes for arguments ?
They do n't even pair like parenthesis do !
In Python , there 's a much stronger emphasis on passing functions .
I 'm sure that it 's possible in Ruby , but it 's more natural to pass a block instead .
Ruby has a very different syntax for exceptions handling than most languages :
begin
a = some_func
rescue FuncFailed
puts " I 'm hosed ! "
end
When you unmarshal an object in Ruby , all the class definitions have to be loaded already .
Python will import them for you , assuming they can be imported .
Ruby allows function names like " empty ! " and " empty ? " which is clearly a matter of taste , but I like it .
This is probably inspired by Scheme .
For some reason , it seems like using " help ( String ) " in Ruby is pretty slow , whereas using " help ( str ) " is pretty fast .
I wonder if Ruby does n't have the docstrings attached to the object at runtime like Python does .
In Python , this stuff is always loaded unless you use " - 00 " for optimization .
The rest of these comments are inspired by : http://books.rubyveil.com/books/ThingsNewcomersShouldKnow
What Ruby calls " ' foo ' [ 0 ] " , Python calls " ord ( ' foo ' [ 0 ] ) " .
What Python calls " ' foo ' [ 0 ] " , Ruby calls " ' foo ' [ 0,1 ] " or " ' foo ' [ 0 ] .chr " .
In Ruby , a failed lookup in a hash returns a default value , which is usually nil .
You can set a different default if you want .
Python will raise an exception if you try to access a key that does n't exist .
However , in Python 2.5 , you can now set a default value for the dict .
Now I know where they got that idea from ;)
In Ruby , you say " ( hash [ key ] ||= [ ] ) << value " , whereas in Python , you say " hash.setdefault ( key , [ ] ) .append ( value ) . "
In Python , it 's " len( obj ) " ( i.e. len is a generic function ) .
In Ruby , it 's " obj.length " ( i.e. polymorphism is used ) .
This difference seems to happen a lot .
In Ruby , strings are mutable .
Hence , " s.upcase " returns a upcase version of s , whereas " s.upcase ! " actually modifies s. Python strings are immutable .
Ruby does n't have tuples ( i.e. immutable arrays ) .
Because Ruby does n't have as strong a notion of immutable objects as Python does .
For instance , you may use mutable objects as hash keys in Ruby .
Python forbids this .
If you do change the value of a key in Ruby , you may want to let the hash recalculate the hash values for all the keys via " my_hash.rehash " .
Ruby will let you assign a new value to a variable defined outside your scope :
i = 0
( 0..2 ) . each do |i|
puts " inside block : i = # {i} "
end
puts " outside block : i = # {i} " # -> ' outside block : i = 2 '
This was not previously possible in Python without using a workaround .
However , Python is gaining this feature with the use of a keyword similar to the " global " keyword .
Coming at it from a different angle , in Java , you use explicit variable declarations to assign scope .
This is true too in Perl when you use " my " .
In Python , an assignment automatically sets scope .
Hence , you can shadow variables in Java , Python , and Perl .
Ruby tries really hard to avoid shadowing .
Hence , whoever assigns to the variable first sets the scope .
Shadowing can still happen in rare cases ( see here ) , but it 's a lot less likely .
Ruby assignments are expressions .
Hence , you can do :
while line = gets
puts line
end
for line in sys.stdin :
print line
Python purposely left this out because it 's too easy to confuse " = " and " == " .
Hence , in Python you would write : Ruby has two sets of logical operators .
They have different precedences .
Hence , " a = b && c " means " a = ( b && c ) " , whereas " a = b and c " means " ( a = b ) and c " .
I 'm going to agree with Guido on this one and say this is just too confusing .
Ruby has an === operator and case statements .
This feature is a lot closer to the match feature in ML languages than anything in Python :
case my_var
when MyClass
puts " my_var is an instance of MyClass "
when / foo /
puts " my_var matches the regex "
end
This is really neat .
Notice that , thankfully , Ruby does n't require " break " like all the C inspired languages .
In Ruby , only false and nil are considered as false in a Boolean expression .
In particular , 0 ( zero ) , " " or '' ( empty string ) , [ ] ( empty array ) , and {} ( empty hash ) are all considered as true .
In Python , 0 , " " , '' , [ ] , and {} are all considered False .
In general , Python has a very rich notion of " truthiness " , and you can define the " truthiness " of your own objects .
In Ruby , if s is a string , you may write " s += ' a ' " or " s << ' a ' " .
The first creates a new object .
The second modifies s.
If you modify s , that may " surprise " other pieces of code that also have a reference to s.
Python strings are simply immutable so this can't happen .
Ok , that 's all for now !
In my opinion , they 're both great languages .
If you know about more fun differences , post them below !

The Longest Insect .
The Biggest .
Strongest animal on earth .
Weird Lifecycle .
( Image credit : Hans Pohl )
Violent Sex .
Bizarre Body Parts .
Trap and Torture .
Unstoppable Swarmers .
Gruesome Bloodsuckers .
Deadliest of all .
The Prettiest
.
The strangest of all .
There are over a million described species of insects , and even more that have n’t been studied .
A little research indicates they are all strange in different ways .
It was not easy to pick a dozen for this list , but these are all pretty weird .
The Borneo walking stick ( Phobaeticus kirbyi ) can grow to up to 32 centimeters long , with another 14 centimeters if you measure the legs stretched out !
But you might not see one , even if you are in Borneo and looking for them , since they closely resemble the slender tree branches they live on .
Goliath beetles ( Goliathus ) are the largest insects in terms of bulk and weight .
They can reach over 4 inches long , which does n’t sound like much , til you look at the picture .
The beetles are native to the African tropics , where they subsist on tree sap and fruit .
Goliath beetles can be kept as pets , just feed them dog food ( but do n’t expect them to come when called ) .
The Hercules beetle ( Dynastes hercules ) is a species of rhinoceros beetle that lives in South America .
It can grow to over 6 inches in length ( counting its horns ) , but its claim to fame is its strength .
The Hercules beetle can support 850 times its own weight on its shell !
This beetles eats only vegetation and is not aggressive , except to other Hercules beetles , when males fight each other over females .
The twisted - wing parasite ( Strepsiptera ) is an order of insects who display a gruesome lifestyle .
The larval stage parasite will climb a flower and wait for an insect pollinator ( bee or wasp ) to come along .
They climb aboard the bee , burrow into its body , and change into a second - stage larva .
They feed off the blood and organs of the host .
An adult male parasite will emerge from the host and search for a mate - a process that takes such little time that he never develops a mouth .
The adult female remains in the host ’s body for the rest of her life , never growing legs or wings .
She mates by pushing only her reproductive organs outside of the bee ’s body !
Her offspring will emerge and look for new hosts .
The gruesome behavior or the male African bat bug ( Afrocimex constrictus ) is directed at other bat bugs .
Instead of copulating via the female ’s sex organs , he will stab her abdomen to release sperm directly into her bloodstream .
So the females have evolved paragenitals , a “ spongy reservoir of immune cells ” as a defense against these tactics .
But since male bat bugs are not particular when it comes to mating , some male bat bugs have also developed paragenitals to defend themselves against sexual attack !
Seed Beetles have rough sex , too , but in the conventional manner .
What is very unconventional is the male seed beetle ’s penis ( shown in above picture ) .
He can do some damage with that thing .
So female seed beetles have developed thicker , more padded reproductive canals over time as self - defense against their paramour .
Tree ants ( Allomerus decemarticulatus ) in the Amazon contruct elaborate traps for other insects they feed upon .
They build these traps from tree fibers reinforced with fungus .
When an unsuspecting insect encounters the trap , the ants emerge from hiding underneath and pull the prey ’s legs to immobilize them , almost like a torture rack .
Then they dismember the victim and carry the parts off to the colony .
This method of “ drawing and quartering ” allows the ants to dine on insects much larger than themselves .
Driver ants ( Dorylus ) or siafu are the masters of the swarm .
Dorylus includes several species of army ants , primarily found in Africa .
Colonies can contain 20 million ants !
When the column is on the march looking for food , people can avoid them just by stepping aside .
But there have been cases where invalids have been killed ( by asphyxiation ) when a column of ants marches through the house .
They have been known to kill and eat animals up to the size of small zebras .
The soldiers of the colony flank the column .
Their bite is so strong and persistant that they are sometimes used to suture wounds ; just apply an ant while you hold the wound together and let it bite , then rip the body off .
It should hold for a few days .
Male driver ants are so much larger than the rest of the colony that they appear to be a different species .
Males lead a solitary life until sexual maturity , when they approach the colony for mating .
When a male is detected , the workers of the colony tear off his wings and take him to be mated with their queen .
You can watch this process on video Assassin bugs use a mouth tube to inject toxin into their prey .
This toxin acts as an anaesthetic and also liquifies tissues , the easier to suck you dry with .
There are thousands of assassin bug species ; some eat only other insects and some attack reptiles , birds , and mammals .
This assassin bug is turning the tables on a vampire bat .
Notice how you can see the blood entering the young insect .
The mosquito ( Culicidae ) causes the deaths of millions of people every year .
They spread yellow fever , dengue fever , encephalitis , West Nile Virus , and malaria from person to person , without being affected by the diseases themselves .
They also transmit the debilitating filariasis worm , which can lead to elephantiasis in humans .
Mosquitos are nasty business .( discounting butterflies ) The Orchid mantis ( Hymenopus coronatus ) is a variety of flower mantis usually found in Malaysia and Indonesia .
Does n’t the mantis pictured look just like an orchid ?
They hide in the flowers they resemble , waiting for other delicious insects to alight .
See a beautiful picture of a pink flower mantis here
The weirdest insect of all is the Western honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) .
That may surprise you , but the only reason they do n’t seem strange is because we are familiar with them .
But think ... how many insects produce a delicious food product enjoyed by bees , bears , and people ?
In addition to honey , bees produce beeswax , honeycombs , royal jelly , and venom .
Bees communicate with each other , coordinate colony activities , determine the fate of the next generation , and are master architects , chemists , and engineers .
Bees are crucial to food production as they pollinate billions of dollars worth of crops each year .

Two Moscow inhabitants decided to explore collecting system under the building where they live .
So they found the right gully grating , opened it and came down .
How they were surprised , discovered the whole system of caves with the real underground river .
Now they say , that it is one of their favorite places in Moscow to have a walk at evenings , or just to have a rest near river right under the house .

NEW YORK -- Something remarkable happened at 44 Henry St. , a grimy Chinatown tenement with peeling walls .
It also happened nearby at a dimly lighted apartment building with trash bins clustered by the front door .
And again not too far away , at 88 E. Broadway beneath the Manhattan bridge , where vendors chatter in Mandarin and Fujianese as they hawk rubber sandals and bargain - basement clothes .
All three locations , along with scores of others scattered throughout some of the poorest Chinese neighborhoods in Queens , Brooklyn and the Bronx , have been swept by an extraordinary impulse to shower money on one particular presidential candidate -- Democratic front - runner Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Dishwashers , waiters and others whose jobs and dilapidated home addresses seem to make them unpromising targets for political fundraisers are pouring $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 contributions into Clinton ’s campaign treasury .
In April , a single fundraiser in an area long known for its gritty urban poverty yielded a whopping $ 380,000 .
When Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass. ) ran for president in 2004 , he received $ 24,000 from Chinatown .
At this point in the presidential campaign cycle , Clinton has raised more money than any candidate in history .
Those dishwashers , waiters and street stall hawkers are part of the reason .
And Clinton ’s success in gathering money from Chinatown ’s least - affluent residents stems from a two - pronged strategy : mutually beneficial alliances with powerful groups , and appeals to the hopes and dreams of people now consigned to the margins .
Clinton has enlisted the aid of Chinese neighborhood associations , especially those representing recent immigrants from Fujian province .
The organizations , at least one of which is a descendant of Chinatown criminal enterprises that engaged in gambling and human trafficking , exert enormous influence over immigrants .
The associations help them with everything from protection against crime to obtaining green cards .
Many of Clinton ’s Chinatown donors said they had contributed because leaders in neighborhood associations told them to .
In some cases , donors said they felt pressure to give .
The other piece of the strategy involves holding out hope that , if Clinton becomes president , she will move quickly to reunite families and help illegal residents move toward citizenship .
As New York ’s junior senator , Clinton has expressed support for immigrants and greater family reunification .
She is also benefiting from Chinese donors ’ naive notions of what she could do in the White House .

Campaign concerns
As with other campaigns looking for dollars in unpromising places , the Clinton operation also has accepted what it later conceded were improper donations .
At least one reported donor denies making a contribution .
Another admitted to lacking the legal - resident status required for giving campaign money .
Clinton aides said they were concerned about some of the Chinatown contributions .
“ We have hundreds of thousands of donors .
We are proud to have support from across New York and the country from many different communities , ” campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said .
“ In this instance , our own compliance process flagged a number of questionable donations and took the appropriate steps to be sure they were legally given .
In cases where we could n’t confirm that , the money was returned . ”
The Times examined the cases of more than 150 donors who provided checks to Clinton after fundraising events geared to the Chinese community .
One - third of those donors could not be found using property , telephone or business records .
Most have not registered to vote , according to public records .
And several dozen were described in financial reports as holding jobs -- including dishwasher , server or chef -- that would normally make it difficult to donate amounts ranging from $ 500 to the legal maximum of $ 2,300 per election .
Of 74 residents of New York ’s Chinatown , Flushing , the Bronx or Brooklyn that The Times called or visited , only 24 could be reached for comment .
Many said they gave to Clinton because they were instructed to do so by local association leaders .
Some said they wanted help on immigration concerns .
And several spoke of the pride they felt by being associated with a powerful figure such as Clinton .

New take , old game
Beyond what it reveals about present - day campaign fundraising , Chinatown ’s newfound role in the 2008 election cycle marks another chapter in the centuries - old American saga of marginalized ethnic groups and newly arrived immigrants turning to politics to improve their lot .
In earlier times , New York politicians from William “ Boss ” Tweed to Fiorello LaGuardia gained power with the support of immigrants .
So did politicians in Philadelphia , Cleveland , Chicago and other big cities .
Like many who traveled this path , most of the Chinese reported as contributing to Clinton ’s campaign have never voted .
Many speak little or no English .
Some seem to lead such ephemeral lives that neighbors say they ’ve never heard of them .
“ This is a new game , ” said Peter Kwong , a professor at Hunter College in New York who studies Chinatown communities across the country .
Historically , Kwong said , “ voting in Chinatown is so weak ” that politicians did not go out of their way to court residents .
“ Today it is all about money , ” he said .
The effort is especially pronounced among groups in the Fujianese community .
More than a decade ago , Fujianese cultural associations ran gambling operations and , more ominously , at least one was home to a gang that trafficked in illegal Fujian native immigrants .
The human - smuggling problem came to a head in 1993 , when a cargo ship , the Golden Venture , ran aground off New York City .
As shocked police and immigration officials looked on , hundreds of Fujian natives who had spent weeks below deck struggled to make it to shore .
Several died in the attempt .
A crackdown by the FBI ’s organized - crime task force led to the indictment of more than 20 Fujian native traffickers .
Today , the problem has substantially dissipated , says Konrad Motyka of the FBI ’s New York field office , who participated in the investigation of the Golden Venture .
Although Motyka is wary of the havoc wreaked in the past by Fujianese organized crime , he said : “ I welcome signs that the community is participating in politics . ”

High hopes
At his tiny restaurant in the south Bronx , which has one table and a takeout counter , Chang Jian Lin displays a prized memento : a photo of himself and Clinton .
The picture was taken at a fundraising banquet in Chinatown this spring .
Lin and his wife , who also works in the restaurant , said through an interpreter that they believe Clinton , if elected president , will reunite their family .
The Lins ’ two teenage children remain in Fujian , a mountainous coastal province in southeastern China opposite Taiwan .
“ If she gets to be the president , we want our children to come home , ” Chang Jian Lin said .
Campaign officials point out that Clinton has sponsored legislation aimed at family reunification ; the proposals failed .
And immigration measures being discussed in Congress would assign a lower priority to family reunification , which tends to bring in poor people , and give preference to immigrants with more - lucrative job skills .
Moreover , the Lins appeared to have an exaggerated impression of a president ’s ability to change such things as immigration laws single - handedly .
Kwong thinks Clinton may be “ exploiting the vulnerabilities of recent immigrants . ”
Nonetheless , Lin is planning to attend another Clinton fundraiser , a birthday bash next week .
He said his support rested on more than his hope for reuniting his family .
“ Besides the immigration issue with my kids , the overall standard of living will improve for the Chinese people ” living in the U.S. , he said .
He has never before supported a U.S. politician and , not yet a citizen , he is barred from voting .
But when Fujianese community leaders asked him to donate to Clinton , he said , he eagerly contributed $ 1,000 .
Immigrants who have permanent resident status can legally make campaign contributions .
Coming up with the money was hard , Lin acknowledged , adding : “ The restaurant is really small . ”

Missing persons
The tenement at 44 Henry St. was listed in Clinton ’s campaign reports as the home of Shu Fang Li , who reportedly gave $ 1,000 .
In a recent visit , a man , apparently drunk , was asleep near the entrance to the neighboring beauty parlor , the Nice Hair Salon .
A tenant living in the apartment listed as Li’s address said through a translator that she had not heard of him , although she had lived there for the last 10 years .
A man named Liang Zheng was listed as having contributed $ 1,000 .
The address given was a large apartment building on East 194th Street in the Bronx , but no one by that name could be located there .
Census figures for 2000 show the median family income for the area was less than $ 21,000 .
About 45 % of the population was living below the poverty line , more than double the city average .
In the busy heart of East Broadway , beneath the Manhattan Bridge , is a building that is listed as the home of Sang Cheung Lee , also reported to have given $ 1,000 .
Trash was piled in the dimly lighted entrance hall .
Neighbors said they knew of no one with Lee ’s name there ; they knocked on one another ’s doors in a futile effort to find him .
Salespeople at a store on Canal Street were similarly baffled when asked about Shih Kan Chang , listed as working there and having given $ 1,000 .
The store sells purses , jewelry and novelty Buddha statues .
Employees said they had not heard of Chang .
Another listed donor , Yi Min Liu , said he did not make the $ 1,000 contribution in April that was reported in his name .
He said he attended a banquet for Clinton but did not give her money .
Clinton “ has done a lot for the Chinese community , ” he said .
One New York man who said he enthusiastically donated $ 2,500 to Clinton does n’t appear to be eligible to do so under federal election law .
He said he came to the United States from China about two years ago and did n’t have a green card .

Out of the periphery
A key figure helping to secure Asian support for Clinton is a woman named Chung Seto , who came to this country as a child from Canton province and has supported Bill and Hillary Clinton since the 1990s .
She called Fujian natives ’ support for Hillary Clinton the beginning of civic engagement for an immigrant group that had long been on the periphery .
She said she stationed translators at the entrance of one event to try to screen out improper contributions .
Qun Wu , a 37 - year - old waiter at a Chinese restaurant in Flushing , saw a reference to a Clinton fundraiser in a Chinese - language newspaper .
He took a day off from work to go .
Though he only makes $ 500 a week , he considers his $ 1,000 donation to be money well - spent .
He got his picture taken with Clinton , hung it prominently in his house , then had color reprints made and sent to family in China .
“ Every day I go home and see it , ” he said .
“ I see my picture with Hillary , and I feel encouraged .
It ’s a great honor . ”
Many , on the other hand , said they gave for reasons having more to do with the Chinese community than with Clinton .
He Duan Zheng , who gave $ 1,000 , said of the Fujianese community : “ They informed us to go , so I went .
“ Everybody was making a donation , so I did too , ” he said .
“ Otherwise I would lose face . ”

Over the last 4 years we 've tracked the annual growth of fungus on the trees in front of my house , but the time for tracking was over .
The time for chewing was here .
I was never interested in eating the Tree Brain because wild mushrooms can kill people .
So I 'm going to start off by saying : DO NOT EAT ANY MUSHROOMS YOU FIND GROWING IN THE WILD .
I have no interest in being an accessory to your untimely death .
Even if you think you 've found a mushroom similar to mine , do n't eat it .
YOU WILL DIE .
You 'll be a dick and you 'll die .
So do n't do it .
I 'm serious .
Pretend this is a PSA with a well - respected celebrity , such as -- I do n't know ...
Jeremy Gelbwaks .
And in the PSA he looks to camera and says " Hi , I 'm TV's Jeremy Gelbwaks .
You may know me better as the kid who was the first Chris Partridge on the Partridge Family .
Do n't eat mushrooms you find in the wild . "
And then off - camera we hear : " He 's right . "
And , oh my God , it 's BRIAN FORSTER , Chris Partridge # 2 !
The two Chris 's laugh , high - five and we 're all a little bit safer .
That said , I totally ate the tree brain .
At some point a small residual nubbin finally did grow on the original tree .
It seemed a waste to not do SOMETHING with it .
And as much as I like writing this site for you guys , hot man on mushroom sex was n't going to happen .
My wife has been the real force behind me not eating it over the years , but I caught her at just the right time .
I reminded her that a professional mycologist had identified it and that I was well - read on all the potential pitfalls .
It was still " young , " it was not growing on a type of tree that could potentially make me ill ( such as eucalyptus ) and I was going to cook it thoroughly .
I also found it hard to believe it would want to hurt me after all I 've done for Tree Brain awareness .
I was 99.7 % sure I 'd be fine and I even made a deal with her that I 'd just chew it and spit it out .
Luckily , she was feeling sick and had a headache .
I was given some vague " Do whatever you want , " approval .
It really is heartwarming to know that my wife is devoted and loves me and does n't want me to die .
Unless her head hurts a little .
I tried to think of some perfect words to say before removing the brain .
This was a historic moment and I wanted to come up with something fitting .
Then my neighbors across the street drove up .
I felt silly and hid behind my car until they went inside .
Eventually I cut off the brain and ran back into my house .
Historically .
It was weird to see it in my kitchen .
I took a few pics like a geeky fanboy ...
then unceremoniously hacked it to pieces .
The raw brain did n't smell like much of anything .
If I was going to taste this thing , I did n't want to mask the flavor so I just went with a little olive oil .
The hunks got more intensely orange as they cooked down and soon it was go time .
As I promised my wife , the plan was to chew it and spit it out .
BUT IT WAS SO GODDAMN DELICIOUS IT HAD TO BE SWALLOWED .
IT WAS THE BEST MUSHROOM I'VE EVER HAD .
I had read over and over that these Sulfur Shelf mushrooms ( sometimes called " Chicken of the Woods " ) were supposed taste like chicken or even lemony chicken .
But it did n't just " kind of " taste like lemony chicken .
It was as if Willy Wonka branched out from chocolate to work on a lemony chicken mushroom and when he let you try it you'd be like , " Holy shit , this REALLY tastes like lemony chicken , Bill ! "
( Although it would n't kill you to treat Mr. Wonka with a little more respect . )
I waited awhile to see if I got sick .
I did n't , so I went off zombie - style on the remaining brains .
Even my wife , who was still feeling like crap , tried it and had to admit to its deliciousness .
Lest you doubt that the tree brain was consumed , I 've decided to include an up close and personal picture of my sloppy food hole , chewing it up .
I 've always felt you did n't need to actually see these types of pix of food literally being mashed up in my mouth , but I figured on such a momentous occasion , it should be documented -- saliva , taste buds , 4 days of stubble and all .
I can't wait until next year .
I will eat the shit out of that tree .
I have to say , it 's weird to watch something grow for 4 years and then all of a sudden you 're eating it .
It really made me think ...
Maybe I should ...
EAT MY SON .

I ’m really stoked about this .
I think rubinius has so much potential that I am really happy to be able to support it .
Starting next month Evan Phoenix is going to be working here at EY half time on ey [ Engine Yard ] tools and such and half time on rubinius .
For those of your who are n’t familiar with rubinius you can read a bit more about it here .
It ’s a new implementation of ruby done in a smalltalk style with a small core VM written in C and almost everyting else written in ruby .
Really , even String and Array and definied in ruby .
Rubinius is going to open up core ruby hacking to the masses as the internals wo n’t be a bunch of gnarly C code thats really hard to grasp .
all
The situation for alternative Ruby implementations has changed significantly in the past year .
First JRuby 's core team was hired by Sun , then MS hired John Lam to work on IronRuby ( a Ruby for .NET ) .
Now , EngineYard has hired Evan Phoenix who works on the Rubinius project .
InfoQ recently featured an interview with Ezra Zygmuntowicz of EngineYard .
Engine Yard offers Rails hosting and makes use of virtualization to allow flexible solutions and easy scaling .
Ezra Zygmuntowicz on hiring Evan Phoenix
He follows with a quick explanation of Rubinius :
It 's important to point one thing out : with Evan Phoenix being paid to work on Rubinius , Ruby implementations ( Ruby , JRuby , IronRuby , Rubinius ) now have paid developers working on them .
Just when you think they can't be more absurd ... do n't get me wrong , Katie is hardly capable of the " in the field " coverage that CBS used to be known for , but this angle is just ridiculous .
PERRspectives :
As ThinkProgress reported today , Fox News attacked CBS rival and single mother Katie Couric for her upcoming trip to Iraq .
But while Neil Cavuto , John Gibson and the gang at Fox grew hysterical about Couric , they remained silent about 26 year old Michelle Ring and other single mothers fighting for the United States in Iraq .
The issue for Fox , of course , is that anyone else 's coverage of Iraq inevitably brings the facts of Bush 's Baghdad fiasco directly to American television screens .
But in a new low even for Fox , Couric ( whose husband passed away from colon cancer in 1998 ) was accused of placing her children at risk all in the name of ratings .
As guest Janice Crouse of Concerned Women for American put it :
" She 's saying my ratings are more important than my children .
That 's the bottom line . "
If only Fox News would focus such concern on all of the American single mothers who are fighting - and dying - for us in Iraq .
That would include women like Michelle Ring of the 92nd Military Police Battalion based in Fort Benning , Georgia .
Ring , who joined the Army in 2005 , recently reenlisted with the hope of becoming a military police officer .
Ring was killed by mortar fire on July 5th while on guard duty .

“ Lisp programs inflate libraries with functions whose utility transcends the application that produced them .
The list , Lisp ’s native data structure , is largely responsible for such growth of utility .
The simple structure and natural applicability of lists are reflected in functions that are amazingly non-idiosyncratic … .
It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures . ” — Alan J. Perlis
You might have started out with Peter Seibel ’s Practical Common Lisp .
You thought of yourself as being an experienced coder , so you skimmed it quickly , mainly taking away the point that Lisp really is unusually expressive and powerful .
But after sitting down at the REPL prompt you succeeded at only kludging together ugly imperative style programs .
So you slowed down and worked through half or more of a more straight forward tutorial .
This lead to a pet project that started innocently enough , but that soon spun out of control and got uglier and uglier as you took more and more shortcuts just to get things to work .
Maybe you dipped into some more advanced books and solved some clever problems , but you want to start coding something real because you ’re beginning to lose interest .
As Duncan Kenzie said , “ any time you have something that can give you good success early on , it helps to build momentum and get into more complex things . ”
Without something resembling a successful project , you ’re liable to give up on Lisp and go off and tinker with Python or Ruby instead .
This article is written in hopes of preventing such a fate for the would - be Lisp programmer .
What we ’re going to do is demonstrate how the plain vanilla Common Lisp list can adapt to just about any data structure you can think of .
We ’re going to use a simple list to write pseudo - code that is designed to be as readable as possible – then we ’ll build up on our core language elements until we can actually run our pseudo code .
We ’re going to do all the things that the Lisp experts have bragged about ( and that you ’ve maybe failed to achieve on your own ) and we ’re going to show that you do n’t have to be a genius to make this work for you .
In fact , the most difficult technique we ’re going to use is recursion on trees and lists – something that most Lisp texts tend to confront you with fairly quickly anyway .
We ’ll see that while it may take us a little bit longer to work through a problem than it would , say , in a language that we ’ve already mastered , it will all be worth it for the additional configurability we get in the process .
The Problem : Traveller World Generation
“ The referee has the responsibility for mapping the universe before actual game play begins .
The entire universe is not necessary immediately , however , as only a small portion can be used at any one time . ” — Traveller Book 3
Whenever I ’m experimenting with a new technique I like to do something completely and pointlessly fun .
The less “ real world ” applicability , the better .
( Of course , nine times out of ten , I end up applying the techniques I learn on a real project later on , anyway . )
For this project we ’ll dig back into the pencil and paper gaming scene of the late seventies and look at the world generation sequence of the first science fiction role playing game .
The game Traveller debuted in 1977 .
It featured a generic space opera setting that was vaguely reminiscent of classic sci- fi works such as Dune and the Foundation series .
Actually , it did n’t originally come with a fleshed out setting at all : the “ referee ” was supposed to randomly generate one for the players to explore .
Back in the day , this meant hours of rolling dice and penciling in obscure symbols on retro-nerdy xerox copies of professional - looking interstellar “ TAS forms . ”
You can get an overview of the process by looking at this pseudo code snippet .
Size represents the world ’s planetary diameter in thousands of miles .
You roll two six sided dice and subtract two to determine this property .
( A zero here signifies a “ world ” that centers in and around an asteroid belt . )
To determine the Atmosphere code for a world , roll 2d6 , subtract 7 , and add the value we determined for Size .
Just as Atmosphere is influenced by Size , so is the Hydrographics code influenced by Atmosphere .
Likewise , Government type is influenced by the Population code and Law Level is influenced by the Government type .
Note that , the Population of a world is completely independent of the world ’s environment .
You can end up with an airless rock - ball with a population in the billions right next to a garden world with a population in the hundreds .
While many Traveller players complain that such results are silly , others took great delight in attempting to come up with plausible explanations for such anomalies .
In any event , referees are encouraged to throw out any results they do n’t like , and there are only so many worlds that can be successfully managed in a real game anyway .
To write a program to take care of all of this is pretty trivial .
All we need is a way to pull the rule expressions out of our pseudo - code list .
Once we have the expression , we need to massage it so that the “ 2 d ” ‘s are replaced with randomly generated die - rolls and the field references are replaced with their current value .
Once we ’ve made such a pass over our expression list , were left with a simple arithmetic problem .
Writing a recursive function to perform that calculation is pretty straight forward , and once we put all of these pieces together in our create - world routine , we have a working proof of concept .
The following code snipped from the REPL prompt demonstrates our program in action :
CL - USER > ( get - rule ( third * worlds * ) )
( |2D| – 7 + ATMOSPHERE )
CL - USER > ( massage ( get-rule ( third * worlds * ) ) ‘( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) )
( 11 – 7 + 2 )
CL - USER > ( massadd *)
(6 )
CL - USER > ( create - world )
( 2 5 6 3 6 2 )
We ’re glossing over a few details here , but if you have a little experience working with Lisp then you should have a pretty good idea of how to implement the above .
The get - rule function returns a list containing everything after the -> symbol in an item from our list of pseudo - code expressions .
The massage function is a little trickier .
While it ’s trivial to replace occurrences of | 2D| with the results of simulated die rolls , to substitute the correct numbers for the reference Atmosphere we ’re going to need to pass along a list such as ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) above representing each of the world code values .
The code will have to pull the correct value from the list and then substitute it for the ATMOSPHERE tag .
Massadd moves through the list replacing occurrences of [ 0 - 9 ] [+-] [ 0 - 9 ] with an integer .
The create - world function starts with a blank world description ( 0 0 0 0 0 0 ) and then cycles through each position replacing it with the results of evaluating massage and massadd with the corresponding line of pseudo code .
Simple !
Notice that everything we ’re doing is in terms of cycling through lists .
Everything we do can be conceived of in terms of abstract operations on lists .
Each function that we write to accomplish the above is fairly straight - forward … but this a completely alien approach when compared with how we tend to do things in more imperative languages .
There ’s More To It Than That
Okay , it ’s actually a little more complicated than what I ’ve described so far .
This is the seventies , we ’re talking about here !
This is RPG ’s , even … .
You are n’t having real fun unless you ’re rolling dice and looking things up on charts and tables .
( See this pseudo code file for a better idea of what we ’re dealing with . )
For Starport type and for checking for the existence of Bases and Gas Giants , we need to roll two dice and look up the result on a chart .
To find out the TechLevel , we need to cross reference most of our World codes on a table and add up the values .
There ’s probably a more concise way to phrase this , but this was about as simple as I could make it .
I came up with a simple way to inline all but two of these tables with their respective rules .
The : choose directive takes a number parameter and returns the nth item on a list .
The : table directive does the same thing in a more verbose ( and more flexible ) manner by looking up a value in an associative list .
Also , we ’re going to have to make sure that some of our world codes fall within a specified range .
CL - USER > ( masschoo ‘(: choose 5 [ ABCDEFGHIJ ] ) )
(E )
CL - USER > ( massage ‘( 1d + : choose Size + 1 [ 22111000000 ] ) ‘( A 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ) )
( 4 + :CHOOSE 2 + 1 [ 22111000000 ] )
CL - USER > ( massadd *)
( 4 + :CHOOSE 3 [ 22111000000 ] )
CL - USER > ( masschoo *)
( 4 + 1 )
CL - USER > ( massadd *)
(5 )
In the above example we see the new masschoo fuction demonstrated from the REPL prompt .
First we “ choose ” the fifth item from a string contained inside square brackets .
Then we step by step break down a more complex piece of pseudo - code step by step .
First we “ massage ” the die roll and substitute a 2 for the Size tag .
Next we replace the 2 + 1 with a 3 using our previously written massadd function .
Then we choose the third item from our string of results .
And finally we “ massadd ” the resulting list to get our final result of a 5 .
Note that the massadd and masschoo functions are easily tested from the REPL prompt and that it ’s trivial to come up with test cases that prove they work correctly .
And now that we have them worked out , they are so generic that they could easily be applied to totally different projects .
If you ’re still wondering when you ’re going to get around to experiencing the much - vaunted benefits of code reuse in your OOP applications , then maybe Lisp can provide you with a model for achieving it a lot sooner !
Good News , Bad News , How to Reinvent the Wheel !
It seems like every project has one thing that is completely unanticipated .
You know … the kind of nightmares that cause you to reflexively multiply all of your coding estimates by a factor of 5 .
( Check out this pseudo code file to see what we really needed to be able to work with from the start . )
In this case , just as I thought I had completed my project in record time ( and with hardly any short - cuts or kludges even ) I reread the rules and to find out that I ’d missed some essential logic in the pseudo code .
I actually needed to be able to handle conditional logic in the same style with which I ’ve dealt with table look ups and die rolls … .
Now if I ’d known I was going to do this much work , I probably would not have started the project quite this way .
I do n’t know what I ’d have done … maybe I would n’t have started the project at all .
Anyways , I decided to suck it up and hack through the problem anyway .
I just about ended up doubling the code size for the project in the process , but I think some of that is due to the fact that I was reinventing the wheel in places .
Maybe if I was more familiar with the built - in functions of Common Lisp , then I might have had an easier time .
CL - USER > ( massif ‘( : if [ 0 = 0 ~ 5 ~ 42 ] ) )
(5 )
CL - USER > ( massif ‘( : if [ 2 = 0 ~ 5 ~ 42 ] ) )
( 42 )
CL - USER > ( massif ‘( : if [ 2 = 0 ~ 0 ~ 5 – 7 + 6 : if [ 6 ranges from 3 to 8 ~ – 4 ] ] ) )
( 5 – 7 + 6 :IF [ 6 RANGES FROM 3 TO 8 ~ – 4 )
CL - USER > ( massif *)
( 5 – 7 + 6 – 4 )
CL - USER > ( massadd *)
(0 )
CL - USER > ( massif ‘( ( : if [ 2 <= 5 ~ AA ] : if [ 3 = 6 ~ BB ] : if [ 7 in ‘[ 2579 ] ~ CC ] ) ) )
(( AA CC ) )
Here we see my ( perhaps half - baked ) list oriented “ embedded if ” concept in action .
I wanted to avoid introducing nested parentheses to the pseudo code due to all the hard feelings they seem to generate in non-lispers .
I used the ~ character to represent the argument separator .
So the first example expresses “ if 0 equals 0 then return 5 otherwise return 42 . ”
Of course , we may need to return expressions … and we may even need to return expressions containing more : if directives .
Finally , we may need to return a list of items , with each item associated with their own conditional that determines whether or not the show up in the list .
Coding all of this did n’t require any advanced techniques beyond the usual recursion on lists and trees , but it did require a lot of tedious work to get a function that could handle all of the various cases .
Whenever I expend this much effort on something like this I always assume I ’m overlooking something obvious , but the time it would take to figure out what that was exactly might ( in this case anyway ) take longer to figure out than it would to just follow my original premises to their logical conclusion .
Not as pretty as I would like , but you can always expect a few rough edges when you ’re trying to pick up a new language .
Here we have a demo of the final program :
CL - USER > ( create - world )
( B 8 8 1 8 6 4 – 5 ~ S G ( RI ) )
CL - USER > ( create - world )
( A 4 5 0 4 3 0 – 12 ~ S G ( NI PO DE ) )
In that last result there , you can see the that we have a Starport code of A , Size 4 , Atmosphere 5 , Hydrographics 0 , Population code 4 , Government code 3 , Law level 0 , Tech level 12 … there ’s no Naval Base , but there is a Scout Base and a Gas Giant .
Finally we have Trade codes Ni , Po , and De. Each position in the list corresponds to a result derived from a line of pseudo - code .
Conclusion
Lets take a quick look at what we got using this approach to solve our problem .
( Here ’s the complete code listing . )
First , the program logic for the overall thrust of the application fits neatly into a single screen .
This is extremely handy if you want to attempt to keep the entire program in your head at once .
( Note that habits developed while working with relational databases and modern OOP languages work against this outcome : those tools train you to break each piece up into their own separate table or code file . )
The pseudo code practically eliminates the need for code comments to document what ’s going on .
Not only are we at the opposite extreme of Perl ’s notorious “ right once read never ” methodology , but we can also make complex changes to the behavior of the application without writing new functions .
We can add new “ properties ” to our world objects without modifying any class definitions and we can open up our program to customization– even to people with an innate fear of parentheses !
Finally , the list processing routines can be reused in completely different applications .
In fact , the bulk of our code is more like abstract utilities than anything else .
So we have realized most of the promises of the Lisp advocates .
Paul Graham was right when he said that “ in Lisp , you do n’t just write your program down toward the language , you also build the language up toward your program . ”
And notice that we could do it without using the hard - core techniques like closures and macros that get all the press .
We could do it just using recursion and the built - in features of the humble list .
The key to our approach was not to think of our processes in terms of tables or objects or any other abstraction … but to instead try to express the problem as closely as possible to a natural pseudo - code notation .
We then built up our language to the point where we could actually execute the pseudo code .
While it was challenging to work out a few of the list processing routines , integrating our new language elements into the pseudo - code interpreter turned out to be a snap .
This approach may not be suited to everything you might want to code , but if readability , code reuse , and configurability are really important to you , this might be the way to go .
At any rate , programming this way is a lot more fun !
Okay … questions anybody ?
Yes … you over there in the “ I grok Spock ” shirt … .
“ But what about speed and efficiency ? ”
It may appear inefficient to make so many passes across each “ rule ” list in this example .
If speed matters , what we can do is alter our approach somewhat by developing a macro that transforms a pseudo code rule into a function .
These could then be compiled at run time , and our code will run about as fast as if it were all written directly in Lisp .
Yes .
Thank you .
Okay , you over there with the trendy Buddy Holly glasses ….
“ What ’s the next step in developing the application ? ”
Assuming that the premise of this program is not insane , the next step would be to write a set of thorough unit tests for our existing language elements .
Once we have the functions working correctly for all of the oddball cases , then we should look at adding some additional elements that improve the expressiveness of our custom pseudo code language .
In particular , I would like to have a : table directive that could process more complicated table look ups .
( I do n’t like having to have a separate associative list defined for the Government Tech and Starport Tech modifiers tables . )
Another thing to do is to carefully read the Common Lisp specification to help eliminate anywhere that I ’m inadvertently reinventing the wheel .
We ’ll want to look at our functions and try to determine if there ’s a way to make any of them even more generic than they already are so that when we pull them out into a utility file they ’ll be more useful in other programs .
Finally , we ’ll want to look at other world generation procedures and see if they can be implemented in our pseudo code without having to extend the language anymore .
Once we get that far , we know we ’ve accomplished something .
Okay … you in the turtle neck there ….
“ Yeah , uh , ca n’t I program in a similar style in the language I aleady use ? ”
Yes you can .
I ’ve coded similar applications in other languages myself .
The thing is , I started by googling for a utility that could evaluate strings into code .
It took me maybe a few minutes to extend the application with my own “ instant if ” function and things like that … but there ’s still this chunk of code there that I shamelessly munged off of someone else and that I might not completely understand .
In other languages you ’re much more likely to hack out a kludgey mess that only works well for a single class of problems – so unless you ’re really good you ’ll lose out in the code reuse department .
When you work with Common Lisp , you get a code evaluator out of the box for free and you ’re working with the overall idiom of the language .
You might spend a little more time working through some of your custom functions , but you end up with something that is completely transparent , understandable , and generically applicable .
Attempting this in other languages , there is a tendency to create applications in which you have an evaluator that ’s tacked onto ( and hardwired for ) a bunch of other code .
Notice that the way we worked here , we did n’t end up with an evaluator that was tacked on to a bunch of other stuff .
The evaluator was our program .
Once you begin to think in these terms , you can begin to develop applications which blur the lines between “ data ” and “ code logic ” in a much more creative manner .
It is this property that makes coding in Lisp so much fun .
Update 8/30/07 : A lisp hacker has rewritten my code to take advantage of more of the language ’s native features – eliminating a great deal of code in the process .
While the new iteration of the pseudo - code might be less non-lisper friendly than what I would prefer , you can still see a few places where I coded a function that already existed in the language .
Update 8/31/07 : I respond to feedback on this article here .

Antibiotic resistance propagates in bacteria by moving DNA strands containing the resistance genes to neighboring cells .
An enzyme called relaxase is essential for this process .
Bisphosphonates , already approved to treat bone loss , have now been shown to potently disrupt the relaxase function .
Some bisphosphonates prevent the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes and selectively kill bacterial cells that harbor resistance .

Putting bacteria on birth control could stop the spread of drug - resistant microbes , and researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have found a way to do just that .
The team discovered a key weakness in the enzyme that helps “ fertile ” bacteria swap genes for drug resistance .
Drugs called bisphosphonates , widely prescribed for bone loss , block this enzyme and prevent bacteria from spreading antibiotic resistance genes , the research shows .
Interfering with the enzyme has the added effect of annihilating antibiotic - resistant bacteria in laboratory cultures .
Animal studies of the drugs are now underway .
“ Our discoveries may lead to the ability to selectively kill antibiotic - resistant bacteria in patients , and to halt the spread of resistance in clinical settings , ” said Matt Redinbo , Ph.D. , senior study author and professor of chemistry , biochemistry and biophysics at UNC - Chapel Hill .
The study appears online the week of July 9 , 2007 , in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health .
The study provides a new weapon in the battle against antibiotic - resistant bacteria , which represent a serious public health problem .
In the last decade , almost every type of bacteria has become more resistant to antibiotic treatment .
These bugs cause deadly infections that are difficult to treat and expensive to cure .
Every time someone takes an antibiotic , the drug kills the weakest bacteria in the bloodstream .
Any bug that has a protective mutation against the antibiotic survives .
These drug - resistant microbes quickly accumulate useful mutations and share them with other bacteria through conjugation – the microbe equivalent of mating .
Conjugation starts when two bacteria smoosh their membranes together .
After each opens a hole in their membrane , one squirts a single strand of DNA to the other .
Then the two go on their merry way , one with new genes for traits such as drug resistance .
Many highly - drug resistant bacteria rely on an enzyme , called DNA relaxase , to obtain and pass on their resistance genes .
A mutation that provides antibiotic resistance can sweep through a colony as quickly as the latest YouTube hit .
The researchers analyzed relaxase because it plays a crucial role in conjugation .
The enzyme starts and stops the movement of DNA between bacteria .
“ Relaxase is the gatekeeper , and it is also the Achilles ’ heel of the resistance process , ” Redinbo said .
Led by graduate student Scott Lujan , the team suspected they could block relaxase by searching for vulnerability in a three - dimensional picture of the relaxase protein .
Lujan , a biochemistry graduate student in the School of Medicine , confirmed the hunch using x-ray crystallography , which creates nanoscale structural images of the enzyme .
The researchers predicted that the enzyme ’s weak link is the spot where it handles DNA .
Relaxase must juggle two phosphate - rich DNA strands at the same time .
The team suspected a chemical decoy – a phosphate ion – could plug this dual DNA binding site .
Redinbo , who has a background in cancer and other disease - related research , realized that bisphosphonates were the right - size decoy .
There are several bisphosphonates on the market ; two proved effective .
The drugs , called clodronate and etidronate , steal the DNA binding site , preventing relaxase from handling DNA .
This wreaks havoc inside E. coli bacteria that are preparing to transfer their genes , the researchers found .
Exactly how bisphosphonates destroy each bacterium is still unknown , Redinbo said , but the drugs are potent , wiping out any E. coli carrying relaxase .
“ That it killed bacteria was a surprise , ” he said .
By targeting these bacteria , the drugs act like birth control and prevent antibiotic resistance from spreading .
Redinbo , who cautions that the results only apply to E. coli , said further testing will reveal whether bisphosphonates also attack similar species like Acinetobacter baumannii ( hospital - acquired pneumonia ) , Staphylococcus aureus ( staph infections ) and Burkholderia ( lung infections ) .
“ We hope this discovery will help existing antibiotics or offer a new treatment for antibiotic - resistant bacteria , ” he said .
The drugs may be most effective at sites where clinicians can best control dosage – on skin and in the gastrointestinal tract , Redinbo said .
Other applications may include disinfectants and treatments for farm animals .
Study coauthors , all from UNC - Chapel Hill , include Laura Guogas , Heather Ragonese and Steven Matson .
Redinbo is a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center .
Redinbo and his colleagues have filed a patent and formed a small company to further develop the technology .

With loan defaults rising along with many mortgage payments , fast - growing numbers of homeowners are gambling on bankruptcy filings to try to stay in their homes .
Last month , as the nation 's housing slump continued , consumer bankruptcy filings increased almost 23 % from a year earlier -- representing nearly 69,000 people -- according to the American Bankruptcy Institute , a nonprofit research group whose members include bankruptcy attorneys , judges and lenders .
Overall , consumer bankruptcy filings were up 44.76 % during the first nine months of this year .
In some areas where the real - estate boom was especially heated , the increase in filings has been even sharper -- especially for a type of bankruptcy that allows homeowners to halt foreclosures on their homes .
The surge in filings has n't caught up with the flood of bankruptcy cases consumers launched in 2005 , as they raced to beat a change in federal law that made it harder for individuals to declare bankruptcy .
Even so , it shows the rising sense of insecurity many Americans feel as housing values fall , lending standards get tighter and hundreds of thousands of mortgages with low introductory interest rates " reset " to higher rates , boosting the homeowner 's monthly payments .
Most consumers filing for bankruptcy continue to do so under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
Under that provision , a person must forfeit certain assets -- including , in some cases , a portion of home equity .
Those assets are sold to pay off debts .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Show - business writers will go on strike early Monday after their negotiating team recommended a walkout over royalties that could immediately pinch late - night TV shows .
Timely programs like " The Daily Show with Jon Stewart " could be among the first affected .
The Writers Guild of America board voted unanimously to strike as of 12:01 a.m. Monday ( 3:01 a.m. ET ) , officials said .
The walkout will be the first in 20 years .
Steve Skrovan , a screenwriter for the Fox show " ' Til Death , " said a strike is all but inevitable .
" We 've never been more united and we are willing to deal -- and our decision - makers are at the table , " said Skrovan .
" Their decision - makers are not at the table and that tells you pretty much all you need to know about how the companies are pushing this . "
The news of a possible strike is not unexpected , said Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers President Nick Counter .
" By the WGA leadership 's actions at the bargaining table , we are not surprised by tonight 's recommendation , " Counter said in a statement on the AMPTP Web site .
" We are ready to meet and are prepared to close this contract this weekend . "
The labor impasse is over royalties from DVD sales -- last negotiated in 1988 .
Do n't Miss CNN / Money : Hollywood scripts own Halloween horror
Writers also want royalties from " new media " -- all the various places their works are now distributed , including Internet downloads .
" The future of TV is not going to look like what it 's been for the last 30 years , " said TV writer Dave Schiff , who has penned scripts for " King of the Hill " and " That ' 70s show . "
" So , you know it 's not just for us who are currently working , but writers down the line , that we make sure that we get a ... piece of the pie . "
Producers say the royalty issues are non-starters , but writers accuse producers of being nonresponsive .
" After 3 ½ months of bargaining , the AMPTP still has not responded to a single one of our important proposals , " a statement from the WGA said .
" Every issue that matters to writers , including Internet reuse , original writing for new media , DVDs , and jurisdiction , has been ignored .
This is completely unacceptable . "
TV writer Bryce Zabel agrees .
" It sounds like the producing companies that have decided to force the writers into a situation of a strike , " Zabel said late Thursday .
" So really , our choice right now is to accept a completely unacceptable deal or to go on strike .
" Strike is the only option . "
If Hollywood writers do go on strike , late - night television hosts like David Letterman , Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel , as well as programs like " The Daily Show " would feel the pinch first .
Watch how a strike could affect your favorite shows »
Because of their topical nature , networks do not typically shoot these shows in advance .
Daytime soaps normally stockpile about 30 days in advance and most prime - time shows would likely make it through the end of the year without any major impact on programming .
But networks would have to resort to reruns , news programs and reality shows to fill the schedule in 2008 if a strike were to drag on .
The film and television industry is responsible for an estimated 1.3 million jobs in the United States .
The union 's most recent strike , in 1988 , lasted 5 ½ months .
Industry estimates say a half - billion dollars was lost because of that walkout .

You can cut your home cooling costs in half easily , even eliminate them .
Cooling your house can be accomplished easily with proper planning .
The most important thing you need to take away from this lesson is …
Although your first thought for home cooling may be air conditioning , there are many alternatives that provide cooling with less energy use .
A combination of proper insulation , energy - efficient windows and doors , daylighting , shading , and ventilation will usually keep homes cool with a low amount of energy use in all but the hottest climates .
Ventilation Systems Ventilation is the least expensive and most energy - efficient way to cool buildings .
Ventilation works best when combined with methods to avoid heat buildup in your home .
In some cases , natural ventilation will suffice for cooling , although it usually needs to be supplemented with spot ventilation , ceiling fans and window fans .
For large homes , homeowners might want to investigate whole house fans .
Ventilation is ineffective in hot , humid climates where temperature swings between day and night are small .
In these climates , attic ventilation can help to reduce your use of air conditioning .
Ventilating your attic greatly reduces the amount of accumulated heat , which eventually works its way into the main part of your house .
Ventilated attics are about 30 °F ( 16°C ) cooler than unventilated attics .
Properly sized and placed louvers and roof vents help prevent moisture buildup and overheating in your attic .
Natural Ventilation Natural ventilation relies on the wind and the " chimney effect " to keep a home cool .
Natural ventilation works best in climates with cool nights and regular breezes .
The wind will naturally ventilate your home by entering or leaving windows , depending on their orientation to the wind .
When wind blows against your home , air is forced into your windows on the side facing into the wind , while a natural vacuum effect tends to draw air out of windows on the leeward ( downwind ) side .
In coastal climates , many seaside buildings are designed with large ocean - facing windows to take advantage of cooling sea breezes .
For drier climates , natural ventilation involves avoiding heat buildup during the day and ventilating at night .
The chimney effect relies on convection and occurs when cool air enters a home on the first floor or basement , absorbs heat in the room , rises , and exits through upstairs windows .
This creates a partial vacuum , which pulls more air in through lower - level windows .
The effect works best in open - air designs with cathedral ceilings and windows located near the top of the house , in clerestories , or in operable skylights .
Passive solar homes are often designed to take advantage of convection to distribute heat evenly through the home .
These homes are often amenable to natural ventilation by ventilating them near the top .
Natural ventilation can be enhanced or diminished through landscaping .
Depending on the house design and wind direction , a windbreak — like a fence , hedge , or row of trees that blocks the wind — can force air either into or away from nearby windows .
Ceiling Fans and Other Circulating Fans for home cooling
Circulating fans include ceiling fans , table fans , floor fans , and fans mounted to poles or walls .
These fans create a wind chill effect that will make you more comfortable in your home , even if it 's also cooled by natural ventilation or air conditioning .
Ceiling fans are considered the most effective of these types of fans , since they effectively circulate the air in a room to create a draft throughout the room .
If you use air conditioning , a ceiling fan will allow you to raise the thermostat setting about 4 °F with no reduction in comfort .
In temperate climates , or during moderately hot weather , ceiling fans may allow you to avoid using your air conditioner altogether .
Install a fan in each room that needs to be cooled during hot weather .
Ceiling fans are only appropriate in rooms with ceilings at least eight feet high .
Fans work best when the blades are 7 –9 feet above the floor and 10 – 12 inches below the ceiling .
Fans should be installed so their blades are no closer than 8 inches from the ceiling and 18 inches from the walls .
Larger ceiling fans can move more air than smaller fans .
A 36 - or 44 - inch diameter fan will cool rooms up to 225 square feet , while fans that are 52 inches or more should be used in larger rooms .
Multiple fans work best in rooms longer than 18 feet .
Small - and medium - sized fans will provide efficient cooling in a 4 - to 6 - foot diameter area , while larger fans are effective up to 10 feet .
Evaporative Coolers
In this example of an evaporative cooler , a small motor ( top ) drives a large fan ( center ) which blows air out the bottom and into your home .
The fan sucks air in through the louvers around the box , which are covered with water - saturated absorbent material .
In low - humidity areas , evaporating water into the air provides a natural and energy - efficient means of cooling .
Evaporative coolers , also called swamp coolers , rely on this principal , cooling outdoor air by passing it over water - saturated pads , causing the water to evaporate into it .
The 15 ° – 40 °F - cooler air is then directed into the home , and pushes warmer air out through windows .
When operating an evaporative cooler , windows are opened part way to allow warm indoor air to escape as it is replaced by cooled air .
Unlike central air conditioning systems that recirculate the same air , evaporative coolers provide a steady stream of fresh air into the house .
Evaporative home cooling cost about one - half as much to install as central air conditioners and use about one - quarter as much energy .
However , they require more frequent maintenance than refrigerated air conditioners and they 're suitable only for areas with low humidity .
In general , evaporative cooling can be used where :
1. temperatures are high ;
2. humidity is low ;
3. water can be spared for this use ; and
4. air movement is available ( from wind or electric fans ) .
Operation
An evaporative cooler should have at least two speeds and a vent - only option .
During vent - only operation , the water pump does not operate and the outdoor air is not humidified .
This lets you use the evaporative cooler as a whole - house fan during mild weather .
Control the cooler 's air movement through the house by adjusting window openings .
Open the windows or vents on the leeward side of the house to provide 1 – 2 square feet of opening for each 1,000 cfm of home cooling capacity .
Experiment to find the right windows to open and the correct amount to open them .
If the windows are open too far , hot air will enter .
If the windows are not open far enough , humidity will build up in the home .
You can regulate both temperature and humidity by opening windows in the areas you want to cool , and closing windows in unoccupied areas .
Where open windows create a security issue , install up - ducts in the ceiling .
Up - ducts open to exhaust warm air into the attic as cooler air comes in from the evaporative cooler .
Evaporative coolers installed with up - ducts will need additional attic ventilation .
Optional filters remove most of the dust from incoming air — an attractive option for homeowners concerned about allergies .
Filters can also reduce the tendency of some coolers to pull water droplets from the pads into the blades of the fan .
Most evaporative coolers do not have air filters as original equipment , but they can be fitted to the cooler during or after installation .
Two - Stage Evaporative Coolers
Two - stage evaporative coolers are newer and even more efficient .
They use a pre-cooler , more effective pads , and more efficient motors , and do n't add as much humidity to the home as single - stage evaporative coolers .
Because of their added expense , they are most often used in areas where daytime temperatures frequently exceed 100 °F .
Drawbacks of Evaporative Coolers Evaporative home cooling should not be used in humid climates because they add humidity .
Also , they cool your house down to a higher temperature than an air conditioner would .
They require maintenance ( albeit easy ) about once a month .
If the cooler is installed on the roof , there is some roof deterioration caused by routine maintenance trips .
A sunlit rooftop cooler will be about 1 °F less effective than a shaded cooler .
Rooftop maintenance also requires using a ladder , which may be an inconvenience .
By their nature , evaporative coolers also continually use water .
In areas with limited water supplies , homeowners may be concerned about the water - use impact of adding an evaporative cooler .
Absorption Home Cooling
In the more tropical portions of the Southern U.S. , where air temperatures peak above 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the day , humidity is high , and overall low night time temperatures remain above 80 degrees , a solar - powered “ absorption chiller ” can be used to reduce air temperature and humidity in the interior living quarters down as low as any human could possibly desire .
The absorption chiller concept is unfamiliar to most homebuyers , architects and builders today .
They are skeptical about everything that they do not understand .
In the 1920 ’s , this reliable , low - cost , noiseless , phase - change , absorption cooling technology was used extensively in “ gas refrigerators ” , especially in urban - and - rural homes that had no electricity .
Many modern designers are not familiar with the characteristics or economics of absorption home cooling .
It revived for use in Recreation vehicles .
A water - based absorption chiller can inexpensively drop the temperature down to 40 degrees .
Other non-water versions can go well below freezing for making ice , etc .
When powered by concentrated solar energy ( instead of 1920 ’s natural gas ) , absorption chillers cost almost nothing to operate , and have essentially nothing in them to wear out ( as do today ’s noisy , expensive , electromechanical freon - compressor - based air conditioners and refrigerators , which have to be replaced at high cost every few years ) .
The heat source causes circulation , fluid / gas phase change , and cooling .
Absorption home cooling is essentially an air conditioner driven not by electricity , but by a heat source such as natural gas , propane , solar - heated water , or geothermal - heated water .
Because natural gas is the most common heat source for absorption cooling , it is also referred to as gas - fired cooling .
Although mainly used in industrial or commercial settings , absorption coolers are now commercially available for large residential homes .
Absorption home cooling usually only makes sense in homes without an electricity source , but may also be employed to make use of renewable energy .
Absorption cooling is essentially a heat pump technology ; absorption coolers are absorption heat pumps that are not set up to allow their use as a heating device .
Tony Sale and a group of British vintage computer enthusiasts is rebuilding Colossus , the gigantic proto- computer that Alan Turing and the Bletchley Park scientists built to crack German codes during WWII .
The original Colossus machines were all broken up ( into pieces " no bigger than a man 's hand " ! ) after the war for security reasons , but Sale has tracked down the surviving Colossus engineers and is making great strides in completing the machine .
The finished Colossus is to be pitted against a contemporary general - purpose PC in a code - breaking race .
The raw fodder for the race is a set of messages encrypted using Nazi ciphers and transmitted by amateur radio enthusiasts in Germany .
It 's all in support of a new National Museum of Computing , based at Bletchley .
What a cool idea —
I 'm now officially planning a day - trip to Bletchley to see the museum .
He had no working machines to look at because , on Churchill 's orders , the Colossus machines were dismantled once the war was over .
Many parts , mostly the 1500 valves , went back to telephone exchanges and the rest were broken into pieces " no bigger than a man 's hand " .
Mr Sale has tracked down the few living engineers who worked on the project and plumbed their expertise to guide the rebuilding effort …
The German participants in the code - cracking challenge will transmit three enciphered messages – one hard , one very hard and one ultra hard .
The BBC's Rory Cellan - Jones said there was a " busy and business - like " atmosphere at Bletchley as the code cracking attempts got underway .
" We 've seen webcam video of the Germans preparing to send the first signals , " he said .

The specific advice can differ from specialist to specialist .
Some , like Dr. Weinstein , say most people can continue with the sport they love although they may need to cut back a bit , running shorter distances or going more slowly .
Others say to cross - train at least some of the time and others say the safest thing to do is to cross - train all the time until the pain is gone .
You might end up cycling instead of running , or swimming instead of playing tennis .
But unless it ’s something as serious as a broken bone or a ripped ligament or muscle , stopping altogether may be the worst thing to do .
“ We want to keep you moving , ” said Dr. William Roberts , a sports medicine specialist at the University of Minnesota and a past president of the American College of Sports Medicine .
“ Injured tissue heals better if it ’s under some sort of stress . ”
He and others acknowledge that the advice to keep moving may come as a surprise and that some doctors feel uncomfortable giving it , worried that their patients will do too much , make things worse and then blame their doctor .
“ I ’m not convinced this is part of every doctor ’s training or that everyone is ready to make it part of mainstream medicine , ” Dr. Roberts said .
“ You have to work with athletes a while to figure out how to do it and how to do it well . ”
“ The easy way out is to say , ‘ Do n’t exercise , ’ ” said Dr. Richard Steadman , an orthopedic surgeon in Vail , Colo. , and founder of the Steadman Hawkins Research Foundation , which studies the origins and treatment of sports injuries .
That advice , he added , “ is safe and you probably will have healing over time . ”
But , he said , “ if the injury is not severe , resting it will probably prolong recovery . ”

Shown in this false - color image , a backlit view of the moon 's southern limb , the majestic , icy plumes were discovered by instruments on the Cassini Spacecraft during close encounters with Enceladus in November of 2005 .
Eight source locations for these geysers have now been identified along substantial surface fractures in the moon 's south polar region .
Researchers suspect the geysers arise from near - surface pockets of liquid water with temperatures near 273 kelvins ( 0 degrees C ) .
That 's hot when compared to the distant moon 's surface temperature of 73 kelvins ( - 200 degrees C ) .
The cryovolcanism is a dramatic sign that tiny , 500 km - diameter Enceladus is surprisingly active .
Enceladus ice geysers also likely produce Saturn 's faint but extended E ring .
Four Fantastically Cheap Investing Tips !
4. Befriend A Mentally Disturbed Mathematical Genius
Although he lies awake at night writhing from the pain and insomnia of incessant equations and unsolved problems bequeathed by long - dead , equally tortured mathematicians , this poor soul can be your gateway to riches !
All you have to do is support his failing bodily functions by coming by twice a day to remind him to eat and bathe in between pondering the great enigmas of numerology and you will have gained his trust enough to tell him you want to try something .
Then he will let you lay out all the stock pages from the last year , glued to the walls , ceiling and floor of his apartment , at which point connections and correlations will erupt like chain lightning in his delusional , but brilliant brain .
Remember to hire someone else to feed him when you are rich .
3. Learn How To Interpret The Federal Reserve 's Cryptic Body Language
While Ben Bernanke is careful to keep his lips sealed lest the markets be upset by some gaffe , his hips , like Shakira 's , do n't lie .
Widely expected to lower rates this week , his body language is telling a different story .
It is saying " You .
American investors .
You think you 're all that but you are not .
I 'm not going to bail you out of this one , you irrationally exuberant cads .
I 'm going to punish you by raising interest rates and nipping inflation in the bud .
You will thank me later .
Hold me . "
Start shorting bonds and t- bills at the current rate .
2. Incorporate Yourself Under A Chinese Name
Everyone knows
China is going to be growing at roughly twice the rate of America for the next few decades .
What most Americans do not know , however , is anything about China .
So start making some poisonous but brightly colored children 's food and sand - bag diapers , because in Idaho , if it 's not tater - based , then they 're fucking stumped .
While you 're at it , just go ahead and just name your company the Kung Fu Manchu Ding Dong Huey Looey N. Dooey Bruce Lee Manufacturing Company .
Otherwise people wo n't know it 's Chinese .
1. Squatters ' Rights
When it comes to a return on capital , nothing beats the return on zero .
Enshrined in the forgotten back pages of American law , dating back to the days of the Frontier , anyplace that 's not currently used , maintained , wanted , or healthy can be yours provided you move there and improve it .
Patience and the willingness to live somewhere other humans naturally flee is all that 's needed to start your real - estate empire from scratch .
Scratch , by the way , is what squatters call the dish they make out of paint - flakes , rainwater , and cockroaches .
You 'll be making a lot of scratch .
We recommend trying to sell some scratch to less - enterprising squatters , unless they are dead , in which case you may eat them , because that will taste and sell better than scratch .
X Windowシステムの良い点は、リモートコンピュータで実行されているXアプリケーションをローカルコンピュータに表示する機能があることだ。Microsoft
Windowsの良くない点は、Xアプリケーションを表示する標準機能がまったくないことだ。仕事でWindowsを使っているが、Linuxアプリケーションも同時に使いたい場合、Xmingが役に立つ。Xmingは、X WindowシステムとMicrosoft Windowsを結ぶ、フリーで使いやすいポートである。
Xmingは、GNU General Public License version 2 （GPLv2）によってライセンスが供与され、使いやすいインストーラ付きのWindows実行可能ファイルのパッケージとして提供されている。X Windowサーバだけが必要な場合 — つまり完全なUnix型の環境は必要ない場合 — Cygwin/XよりもXmingを選ぶのが妥当である。また、Xmingは開発の活発さでも勝っている。Cygwin/Xは（ホームページの記述によれば）2004年以来アップデートされていない。
Xmingのインストールは簡単だ。Xmingプロジェクトのページを開き、リリースのセクションを参照しよう。絶対欲しい機能が最新の開発段階のリリースに含まれていない限り、おそらく安定版のリリースを使うのが妥当だろう。最新のXmingを取得し、セットアップウィザードを実行する（OpenGLではなくMesaレンダラを使う必要がある古いクライアントの場合は、Xming-mesaを取得する）。インストールが終了するまで1分ほどだ。おそらくXming-fontsインストーラも取得して、コアXフォントをインストールする必要もある。これらのパッケージのインストールが完了すれば、XをWindowsで実行する準備は終了となる。
始めてみよ う
Xmingをインストールする過程で、デスクトップにXLaunchというショートカットが作成される。これをダブルクリックするとダイアログが表示され、Xmingでプログラムを表示する方法をマルチウィンドウ、シングルウィンドウ、全画面表示、タイトルバーなしのシングルウィンドウのいずれかに選択できる。
どのウィンドウ表示を選ぶかは、予定している使い方次第である。数種類のプログラムを同時に表示するために複数のウィンドウをWindowsデスクトップに開くこともあれば、X
Display Manager Control Protocol（XDMCP）を使ってコンピュータに接続してデスクトップ全体をWindowsコンピュータに表示することもある。
複数のプログラムを個別のウィンドウで実行する場合は、「Multiple Windows」を選択する。このとき、表示番号をダイアログの下部で設定することもできる。これが最初の接続であれば、番号は0のままでかまわない。複数のX接続を作成するには、1、2、3と番号を割り振る。この設定を忘れると、後続のセッションを起動しようとしたときにエラーになる。
次のウィンドウでは、セッションのタイプを選択する。今回の接続に関しては、「
Start a program 」を選択し て「 Next 」 をクリックする 。
次のダイアログでは 、 「 Run Remote 」 をクリックし 、 「 Using PuTTY 」の横にあるラジオボタンをクリックし、ユーザーとホストの情報を入力する。ここでパスワードを入力しないでおくと、Xmingがリモートシステムに接続する時点でパスワードの入力が要求されることになる。
ここまで順調に進んだと仮定すると、リモートシステムからxtermが表示される。xtermを使って操作するか、xtermからXアプリケーションを起動してXmingを通じてローカルシステムに表示することができる。
また、リモートシステムに接続する際にxterm以外を実行することもできる。その場合は、「 Start program」ダイアログで、xtermの代わりに実行するプログラムの名前を入力する。このとき、プログラムの名前がドロップダウンボックスに表示される。このボックスはプログラムをリストから選択するためだけのもののように見えるが、実際には任意のプログラム名を直接入力することもできる。なお、私の好みはxtermなどの端末プログラムを使う方法で、これだとプログラムをいくつでも起動できる。
手持ちのXアプリケーション（xcalcなど）とGNOMEやKDEのアプリケーション（Epiphany、Konqueror、Gnome-terminalなど）を片っ端からXmingで起動してみたが、アプリケーションの動作に問題はなかった。Microsoft Windowsの標準タイトルバーなどがあることを除けば、アプリケーションはLinuxで動いているとしか見えない。
デスクトップ全体の実行
また 、Xmingを使っ てWindowsコンピュータをX端末（に近いもの）として動かすこともできる。先ほどと同様にXLaunchアイコンをダブルクリックし、今回は「
One Window 」 か「 Fullscreen 」を選択する。次に、「 Session type 」ダイアログ で「 Open session via XDMCP 」 を選択する。次に表示されるダイアログで、接続先のホストを指定するか、XDMCPサーバを自動で検出するようにXmingに指示する。
次のダイアログでは、他のパラメータを追加で指定できる。おそらくXmingに上記以外のパラメータを指定する必要はないだろうが、リモートフォントサーバを指定する場合などは、このダイアログで作業を行うことになる。
最後に設定を保存しておくと、後で必要になったときに再利用できる。「
Finish」をクリックすると、接続先のシステムでXログインマネージャが実行していることがローカルコンピュータに映し出されるはずだ。
Xmingは使いやすいツールであり、Windowsを使わざるをえない人々に素晴らしいXサーバを提供する。フリーソフトウェアなので、Windows用の商用Xサーバと比べて費用の面ではるかに優れているうえ、リリースも頻繁に行われているため、これからも長く使い続けることができるはずだ。

This is a very good point from Dean Baker .
We ’re told that we must n’t regulate subprime lending , despite the vast wave of foreclosures it has produced , because to do so would prevent minorities and other disadvantaged Americans from achieving the dream of homeownership .
Yet homeownership is already back down to about what it was before the big wave of subprime lending began .
All that the wonders of the financial market achieved , it seemed , was to give a lot of people a brief taste of homeownership , followed by a nasty foreclosure .
Do you remember all those books from the 1980s and ’90s explaining why the United States could n’t keep up with Japan ?
Once they were proved wrong , pundits came forth with a new batch of titles to explain why the American boom might last forever .
The masterwork of the genre was “ Dow 36,000 . ”
After the Dow sank , the optimists took a few years off before re-emerging .
My favorite recent entry on the shelf of misbegotten titles was “ Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom ? ” from 2005 .
Making economic predictions , suffice it to say , is often a fool ’s game , but it is played with particular relish every time the calendar turns to a new year .
Today , let ’s try a slightly different approach .
There is no way to know what 2007 will bring .
You can make a pretty good argument that the country is due for a financial crisis — or that the economy is about to swing up again .
But while the answer may be uncertain , it ’s clear that the single biggest economic question of the year will probably be this :
Will the surge in the paychecks of ordinary Americans continue in 2007 ?
In 2006 , a slowly improving job market finally grew strong enough to bring solid pay increases to most workers .
Thanks to falling oil prices , meanwhile , inflation plummeted .
As a result , the real average wage of rank - and - file workers — a group that makes up about 80 percent of the work force — has risen more than 2 percent over the last year .
That pace has been reached only one other time in the last three decades , at the peak of the great 1990s boom .

Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $ 100 using Amazon 's storage , grid , and queuing services platform ?
It appears so , at least for the right application .
Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll - your - own versus the connect - the - dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services .
Their argument is strong .
Using Amazon 's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make , a pile of money to create , and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain .
Yet Amazon does n't provide SLAs , so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels ?
Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon 's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services .
The battle for the future is on .
Site : http://aws.amazon.com/
Information Sources
Amazon Services Home .
Platform
Amazon ECS ( E - Commerce Service )
Amazon S3 ( simple storage service )
Amazon SQS ( simple queuing service )
Amazon EC2 ( grid service )
Amazon Web Search Service
Amazon Flexible Payments Service ( Amazon FPS )
REST and SOAP Service Interfaces
What 's Inside ?
Why use external services ?
Amazon 's services replace the boxes , wires , and disk drives part of the application stack .
Amazon has spent ten years and over $ 1 billion developing a world - class web service that millions of customers use every day .
Maybe you can leverage that experience for your site ?
Focus on the customer .
70 % if Web Development is n't about providing customer value .
It 's about building and managing data centers .
Your efforts would be better spent on your customers and not plumbing .
Quicker to market .
Scaling is hard .
Let someone else worry
about that while you concentrate on adding user value .
Designing for peak load is expensive .
So turn fixed costs into variable costs .
Say you want to handle high traffic flows from slashdot or digg , or you have high seasonal demand , having the infrastructure in place to handle those loads is a high fixed cost .
You could use that money better elsewhere .
It make sense to create an infrastructure where you can automatically and
temporarily scale resources to handle peak demand .
High reliability and availability .
A dedicated service may be more reliable than a service you could create .
It say " may " because Amazon does n't provide an SLA , so you wont get any guarantees .
The idea is that Amazon is cheap enough and reliable enough that the few failures will be acceptable .
Besides , SLAs usually just refund some money when things go wrong , they
do n't really guarantee anything .
It 's a cheap CDN .
Amazon 's storage network could serve a relatively inexpensive content delivery network .
This option is discussed in
Reducing Your Website 's Bandwidth Usage .
The idea is that just the frequent downloading of a simple favicon.ico
file can use a significant portion of your bandwidth .
Using S3 for $ 2 / month to offload 90 % of your bandwidth to an external host is a good deal .
However , without an SLA S3 can't be thought of as a proper CDN .
Amazon ECS ( E - Commerce Service )
This service exposes Amazon 's product data and e-commerce functionality :
Detailed Product Information on all Amazon.com Products , Access to Product Images , All Customer Reviews associated with a Product , etc .
Amazon products are aggressively priced .
I found this service disappointing .
If you want to build a store on top of Amazon it seems great , but I did n't see a way to add your own products to the store , so I do n't think it 's generally useful .
Amazon S3 ( simple storage service )
This service stores data in Amazon 's storage network .
$ .15 per GPB per month storage
$ .01 for 1000 to 10000 requests .
$ .10 - $.17 per GB data transfer .
The service is : fast , relaible , scalable , redundant , dispersed .
You can have per object URLs .
This means you can reference an image or other file directly with a URL , so it 's usable in a web page .
Typical use : CDN and backup storage .
Storage is distributed to multiple locations so you get a level of geographical distribution .
Amazon SQS ( simple queuing service )
This service provides an internet scale queuing service for storing messages .
Distributed actors put work on the queue and take work off the queue .
$ .10 per 1000 messages .
$ .10 - $.18 per GB data transfer .
This service is : scalable , elastic , reliable , simple , secure .
Typical use : a centralized work queue .
You put jobs on the queue and different actors can pop work of the queue and process them when they get CPU time .
Expected message latency , as of 2007 , was 2 - 10 seconds .
This is horrible for many applications , not bad for many others .
Part of scalability .
Have any number of producers and consumers .
You do n't worry about it .
Queues are spread across multiple machines and multiple data centers .
Amazon EC2 ( grid service )
This service provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud .
It is designed to make web - scale computing easier for developers .
Basically you create a Xen image for your Linux distro and upload it into their " elastic compute cloud . "
Using an API you can then start as many instances as you like .
Typical use : transcoding , audio work , load testing .
Root level access to the server and full control over the machine .
Can scale up and scale down on a minute - by - minute basis .
For real - time processing one criticism has been slow CPUs ( 1.75 Ghz Xeon ) .
This probably wo n't be a problem if your application is written to linearly scale .
An EC2 instance is not persistent so you can't store a database there .
You have some local storage , but it goes away when the instance goes away .
Takes a few minutes to start and stop images , so it 's not really on demand .
You can add anything you want to an image .
If you want a database you can add it in .
GigaVox Media Example Web - Scale Architecture
You can start to see how Amazon 's services can work together .
Let 's say you have a large batch of MP2s you would like transcode to MP3s .
You would store the original media into S3 , queue the work request into SQS , and have instances running in EC2 to take work of the queue and perform the transcoding , storing the results back into S3 .
And this is exactly what GigaVox does .
GigaVox is a podcasting company .
- They take original recordings and transcode them say from MP2 to MP3 .
Many other transcodings are also performed .
- Then these chunks of media are assembled together into a delivery format based on building a show .
For example , old podcasts can be reassembled each night with up to date advertisements .
- To do this at scale would take a lot of costly resources .
Using Amazon 's services GigaVox gets geographically redundancy and failover for relatively inexpensive CPU , bandwidth , and storage charges ,
and bandwidth costs .
You have no boxes or wires .
No data center to manage .
And you can grow with small fixed costs .
Messages are time stamped on the queue .
If the message waited in the queue for too long then they can start more EC2 images .
You can balance costs .
You could also layer in a customer based priority mechanism .
They have each instance have its own messaging queue for command and control .
For security reasons they upload files through ftp to instances rather than going through S3 .
All bandwidth withing the Amazon cloud is free .
This is an important business consideration for making the services work together .
Another set of instances and queues handles assembling the delivered media .
Allows GigaVox to deliver value to their customer at a low startup cost .
Lessons Learned
Build or buy is always a difficult decision .
If a service does n't work then you may lose your customers and there 's nothing more you can do other send yet another urgent email to nobody in particular .
This is a horrible feeling .
Yet , if it does work you could be way ahead of the game .
How to choose ?
That would be telling :-)
Build a layer of virtualization so you can switch to another provider when they become available or so you can replace it with your own service .
This lessens your dependency on Amazon in the event they get tired of offering services or their performance deteriorates .
As a startup using Amazon services is n't a big risk because you are already in a risky situation .
And any risk is moderated by the very low cost of starting up and money is always an issue for startups .
For many use cases buying your own dedicated servers may still be a better approach as you get more control , lower latency , and the same hardware is usable for multiple purposes .
Software as a service is a powerful and practical idea .
It changes how you build software .
It forces you to layer your software around interfaces .
And once your software is composed of interfaces you have loosely coupled components that can be easily replaced .
You also have the basis for a platform API should you ever want to provide an API you your customers .
The highest level of development would to use the same API you give your customers to build your service .
Loosely coupled , message based architectures combined with service interfaces allow you to think several levels up the abstraction layer .
You do n't have to wallow in the muck , which frees you how to structure your application using large scale blocks of behavior .
Designing a UI for an asynchronous interactive interface poses some challenges .
It may take a while to perform an operation , so how do you interact with the user to handle that ?
Instinctively I doubted Amazon could deliver .
But if you have the right type of problem , you really can do a lot of work cheaply using Amazon services .

The mystery illness that has bedeviled U.S. beekeepers since 2006 may stem from a bee virus that apparently spread to the U.S. from Australia three years ago , according to a new study that marks the first big break in the puzzling case of the disappearing bees .
Researchers performed a sophisticated genetic comparison of healthy and diseased U.S. colonies that revealed the presence of Israeli acute paralysis virus ( IAPV ) , an obscure but lethal bee bug , in almost all beekeeping operations affected by " colony collapse disorder " ( CCD ) , but in only a single healthy one they examined .
" We have n't proven this is the cause .
It is a candidate for being a trigger for CCD , " says W. Ian Lipkin , director of the center for infection and immunology at Columbia University 's Mailman School of Public Health , one of the study 's lead members .
The disorder may also result from a combination of poor nutrition , pesticides and other factors , including infection , Lipkin and his colleagues say .
They add that time - consuming tests are needed to determine whether IAPV can trigger CCD alone or in concert with other stressors , or whether certain combinations of stressors instead make hives vulnerable to the virus .
Israeli virologists discovered IAPV three years ago after investigating unexplained cases of dead bees piled in front of hives .
The new study found the virus in samples of Australian bees , which were first imported to the U.S. three years ago .
If IAPV is the main trigger , researchers say , honeybees worldwide could be bred with strains of bees resistant to the virus , perhaps rescuing our nation 's most economically valuable pollinator .
Bees are estimated to provide pollination valued at $ 15 billion every year and are already worked to the limit .
Half of the nearly 2.5 million hives in the U.S. alone are needed to pollinate almond crops .
Late last year , reports surfaced that adult honeybees were mysteriously abandoning commercial colonies , leaving ghost hives full of honey , larvae and unattended queens .
The disorder wiped out an average of 45 percent of bees among the 23 percent of commercial U.S. beekeepers affected last winter .
Researchers and conspiracy theorists have offered a number of potential explanations , from parasitic varroa mites to chemical pesticides to cell phone radiation that leads bees astray .
Entomologists Diana Cox -Foster of Pennsylvania State University and Jeffery Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Research Service Bee Research Laboratory formed the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group to try to solve the mystery .
A key line of evidence suggested that infection plays a major role :
The group found they could restore empty CCD hives to health by restocking them with fresh bees — but only if they first irradiated the hives with gamma rays , which destroy DNA .
Based on that evidence , Cox -Foster and Pettis convinced Lipkin , who led the discovery of West Nile virus , to take up the case , using specialized technology manufactured by genome sequencing firm 454 Life Sciences in Branford , Conn .
The trio and their colleagues lumped together RNA — the chemical that encodes active genes — from four geographically separated commercial operations stricken with CCD and compared it with the combined RNA of apparently healthy bees from Hawaii and Pennsylvania .
They also scanned seemingly healthy bees from Australia and imported royal jelly from China , which queen bees use to nourish young workers .
Overall , CCD bees carried more types of harmful microorganisms than healthy bees , the researchers report in the online edition of Science .
To identify potential culprits , they analyzed individual hives .
IAPV showed up in 25 of 30 diseased operations but in only one healthy colony from the U.S. , they report .
In contrast , all CCD hives contained a related virus called KBV along with a single - celled parasite Nosema ceranae , which a prior study had linked with CCD — but both organisms were present in about 80 percent of the healthy hives , too .
" The paper is a model of careful investigation , " says entomologist Gene Robinson , director of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign 's bee research facility , who was not involved in the study .
IAPV seems to be either a cause of or a marker for the disease , he says .
" Either way , it 's the first big breakthrough in the CCD story , so it 's very exciting and very encouraging . "
The smoking gun , Lipkin says , would be to infect healthy or stressed bees with IAPV and see if they catch CCD .
The researchers plan to carry out such tests , but isolating the virus is challenging , he adds .
A broader sampling of diseased and healthy colonies from around the world would also help narrow down what causes the disease , Robinson says .
Lipkin and co-workers found that seemingly healthy Australian bees were infected with the virus and point out that all of the CCD hives they examined included or spent time near imported Australian bees .
Beekeepers from Down Under have reported a " disappearing disease " but not on the scale of CCD , Pettis said during a press conference Wednesday .
One difference , he said , could be parasitic varroa mites , which suppress bees ' immune systems and have driven down the U.S. bee population by 30 percent in the last 25 years , but are not found in Australia .
" We know it 's a primary stressor , " he added .
" I still believe that multiple factors are involved in CCD and we must test [ them ] in a more rigorous fashion . "
The researchers only found varroa mites in half of the diseased U.S. hives .
They note , however , that it is possible a mite - killing chemical applied by beekeepers may have killed the parasites off after they did their damage , or the chemical itself could have harmed the bees .
IAPV seems to have first killed bees in Israel in 2002 , and since then has caused a varying number of deaths each year , says plant virologist Ilan Sela of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , whose group identified the virus , which causes dying bees ' wings to shiver .
" I was told by the Israeli [ beekeeping ] extension people that there are some recent indications for a small - scale CCD - like phenomenon in Israel , " he says , adding that he has yet to test the afflicted bees for the virus .
If IAPV is causing CCD , there is hope of stopping its spread .
About 30 percent of the bees Sela examined have incorporated pieces of the IAPV genome into their chromosomes and are resistant to the virus .
Other bees could be bred to carry those fragments and presumably survive infection , too , he says .
But he cautions that IAPV could in theory be causing CCD by inserting its genetic material into bee genes for pheromones or other molecules that coordinate hive behavior , thereby disrupting those genes , a possibility that he and the CCD working group plan to test .
Until researchers have cracked the CCD mystery , Cox -Foster advised beekeepers Wednesday to keep their bees well fed and free of mites .
Advocacy group files FOIA request seeking answers about DOJ ' net neutrality ' ruling Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday September 13 , 2007
Print This Email This A public interest group has filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request with the Justice Department seeking details about " whether industry lobbyists or White House politics unduly influenced " the Department 's Sept. 6 filing against " net neutrality . "
Internet service providers want to charge additional fees to content providers in exchange for access to enhanced service .
In other words , they seek to make the Internet " un-neutral , " whereby sites with more money could pay for their pages to load faster on different ISPs .
Free Press , the " non partisan media reform group " that organizes the Save the Internet coalition , filed the request , stating in a press release that " The most recent anti-Net Neutrality filing came during Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ' last days at the helm of the Justice Department .
It followed recent revelations that the government and AT&T had conspired in far - reaching efforts to spy on Americans without legal warrant -- efforts for which the Bush administration is now seeking to give immunity from prosecution to AT&T and other phone companies . "
In its comments earlier this month , made in response to an inquiry from the FCC , the Department 's Antitrust Division warned that some aspects of net neutrality could act as a deterrent against innovation and upgrade among broadband internet service providers .
" Consumers and the economy are benefiting from the innovative and dynamic nature of the Internet , " said Thomas Barnett , Assistant Attorney General at the Antitrust Division .
" Regulators should be careful not to impose regulations that could limit consumer choice and investment in broadband facilities . "
" The filing lacks any evidence of serious investigation into this critical issue and fits into a pattern of politically motivated decisions coming out of the Justice Department , " Marvin Ammori , general counsel of Free Press said in the press release .
Noting that the filing came after the close of the FCC 's formal comment period , Ammori added , " We want to know if the Bush administration 's lawyers reached out to any of the thousands of groups , businesses or individuals who support Net Neutrality -- or if they only talked to industry lobbyists at AT&T and Verizon . "
" It 's time we had a national broadband policy that replaces duopoly control with the kind of healthy competition we need to achieve universal , affordable high - speed Internet access that benefits everyone -- not just AT&T , said Ben Scott , policy director of Free Press .

I 'm from Italy and many of you do n't even know what are they are talking about .
Many of the comments are just a bunch of clichés from haters and morons .
There are different parts in our police , some of them is " civil police " ( like Polizia di Stato , or Polizia Municipale ) and some other is " military police " ( like Esercito Italiano ) , some both ( like Carabinieri ) .
They have diffent goals and tasks to do .
Of course different goals means different tools to achieve it .
For example polizia municipale can do things like help scholars cross the road or make a fine to a driver .
They do n't need to be heavy armed : a stiletto for personal defence will do ( if anything is ever needed at all ! ) .
They mostly patrol our streets looking for potentially troubling situations but rarely they are involved in " big troubles " .
On the other hand , for example , Carabinieri , which actively fight crime and have both tasks of military police and civil police , are heavy armed , and there are little to no woman involved in tough operations ( because of less personal strenght ) .
So I do n't see why this is seen as stupid ... funny ?
yes , of course .
But we do n't use the " manganello " from Mussolini era anymore ( unless necessary of course ) .
We can't afford to buy expensive things like stun rods and such because our politicians waste or steal all of our resources .
To all the haters : go **** yourself , as we have a lot of defects , but if you judge us the common people , from the individuals that internationally rapresent us , then you have no idea of what a real Italiano is .
Manager Jill Whittingham said they had no idea who donated the book
The book , which dates back to 1898 , was discovered at the branch of Oxfam in Nantwich , South Cheshire - appropriately inside a handbag .
Staff at the shop said they had no idea who donated the items , and have put the book on sale for £ 650 .
The book has a mark in the front cover saying it was number 349 out of a total of 1,000 printed copies .
The shop 's manager Julie Whittingham said : " We have absolutely no idea who brought it in .
" That sort of thing is a one - in - a - million chance for shop like this - it 's very exciting .
" Someone could have easily come across it and just put it out in the shop , thinking it was a bit battered and probably just worth about £ 4.99 .
We 've had it checked and verified and it 's fantastic for us . "
One of the lead characters in the play is said to have been found in a handbag at Victoria railway station .

While I ’m not always a fan of sticking strictly to the ‘ rules ’ or ‘ guidelines ’ of photography I think they can be well worth knowing and keeping in the back of your mind as you shoot ( whether it ’s so you can follow them or break them for effect ) .
Here ’s four ‘ rules ’ for landscape photography that might be helpful for those just starting out ( ie they ’re not meant as a definitive guide but rather a starting point ) :
1. Diagonal Lines
Using diagonal lines can be a very effective way of drawing the eye of those viewing an image into it and to the main focal point .
The ‘ lines ’ need not be actual lines – they could be the shape of a path , a line of trees , a fence , river or any other feature in an image .
Converging lines ( two or more lines coming from different parts of an image to a single point ) can be all the more effective .
Read more about using Diagonal Lines in your digital photography .
2. Geometric Shapes
By positioning key aspects of a landscape on points of a geometric shape you can help create a balanced composition .
Perhaps the most common and easiest way to do this is to use a ‘ triangle ’ shape between objects in an image with three objects in a frame positioned with one to each side and one more central .
Using Geometric
Shapes in this way is n’t something that I ’ve done a lot of – but it is one technique to get balance in a shot and if you ’re clever , to lead the eye into it ( in a similar way to the diagonal lines rule above ) .
You can see this illustrated ( to a point ) in the photomontage image to the right .
3. The Rule of Thirds
The Rule of Thirds gets trotted out more often than any other in all types of photography and is one of the first rules of composition taught to most photography students .
While sometimes it can feel a little cliche it can also be a very effective technique in landscapes ( although keep in mind that breaking this ( and other rules ) can also produce dramatic and interesting shots ) .
Position key points of interest in a landscape on the intersecting point between imaginary ‘ third ’ points in an image and you ’ll help give your image balance and help those focal points to really capture attention .
Read more about using the Rule of Thirds in composing your shots .
4. Framing Images
While adding points of interest to a foreground is an important technique for adding interest to landscape shots – a similar technique is to ‘ frame ’ the shot by adding interest to other parts of the edges of an image .
Perhaps the most common way of framing a landscape shot is to include an overhanging branch in the upper section of a shot .
Similarly framing a shot with a bridge might work .

Rules are Made to Be Broken ?
Of course while knowing the rules can be important – knowing when to use them and when to break them is a talent that great photographers generally have .
Practice these techniques – but do n’t get so worked up about them that they kill the creativity that you have .
Let me finish with a quote about Rules of Photography from Photographer Edward Weston to help give us a little balance on the topic :
“ To consult the rules of composition before making a picture is a little like consulting the law of gravitation before going for a walk .
Such rules and laws are deduced from the accomplished fact ; they are the products of reflection . ”

KARACHI , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
At least 136 people were killed and more than 387 wounded around midnight Thursday in a suicide bombing near a motorcade carrying former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , who returned to the country earlier in the day after eight years of self - imposed exile , according to hospital and police sources .
Bhutto , recently returned to Pakistan , is helped from her vehicle following the bombing .

Bhutto and those with her were unhurt , and her companions said she reached her family home safely .
Video footage showed her exiting the bullet - and blast - proof vehicle after the blasts .
Pakistan 's president , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , called Bhutto Friday to condemn the bombing and assure her that an independent investigation will be completed as soon as possible , his office said .
She apparently had moved from the roof of the vehicle inside and downstairs just moments before the blasts .
" I can see body parts strewn all over the road , " said CNN 's Dan Rivers , at the scene .
" There are dead bodies everywhere .
...
It is a large - scale attack , by the looks of things . "
Authorities believe the suicide bomber was on foot and threw a grenade to attract attention before setting of the second , major blast , Karachi police chief Azhar Farooqi told CNN .
The bomber is believed to have acted alone .
Police do not think a car bomb was involved , he said .
Nearby cars were burned but police do not believe a bomb was inside the car .
He would not say who authorities believe was behind the bombing , citing the ongoing investigation .
" Although the truck that Benazir Bhutto was riding on was surrounded by police cars , so the suicide bomber could not get onto the truck and could not get anywhere near it , so he blew himself up and that has caused many casualties , mostly among the policemen who were riding beside the truck , " Tariq Azim Khan , Pakistani information minister , told CNN .
Other officials said at least one bomb apparently had been placed in a car on the street where Bhutto 's supporters had gathered to see her convoy pass .
One witness told Rivers he saw a car with three people inside explode .
Watch witnesses describe what happened »
Video footage showed a chaotic scene after the explosions , with crowds of people trying to flee as emergency vehicles jammed streets .
Other footage showed wounded victims writhing on a road , awaiting medical attention , and at least one fire apparently sparked by the blasts .
The windshield of the vehicle Bhutto was riding in was smashed by the blasts , Rivers said , and a vehicle that was following hers was burned out .
The scene , he said , was " absolutely horrendous , " with blood running in streams down the street .
Because the streets were crowded with supporters who had turned out to greet Bhutto , ambulances had difficulty reaching the scene immediately after the blasts .
Onlookers resorted to ferrying the injured to hospitals in private cars .
Rivers said he and his crew , filming the convoy just before the blasts , remarked on the lack of security surrounding it .
It was possible to walk right up to the side of her vehicle without being stopped , he said .
Qasim Zia , a leader of Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party , was riding on Bhutto 's vehicle and told CNN one of his bodyguards was killed and another seriously hurt .
The wounded included at least 20 leaders of the party , he said , and most of those killed were members of security forces or police who were surrounding Bhutto's truck at the time of the explosions .
Had it not been for heightened security measures in place , Bhutto could have been wounded or killed , he said .
The bomb detonated as Bhutto's motorcade was nearing the tomb of Muhammad Ali Jinnah , who led Pakistan to independence and championed equal rights for all Pakistani citizens regardless of their religion .
Bhutto had planned to stop and pray at the tomb , then deliver a speech to her supporters .
The United States was swift to condemn what it called " terrorist attacks in Karachi during peaceful political demonstrations . "
" There is no political cause that can justify the murder of innocent people , " State Department spokesman Tom Casey said in a written statement .
White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said , " extremists will not be allowed to stop Pakistanis from selecting their representatives through an open and democratic process . "
United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon also issued a statement condeming the bombing , and British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said he was " appalled " by the " horrific " attacks .
The terrorist watch group IntelCenter said the death toll from the bombing places it among the top 10 deadliest terror attacks within the past nine years .

A U.S. study found that religiously focused physicians do n't disproportionately care for poor and underserved patients .
The study -- conducted by Drs. Farr Curlin , Lydia Dugdale , John Lantos and Marshall Chin at the University of Chicago and Yale New Haven Hospital -- examined whether physicians ' self - reported religious characteristics and sense of calling in their work were associated with focusing their practice on underserved patients .
The researchers said they found physicians who were more likely to report practice among the underserved included those who were highly spiritual , those who strongly agreed their religious beliefs influenced their practice of medicine and those who strongly agreed the family in which they were raised emphasized service to the poor .
Physicians who were more religious in general , as measured by intrinsic religiosity or frequency of attendance at religious services , were much more likely to conceive of the practice of medicine as a calling .
However , the researchers said religious physicians were not more likely to provide services to the underserved .
The researchers concluded physicians who are more religious do n't disproportionately care for the underserved .
The study appears in the July - August issue of the journal Annals of Family Medicine .

World Brain Death Project seeks clarity and consensus
Over the weekend I posted this photo titled " eating river crab that wears three watches " to my Flickr account .
People who do n't read Chinese blogs are - understandably - asking why .
Let me explain .
At the World Economic Forum in Dalian last week Issac Mao and I were there in person when Premier Wen Jiabao broke major news with the announcement that he intends to build a harmonious society in China .
Forum founder Klaus Schwab echoed
Wen in his welcoming speech , calling for a " a new harmonious relationship among business , governments , society , and the environment . "
While technology pundits attending the conference swooned over Chinese internet companies , the government launched a new purge of internet data centers , shutting down thousands of websites - a story which most business and tech reporters covering the conference appear to have been too busy swooning to check out .
Meanwhile see this article from the New York Times about how American financiers are helping beef up the Chinese government 's surveillance capabilities .
In celebration of so much harmoniousness , Isaac and I led some Young Global Leaders , Tech Pioneers , New Champions and other esteemed foreign guests out of their conference - center - and - hotel cocoon to a local seafood place .
We drank some local beer and Dalian fire - water and got to talking about the Chinese blogosphere .
We thought it would be funny to create a real - life version of a mashup - pun about internet censorship that has been cropping up all over the Chinese blogosphere lately .
In China these days , if your website gets blocked , your blog - hosting service takes down a politically edgy post you wrote , or your ISP deletes your site completely , you say : " I 've been harmonized . "
The word for harmony , harmonized , or harmonious ( all the same word in Chinese ) is pronounced " he xie " in Chinese and is written like this : 和谐 .
For those without Chinese fonts on their browser :
However , there 's a slight problem , which is that since this phrase is so often used sarcastically on Chinese blogs and forums , it has been flagged as a sensitive keyword by many of the blog and forum hosting platforms , increasing the chances that a post using this phrase could itself get " harmonized . "
So bloggers and chatroom denizens have switched the characters to another phrase , 河蟹 , also pronounced " he xie " ( with slightly different tonation ) which means " river crab : "
Thus , when bloggers seem to be writing nonsensically about " river crab , " they 're actually talking about censorship .
Then somebody somewhere started this photoshop - meme :
A crab wearing three watches .
河蟹带三个表 。
What ?
Because the Chinese blogger Wang Xiaofeng writes under the pen name 带三个表 （ " dai sange biao ) which means " wears three watches " ... which is a pun on 三个代表 ( " sange daibiao " ) which means " Three Represents , " a political slogan coined by former President Jiang Zemin .
Some blogger thought it would be funny to do a visual mashup combining " river crab " and " wears three watches . "
Now , if you do a Google search on the Chinese phrase 河蟹带三个表 , you 'll see people giggling about this mashup - meme all over the Chinese Internet .
In a blog post about how WEF delegates got a first - hand taste of Chinese Internet censorship last week , Isaac explained another catchphrase in the Chinese blogosphere these days .
The " Great Firewall " is usually refered to as GFW .
But Chinese bloggers now call it 功夫网 " gong fu wang " ( also GFW ) - which literally translates as " kung fu web . "
So sometimes when you see bloggers talking about kung fu , they may actually be talking about censorship .
Despite the Chinese government 's fear of its netizens , and despite the fact that the WEF failed to address how unfortunate it is that the conference 's host government fears its citizens in this way , Isaac still believes it 's good that such events are being held in China .
He writes :
Feminism boosts sexual satisfaction for both men and women , a new study suggests .
Busting stereotypes that peg feminists as men-haters , a new study shows that having a feminist partner is linked with healthier , more romantic heterosexual relationships .
The study , published online this week in the journal Sex Roles , relied on surveys of both college students and older adults , finding that women with egalitarian attitudes do find mates and men do find them attractive .
In fact , results reveal they are having a good time , maybe a better time than the non-feminists .
Both men and women are prone to holding negative views of feminists , the authors say .
Along with the sexually unattractive stereotype , some women also view feminism as a movement for victims , or for women who are n't competent enough to achieve success on their own merit , according to the Rutgers University researchers .
Psychologists Laurie Rudman and Julie Phelan carried out a laboratory survey of 242 Rutgers undergraduates and conducted an online survey of 289 older adults who had an average age of 26 and typically had been in their current relationship about four years .
Older adults have more life experience " and thus may be more likely to show an incompatibility between feminism and romantic relationships , " Rudman and Phelan write .
While younger females likely grew up with the attitude that " women can have it all , " the researchers note older women may have come of age in the era following U.S. women 's suffrage ( 1919 ) or during the women 's movement that emerged in the 1960s .
The researchers looked at people 's perception of their own feminism , their partner 's feminism and whether they had positive views of feminists and career women .
Other survey measures included overall relationship quality , agreement about gender equality , relationship stability and sexual satisfaction .
For example , relationship quality was measured with questions such as : How often do you and your partner laugh together ?
And how often do you and your partner quarrel ?
For stability measures , participants answered how often they considered terminating the relationship , as well as how often they thought their romantic relationship had a good future .
Among the findings :
College - age women who reported having feminist male partners also reported higher quality relationships that were more stable than couples involving non-feminist male partners .
College guys who were themselves feminists and had feminist partners reported more equality in their relationships .
Older women who perceived their male partners as feminists reported greater relationship health and sexual satisfaction .
Older men with feminist partners said they had more stable relationships and greater sexual satisfaction .
Overall , feminism and romance do go hand in hand , the scientists say .
While they are n't sure how feminism works to enhance relationship health , the researchers have some ideas .
Feminist men might be more supportive of their female partner 's ambitions than are traditionalists .
Men with feminist partners may enjoy the extra breadwinner to share the economic burden of maintaining a household .
Imagine you were running a scientific conference and the great grand nephew of Alfred Nobel , who created the Nobel prizes , asked if he could use your event to introduce the first new Nobel prize in 40 years .
Sort of cool , huh , in that international academic prestige sort of way .
So there was no shortage of excitement among the organizers of NanoTX ’07 , a nanotechnology conference , when Michael Nobel , who is indeed Alfred ’s great grand nephew , approached them about announcing a new prize for advances in alternative energy .
He wanted to be the featured speaker at a reception meant to honor the surviving members of the team of scientists who won the 1996 Nobel Prize for chemistry for the buckyball — a novel soccer - ball shaped form of carbon .
( The buckyball has n’t amounted to much , but excitement stemming from its discovery in 1985 played a crucial role in the discovery of other new materials and getting nanotechnology on the radar of governments , industry and investors . )
Mr. Nobel told conference organizers them that his goal , with the family ’s support , was to focus attention on the need for advances in alternative energy , a field of passionate interest for Dr. Richard E. Smalley , a leader of the buckyball team who died in 2005 .
The arrangements were announced on Aug. 30 in a press release that intriguingly withheld mention of what field the award would cover .
Alas , two weeks later , the organizers received a disturbing fax from The Nobel Foundation in Sweden .
It advised them that Mr. Nobel had been voted out as head of the Nobel Family Society at a meeting in August of 2006 “ mainly because of his unauthorized activities and involvements in the name of the Nobel Family Society . ”
And it threatened legal action against those involved in creating “ The Dr. Michael Nobel Award ” , as Mr. Nobel had indicated it was to be named .
“ We were flabbergasted , ” said Peter G. Balbus , a management consultant who had volunteered to arrange the Nobel laureates ’ reception for NanoTX’07 .
Robert Mason , chairman of the conference , did not wait to hear Mr. Nobel ’s said of the story .
“ We immediately took every mention of him off the website , ” said Mr. Mason .
Mr. Nobel was “ disinvited ” via email and various phone messages , Mr. Mason said , but neither he nor Mr. Balbus have received a response .
Mr. Nobel has , so far , been unreachable for his side of the story .
But NanoTX’07 organizers said that the relationship was troubled even before the bad news arrived from Sweden .
To start with , Mr. Nobel had initially demanded an appearance fee of “ at least $ 25,000 ″ Mr. Balbus said , a payment that was completely out of the question for a show where almost every participant is a volunteer coming for the networking opportunities .
Then there was Mr. Nobel ’s plan to have the actual awards presented next spring in an event he told Mr. Balbus would be produced by Dick Clark Productions — a mix of Hollywood with the staid Nobel name Mr. Balbus said he found surprising .
And the original plan at least was for four awards , one for governments , one for scientists , one for industry and one , astonishingly , for the “ celebrities ” who advanced the alternative energy cause .
One online technology blog that had been following developments , The May Report , had noted that such an approach might discourage serious researchers from having anything to do with the award even though figures like $ 25,000 per prize were being mentioned .
To be sure , that was up in air too .
“ He claims he ’s getting huge support from the Koreans , whatever that means , ” said Mr. Balbus in a phone interview .
So why were Mr. Balbus and his NanoTX ’07 colleagues so surprised at the outcome ?
It ’s a story rapidly becoming familiar to all of us — there was plenty of information about Mr. Nobel ’s career and activities that looked good on the Internet with no obvious warning signs it might be out - of - date or exaggerated .
And who wanted to look for bad news when the Nobel family name could be added to the speaker list ?
“ We were really impressed he knocked on our door , ” Mr. Mason conceded .
Even after their rude awakening , the NanoTX ’07 organizers sound more wistful than angry .
“ I think his intentions are good , ” said Mr. Balbus .
( More than a week after this was originally posted , Michael Nobel phoned me with a different view of what happened , a view summarized by another Nobel relative , Philip , in the comments section for this post — check it out )
A majority of black Americans blame individual failings -- not racial prejudice -- for the lack of economic progress by lower - income African Americans , according to a survey released Tuesday -- a significant change in attitudes from the early 1990s .
At the same time , black college graduates say the values of middle - class African Americans are more closely aligned with those of middle - class whites than those of lower - income blacks , the poll by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found .
And 40 % of those surveyed said African Americans could no longer be viewed as a single community .
The report said that in 1994 , 60 % of African Americans believed racial prejudice was the main thing keeping blacks from succeeding economically .
Only 33 % blamed the individual .
Though views on the issue have shifted over time , this was the first year that a majority of blacks , 53 % , said individuals were responsible for their own condition .

At the same time , the survey found that most blacks believed racial prejudice was still a widespread problem in America .
Pew President Andrew Kohut said that about 60 % of African Americans surveyed said blacks often faced discrimination when they applied for jobs or looked for housing .
Just 20 % of whites agreed with the employment assessment of blacks and 27 % with the housing .
One result of shifting views on individual responsibility may be changes in blacks ’ attitudes toward immigrants .
In 1986 , 74 % of blacks said they would have more economic opportunities if there were fewer immigrants ; today , 48 % feel that way .
Most blacks and whites who participated in the poll agreed that immigrants tended to work harder at low - wage jobs than workers of their own groups .

On the topic of diverging values , 44 % of blacks polled in 1986 said they saw greater differences created by class than by race .
Today , that figure has grown to 61 % .
The feeling holds for blacks with less than a high school education : 57 % of those surveyed said middle - class blacks are more like middle - class whites than they are like poor blacks .
“ The values of the bottom and the top are different , ” Kohut said .
Overall , the survey found that there has been a convergence of values held by blacks and whites .
For instance , a majority of both groups say that rap and hip - hop music have had a negative influence on society .
“ Blacks and whites have become more culturally integrated and , therefore , less - affluent blacks feel more estranged , ” Kohut said .

The survey also found that pessimism about economic prospects has grown significantly among blacks .
Fewer than half of those polled , 44 % , said they expected life to get better .
Twenty years ago , 57 % had said they thought life would improve .
“ People are quite anxious , ” Kohut said .
“ They do not see the kind of forward momentum that blacks saw in earlier times . ”
One reason for the pessimism may be that the condition of the black middle class appears to be more fragile than that of whites .
About 45 % of black children who grow up in middle - class families will slip into a lower - income bracket in adulthood , according to a separate study on economic mobility sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts .
“ Nearly half of children born to middle - class African Americans fall down to the bottom quintile [ 20 % ] as adults , ” said John Morton , director of the economic mobility study .
Advertisement
The project , which tracked more than 2,000 children from 1968 to the present , found that two - thirds of children of all races tended to earn higher incomes than their parents when measured in constant dollars , Morton said .
However , about 16 % of white children and about 45 % of black children were unable to match their parents ’ success and slipped into a lower socioeconomic bracket in adulthood .
“ The good news is that the lower the child begins on the economic ladder , regardless of race , the higher the likelihood that child will surpass their parents ’ income as an adult , ” Morton said .
“ The bad news is that middle - income African American families appear to have tremendous difficulty passing on their middle - income status to their children . ”
Morton said one reason could be changing family structures .
Advertisement
“ There is a higher prevalence of single - parent families at a time that it is increasingly important to have two salaries to maintain a standard of living , ” Morton said .
The Pew poll , which interviewed more than 3,000 people in September and October , had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points .
The margin was slightly higher when the attitudes of blacks , whites and Latinos were considered separately .

A Dallas - Based company is determined to stop overage charges by doing what cell phone providers can easily do but do n't to increase profits .
MinuteAlert will send subscribers an email and / or a text message when their cell phone 's minutes are about to expire .
[ ClickPress , Sat Feb 17 2007 ]
In a recent survey of its subscribers  cellular usage , PersonalMaestro.com found that unexpected charges on cell phone bills were the number one complaint .
Topping the list of unexpected charges were overage fees ( per-minute charges when users go over their monthly allotted premium minutes ) .
In response to the overwhelming requests by its customers , Maestro has launched a spin - off company that provides automatic alerts to subscribers when they are about to go over their anytime minutes .
This new service is called Minute Alert and can be found at www.MinuteAlert.com.
Another recent industry survey found that almost all cellular providers levied overage fees .
The average overage fee was $ 0.43 / minute , with Verizon and Cingular leading with $ 0.45 / minute .
 The inspiration for the service came when I received a bill from my provider that included a charge of $ 54 for 124 overage minutes , in effect doubling my normal monthly cell phone expense ,  said Kfir Alfia , founder of Minute Alert and Managing Partner of PersonalMaestro.com .
 What was most frustrating was that cell phone providers , if they wanted to , could easily alert their users when anytime minutes are used up .
But the reality is that they are raking in significant revenue from overages and are reluctant to help their customers avoid these exorbitant penalties . 
98 % of those polled in Minute Alerts survey who had incurred cell phone minute overages , stated they would have reduced cell phone usage if they had known they had run out of minutes .
57 % stated they would have ceased cell phone usage until the next billing cycle .
89 % stated that they used their cell phones even though they could have easily used a landline at the time .
Although most carriers give users the ability to check minutes from their cell phone , 82 % of respondents reported never using this service with 69 % of those not even knowing how .
 After a fruitless search for a service that would automatically alert me when I went over my minutes , I decided to create a service that would do exactly that , Alfia said .
Users who sign up for Minute Alert pay as low as $ 9.95 for a whole year of service ( $ 0.83 per month ) .
With overage fees averaging $ 20 per month , Minute Alert is determined to help cell phone users significantly cut down on their monthly cell phone expense .
Minute Alert also gives subscribers the option of monitoring the minutes for one cell phone account and have the alerts sent to a different cell phone .
With this option , Minute Alert plans to help parents monitor their childrens cell phone usage , where overage charges can easily skyrocket .
Other features include the ability to set a minute threshold , determining when the first alert is to be sent , and optional weekly or daily minute usage updates .
Alerts are sent via text message , through email , or both .
Maestro , Minute Alerts parent company , is a personal assistant service that subscribers pay for by the minute .
Callers can ask any question about anything or have agents perform virtually any task .
Subscribers can call from anywhere in the country and are greeted by name with every call .
Egon Yeah , AutomoBlog.net went from PR5 to PR3 .
I wonder how this is going to affect advertisers .
Come on Google , let us know what ’s going on .
Keith Dsouza
It really should not affect most of the SERP ’s but Google or atleast Matt Cutts should make an annoucment on what the hell is going on .
Venomous Kate My PR5 blog went down to a 3 overnight .
My PR4 blog went to a 3 last week and is now down to a 2 .
Granted , since I do sponsored reviews I expected a little bit of a drop but nothing like this .
If Google are doing this to protect their Adsense revenues from competitors like TLA , then I think it ’s safe to say Google has repositioned from being a search engine to being more of a corporate sponsor .
As for me , I just sold off my Google shares .
No , I do n’t think it ’s going to hurt them , but it felt better than slamming my head against my keyboard all morning .
Made a nifty little profit , too .
I ’m going shopping .
Cigar Jack
I got hit and dropped from a 4 to a 2 .
Ashish Mohta
I have small guess ,
Not sure but possibly Google can find when you were linked and In how much time for a particular article …
If they find high amount of linking all of a sudden .
They can go for manual check
If you made a good story and true find…its not considered as positive linking .
But if you did by giving money or creating useless competition that can create a problem I know one thing for sure that Google have both auto and manual check .
They should be having some script to find sudden linking and then find exact nature with manual .
Do correct me If I am wrong .
Court I have now been hit with a - 2 and I ’m not selling links and I ’m not part of a blog network .
Is it possible that Google is going to hit all blogs ?
If so I think it ’s very odd and stupid .
If not , there is n’t any reason to penalize my site .
Technobuzz.net oh ! my god !
thats so bad .
Daniel Harrison
Just wondering , it might be due to the quality of directory and blog links being downgraded , and therefore sites with PR based on those have been hit .
Daniel Harrison I noticed my Spy Gadget Blog dropped PR5 to PR3 .
My directories have dropped 2 points too .
Karthik I do n’t think any of you would complain if you heard of Google ’s woes .
Google does n’t rank for “ search engine ” on google.com !
How about that for being ironic ?
Vincent Chow Now I do n’t feel as bad for my PageRank drop from 5 to 4 .
JoeTech.com
Wow …
Some of those sites took a big hit .
What really matters is the fact that these sites will undoubtedly lose a lot of search engine traffic .
I ’m just glad I ’m still holding my PR5 .
Daniel Easton , yeah I checked you guys and it was fine .
Gawker media , Crunch Network and GigaOM seem to be fine as well .
Easton Ellsworth Know More Media has about 100 interlinking blogs and our PageRanks appear not to have changed – nearly all 6’s across the board for the blogs ’ home pages .
Jerry
Its really sad to know that all the hardwork can be taken away by the “ all mighty google ” .
The just wanna show how powerful n controlling the can be .
Mine is has a PR 0 and am still alive and kicking !
Do n’t lose your sleep ..
Stephen
As a resident voice on SEO , I ca n’t help but weigh in on this one .
My working theory is n’t that all of these sites have necessarily been penalized , especially considering many of them are doing nothing wrong .
Rather , I believe that the sites linking to them have been largely devalued .
Consider this :
The primary audience for many of these sites are bloggers .
These sites derive their popularity from others who are quite likely being penalized .
Now that the algorithm has been changed and all those links have lost their juice , the popular blogging niche sites are losing PageRank as a byproduct .
It ’s regrettable , but largely unavoidable .
I ’ll keep everyone apprised if I come across a better explanation , but that ’s the best I ’ve got for now .
Honestly , it ’s a bit of a head - scratcher , but this is why it ’s never advisable to put all your eggs into the Google basket .
Paula Neal Mooney JohnChow.com is a PR 4 , down from a PR 5 when I wrote this post : PAULA NEAL MOONEY : PageRank Dropped from 5 to 4 … Thank God it did n’t drop to zero !
PaulaNealMooney.com dropped from 5 to 4 to now a 3 — but they also penalized me so I do n’t rank for “ Paula Mooney ” nor “ blogger salaries ” nor other stuff anymore .
Sucks , but I ’m glad I ’m focused on my other websites — which I hope get a PR soon …
Great post again , Daniel .
thomas I went down one rank also .
I first thought it had to do with dmoz not giving juice anymore , but it seems to be something else .
Jacob Share My HP went from 4 to 2 and I have n’t a clue why .
I have n’t sold any links on it for over a month , I ’ve never done a link exchange and have always been careful to follow the Webmaster Guidelines .
That said , since I do n’t actively run after PR , I ’ll still sleep tonight but I would still like to know what happened .
As if .
Andrew Flusche Google slammed me from 5 down to 3 .
But now that I ’m seeing all these other changes , I do n’t feel so bad .
Fortunately , my search traffic has stayed steady .
I ’m still going to clean out some paid links and try to be more “ valuable ” in Google ’s eyes .
Deep
Dave Networking could be the issue – maybe Google have decided that because many networks interlink their sites when they are not related , they are going to penalise them ( as if they were a paid - for directory ) .
I ’d love to hear Google actually comment on what they are doing , rather than leaving everyone to guess .
Baris Unver
My blog ’s PR stayed as 0 , hooray .
Darren Deep – I thought it could be them just lowering the overall value of PR – but how come some blogs are down and some are not ?
The text link selling theory does n’t add up for me – as quite a few blogs that have been hit in the last 24 hours do n’t sell them .
The blog network theory could have something to it – although some of the blogs that I ’ve seen hit are not in blog networks – or at least are not fully participating in link exchanges – and other blog networks seem untouched despite interlinking ( like TechCrunch ’s network ) .
Maris – you ’re experience is the same as mine PR is down but traffic is stable from Google .
So ultimately for me it does n’t matter – but it is odd and something I hope Google gives some insight on .
TipsoSaurus oh ! my god !
this is soooo bad .
Problogger deserves 10 page rank !
I really think that google should stop acting evil and must concentrate on making the things better or rather improving the Pagerank in a way that it does n’t give too much weight to the paid links … but penalizing like this is not really good .
Although , one thing is sure that these sites now really do n’t depend on the traffic from google .
Hey guys .. continue selling the links 😀

Some datacenters will still show a 6 , but there are many 4 ’s there , so its changing over time towards the 4 .

The PR resources I checked mentioned problogger is still at 6 .
What resources are you guys using ?

My blog also dropped from 5 to 3 but I ’m pretty happy that traffic remains the same .
I removed all my sold links and link exchange partners .
Will see if this helps to receive back PR .

My assumption might not be correct though Deep , I am talking with some friends right now and will update the post soon .

This is what happened after the guy " Andrew " was led away by the police after he was tasered .
Mother who shaved her daughter 's head and pierced her genitalia acquitted
A U.S. woman who decided to pierce her 13 - year - old daughter 's genitalia to protect her from early sex life was acquitted of aggravated child abuse .
The girl , now 16 years of age , testified at court that her mother was trying to protect her .
In 2004 the woman asked her male friend to shave the girl 's head to make her unattractive to boys .
Afterwards , the woman apparently thought that it was not enough and decided to forcefully pierce the girl 's genitalia .
Mother who shaved her daughter 's head and pierced her genitalia acquitted
A woman who had her 13 - year - old daughter 's genitalia pierced to make it uncomfortable for her to have sex was acquitted of aggravated child abuse .
The girl , now 16 , had testified that her mother asked a friend in 2004 to shave the girl 's head to make her unattractive to boys and later held her down for the piercing .
A jury deliberated for about three hours before deciding Thursday that the mother 's actions did not involve punishment or malicious intent , or cause permanent damage or disfigurement .
The 39 - year - old woman , whose name is being withheld to protect her daughter 's identity , could have faced up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the charges .
The girl was not in court for the verdict .
Her guardian declined comment .
" She was trying to protect me , but it hurt me , " the girl testified earlier this week .
" It not only hurt me physically , but it hurt me mentally .
...
That 's emotionally scarring .
That 's physical abuse . "
Prosecutors said the mother called on a friend to shave the girl 's head and do the piercing after realizing that she had been having sex , including with the mother 's boyfriend .
Defense attorneys told jurors that the mother had trouble with her rebellious daughter and that the girl agreed to the piercing to help rebuild her mother 's trust .
Child welfare officials were called after the girl became infected from the piercing .
Tammy Meredith , 43 , who did the piercing in her home , was sentenced to a year in jail for her role .
An arrest warrant has been issued for the mother 's boyfriend on allegations he had sex with the girl .
Defense attorney Donald Day argued the mother had trouble with her rebellious daughter and that the girl agreed to the piercing to help rebuild her mother 's trust .
" It was n't torture or extreme violence , " Day said .
" It was , in the young girl 's words , to try to save her .
...
That decision was a last - ditch effort .
In my client 's mind , she had no other options . "
Child welfare officials were called after the girl became infected from the piercing .
Judges have rejected two proposed plea agreements as too lenient .
The mother , whose name is being withheld to protect her daughter 's identity , would have spent up to 30 years in prison if she had been convicted of the charges .
Pentagon hires ABC reporter to improve PR
The Pentagon will announce this week that Geoff Morrell , previously a White House correspondent for ABC News , has been hired as the Defense Department ’s on - camera briefer , a senior administration official told The Politico .
Morrell , 38 , will become a familiar face of the administration on television and the Web .
The official said that a working journalist was chosen by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates in an effort to improve press relations at a time when the administration is under pressure to show progress in Iraq .

Morrell ’s title will be a deputy assistant secretary of Defense .
His functions will be as Pentagon press secretary and Gates ’ personal spokesman .
After joining ABC News in Chicago in 2000 , Morrell covered the next two presidential elections , the Florida recount and the Iraq war from U.S. Central Command in Qatar , according to his network biography .
A Washington native , Morrell graduated from Georgetown University and received a master 's degree in journalism from Columbia University .
We — all of us — now face a universal threat .
Though it is not from outside this world , it is nevertheless cosmic in scale .
Consider this tale of two planets .
Earth and Venus are almost exactly the same size , and have almost exactly the same amount of carbon .
The difference is that most of the carbon on Earth is in the ground — having been deposited there by various forms of life over the last 600 million years — and most of the carbon on Venus is in the atmosphere .
As a result , while the average temperature on Earth is a pleasant 59 degrees , the average temperature on Venus is 867 degrees .
True , Venus is closer to the Sun than we are , but the fault is not in our star ; Venus is three times hotter on average than Mercury , which is right next to the Sun .
It ’s the carbon dioxide .
This threat also requires us , in Reagan ’s phrase , to unite in recognition of our common bond .
Next Saturday , on all seven continents , the Live Earth concert will ask for the attention of humankind to begin a three - year campaign to make everyone on our planet aware of how we can solve the climate crisis in time to avoid catastrophe .
Individuals must be a part of the solution .
In the words of Buckminster Fuller , “ If the success or failure of this planet , and of human beings , depended on how I am and what I do , how would I be ?
What would I do ? ”
Live Earth will offer an answer to this question by asking everyone who attends or listens to the concerts to sign a personal pledge to take specific steps to combat climate change .
( More details about the pledge are available at algore.com . )
But individual action will also have to shape and drive government action .
Here Americans have a special responsibility .
Throughout most of our short history , the United States and the American people have provided moral leadership for the world .
Establishing the Bill of Rights , framing democracy in the Constitution , defeating fascism in World War II , toppling Communism and landing on the moon — all were the result of American leadership .
Once again , Americans must come together and direct our government to take on a global challenge .
American leadership is a precondition for success .

A " proleptic " time scale is one whose definition has been extended so that it can be used outside its normal range of validity .
For example , it 's common for computer software to implement only the current leap year rules regardless of the year in question , which means they implement the proleptic Gregorian calendar .
This is a straight - forward simplification that 's useful if you are n't too worried about handling historical dates anachronistically .
Most current computer time scales follow a form of Universal Time which has a fixed 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds per day , synchronized to UTC but with some kind of fudge to handle leap seconds .
It would be much more satisfactory for the computer 's clock to count seconds of atomic time all the time , and use a leap seconds table to implement UTC properly .
However , the current rules for translating between atomic time and universal time only date back to 1972 , which is fairly hopeless if you want your time scale to be usable for historical purposes .
Of course , atomic time only dates back to 1958 which is not much better .
We need to come up with some plausible rules for proleptic TAI and proleptic UTC so that we can handle historical times within the same framework that we use for times nearer the present .
Since there was no TAI before 1958 , and TAI is defined to be synchronized with UT at the start of 1958 , the obvious way of dealing with earlier times is to assume that TAI = UTC = UT before that point .
Between 1958 and 1972 there was a time scale called " UTC " but it is nothing like the current version .
This old UTC ( oUTC ) had variable - length seconds and occasionally made 0.1s steps .
The history of its variations is kept by the US Naval Observatory .
The time scale described in that table does mesh reasonably smoothly with TAI - UT=0 at the start of 1958 ( even though 1961 is the start of the oUTC time scale ) and TAI - UTC=10 at the start of 1972 .
The problem with using this table directly is that it means we have to introduce complications into the code which are not necessary for most purposes .
It also implies a degree of accuracy that can't really be justified for events that old .
( Digression : I 'm deliberately not distinguishing between UT0 / UT1 / UT2 before 1958 because practical timescales back then were not well synchronized owing to disagreements about the locations of observatories .
An alternative that would appeal to pedantic astronomers would be to align our base time scale to ephemeris time and terrestrial time which is TAI +32.184s .
However that needlessly complicates things since we would have to work out how to extend back into history the non-uniform translation to UT , and it requires all the complexity of oUTC . )
It seems to me that a reasonable solution is to use the USNO 's table to extend the leap second system back to 1958 .
This means that we will not need to deal with non-integer offsets between time scales nor with variable - rate seconds .
My method is to use the equations in the table to work out the TAI - oUTC values for 00:00 on 1st January and 1st July each year ( the points immediately after each possible leap second insertion ) .
Assuming that these values are a good approximation to TAI - UT1 , I add leap seconds to create a proleptic UTC ( pUTC ) which keeps pUTC - oUTC less than 0.9 .
This is the same as the modern UTC - UT1 ( DUT1 ) rule .

The U.S. Government Intends to Win the War in Iraq
For the U.S. to cut and run in the age of Peak Oil would mean the death knell for the U.S. economy , and the sad truth is that Peak Oil will ultimately bring down the U.S. economy even with U.S. control of Iraqi oil and strategic petroleum distribution .
But if China , Russia , India , or other nations are able to siphon ultimate control of Iraqi and Persian Gulf oil for themselves as the international competition for remaining petroleum escalates , the U.S. will not only be a very sore loser , but a very , very dangerous one .

U.S. economic forecast for 2007 : cooling off but no recession
Still , oil prices are unlikely to do anything but rise in the long term as demand increases and easily pumped oilfields are drained , a phenomenon known as " Peak Oil . "
" Expected growth rates in emerging economies such as China , India , Brazil would indicate that oil prices should continue to rise , " [ JP Morgan Chase 's chief investment officer Peter ]
Wall said .
" These countries and many other emerging economies are still well below their projected peak energy consumption levels -- based on the consumption levels of developed economies -- so growth in energy demand is expected to outpace growth in supply .
That does n't mean we wo n't see intermittent declines in oil prices . "

Can we grow our way out of an energy crisis ?
She 's sexy , she 's stylish , she 's sophisticated - and somewhat surprisingly , she 's Ronald McDonald .
A gender - bending makeover of McDonald 's marketing icon in Japan has been hailed a great success after capturing the public imagination and enticing adults back into its outlets to sample a revamped menu .
Traditionally , Ronald McDonald would goof about in oversized shoes and baggy yellow overalls in a frantic and successful pursuit of Hamburgler .
In the Japanese TV commercial the foxy female version , with shoulder - length straight auburn hair in place of Ronald 's frizzy mop , smoulders at the camera in a flowing yellow dress , and later a red and white striped bikini with thigh - length leggings and red high heels .
But the man behind the campaign insists he did not create a female Ronald McDonald - but merely appropriated his instantly recognisable outfit .
Hidekazu Sato , known by his nickname Kazoo , the associate creative director at Beacon Communications - a joint venture of Leo Burnett and Dentsu - said the costume was so recognisable it was a mnemonic - a design that people would instantly associate with McDonald's .
" We devised the costume and took the red and white stripes and the yellow , which were recognised and converted them into a stylish dress , " Kazoo said via a translator .
" We were assuming that even if we did n't include the McDonald 's logo and even if the model was a beautiful caucasian just those colours of the mnemonic design would wake up people 's association with McDonald's . "
" The important point is we did n't change Ronald himself - we played around with his costume . "
" The customers are calling her the female Ronald but that was not our intention , " Kazoo said .
It is not the first time that the fast - food outlet - which has fended off attacks from obesity campaigners in recent years - has played fast and loose with its image .
In Britain the company , faced with falling sales , abandoned the famous golden arches logo and replaced it with a question mark in a poster campaign to get consumers to reconsider its fast food outlet image .
But the chain is still protective of its reputation .
McDonald 's Japan refused MediaGuardian.co.uk permission to show the full TV advert .
The Japanese adverts , which promoted the new McGrand burger , first appeared last year and had a big impact on popular culture , particularly the culture of costume play , known as " cospre " .
" In its favour was the strong Japanese culture of costume play , an underground scene of adults dressing up as cartoon characters , " said Kazoo .
" The commercial was popular and in particular the costume .
When I go to other shoots I sense that people in the fashion industry ask who created it and who the stylist was , so it is talked about . "
The advert even led to Japanese pop singer Namie Amuro approaching Beacon Communications to revamp her image after she saw it .
But despite the successful attempt to reach out to adults , the TV commercial found favour with a very familiar audience .
" It was rated number one likeable among high school girls , a wonderful surprise .
We were able to capture the young group as well as capture a more aspirational image for McDonald's . "
