The British Government is contemplating the third - party construction of a super database containing the identities and location of every person in Britain .
The ' super database , ' which comes at the hefty cost of 12 billion British pounds , would be run by one or a number of private companies and would track every citizen 's Internet usage , every phone call , every text message , as well as many other transactions .
The government claims the database is necessary to fight terrorism and serious crime .
Of course , the government also claims it would come with stringent safeguards to protect a user 's personal private information , but if history is any indication , those safeguards would prove mostly ineffectual and that information will inevitably end up being leaked into the public domain .

The British government -- as well as the U.S. and many other governments -- has had major problems keeping the private information of its citizens safe .
Last year , the UK's HM Revenue & Customs Department lost 25 million child benefit records .

Needless to say , the personal and privacy rights violations could be quite staggering and no matter what alleged safeguards are put in place , the resulting violations could be disastrous .
As history has repeatedly proven , no government can be trusted to protect so much personal information .

As noted by Sir Ken MacDonald , former Director of Public Prosecutions , " the tendency of the state to seek ever more powers of surveillance over its citizens may be driven by protective zeal , but the notion of total security is a paranoid fantasy which would destroy everything that makes living worthwhile .
It would be a complete readout of every citizen 's life in the most intimate and demeaning detail . "

The new plan , to be outlined early this year in a consultation paper on the interception modernization program , would allow one or a number or organizations to proactively collect all communications data , including broadband phone calls and chat rooms instead of being provided by the ISP's and telecoms at the request of the police or other governmental agencies .
Internet Service Providers and Telecom companies are already able to provide the police necessary information about the whereabouts and identities of suspects when necessary .

I found it was quite trivial to port my Erlang Fibonacci examples to Scala .
The naive and tail - recursive friendly versions look pretty much the same : [ source: scala ]
def fib(n : Int ) : Int = {
n match {
case 0 => 0
case 1 => 1
case _ => fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 )
}
}</p>
def fib2iter ( iter : Int , result : Int , next : Int ) : Int = {
if ( iter == 0 ) {
result
} else {
fib2iter ( iter - 1 , next , result + next )
}
}
def fib2 ( n : Int ) : Int = {
fib2iter ( n , 0 , 1 )
}
[ / source ]
Scala of course runs on the JVM , which does not support tail recursion .
However , the Scala compiler recognizes and handles the tail recursion properly so that it still has the same iterative properties and can scale for larger values of N .
In playing with fib2 I found interestingly that because Scala maps Int to Java integers we overflow at N=47 : [ source: scala ]
scala > fib2 ( 46 )
res16 : Int = 1836311903
scala > fib2 ( 47 )
res17 : Int = - 1323752223
[ / source ]
The solution there is to switch to the Scala class BigInt ( which is just a friendly wrapper around java . math .
BigInteger ) : [ source: scala ]
def fib(n : Int ) : BigInt = {
n match {
case 0 => BigInt( 0 )
case 1 => BigInt ( 1 )
case _ => fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 )
}
}
def fib2iter ( iter : Int , result : BigInt , next : BigInt ) : BigInt = {
if ( iter == 0 ) {
result
} else {
fib2iter ( iter - 1 , next , result + next )
}
}
def fib2 ( n : Int ) : BigInt = {
fib2iter (n , BigInt ( 0 ) , BigInt ( 1 ) )
}

I hunted around for a built - in way to time something in Scala but did n’t really find anything other than the Benchmark trait which was the functionality I wanted but outside of a trait .
I ultimately just cobbled my own together :
[ source : scala ]
def timeNanos( n: Int , f : => Unit ) : Long = {
var total : Long = 0
for ( val i <- List.range ( 0 , n ) ) yield { val startTime = System.nanoTime ( ) ; f ; val stopTime = System.nanoTime ( ) ; System.gc( ) ; total += stopTime - startTime } total / n } [ / source ]
This function runs a closure f for n iterations , timing each iteration using the System.nanoTime ( ) method , then averages the result .
Not pretty and surely fraught with microbenchmarking bias , but it ’ll serve for this blog .
To actually run all of this : [ source: scala ] scala > : load fib.scala Loading fib.scala … fib : ( Int ) BigInt fib2iter : ( Int , BigInt , BigInt ) BigInt fib2 : ( Int ) BigInt scala > : load timing .scala Loading timing.scala … timeNanos : ( Int , => Unit ) Long scala > timeNanos ( 10 , fib ( 8 ) ) res0 : Long = 255700 [ / source ]
After playing around for a while and warming up the JVMs I started to see consistent times and compared them here vs my Erlang results from yesterday :
So , pretty similar results for both versions , as we ’d expect .
Scala seems to be a little slower on the smaller N but have a flatter curve as N gets bigger .
Online vandals protesting Israel 's military action in Gaza have defaced thousands of websites , including high - profile sites belonging to the US Army , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and a Washington - based group that oversees homeland security .
The attacks on Thursday left several of them inoperable some 24 hours later .
Websites belonging to the Army 's Military District of Washington and the Joint Force Headquarters of the National Capital Region , which is responsible for homeland security in the Washington DC area , were both unreachable on late Friday .
NATO 's Parliamentary Assembly 's website was back online .
A group calling itself Agd_Scopr / Peace Crew claimed responsibility for the attacks .
They defaced the sites with anti-US and anti-Israel slogans and images .
The group has attacked other websites , including those belonging to Microsoft , Shell , Harvard University , and Mercedes Benz and has gone under the name Terrorist Crew , according to researcher Gary Warner 's CyberCrime and Doing Time blog .
Over the past few years , computer attacks have often coincided with military conflicts as parties on both sides use defacements , denials of service , and other types of internet - based attacks to air propaganda and disrupt their opponents .
This image accompanied a defacement on websites belonging to NATO and the US Army
Israel 's two - week assault on Gaza has played out much the same way , with thousands of websites vandalized by hackers voicing support for Palestinians .
Unlike recent conflicts in Georgia and Estonia , however , there is a noticeable absence of denial - of - service attacks , Security Focus reports . ®
Psychiatric nurse Bryan Krumm 's opinion of the state 's medical marijuana program is not an uncommon one .
" Until they can keep the federal government out of the program , they are not going to be able to make our program functional . "
The Department of Health established regulations regarding the growth and distribution of medical marijuana last week .
The department accepting applications from nonprofit businesses interested in producing medical marijuana .
Krumm filed suit against the U.S. attorney and others general in District Court to combat federal interference , and he 's using a stipulation in the Controlled Substances
Act to do it .
The act is broken into " schedules , " which are classifications for various drugs .
Marijuana is listed in the most restrictive category , Schedule I . According to the act , these drugs have no medical uses .
Cocaine and opiates are listed as Schedule II drugs , because they have medical applications .
Krumm works at Sage Neuroscience Center in Albuquerque .
He argues that once California created a medical marijuana program in 1996 , cannabis should have been bumped to a less restrictive schedule .
" Once it has accepted medical use , " says Krumm , " it no longer meets criteria for placement in Schedule I . "
Krumm says his is the first lawsuit in the country that is using the Controlled Substances
Act itself to justify the removal of marijuana from Schedule I .
He tried asking the state to move marijuana to a lower schedule in the state 's Controlled Substances Act , but the New Mexico Pharmacy Board refused .
" It was just an attempt to get it out of this arbitrary placement , " he says .
" Right now in the state of New Mexico , it 's listed both in Schedule I and Schedule II . "
William Harvey , executive director of the Pharmacy Board , says it 's not up to the board to move a drug from one schedule to another .
It 's up the the Legislature , he says .
" The Legislature has given the board the ability to schedule substances that are n't recognized yet — like there 's always chemicals or drugs that are invented .
But the board can't take something that 's already in a schedule and move it to another one unless the Legislature has given us the authority .
And it has n't . "
But Harvey added there 's no doubt state law permits medicinal marijuana through the Department of Health .
Marijuana is listed in Schedule I under the state 's Controlled Substances Act .
It 's also part of Schedule II , but only for use by certified patients in the state 's medical cannabis program .
Marinol , which is synthetic THC , is categorized in Schedule III .
Krumm will argue his case against the federal government in a couple of months .
If he succeeds in proving the Drug Enforcement Administration has been illegally maintaining Schedule I placement of marijuana , it would open options for people around the country .
Rescheduling would prevent the federal government from saying it 's against federal law for these state programs to operate , he says .
" There are so many people who are suffering needlessly for lack of a needed medication , " Krumm adds .
" Marijuana has unique therapeutic value that can't be mimicked by any other class of medication .
It 's one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man . " '
In a study recently accepted for publication in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience , scientists at UC Berkeley 's Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute and the School of Public Health report that normal 9 - and 10 - year - olds differing only in socioeconomic status have detectable differences in the response of their prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain that is critical for problem solving and creativity .
{ snip }
" Kids from lower socioeconomic levels show brain physiology patterns similar to someone who actually had damage in the frontal lobe as an adult , " said Robert Knight , director of the institute and a UC Berkeley professor of psychology .
" We found that kids are more likely to have a low response if they have low socioeconomic status , though not everyone who is poor has low frontal lobe response . "
{ snip }
" These kids have no neural damage , no prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol , no neurological damage , " Kishiyama said .
" Yet , the prefrontal cortex is not functioning as efficiently as it should be .
This difference may manifest itself in problem solving and school performance . "

We assume social classes and races are imposed on otherwise " blank slate " individuals .
The truth is that social classes , races , et al emerge from organic , immanent processes like evolution and social differentiation .
The article spends most of its time apologizing for its conclusions , and suggesting that poorer parents not sitting down to dinner with their kids is the reason why they have lowered cognitive ability .
Note that not all poor kids have this ; this corresponds to the social darwinist idea that parents who do not value money , or are disorganized and not slower , end up poor as well as those whose brains do not optimize them for any labor , so they default to manual , low - impact jobs .
The taboo - flinging , apologetics , and bad logic will undoubtedly hastily cover this discovery like a mound over a battlefield burial .
This topic is as taboo as genetic differences between races -- which exist , but may not be important ; whether multiculturalism / pluralism is viable or not is another argument -- because it points out what we loathe to know : we 're not in control of our lives , we do n't have free will , we can't be anyone we want to be , and in fact , we serve in small and unimportant parts of a social structure .
You are born smart or born not , as that pretty much decides the issue .
Last week I set out to improve the performance of the Dashboard and Contacts tabs in Highrise .
Both tabs would frequently be much too slow .
Especially the Contacts tab , which for our own account some times could take upwards two seconds to load .
The number one rule for improving performance is to measure , the number two rule is to measure some more , and the third rule is to measure once again just to be sure .
Guessing about performance never works , but it ’s a great excuse to get you out in the weeds chasing phantom ponies .
Looking outside the epicenter
So I measured and found that part of the problem was actually not even part of the epicenter , the notes and the contacts .
In fact , we were wasting a good 150 ms generating New Person / Company form sheets all the time ( through a complicated Presenter object that ’s high on abstraction and low on performance ) .
Even though these sheets were the same for everyone .
That left me with two choices :
Either I could try to speed up the code that generated the forms or I could cache the results .
Since speeding up the code would require taking everything apart , bringing out the profiler , and doing lots of plain hard work , I decided to save myself a sweat and just cache .
People using Highrise could n’t care one way or the other as long as things got faster and frankly , neither could I .
I ended up with this code :
< % cache [ ' people/new/contact_info ' , image_host_differentiation_key ] do %> <%= p.object.contact_info.shows.form %> <% end %>
This cache is hooked up to our memcached servers for Highrise .
The image_host_differentiation_key makes sure that we do n’t serve SSL control graphics to people using Safari / Firefox , but still do it for IE , in according to our asset hosting strategy .
Good enough performance
But saving 150 ms per call was n’t going to do it .
So I added memcached caching to the display of the individual contacts and notes as well .
The best thing would of course be if I could cache the entire page , but since Highrise is heavy on permissions for who can see what , that would essentially mean per-user caching .
Not terribly efficient and hard to keep in synch .
So instead we just cache the individual elements and still run the queries to check what you can see .
Mr. Tankleff and his lawyers contend that the killers were Mr. Steuerman and a band of three ex-convicts led by Joseph Creedon , who has admitted collecting debts for drug dealers .
These men have publicly denied involvement , but , according to witnesses in Mr. Tankleff ’s appeal , have made private admissions .
Before the murders , Mr. Steuerman had been resisting Seymour Tankleff ’s demands to repay a $ 500,000 debt , and they fought over control of the bagel shops they operated together .
He was at the Tankleff house for a poker game the night of the attacks , in September 1988 .
The book quotes a startling statement by Mr. McCready , the police investigator , in an outtake of a 2006 segment on a “ Dr. Phil ” television program on the case .
Responding to allegations that he was paid $ 100,000 to shield the killers from investigators , Mr. McCready disputed the sum , by saying of Mr. Creedon , “ I mean I think he only got paid $ 50,000 to do the murder . ”
The book says that Mr. McCready ’s comment , in a taped speakerphone interview that was cut from the broadcast , not only accepted that Mr. Creedon was involved in the killings and was paid for it , but also gave a figure that had not previously been reported .
Mr. Creedon ’s lawyer , Anthony M. La Pinta , dismissed Mr. McCready ’s statements about the payment for the murders .
“ This is a ridiculous allegation , ” he said .
Richard Firstman , a former reporter for Newsday who wrote the book along with Jay Salpeter , a private investigator , said he discovered another revealing “ Dr. Phil ” outtake after the book went to press .
In that clip , Mr. McCready appears to be discussing Mr. Steuerman ’s motive : “ Nobody ever talks about the real thing behind the murder itself and the argument with Seymour , between Seymour and Jerry .
The argument was over two businessmen , and one outfoxed the other , and one got mad and wanted his money back . ”
Combined with his comments about Mr. Creedon , Mr. McCready in the interview effectively embraced Mr. Tankleff ’s version of what and who were behind the killings  not the prosecution ’s theory and his own testimony that Mr. Tankleff was a spoiled teenager who killed his parents to inherit their wealth .
New accusations about Mr. McCready ’s own involvement with Mr. Steuerman were raised by two new witnesses cited in the book .
One witness , who gave a statement to Mr. Tankleff ’s lawyers but said she was afraid to testify , said that she worked at one of the bagel stores with Mr. Steuerman ’s son , Todd , a convicted drug dealer .
She said he sold drugs at the store and told her that the police took payments to ignore the illicit activity .

BERGEN - BELSEN , Germany  Habbo Knoch , who runs the new Bergen - Belsen Memorial at the former concentration camp , invited various scholars and museum directors to a four - day conference here last week called “ Witnessing : Sites of Destruction and the Representation of the Holocaust . ”
He asked a question one evening during a break : “ Will people in 20 years look back and say we built a museum that focuses on Nazi genocide while Darfur was happening ?
Will they ask whether anyone raised this issue ? ”
Consider it raised .
The new memorial is an immense concrete and glass museum emerging from a copse of trees beside the cemetery of mass graves ( there are more than 70,000 bodies buried there ) , which had been the camp site .
The permanent exhibition is a model of its kind , focused on the meticulous and sober reconstruction of the past .
From time to time the present literally intrudes with a bang , though , when practice rounds of tank fire from the British military base next door boom over the treetops .
Otherwise you might be struck by how ordinary the whole area seems .
During the war , prisoners  at first Soviet soldiers , later Jews  used to be marched several miles from a railway terminal beyond the base , which was then for the Wehrmacht , and past fields , farms and houses .
Some survivors have said they were struck by the pretty scenery .
At the camp , corpses lay in piles and thousands were dying of starvation and disease , from genocide by neglect .
The farmers and villagers who had watched the prisoners go by afterward mostly claimed they knew nothing about it .
“ Hitler appointed me his biographer , ” David Irving says .
He is not laughing .
He is announcing that the Fuhrer – the man he has revered since he was a child – saw him coming .
Yes : Hitler prophesied Irving as the man who would clear away the smears and bring The Truth at last to an unwilling world .
Irving discovered this prophecy when he was writing a biography of Adolf Hitler , but he is only prepared to disclose it baldly now .
“ I made a great point of tracking down all Hitler ’s surviving doctors , ” he says , “ and I identified Erwin Giesing as the doctor who treated Hitler after the bomb attempt on his life in 1944 . ”
He tracked him down in the 1970s to Aachen in West Germany , and when Irving called , he claims Giesing said : “ Yes , I ’ve been expecting you . ”
Irving arrived at Giesing ’s surgery and , he says , was immediately handed a 400 - page file .
“ Giesing said it was his diary [ of his time with Hitler ] .
‘ That ’s what you have come for , ’ [ he said ] .
I asked why , why me ?
Why have n’t you given it to Jacobson or Hilburg or any of the other great historians ? ”
Giesing said the answer lay on page 385 .
Irving flicked to this page , and , he says , “ it is August 1944 and he is treating Hitler – cauterizing his eardrum – and he says , ‘ Mein Furher you realize that you have the same illness now in your inner ear that the Kaiser had ? ’
Hitler said ‘ Yes that is true , how did you know that ? ’
And Geesing said he had read it in the biography of the Kaiser written by an Englishman , J D Chamier . ”
And he says Hitler replied : “ One day , an Englishman will come along and write my biography .
But it can not be an English man of the present generation .
They wo n’t to be objective .
It will have to be an Englishman of the next generation , and one who is totally familiar with all the German archives . ”
Irving sits back with an expression of beatific calm .
“ So [ when ] I phoned the doctor and he said ‘ I ’ve been expecting you , ’ the Messiah had come .
The one he had been waiting for all these years .
And of course all the other historians hate that because they do n’t fit . ”
I stare silently for a moment .
To clarify : you actually think Hitler wanted you to be his biographer ?
“ Yes .
Yes and I am not ashamed of that .
Hitler knew that .
Hitler himself said that for fifty years they wo n’t be able to write the truth about me . ”

And I realize this interview is n’t about history ; it ’s about pathology .
How did this happen ?
How did a clever boy abandoned by his father in wartime Essex – as Nazi bombs fell all around – end up as the last man entranced by Adolf Hitler ?
How did a historian feted , for a while , by the English right end up in jail in Austria under laws banning the reconstitution of the Nazi Party ?
How did the father of a disabled daughter end up believing the great killer of the disabled was spiritually guiding him ?
And how did it end here , with this ?
I : Swinging the lantern
David Irving has limped to the door of his large Berkshire country house , and is standing by a Christmas tree , waiting .
I trudge up the drive , wondering how a recent bankrupt can afford all this , when he beckons me in with a rather severe look .
As we walk into his kitchen , he explains his awkward movements : “ If you spend four hundred days in prison , your muscles turn to Marmalade jelly .
We were allowed to walk around once a day in a yard smaller than this room – ” he waves his hand around the kitchen – “ seventy men , walking clockwise .
At my age , ” seventy , “ the muscles do n’t come back .
I have to crawl like a cockroach up stairs . ”
He begins to make coffee and bleak chit-chat .
He says that two days after he was released from prison , he fell over in Swiss Cottage tube station .
“ A woman came up to me and said ‘ What ’s happened to you ? ’
I said , ‘ Well , I ’ve been in prison for 400 days … ’ and she scuttled away . ”
While the water boils , he takes me on a tour of the grounds .
There are acres of rolling greenery , lapping over private tennis courts and spurting fountains .
He lives here alone .
His former partner – or “ concubine ” , as he calls her – Bente Hogh ended their relationship when he was imprisoned , and he is single now .
Their teenage daughter Jessica visits sometimes .
As he shows me the foliage proudly , he explains that he used to live half the year in Florida , but now immigration is “ a nightmare . ”
He adds with a wag of the finger : “ If you go to Florida , do n’t go with a woman .
Florida is very humid , and she will blame the humidity on you .
It will be your fault . ”
We settle in the living room looking out over the grounds , and our photographer begins to snap him .
He mentions that the white coffee - cup Irving is holding works well against the green , and Irving says : “ Well , it is an Aryan cup . ”
A picture of his father , John , stares out from the mantelpiece .
“ I saw him very little , ” Irving says .
“ The rumour in the family was that when he found out that my mother was expecting twins – me and my brother – he turned and fled .
[ That was ] 1938 .
There were various attempts , sporadically , at reconciliation .
In those days families did n't divorce .
He came back once from Wales where he was living , and I 've got a vague memory of him being there for three or four days and then kicking over the traces and going again .
I remember in those two or three days , I went to Brentford school happy , nonchalantly mentioning that I was going to be having a chat with my father that evening .
But then he was gone again .
Then some time in the 1950s he came back for about another week .
He tried and also failed . ”
He only got to know his father in the last year of his life : 1964 .
John said he fought in the Battle of Jutland , so Irving got a contract for him with his publisher to write a book about it for the anniversary .
But his mother warned him he would only be let down again : the book would never arrive .
So Irving drove to Wales and took his father back to London to live in his flat .
“ I sat him at that table and I put out an old tape recorder in front of him and I said you dictate and I 'll spend all afternoon typing [ it ] up .
Between us we finished the book . ”
He suspects now his father was a fantasist .
He said he fought in the war and was invalided out after being on HMS Edinburgh , but “ after a time , when you get to know your father , in retrospect you think – I wonder if that was true ?
My sister has done a lot of research and says , ‘ You know David , a lot of what daddy told us was n't exactly true . ’…
Oh , he was full of stories .
He affected a mock Welsh accent when he told them . ”
Then he adds : “ In the navy they call this make - believe and exaggeration ‘ swinging the lantern . ’ ”

Are you like your father , David ?
“ Oh , everyone spots similarities between me and my father …
In fact my first wife , Pilar , got on very well with my mother , and at one point [ she told her ] I was being just the same as my father .
I know how he behaved . ”
How was that ?
“ Oh , probably some chauvinism .
I 've got pronounced views on women .
They 're very useful but they have their place . ”
And he thought that ?
“ Oh , I 'm sure he did .
When he died , his brother sent me a twelve page letter telling me what a rotter my father had been . ”
David was left alone with his mother and his siblings in the village of Ongar , in Essex .
She rose them alone , making money by drawing sketches for the Radio Times .
I ask how she explained that their father did n’t return .
“ Oh , I take always with a pinch of salt what women say about how their husbands behave .
I 've heard equally bad stories about her having complained to the Admiralty about him , which did n't do his career any good . ”
Nonetheless he says she raised her four children “ absolutely impeccably .
She managed to get us all into public school in Brentwood . ”
But it was a tough wartime childhood .
He says : “ You 're very indignant you 've got no toys .
Our toys were made of broomsticks and wood .
My older brother John had a Hornby train , the only reason I 've ever wanted to have a little boy was so I would have an excuse to have a Hornby train . ”
And this is where Adolf Hitler first enters David Irving ’s story .
II : That Man
“ I was told you do n't have toys because of that man Hitler , ” he says , sipping from his Aryan cup .
“ He was called That Man .
[ In the newspaper cartoons ] there were Nazis parading around – Mr Hitler with his crinkly boots and little toothbrush moustache , and there was Dr Goebbels with his club foot , and fat old Goering with his medals .
And I thought – because of them I 've got no toys ? ”
He snorts .
“ You split away from your parents at a very early age .
They tell you things and you nod and say ‘ yes mummy , ’ but at the back of your brain you think , well , I 'm probably being sold a bill of goods .
You make a little mental check … .
I said to myself , if they ’re such ludicrous people , then why are the Germans doing it for them ? ”
His twin brother , Nicky , remembers David at six years old running towards bombed - out houses after a Nazi air - raid , shouting “ Heil Hitler ! ”
Irving shakes his head .
“ Untrue , untrue , ” he mutters .
His infatuation began , he says , a few years later , when he was sent away to school .
He got hold of a copy of Hitler ’s Table Talk , and he would read it at night , allowing himself only a few pages at a time so it would last longer .
“ I do n't know if you 've read Hitler 's Table Talk , but it 's [ in bites of ] two or three page describing in the first person what Hitler said at lunch or dinner , from 1941 to 1944 , ” he says .
“ It ’s fascinating to read what Hitler was thinking .
A lot of it made sense . ”
Like what ?
“ Oh , about women … Women have very special minds .
They are superficially similar to us and they speak a very similar language to us but they are also rather like ants .
They can communicate with each other , without actually [ using ] a language that you can hear …
More than that I 'm not going to say , I 've got enemies enough already . ”
What could be more taboo in the Britain of the 1950s than to embrace Adolf Hitler , the man the country had united to defeat , as an alternative father - figure ?
It was the most absolute and shocking way to reject everything around him .
“ I was beaten solidly throughout [ school ] .
It was a very sadistic process …
Our house master was the gym teacher , which meant he was very muscular …
There was an umbrella stand with ten different bamboo canes of different calibre with a cushion next to it , which he would try them out on first ” – he makes a repeated thrashing noise – “ and he would say right come with me , follow me . ”
It was ritualised , I say .
“ Oh , absolutely , it was sadistic .
And I would n't have missed it . ”
When he was in his mid-teens , he won a school prize .
He could choose a book to be presented to him on Speech Day by the Deputy Prime Minister , Rab Butler .
Irving asked for Mein Kampf .
“ I arranged for all the local press to photograph the deputy prime minister giving a copy of Mein Kampf to Brentwood schoolboy David Irving , ” he says with glee .
“ I stood there holding the book up long enough for all the people to get their focus and flash and I sat down .
I looked at the book and it was n't Mein Kampf , it was a German - Russian technical dictionary .
They got their own back . ”
After Brentwood he went to Imperial College , London to study science , but he believes he was thwarted by a “ Communist ” professor and had to drop out .
He headed for Germany .
“ I was the only foreign labourer in the whole of the Ruhr , ” he says .
Working in the steelworks , he began to hear whispers of another taboo .
“ Dresden was a word which just did n't exist in the English vocabulary then , ” he says .
But the Germans told him their city – filled with civilians , with little military role – had been firebombed by the Allies .
“ The whole of the city centre was cordoned off while they were cremating the bodies , ten thousand at a time on the city square , ” Irving says , shaking his head .
So he wrote his first history book , a densely researched account of the firebombing of Dresden .
Suddenly he was an up - and - coming historian , acclaimed across continents .
But he remained within the historical consensus : the book condemns Nazi atrocities .
When I remind Irving of this now , he says these passages were inserted into the book without his knowledge .
“ My publisher William Kimber … felt very deeply about the Dresden air raid and he put in certain lines into my Dresden book without telling me .
Okay ? ”
He only realised this , he insists , “ years later . ” I must look incredulous .
You did n’t see the proofs ?
“ No . ” Why would he do that ?
“ Political correctness .
Do n't raise your eyebrows in great shock , this happens .
You'd be surprised if you knew how many people have a hand in a book before it 's finally published , lawyers , publishers , editors ' sisters and wives . ”
Ah yes , women .
By telling the story of Dresden from the perspective of the Germans , he suddenly found another door opening – to Hitler ’s ghost .
III : The Magic Circle
Scattered across Germany , silent and shamed , were Hitler ’s secretary , his personal guard , his doctor .
They were , he says , “ a small circle of very frightened people who had had a very tough time .
When one of them [ died ] , they would meet at the graveside . ”
They had never spoken to anyone .
Irving was the first outsider to penetrate this “ Magic Circle ” .
Otto Gunsche had been
Hitler ’s personal adjutant , the man who burned his body at the end – and he liked the Dresden book .
After a series of meetings , he led Irving to the rest .
“ They were all very nice people , ” he says .
“ This was something that impressed me from day one – these are people who 've been to staff college , they 've been to university , they 're educated , upper - middle class people , chosen for their qualities and their abilities … and they all spoke to me in private in terms of glowing admiration of the Chief .
And I thought to myself – there must be two Hitlers , there 's the Hitler we 're told about by Hollywood and Madison Avenue and there 's the Hitler that these people worked for . ”
They told him about a Hitler who was kind to children and animals .
He recounts a very long story about how Hitler once noticed that two stenographers were cold , and insisted they be brought heaters .
When I suggest that all dictators have a loyal clique who like them – it means nothing – he keeps dodging the question .
Eventually , he responds by arguing dictators are often misjudged : Idi Amin gets a unfair press , for one .
Irving says he owns a medallion that belonged to the Ugandan dictator , and he likes to wear it secretly below his clothes when he is delivering a lecture .
But , I respond , he ethnically cleansed the Ugandan Asians .
He shrugs : “ Expelling people is something that 's been going on for a long time . ”
From within Hitler ’s circle , Irving began to develop an elaborate theory that “ the Chief ” was innocent after all .
After the barrage of unanswerable evidence presented at his trial , Irving now concedes that the Holocaust happened – and there were “ some ” gassings at Auschwitz – but he insists Hitler had no idea it was going on .
It was orchestrated by the evil Joseph Goebbels and his staff .
They deliberately hid it from Hitler , because he was “ the best friend the Jews had in the Third Reich . ”
Eva Braun “ suckered him ” , and Goring made him look anti-Jewish when , in fact , by 1938 , Hitler “ was n’t anti-semitic at all . ”
Hitler was n’t anti-Semitic ?
If you look at his career , both in detail and in general , Hitler was the person who protected the Jews , ” he continues .
“ But he was repeatedly outsmarted by the Heinrich Himmlers , the Martin Bormanns . ”
When I start listing Hitler ’s many genocidal rages against Jews , he says he was just “ playing to the gallery . ”
Of course , to maintain his view that Hitler knew nothing , he has to tamper with historical documents – changing words , and deliberately ignoring all the contrary evidence , as was shown ad nausem at the trial .
I am more interested in teasing out why Irving should contort himself to believe this .
If a raddled , aged Adolf Hitler appeared at your door now , what would you say to him ?
“ I would switch on my tape recorder . ”
And after you had heard everything he had to say , would turn him in ?
“ Then I would base my decision on what he told me he had done and I would adopt a very harsh measure on that .
In the case of Herman Goerring , for example … a lovely , enjoyable buffoon but he was undoubtedly a hanging case .
He committed murders , and in my mind if you commit one murder you 're for the rope . ”
So you think it ’s conceivable that Adolf Hitler could not have committed even one murder ?
“ With his own hands ? ” No , not with his own hands .
He goes off on a long side - track about how Winston Churchill did kill people with his bare hands .
I have to drag him back to Hitler .
“ Oh , he 's technically responsible , he 's constitutionally responsible , but what interests me … [ is ] you find out again and again he 's been duped , he 's been duped by Eva Braun , he 's been duped ... ”
The last time he saw his mother , she disowned him because of this Hitler - love .
She had come to visit his new baby , Josephine , and she was sitting with the child when Irving tried to read her a passage from one of his books .
In revulsion , she asked : “ What is this viper I 've nurtured to my bosom ? ” Irving says : “ She was n't interested and I said , ‘ You just want to play with Josephine , you do n't want to listen to what I 'm [ saying ] , you 've just never been interested in anything I 've done , have you !’
Afterwards you kick yourself that those are the terms you have parted company for ever . ”
But still he cannot stop .
He says : “ One hundred years from now Hitler will get a very decent hearing .
Not so much his underlings .
IV : The Enemy
There were no Jews in the village where David Irving grew up , and he used to think there were none at his school .
“ But let me tell you a horrible little anecdote … ” he says , leaning forward .
“ Immediately after the Lipstadt trial I flew to Florida so they could n't touch me …
On the plane a man came down the aisle towards me , and said ‘ You 're David Irving are n't you ? ’
I said no you 're mistaken , and he said ‘ I know you 're David Irving , and I know why you 're denying it . ’
I said no you do n't .
Whoops ! ”
But when he got to Florida , the man told him angrily : “ I know who you are !
I went to school with you and you made life unbearable for me and another Jew .
I was a boy at Brentwood school , you called us filthy little yids , you screamed at us ! ”
Irving looks bemused as he recounts this story .
He assured the man there were no Jews at his school , and he must be mistaken .
But he was so shaken he got the man ’s name from the checkout desk .
( He claims the airline staff reassured him : “ Them Jews , them Jews , they all want to have suffered . ” )
He checked with his old school and “ I got all the details .
He was a year behind me , two years behind me .
Well , I do n't know if you know anything about public school , but you never , ever , ever speak to boys in the year , or two years behind you .
They do n't exist , they are lower than low .
No way would I have spoken to him . ”
This story is , to Irving , yet more evidence of Jewish wickedness .
He offers the old racist rote : the Jews organised “ most ” of the wars of the twentieth century , and sneer at “ the goyim . ”
Who were the first Jews you knew ?
“ At university .
Mike Gorb .
He was my flatmate in Kensington , very , very nice guy . ”
He is now uncontactibly dead , after a mountaineering accident .
“ John Blok , he was a kind of mentor for me at the university …
Jaqueline Gross we employed and she was very nice , very jolly girl and she thoroughly enjoyed working for us .
That was in 1982 or 1983 or something . ”
He insists these Jews were nice people – but when at a lecture a few years ago a Jewish man asked him if he was saying the Jews brought Auschwitz on themselves , he responded : “ The short answer is yes . ”
How were Mike and John and Jacqueline bringing on their own gassing ?
He shifts in his chair .
“ I know that I 'm not liked and I know why I 'm disliked and I know what I could do to become instantly liked .
The Jews have never asked themselves , so far as I can see , over the last three thousand years why they are not liked . ”
But there is a vast literature by Jews trying to figure out why anti-Semitism happens .
He backs off for a second .
“ I 'm not familiar with Jewish literature , because I do n't read it .
But do they ever reach an objective and useful conclusion ? ” he asks ingenuously .
Plainly is a mass hysteria , like the witchcraft craze – a long , mad search for a scapegoat .
“ Maybe you 're right , I hope you 're right , but then why would holocausts happen , why would the German people have turned a blind eye ? ” he says .
When I do n’t respond immediately , he exclaims : “ Gotcha ! Gotcha ! Gotcha ! ”
Do you think every persecuted group in history brought it on themselves then ?
Did the “ witches ” cause their own murder ?
“ Indirectly , yes , by not creating a society in which this would n't , could n't happen . ”
I run through a long list of persecuted groups in history , and finally come across a few he thinks were just the victims of “ mass hysteria . ”
So could n’t anti-Semitism be a mass hysteria ?
“ No . ”
He believes Jews are responsible for their own persecution because they do not “ police their own community , ” and begins talking about the fraudster Bernie Madoff as an example .
He believes Jews let him get away with it – even though a preposterously small proportion of Jews could possibly have been aware of his crimes .
So if your Jewish researcher or your Jewish flatmate was to be killed by anti-Semites , they would be responsible because they did n't stop Madoff ?
“ Or the Madoff of their days , yes . ”
He seems incapable of seeing Jews as individuals for long .
The faces of Mike and John and Jacqueline soon disappear into the amorphous monstrous mass existing only in his mind known as The Jew , which – intriguingly – suffers from many of the characteristics Irving ’s critics ascribe to him : it is attention - seeking and greedy and brings about its own destruction .
Yet he insists that , like his Hitler , he is only saying this for the Jews ’ own good .
“ I 'm a great friend of them …
I 'm saying this in their own interest .
I 'm trying to stop it happening again , whether it's in America or wherever else the Jews flee to .
They do n't recognise the fact that it 's just possible that they are the architects of their own misfortune , to use that wonderful phrase .
They are so arrogant , they wo n't accept this .
Every time some rich Jew dies , [ they say in his obituaries he was ] the noted philanthropist .
He wo n't go down in history as being a noted philanthropist , he 'll go down in history as being a Jew , and the non-Jews see the Jews and say ‘ well how have they made all their money ?
From us . ’
And that 's one reason to dislike them .
It 's human nature . ”
There will , he reckons , probably be another Holocaust in thirty years , when we realise we have been conned .
Oh , and if the Jews are lucky , there will be a David Irving or an Adolf Hitler there to protect them .
V : Josephine
In a box in the corner of this room , there sits the ashes of a girl Hitler would have murdered .
It is Irving ’s eldest daughter , Josephine .
Like in a moralistic Victorian parable , this Hitler - devotee ended up with a severely disabled daughter – and I want to know how he dealt with the dissonance .
“ In 1981 she became schizophrenic and it was a terrible shock for us , ” he says , his voice dropping from its confident strut .
She had been getting into trouble at school for a while , but Irving assumed it was normal teenage turbulence until one day she left an exam and walked home .
She told her father : “ Oh , the devil was sitting in the road just in front of me . ”
Irving looks into the middle distance .
“ You hear your own daughter saying things like that and it begins to become very frightening .
You do n't realise what 's going on . ”
A Harley Street doctor diagnosed her with latent paranoid schizophrenia .
“ It is not curable .
It can be treated , but for the benefit of the rest of society , ” he says .
“ My wife vanished for three months .
She could n't take it , left me with the children to look after .
I can't begrudge her that , it was a terrible shock and it took a long time to sink in . ”
He remembers walking with Josephine on the anniversary of her diagnosis , and he said she had been ill for a year “ She turned those blue eyes to me and she said , ‘ Oh no daddy , I 've been ill for many more years than that . ’
Imagine your oldest daughter saying that …
For the next 18 years she struggled with this appalling affliction which got worse and worse .
She heard these voices which speak with enormous compulsion .
The voice that tells you to stand back from the edge of a platform as an express train rattles through , with equally the same cohesion tells schizophrenics to do the exact opposite . ”
In 1996 , he tried to commit suicide by hurling herself from a building , and ended up “ a complete cripple ” , as Irving puts it , with a broken back and both her legs amputated .
She secretly married another seriously disabled man who “ had a bad , bad brain , ” but after three years , she attempted suicide again – this time successfully .
The hospital staff , he says , told him “ she must have been a very determined suicide indeed to pull herself out of a window , a fifth floor window , in that condition . ”
Their son is now grown up , and fighting in Afghanistan .
He says the experience has changed him .
“ I find myself becoming a lot more human towards people who have a disability … .
Now if I find a Down Syndrome child or someone a paraplegic or somebody with some other obvious disability wheeled past me I will go out of my way to go over to them , to smile , to say hello because you realize that they are humans too . ”
You do realize , I say as gently as I can , that Hitler would have killed Josephine ?
“ Yes , Hitler had one of his own cousins killed , this is one of the appalling things . ”
He then quickly goes off on another tangent , talking about a radio programme he was once on , and I have – for once – to draw him back to the Hitler .
I can almost see the conflict within him , as he veers back and forth from admitting Hitler did something wrong .
“ Hitler had the very best of reasons , if I can put it very oddly like that . ”
He claims the first case of euthanasia authorized by Hitler was of “ a child who had been born hideously disfigured in some way , and the doctors and the parents wanted to put the child down for its own sake …
That was the kind of reasoning behind it , and then [ Karl ] Brandt [ Hitler ’s physician ] came to Hitler and said of course this is n’t the only case , there are many many more cases like this , but this was the foot in the door .
[ It ] provided a lawful basis for termination of people who were medical misfits and it became ever wider .
When war broke out people said well , we need the hospital beds now for people who really need them , and gradually the field became broader and broader . ”
And so he concedes with a sigh : “ Had we been in Nazi Germany then Josephine would have been swept up in that procedure . ”
But then he adds quickly , in a sentence that uncharacteristically dissolves into meaninglessness : “ Except of course that we now have drugs ” to treat schizophrenia , “ so I am not sure that [ Hitler ] would have [ killed her ] because , as I say , just at the end , by that time the drugs would have been there which would have made it possible to ... ”
He stops and collects his thoughts .
“ The way the Nazis did it was always in the nicest possible way , ” he says at last .
“ The parents were told ‘ oh she has succumb to pneumonia ’ , something like that .
[ It was ] evil with good intentions . ”
Where were the good intentions ?
“ The parents would not have been told . ”
But the child would know that they were being killed , and the parents would still have a dead child .
“ I do n’t know , it is very difficult when you get into these fields , a what - if , a hypothesis . ”
It ’s hardly a wild what - if : it happened to tens of thousands of real people just like you .
He is silent .
So you really think the murder of people exactly like your daughter was an act committed “ in the kindest possible way ” ?
“ Oh , I am quoting that television gentleman … what is he called … he crossed his legs all the time and wore a beard . ”
Kenny Everett ?
“ Kenny Everett .
I ’m , uh , just quoting his catchphrase .
The Nazis did these things , but they did n’t do it , they did n’t do it , they did it in a concealed way so that parents only later on found out to their horror what had actually happened . ”
Does that make it any less horrific ?
He clams up .
“ I think this argument is so stilted I do n't want to get entwined in it . ”
He looks over at the ashes , and then looks down , speechless for the first time in our interview .
VI : Silenced
In 1989 , Austria ’s Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said publicly : “ Should Irving ever turn up here again , he ’ll be locked up immediately . ”
His lectures had breached the country ’s laws banning denial of the Nazis ’ crimes and rebuilding a Nazi movement – and the punishment ran to twenty years in jail .
Yet in 2006 , Irving chose to return to the country , knowing there was a warrant out for his arrest .
Was he seeking a confrontation ?
He shakes his head .
“ No , but I was prepared for it …
I can't allow people to silence me forever .
One day I shall have to go back to Germany .
I have to continue research there , but I 'm banned from Germany .
I can't allow people to silence me or to stop my research . ”
He was put on trial , and blames his conviction on the fact the fact that eight members of the jury were “ stolid , slab - featured , middle - aged Viennese Hausfrau type women , with a bus - stopping range of perhaps a hundred yards or more . ”
But prison , he insists , was wonderful .
“ I thoroughly enjoyed it , ” he says , pushing out his chest .
He says it ’s great for a writer to have all the distractions shut out .
He quotes Evelyn Waugh approvingly : “ Anyone who has been to an English public school will always feel comparatively at home in prison . ”
But is this true ?
This was the first time he was forced into close contact with black people , a group he believes are inferior .
He says America used to have a “ nicely stratified system , with the white on top followed by the coloureds followed by the blacks and the slave labour on the bottom , ” until the Jews decided to shake it up with the wicked civil rights movement .
Yet he says he made friends with a “ young Black ” called Momo , and with “ lots of them .
There were Africans in the prison from Nigeria of course .
I suppose it 's even racist to say of course , but I mean the Nigerians , blacks are going to be largely criminal .
I spoke most of their languages , French or Spanish or whatever and so they came to me . ”
In his new book about his time in jail , ‘ Banged Up ’ , he describes an odd incident in which he “ accidentally ” drank detergent , saying he mistook it for lemon juice .
Did you try to kill yourself ?
“ Lord good Lord no ! ” he says with a great forced guffaw .
“ No , I would never commit suicide .
Suicide is partly congenital like alcoholism .
If you want to be an SS officer , which probably you do n’t ... ” – he laughs – “ one of the forms that you had to fill in looks at if there is a history of suicide in your family or a history of alcoholism then that is a black mark . ”
He then describes an elaborate scenario in which detergent and lemon juice became interchangeable .
As I get up to leave , his daughter Paloma , who is visiting from Madrid , wanders in .
She asks our photographer nervously : “ Did he behave himself ? ” Irving takes me around the house for one last time , proudly pulling himself up the stairs .
He was declared bankrupt in 2003 – so how does he afford this gorgeous house ?
“ I 'm not going to talk about money very much , but I have an income . ” I heard you were supported by a Saudi prince .
“ I tried it , oh I tried it , ” he says .
He claims that in 2003 Prince Salman Fahd – son of the Saudi king , and then Interior Minister – promised him £ 800,000 , just before he died of a sudden heart attack .
“ I would say eighty percent of my income comes from the United States …
It 's very enjoyable showing that despite every effort the enemies make to smash me , provided my heart holds out , then I 'm okay .
I can survive . ”
VII : The scamp
As we stand by the Christmas tree , with the door open and the cold wind blowing in , I wonder –does David Irving believe what he says ?
Does he actually think Adolf Hitler ordained him as his defender when he was just a toddler in Essex ?
His twin brother , Nicky , has said : “ I ’ve never been entirely convinced that , deep down , David really holds these ridiculous views .
It ’s possible that he was simply doing what we did when we were children – anything to get attention .
It ’s almost a sickness with him . ”
His former partner Bente agrees : “ I never really felt he believed a lot of it .
I still do n’t really .
He enjoys being provocative .
He ’s an extraordinary attention seeker , always has been . ”
Is he just swinging the lantern , like his father ?
He laughs at this suggestion .
“ I am a scamp , yes a scamp , ” he says .
“ Ever since school .
I like to have one piece of mischief on every page I write so you go to turn the page and are thinking , well , what was that page about ? ”
And he closes his eyes tightly in the freezing air .
For one moment , it seems as though he is back at Brentwood School , asking for a copy on Mein Kampf for speech day , and thinking all this – all this hate , and all this hard work to rehabilitate the worst genodical killer of the twentieth century – is only a jolly , jolly jape .

Though PC gamers have laughed off the doom - saying surrounding the death of the platform , the piracy problem is n't going away .
2D Boy 's excellent indie title World of Goo is suffering at the hands of the pirates , as the game 's creators have revealed that the game has an alarming 90 percent piracy rate .
Ron Carmel , one of the two men who make up 2D Boy in its entirety , spoke to Joystiq about the stunning piracy rates for World of Goo.
Carmel recounted seeing torrents with upwards of " 500 seeders and 300 leechers " and receiving emails from some who bought the title after pirating it , but flat - out said that " the piracy rate was about 90 " percent .
" We 're doing ok , though , " Carmel said in stride .
" We 're getting good sales through WiiWare , Steam , and our website .
Not going bankrupt just yet . "
It 's very depressing to hear this , considering that World of Goo is an independent production ; this is the kind of story that makes big - name publishers believe even more strongly in DRM .
The company went out of its way to remove all DRM from the title , labeling the move an " experiment . "
The question is open : would the pirates have bought the game otherwise ?
Did the lack of DRM lead to more sales ?
The amount a game is pirated is n't important — lost sales are — but these things are nearly impossible to quantify .
We bought our copies .
Did you ?
Amazon , the world 's largest online retailer , is under attack by online pirates .
An add - on for the Firefox browser called ' Pirates of the Amazon ' makes it possible to shop at the Amazon store but leave without paying a dime .
Instead , on Amazon product pages the add - on integrates links to ' free ' copies on The Pirate Bay .
The timing of the ‘ Pirates of the Amazon ‘ launch could not have been more ( un ) fortunate .
At the busiest time of the year for on - and offline retailers , this Firefox browser add - on offers users a download link to pirated copies of products that can normally be found in the Amazon online store .
When the add - on is installed , it integrates a new “ download 4 free ” button into the Amazon product page when the same article is also available via The Pirate Bay .
It works for CDs , DVDs , games , books and basically all products that can be converted to a digital format .
With their mashup of the largest online retailer and the largest BitTorrent tracker , the project aims to “ be a counterpart to the current models of media distribution ” , and to “ redistribute the wealth ” .
The people behind the project have chosen to link to The Pirate Bay , but clearly state that they act independently .
“ We are not affiliated with The Pirate Bay , and do not host or even link to any illegal content , ” they write .
“ This artistic project addresses the topic of current media distribution models vs. current culture and technical possibilities . ”
‘ Pirates of the Amazon ’ is not the only pirate add - on for Firefox , in fact there are quite a few .
IMDB , Last.fm , and Rotten Tomatoes all have their own pirate skin available .
Most of them use the Greasemonkey add - on which allows the installation of all kinds of useful user scripts which customize the web to your pirate needs .

MUMBAI , India 
On any ordinary day , Vishnu Datta Ram Zende used the public - address system at Mumbai ’s largest railway station to direct busy hordes of travelers to their trains .
But last Wednesday just before 10 p.m. , when he heard a loud explosion and saw people running across the platform , he gripped his microphone and calmly directed a panicked crowd toward the safest exit .
The station , Victoria Terminus , it turned out , was suddenly under attack , the beginning of a three - day siege by a handful of young , heavily armed gunmen .
“ Walk to the back and leave the station through Gate No. 1 , ” he chanted alternately in Hindi and Marathi , barely stopping to take a breath until the platform was cleared .
No sooner , gunmen located his announcement booth and fired , puncturing one of the windows .
Mr. Zende was not hurt .
Overnight , Mr. Zende became one of Mumbai ’s new heroes , their humanity all the more striking in the face of the inhumanity of the gunmen .
As the city faced one of the most horrific terrorist attacks in the nation ’s history , many ordinary citizens like Mr. Zende , 37 , displayed extraordinary grace .

The U.S. Treasury building is seen in Washington , September 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Bourg
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Treasury Department official Stuart Levey has agreed to act as treasury secretary pending confirmation of Timothy Geithner , a transition official said on Thursday .
Geithner , President - elect Barack Obama ’s nominee to succeed Henry Paulson , has run into trouble over back taxes and the immigration status of a former housekeeper .
The controversy forced the Senate Finance Committee to postpone until next Wednesday a nomination hearing for Geithner .
Obama has said he is confident that Geithner will win Senate approval , but the hearing delay means the president - elect will take office on January 20 without his pick to lead the United States out of its worst economic crisis in decades .
An official in Obama ’s transition team confirmed U.S. media reports that Levey , Treasury ’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence , would act as treasury secretary pending Geithner ’s approval .
Levey , an attorney who has served as under secretary since 2004 , has been responsible for the Treasury Department ’s efforts to disrupt and dismantle financial networks supporting terrorist organizations .
Winter weather and cabin fever can lead to some strange behavior .
Take this tale of two thirtysomething Wisconsin brothers for instance .
Apparently , a fight over a PS2 controller lead to punching , choking and stabbing .

According to the Waukesha Police , the fight started over an argument about who 's turn it was to play the ( unidentified ) game .
Eventually , the fight escalated when one brother tried to choke the other out .
In retaliation , he pulled an knife and slashed at his assailant .
The knife was wrestled out of his hands and plunged into his chest .
In a panic , the brother who did the stabbin ' fled the scene and walked to the hospital — suffering severe frostbite on his hands as a result .
The injuries sustained were not life threatening , but police are recommending that charges be brought up against both brothers .
They are also speaking with Santa Claus about the possibility of placing his boot squarely and firmly into their asses .

The dramatic moment surfer cheats death after being trapped between pier and 30ft wave
This is the dramatic moment a daredevil surfer cheated death after becoming trapped in between a stone pier - and a freak 30ft wave .
Terrified Jacob Cockle , 23 , almost drowned when the monster wave emerged from nowhere and charged towards him at at a speed of over 40 mph .
Frantic Jacob struggled desperately to paddle to safety , but was caught in powerful currents that prevented his escape .
A giant wave nearly smashes surfer Jacob Cockle ( circled ) into the sea wall at Newlyn , Cornwall
Clinging helplessly to his board , the student was tossed into the air ' like a rag doll ' when the wave - with an estimated mass of seven tonnes - broke over him .
He was flung into the surf and spent ' ages ' underwater before finally managing to overcome the currents and paddle back to shore .
Mr Cockle was tossed into the air ' like a rag doll ' when the wave - with an estimated mass of seven tonnes - broke over him
Miraculously , Jacob survived the terrifying incident earlier this month at Newlyn , near Penzance in Cornwall , unscathed .
But speaking yesterday from his home in Penzance , Cornwall , Jacob said : ' I could n't believe it .
' I was stuck by the pier and I saw this huge wave rear up right in front of me .
It was just massive and there was no escape .
Terrified : Jacob Cockle
' I thought that was it , that I was in way over my head .
' The wave was so powerful that I was underwater for ages but eventually I managed to swim in to the beach . '
Jacob , a photography student who has been surfing since childhood , added : ' I 've been surfing almost all my life but I never thought I 'd get into a situation like that .
' It was terrifying .
It 's a real reminder of how nature can throw up a surprise now and again . '
Older brother Joe , 30 , was taking pictures from the beach when he saw the giant wave approaching the pier .
Joe , also a photography student at nearby Truro College , said he watched helplessly as his brother was thrown by the surf .
He said : ' There were some really big waves so Jacob wanted me to take some photos of him surfing .
' All of a sudden this massive wave comes through and my brother was in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time .
' I saw the wave land right on him so I dropped my camera and ran to the water to see if he was ok .
' It 's just so lucky that he got out unharmed . '

The accompanying photo gallery is a just small taste of the hundreds of images available .
The Earth Observatory online library stretches back to 1999 , providing a graphic snapshot of how nature and man create changes on the surface of the planet .
In February , dust storms can be seen curling off the coast of Morocco , carrying plumes of sand out across the Atlantic Ocean .
NASA suggest that these storms could be the result of stresses on the land surface -- such as overgrazing and damage to vegetation -- caused by humans .
A satellite image taken in March shows a section of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica , measuring 41 kilometers by 2.5 kilometers , crumble away into the sea .
And the image of Tokyo at night looks like a giant electrical circuit board -- which , of course , it is .
Meanwhile , south of Sudan 's capital , Khartoum , the geometric shape of irrigated fields reveal a man-made collage of rivers and crops while the swollen waters of the Mississippi break the levees in Gulfport , Illinois in June 2008 , leaving homes submerged and lives in ruin .
Hurricane Bertha , the first of the 2008 Atlantic season , gathers strength in July and was a record breaker .
" Since reliable records began in the 1940s , no hurricane has ever formed so far east before August 1 , " NASA reports .
Two hundreds miles above Central Asia , the skies are visibly calmer as polar mesospheric clouds are captured on film .
While the earth is still shrouded in darkness , the clouds are illuminated by the first streaks of sunlight .
NASA says that polar mesospheric clouds are not uncommon over Northern Asia .
Some researchers link increased observations of them to climate change .
A picture taken by an astronaut shows the Amazon burnished in gold as the light of a setting sun transforms the appearance of the river and its tributaries in Brazil .
While the iridescent waters off the coast of Texas and Louisiana reveal the environmental jolt of a storm surge created by Hurricane Ike .
A contrasting aftermath of nature 's force can be seen in the image of the charred peaks of the Chino Hills in southern California which show the extent of damage caused by the recent fires .

DJ Talent hopes to raise £ 30,000 from selling his teeth A DJ and recording artist hit by the economic downturn is planning to sell his gold teeth in order to raise cash .
Anthony Ghosh , aka DJ Talent , hopes to raise about £ 30,000 by selling all 28 of his gold crowns .
The 30 - year - old from Beckenham , south London , says he has seen a significant drop in vinyl sales .
" Records are n't really shifting these days , " said the electro house DJ .
" It 's been like this for a couple of months now and it 's not getting any better . "
He added : " It 's more downloads everyone 's interested in , so the music industry is taking a drop . "
It 's a big decision getting rid of my teeth and could actually cost me my career as I do n't know if I 'll be noticed with white teeth
DJ Talent
He had his teeth crowned three years ago , at a cost of £ 10,000 , to help to boost his career .
" I had all my teeth filed down to small spikes to be more recognisable to my fans and have a trademark as a recording artist , " he said .
" But due to the credit crunch and things not going too great at the moment , I 'm forced to think about what I 'm going to do in the future . "
" It 's a big decision getting rid of my teeth and could actually cost me my career , as I do n't know if I 'll be noticed with white teeth . "
However , he is considering getting treatment for his teeth once the economic outlook improves by turning to platinum crowns because " they 're better value , basically " .

The urban jungle is n’t exactly the safest place for bicyclists .
You need the right tools to keep you one step ahead of irresponsible motorists .
The Nike Hindsight gives you superhuman like powers with extended peripheral vision so all those sneaky cars , beware .
They work similar to bifocals except for your peripheral vision .
By using fresnel lenses on both sides of the glasses , riders can detect motion in a field of view beyond the normal human limit of 180º .
If you want to get technical about it ; high power , diverging fresnel zones aligned vertically distort into view an extra 25 º on both sides .
Vision is radically distorted in the periphery , but as the eye detects only motion in that area , little clarity is lost in the process .
A rider ’s clear benefit is in the early warning of approaching vehicles , but a less obvious advantage is reducing the necessary head rotation to check behind .
Tho it was intended for bicyclists , there ’s a myriad of sports and activities where a greater field of view becomes an advantage .
As for me , I would totally wear these 24/7 to keep this one particular friend in check .
He finds it funny sneaking up on me .
My nerves are shattered enough .
I ca n’t take it anymore .
I need these shades .

Hey rav , thank you , your screencast is great .
I do n't agree that KDE should replace Windows shell though .
However , as soon as most KDE applications work stable on Windows , they could replace most default applications ( like notepad , windows mail etc ) .

The irresponsibility of television news broadcasters never ceases to amaze me .
Exhibit This Morning is Channel 5 in Boston , which just informed my wife and me that a tanker truck carrying deadly something or other had overturned , closing a major highway and forcing the evacuation of a nearby neighborhood .
What the talking head -- a pleasant enough fellow named David Brown -- did not tell us was a ) which highway or b ) which neighborhood .
The reason he did not tell us these pertinent details is not because he and the other alleged journalists who work on this alleged news broadcast do not recognize the value of that information , but rather it is their way of insisting we watch the upcoming round of commercials before learning if we slept through the evacuation order .
We live near Rte. 495 , a major north - south thoroughfare ; my in - laws live so close to Rte. 128 they can hear the traffic ; and , my brother and his wife could have their mail delivered to I - 95 just over the border in New Hampshire , so the information being withheld on purpose by Brown and his colleagues is n't necessarily a matter of mere curiosity .
However , it is the principle of the matter -- the journalistic principle of the matter -- that most frosts my butt .
Yes , I realize that television news does this kind of thing all the time ( with weather forecasts foremost ) .
I also realize that they , like me , depend on advertising revenue to put roofs over their heads .
I 'm just saying they might consider making an exception when public safety is on the line .
So , where was the accident ?
A few mouse clicks shows it was my brother and his wife most at risk , since I 'm guessing Channel 5 was " teasing " this wreck , which happened two exits south of where they get their mail .
And I did n't have to watch Channel 5's commercials to find out .

God or science ?
A belief in one weakens positive feelings for the other

A person 's unconscious attitudes toward science and God may be fundamentally opposed , researchers report , depending on how religion and science are used to answer " ultimate " questions such as how the universe began or the origin of life .
What 's more , those views can be manipulated , the researchers found .
After using science or God to explain such important questions , most people display a preference for one and a neutral or even negative attitude toward the other .
This effect appears to be independent of a person 's religious background or views , says University of Illinois psychology professor Jesse Preston , who led the research .
The study appears in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .
Preston and her colleague , Nicholas Epley , of the University of Chicago , wanted to explore how information about science influences a belief in God , and how religious teaching can also cause people to doubt certain scientific theories .
" As far as I know , no one has looked experimentally at an opposition between belief in science and religion , " Preston said .
" It seemed to me that both science and religion as systems were very good at explaining a lot , accounting for a lot of the information that we have in our environment , " she said .
" But if they are both ultimate explanations , at some point they have to conflict with each another because they can't possibly both explain everything . "
The researchers conducted two experiments designed to manipulate how well science or God can be used as explanations .
In the first , 129 volunteers read short summaries of the Big Bang theory and the " Primordial Soup Hypothesis , " a scientific theory of the origin of life .
Half then read a statement that said that the theories were strong and supported by the data .
The other half read that the theories " raised more questions than they answered . "
In the second experiment , which involved 27 undergraduate students , half of the study subjects had to " list six things that you think God can explain . "
The others were asked to " list six things that you think can explain or influence God . "
All the subjects were then required to quickly categorize various words as positive or negative on a computer .
" What they did n't realize was that they were being subliminally primed immediately before each word , " Preston said .
" So right before the word ' awful ' came up on the screen , for example , there was a 15 - millisecond flash of either ' God ' or ' science ' or a control word . "
A 15 - millisecond visual cue is too brief to register in the conscious mind , but the brief word flash did have an effect .
Those who had read statements emphasizing the explanatory power of science prior to the test were able to categorize positive words appearing just after the word , " science , " more quickly than those who had read statements critical of the scientific theories .
Those who were asked to use God as an ultimate explanation for various phenomena displayed a more positive association with God and a much more negative association with science than those directed to list other things that can explain God , the researchers found .
Similarly , those who read the statement suggesting that the scientific theories were weak were extremely slow to identify negative words that appeared after they were primed with the word " God , " Preston said .
" It was like they did n't want to say no to God , " she said .
" What is really intriguing is that the larger effect happens on the opposite belief , " she said .
" When God is n't being used to explain much , people have a positive attitude toward science .
But when God is being used to account for many events – especially the things that they list , which are life , the universe , free will , these big questions – then somehow science loses its value . "
" On the other hand , people may have a generally positive view of science until it fails to explain the important questions .
Then belief in God may be boosted to fill in the gap , " she said .
The most obvious implication of the research is that " to be compatible , science and religion need to stick to their own territories , their own explanatory space , " Preston said .
" However , religion and science have never been able to do that , so to me this suggests that the debate is going to go on .
It 's never going to be settled . "
Ewa Jasiewicz is a journalist and activist .
She is currently the project co-ordinator for the Free Gaza Movement , and one of the only international journalists on the ground in Gaza .
Here is her account of a week spent trying to document the attacks .
Sunday
The shock of the first day of attacks , launched within minutes of one another , and killing over 230 people in 24 hours , has had no chance to sink in .
Me and my friend Mohammad travelled up to Beit Lahiya today , in the north of the Gaza Strip , to spend the night with the family of a local human rights activist .
Israeli missile fire jarred the journey ; we leapt out and filmed at a burning paint factory in Jabaliya ; no one was injured .
As we drove away , another missile hit , this time a steelworks behind us ; again we went to film .
" Fi shaheed , fi shaheed , " people were shouting , " There is a martyr , " but we saw no one .
We were the only car on the road .
Our driver told us , " The streets are full of fear , nobody wants to go out . "
In Beit Lahiya our friend showed us leaflets the Israelis had dropped from planes .
In plain black script on white A5 , it began : " The IDF [ Israel Defense Forces ] are working against perpetrators of terrorist operations ... we are trying our best not to attack or cause any injuries to civilians ... "
Our friend took us to his roof and pointed out all the possible targets for Israeli strikes .
Here , a mosque founded by Hamas , here the local police station , here a place once frequented by Hamas ' military wing .
Our night was peppered with the sound of tanks creaking along the border , Apache strikes on Jabaliya , Israeli naval ships bombing the port and the F16 strike on the Islamic University .
I got a call from a medical volunteer friend in Jabaliya : " They just bombed the Aiman Ajin mosque - we have dug out five little girls .
Five girls have just been martyred . "
Monday
We went to Jabaliya .
Multiple strikes had levelled the mosque and taken the neighbouring house down with it .
A grieving tent had been erected outside .
The father of the girls was inconsolable .
He cursed the idle Arab leaders of the world and America : " They were sleeping , they were sleeping and the Israelis bombed the house .
The world has died , the world has died . "
Tuesday
Yesterday the Islamic University , where students of all faiths , political affiliation and nationalities came to study , was bombed .
I went to see the damage and was shocked .
I had delivered a lecture on journalism there a week ago .
Now , the science , engineering and technology department is rubble , with torn textbooks , a dangling computer keyboard , slumped concrete floors , a buried laptop bag ...
Wednesday
We awoke to survey the latest damage .
The home of the al - Naim family had had its roof , walls , furniture and floors smashed by exploding debris .
One piece which broke through into a bedroom was a metre long and more than 30 cm wide .
While talking to the family and filming the destruction we heard shattering bangs to our east .
We made out way to Beit Hanoun hospital .
People were agitated , crowds were gathering ; I expected to see an ambulance hurtling round the corner and saw instead a donkey - drawn cart pulling three children and two male relatives .
Twelve - year - old Haya was dead , her singed body quickly covered by a white sheet .
Four - year - old Lamma died in front of us .
Ismaeel , nine , came in breathing .
" We think he 'll be ok , we need to x-ray his legs , " doctors said .
[ He died on Thursday morning . ]
The children died of internal injuries consistent with having been thrown in the air and bounced some 10 metres off the ground .
They had gone to throw the rubbish out .
Later , I went to the offices of Ramattan News - Palestine 's answer to al - Jazeera - to write .
I stayed all night .
Ramattan 's frontline reporters are all local , they do n't have flak jackets or helmets but get some of the best pictures and footage going .
Gaza branch 's director told me they feared being targeted .
Rumours of an Israeli strike had all journalists emptying their offices , lugging computers and cameras and hard drives out to a safe house .
Most of the windows have been taken out in case they shatter - a cold wind whines through Ramattan 's offices , and journalists wear hats and scarves and drink sweet tea to keep warm .
Ramattan have had a shipment of tapes , spare parts , satellite equipment , and mixing desks held at the borders for nearly three months .
The means to witness and communicate the reality of Israel 's attacks here is being denied .
Thursday
We heard that two paramedics had been hit by missiles yesterday while trying to evacuate some fighters in Jabaliya .
Mohammad Abu Hasira , 24 , died on the spot .
I visited 35 - year - old Ihab al - Madhoun at the Kamal Adwan hospital .
He had suffered multiple shrapnel injuries .
His eyes were open , wide and horrified ; he was restless , and kept moving his bandaged head , brain fluid soaking the pillow behind him .
He died soon after .
Myself and Ali , a human rights worker , travelled to try to see the scene of the attack , but could n't get close .
Ali took me to his home in Baiyer al - Debough , on the outskirts of Jabaliya .
It has no windows and his extended family , 12 people in total , all sleep together in one room .
His three - year - old son Salah is undaunted , " If they come with missiles , I 'll just throw them straight back , " he says .
Back in Beit Hanoun , missiles smash into a street in the Hay Amel area , injuring 16 including 10 children .
Beit Hanoun hospital was full of terrified , bloodied children .
One boy , too stunned to speak , was being taken away by two male relatives .
I wished him well and one relative said : " See how they learn about missiles , as soon as he 's older he 'll hit them right back at them . "
At the hospital , all the talk is about a possible invasion .
Friday
A week after the first strikes , surveillance planes are ever - present above us .
Every night , most of Gaza is in total darkness .
Gas is unavailable ; people cook on home - made mud and clay stoves using wood and kerosene .
Food , particularly bread , is scarce .
Travelling around this place , sitting with families in the dark , under blankets , with candles and a wood stove for light and heat , I feel like I am in a tent with refugees .
David Shippy and Mickie Phipps ’ new book “ The Race for a New Game Machine ” has all the videogames industry drama that a person could ask for .
The Wall Street Journal recently put up a tight synopsis of the book , detailing how Microsoft was able to nab fundamental specifications for the Cell and have their own chip created around them for the Xbox 360 .
According to the book , Sony decided that the Playstation 3 needed to have a brand new processor , unlike anything their previous consoles featured before .
In 2001 , a partnership was formed between Sony , Toshiba , and IBM to create the chip from scratch .
In 2002 , Microsoft ( looking to build the 360 ) went to IBM , saw some of the key specs for the unreleased Cell , and contracted IBM to build a processor around those specifications to put into the 360 .
The kicker is that Microsoft ended up winning the time war , without having to spend the R&D money that Sony did .
Because of a manufacturing error with the first round of chips that Microsoft protected itself against , they were able to release their console in 2005 – Sony ’s original target year .
This book does n’t have spies , ninjas , Master Chief , or pictures of cats in precarious positions with hilariously misspelled captions to explain the predicament .
It does have an awesome story to tell , though .

The spirit of giving is in the air !
Like TV on the Radio , Elbow , and Keane and Lily Allen before them , the Arcade Fire are supporting a charity with the release of a new song — and you can hear it right now on SPIN.com .
“ Lenin , ” an unreleased track from the Neon Bible sessions originally called “ When Lenin was Little , ” is the Montreal indie rockers ’ contribution to Dark Was the Night , a upcoming compilation benefiting HIV / Aids charity the Red Hot Organization .
The song features the Arcade Fire ’s characteristic pounding pianos and R&B bass .
But it ’s obvious why it did n’t make Neon Bible – it ’s not exactly their best work .
Nonetheless , it ’s a new Arcade Fire song .

THE METHODS : Top Four Ways Algae Can Fix the Future of Energy
THE PROCESS : How to Make Oil from Algae in Four Steps
Forget wind power or solar power or all the other promising but frustratingly incremental solutions to America 's energy crisis .
The answer , instead , could be algae .
It 's plentiful and , like corn and soybeans , can be processed into oil and gas to power our factories , cars , and airplanes .
But unlike ethanol , oil made from algae wo n't compete with the food supply .
And because algae can grow off a power plant 's carbon emissions and greenhouse gases , it can help solve , rather than exacerbate , global warming .
According to some estimates , by dedicating just 2 percent of its land mass to algae production , America could meet all of its energy needs .
The U. S. government abandoned its algae - as - fuel research program in 1996 because it did n't think it could ever get the price competitive with petroleum oil .
But with oil prices now far higher and global warming an ever - increasing concern , interest in algae oil is back , and tens of millions of dollars of venture capital has followed .
There are dozens of different approaches , but the end goal is the same : to find a production method that will fuel America -- and the twenty - first century .

It 's things like this that make me proud to be an indie game developer .
RealArcade , a subsidiary of RealNetworks , recently released Tiki Towers , a game that looks quite similar to 2DBoy 's hot game World of Goo .
Like identical twin similar .
I do n't want to make any allegations about the inspiration for Tiki Towers .
For all I know , they could have came up with the idea totally independently .
However , what is really noteworthy , is that despite this game having the backing of RealNetworks , and over a year of professional development , the indie game World of Goo is totally kicking its ass .
The reviews are coming in and so far , it looks pretty weak .
Now compare it to World of Goo , one of the highest rated games of the year , with " universal acclaim " according to Metacritic .
It 's refreshing to know that two dedicated and independent game developers , Ron Carmel and Kyle Gabler , can still utterly destroy a team of programmers , PR people , and the corporate behemoth backing Tiki Towers - a company with over half a billion dollars in annual revenue .

While imaging the Large Magellanic Cloud , astrophotographer Doug Robertson got a real surprise when he went to process his data … .
He ’d accidentally recorded the uncontrolled return of the intermediate stage of a recent Russian rocket launch that just put three GLOSNASS satellites into orbit .
Eyewitnesses in Adelaide , Australia were astounded when a huge fireball lit up the skies shortly after midnight local time .
The initial response was believed to be attributed to meteoric activity , but the 45 second event broke into several pieces and traveled along a parallel trajectory .
Hearing the news , Robertson checked his photographic data and sure enough , during the time stamp of 12:12:38 am , he ’d caught the event .
Like all good astronomers , the initial reaction is to immediately report and wait for an answer .
According to the Publicity Officer of the Astronomical Society of South Australia , Tony Beresford : “ Last night at around 00:18CST sept 27 or 14:48 UT Sept. 26 , an intermediate stage of a recent Russian launch that put 3 GLOSNASS satellites into orbit , re-entered the atmosphere and became visible travelling N - S over Adelaide .
I had a full report from a person who saw the pass from Hallett Cove immediately after the event .
It was an expected uncontrolled re-entry .
The rocket stage had broken into several pieces .
This aspect seems similar to other re-entries reported to me over the years .
It took nearly a minute to pass over .
A Sunday Mail reporter who rang this morning said they had a least a dozen reports .
Some of the reports incorrectly used the term “ meteor shower ” to describe what they saw .
Some meteors could give the same phenomena of multiple bodies on parallel paths , but that is not a meteor shower ! ! ”
Is returning “ space junk ” a problem ?
You bet .
In a very comprehensive article done by Nancy a few months ago called Space Debris Illustrated : The Problem in Pictures , she clearly illustrated how spent booster stages and discards from spacecraft could turn into a serious problem for future spaceflight if left unmonitored and uncontrolled .
While the Russian return was expected , it ’s still just another indicator of a mounting problem – inactive space hardware in orbit around the Earth .
According to NASA Shuttle program director John Shannon , “ Next month ’s shuttle flight to the Hubble Space Telescope faces an increased risk of getting hit by space junk because it will be in a higher , more littered orbit than usual .
New number - crunching puts the odds of a catastrophic strike by orbital debris including bits of space junk at about 1 - in - 185 during Atlantis ’ upcoming mission to Hubble .
That compares to 1 - in - 300 odds for a shuttle flight to the International Space Station . ”
Thankfully for everyone concerned there was no impact on the Shenzhou - 7 mission – just a little late night excitement .
Said Robertson , “ Unfortunately I did n’t witness this naked eye .
But as you see that main fragment / track looks extremely bright .
Although rough , the crop clearly shows the number of fragments / debris surrounding the brighter tracks – reminded me off the shuttle disaster a few years ago .
Glad it was n’t anything to do with the manned Chinese mission .
Wish I had put down my coffee and stepped outside a bit earlier to see it ! ”

Is everybody ready for some sweet prostitute interviewing ?
A tipster tells us " 100 % reliably " that Ashley Alexandra Dupre , the famous Eliot Spitzer hooker , sat down for her first - ever prime time interview yesterday .
Our source says that Diane Sawyer filmed the interview for ABC at a midtown studio , in secret , and that the network is planning to air it next Friday .
The network has n't announced it yet , so you heard it here first , assuming it happens .
The other , less solid part of this rumor involves how Ashley got paid for her time :
Our tipster is somewhat less sure of this part , but has also heard :
[ That ] dupre was paid a large " consulting fee " and for " archival footage " — the standard way interview subjects are paid by the networks .
( how outrageous , to pay a hooker that much money and only get an interview ! )
This would be standard , of course , because none of the news networks " pay " for interviews .
Just for services rendered , so to speak , haha .
If you have any more info on the Dupre interview , email us .

Christmas lights raise a smile but most of us breathe a sigh of relief when they find that no one is doing it on their road .
Putting Christmas bling on your suburban crib has become increasingly fashionable in recent years .
" Orders from individuals have increased enormously .
A typical home spends £ 150 on lights , but we have had households spending £ 5,000 , which is what you 'd expect a company to pay , " says Fiona Cameron of www.xmasdirect.co.uk , one of the country 's largest suppliers of Christmas lights .

" Outdoor lights , " she continues , " are much more popular these days , and it seems they 're especially common in Wales , Cornwall , Essex and London . "
Cameron explains that they used to be very specialised , expensive and involve complex systems using transformers .
" But with lower - energy lights , you can run a large display from a normal household circuit , " she says .
There are more than 50 outdoor lighting firms in the UK , most selling Christmas specials .
Why not try a three - foot - tall illuminated polar bear for £ 279.99 , a 3 - D horse - and - carriage set for £ 399.99 ( plus £ 70 for Santa sitting inside ) , or my personal favourite , an animated Santa and Snowman on a see- saw for just £ 136 ?
But not everyone is amused .
Websites such as www.houseblinger.com encourage owners and neighbours to submit pictures of displays , asking them to vote for the best ; www.uglychristmaslights.com celebrates the most tasteless examples .
Sometimes it can get serious .
Vic Moszczynski used to festoon his house at Sonning - on - Thames in Berkshire with 22,000 fairly lights at Christmas for 18 years , until 2006 , when neighbours won a court injunction .
He was then restricted to 300 lights , four seven - foot - high inflatable cartoon characters , eight 30 - foot - long strips of rope lights and two illuminations in the front garden .
Within a few months , paint had been daubed over the homes of three complainants and Mr Moszczynski found himself in court accused of vandalism , although he was acquitted when the judge found there was insufficient evidence to convict him .
There are hundreds of similar disputes every year .
Planning permission is rarely required , even for large outdoor Christmas displays , because they are not permanent and do not change the footprint of the property .
So rows tend to break out once the lights are up and the crowds arrive .
" Disputes between neighbours can become very bitter and cause great distress for both sides .
Mediation , whether informal or in the presence of lawyers , is often the best way to resolve disputes , as going through the courts can be emotionally and financially draining , says John Pugh - Smith , a London barrister who has written a guide on how to resolve disputes between neighbours .
The police , the Law Society , Citizens Advice bureaux , councils and mediation services all report sharp rises in numbers of complaints about light pollution , increased traffic , noise and even brawls caused by the spread of Christmas lights .
Leonard Road , a street in Woolaston in the West Midlands , has more than 30 homes lit up and has more than 40,000 visitors each December ; one Scottish residential street claims 3,000 visitors each weekend in November and December .
There 's an environmental price to pay , though .
The Energy Saving Trust says that modest indoor Christmas - tree lights , burning for 10 hours a day for two weeks , will cost UK households £ 15 m this Christmas .
" A home with a big outdoor display lit throughout December and early January may spend the same as it would during six weeks of normal usage and generate vast amounts of carbon dioxide , " says a spokesman .
But the trust has thrown out a lifeline .
It advises using LED Christmas lights , which use just 10 per cent of the energy of conventional festive bulbs .
There is no guarantee that the lights wo n't be tacky and annoying to neighbours , but at least you can't be accused of not caring about the environment .
Ding - dongs : Quarrels of Christmas past
* In Ayrshire , 50 residents got an injunction limiting a neighbour 's 8,000 - bulb display to three hours a day
* Robbie Raggio , a Sussex businessman , received anonymous letters describing his charity lights in Hove as " distasteful " and a " wasteful use of power "
* Middlesbrough Council stopped the owner of a light - strewn house from erecting signs diverting traffic into her street
* A residents ' association in Utah has complained about noise and lights from one house that put up Christmas decorations in July
[ Editor 's note : neveranything shares with us a very heartwarming story on how videogames helped him make new friends for his Monthly Musing piece .
-- CTZ ]
Throughout elementary and middle school , I was the textbook definition of a bully target .
I was weak , shy , and a bit of a loner .
I had a few friends , but we all fell into the same category of bully magnets .
Since we all fell into the same social category , we formed a fairly tight - knit group and kept to our own little social circle .
Even then , I was still a loser .
I was n't too good at meeting people and making new friends .
If I ended up in a class without anybody I knew , I 'd just fade into the background of the class .
I was cursed by my shyness when it came to meeting new people .
I 'd look for my first chance to escape and hightail it to the nearest quiet corner of the school .
This curse began to carry on through high school until my Sophomore year , when one of the school bullies noticed me reading the December 1998 copy of EGM in my Graphic Arts class .
Normally , I 'd just catch my daily dose of harassment from him so I braced myself when he started walking towards me .
But as he got closer he stopped , looked at what I was reading , then sat next to me and asked what kind of score Metal Gear Solid got .
This scared the ever - living crap out of me and I immediately began looking for the first opening to run .
This bully was one of my daily tormentors ; why would he want to be nice to me ?
Feeling cornered , I quickly gave him the answer and then buried my nose in the magazine .
The bully asked to read the reviews , so I quickly handed him the magazine .
He took a quick read over the reviews , then asked me if I had read much about Metal Gear Solid .
I gave him a quick " yes , " still feeling cornered .
The bully asked me what I thought of the game , based on what I 'd read .
Before I could answer , he started to tell me in detail what he'd read about MGS and how excited he was about it .
I eventually relaxed , and told him what I 'd read about MGS .
I 'd spent a lot of time reading every magazine article I could on it and surprised the bully with how much I knew .
By the time I told him that I had saved as much as I could to get a PlayStation just to play MGS , the class was over .
We both had the same lunch ( which I never knew before because I usually avoided him ) so we agreed to meet up then and talk about the game more .
At lunch I met some of the bully 's friends , who happened to be more of my daily tormentors .
He told them I was " cool , " and that I knew a lot about MGS , a game they were all interested in .
We spent the entire lunch period talking about games , and I started to gain a little acceptance outside of my normal social circle .
As the school year went on , I spent more time hanging out with the bully .
He eventually went from bully to friend , and I began to make even more friends thanks to a shared interest in Pokémon .
Due to the fact that Game Boys were n't allowed in school for any reason , I became part of an elite covert group of Pokémon traders .
During our free time in classes and in between classes , we would hammer out trade agreements , sometimes going into intense haggling bouts to try to get the best trade .
It could take days for trades between rare and / or high level Pokémon to be finalized .
At lunch we would put our backpacks on the lunch table , with our Game Boys conveniently nestled inside .
We 'd use the lunch trays to conceal the link cable , which ran across the table .
When the lunch monitors were distracted we 'd quickly make the trades .
Pokémon battles could be just as daunting .
Battles would be negotiated like prized boxing fights and created many heated rivalries .
I kept meeting new people through the common connection of videogames and eventually began to get recognized more in school .
I also noticed that I was n't as afraid of stepping outside of my social circle as I used to be .
With the friends I made through gaming I started to branch out , taking what I 'd learned by making friends through gaming and started meeting new people through other shared interests .
By my Senior year , I made a lot of progress socially .
I was still a gaming nerd , but I 'd become a " cool " gaming nerd .
I 'd become friends with other kids from a bunch of different social circles .
From the jocks to the art kids and everywhere in between .
I even became friends with most of the kids who had bullied me previously .
And even if I was n't a friend with everyone in my school , I was at least accepted by most of them .
By the time I graduated the only people who still picked on me were part of a small group of very stuck - up snobs .
My entire social education was thanks to videogames .
I love to tell my story every time I hear someone say that videogames are anti-social , that they encourage kids to isolate themselves alone in front of a screen .
I 'm living proof that games are just the opposite .
Since most kids are gamers , gaming gives them a massive common ground , something that they all can relate to , no matter which social circle they 're in .

Within this is the future site of retro , ASCII art .
It ’s often used as a catch - all term for “ text - based art , ” regardless of the actual character set being used .
In this post , we ’ll stroll through the past and present of ASCII art , assessing the influence of key pioneers , so that you might feel inspired to go forth and create .
I hope you come across both familiar guideposts and unknown territory , and come away enlightened !

Nude women never fail : Ken Knowlton ’s mosaics
There ’s an old joke that if you want to advance technology , introduce pornography .
From smutty BBS GIFs to the erotic HD streams being broadcast in glorious 1080 p , the softer side of this issue is that age - old question , “ Is it porn or is it art ? ” I do n’t think computer graphics pioneer Ken Knowlton intended to titillate when his colleague , Leon Harmon , called upon centuries of Renaissance masters and coaxed Knowlton into converting a photo of a nude model into this famous forerunner of ASCII art :
Photo from Ken Knowlton
While composed of “ small electronic symbols for transistors , resistors and such ” and not from the ASCII set ( one reason why the term is a misnomer ) , it ’s a clear link to the ASCII pr0n that would eventually circulate in colleges .
Nothing grabs attention like the female form , and as Knowlton himself expressed :
We did make similar pictures — of a gargoyle , of seagulls , of people sitting at computers — which have appeared here and there .
But it was our Nude who would dolphin again and again into public view in dozens of books and magazines .
No matter how sophisticated we get , we simply ca n’t escape our primal urges .
As indicated , Knowlton was n’t a one - trick pony ; he went on to accomplish many variations on this mosaic theme , from cars to crossword puzzles , including Braille art made into Helen Keller ’s visage ( if only she had been able to see it ! ) , turning painted keyboards into Bert Herzog ’s steely gaze and , in more recent years , turning the typography of playing cards into magician Lennart Green .
All this , like much great art , stemmed from a successful experiment that would set the tone for years to come .
On a somewhat less risqué note …
Knock , knock .
Who ’s there ?
Chuck Close ’s mosaic of Philip Glass
As we ’re seeing , the recurring theme of turning many individual elements ( with details finer than mere pointillism ) into grand canvases carries a heavy weight in early ASCII art history .
No jaunt into this craft ’s past would be complete without revisiting this iconic square - by - square composition of minimalist master Philip Glass :
Photo by A.M. Kuchling
Look closely and you ’ll notice it ’s composed of “ proto - pixels , ” pseudo - squares of varying grayscale values that , when put together and you step back , form a recognizable face .
This is also the same base technique used in many ANSI creations ( keep reading ! ) .
Like Glass ’ music , tiny units ( or cells ) are elongated into elaborate patterns .
In this respect , the portrait serves as a fitting parallel to the sound of the man it represents .
Close went on to further trendify this image by redoing it in several iterations , such as a watercolor , and later a t - shirt for The Gap .
CHI5 Shenzhou would bring an unofficial glowing version into virtual world Second Life , where its bond with quasi- modern ANSI art is solidified :
For you naughty aestheticologists who just ca n’t get your mind off of naked women , Close also worked on Kate Moss .
But he did n’t pixelate her .
“ A Computer Era Masterpiece ” : Digital Mona Lisa
One more mosaic , I promise , then we ’ll speed up several decades .
This one is so significant , it must be mentioned on principle !
New art sometimes finds its direction by emulating the old , then putting a twist on it .
So let me ask you : what ’s the most famous piece of art in the world ?
Many would call out da Vinci ’s Mona Lisa .
In 1964 , H. Philip Peterson “ utilized a CDC 3200 computer and a ‘ flying - spot ’ scanner to create a digital transposition / representation ” :
Photo from Digital Mona Lisa
How long did it take ?
A far cry from today ’s real - time rendering , this particular reinterpretation took 14 hours and , as you can see if you look closely , is made of numbers .
While this arguably did n’t take much imagination , the endurance required would pave the way for more creative developments by showing what this system was capable of .
( You may recall a somewhat similar story involving scanners and Lenna . )
Information on H. Philip Peterson is scant ; unlike Chuck Close and Ken Knowlton , he does n’t appear to have gone on to a prolific art career .
On a relevant tangent , Mona Lisa is also among the most parodied works of art .
Sure , by now you ’ve seen flat characters being formed into cohesive pictures , but what about an assembly of 3D objects ?
Suitably , if computer parts are the order of the day , this Mona “ Motherboards ” Lisa from ASUS ’

Beam me up : Star Trek ASCII art
Obsessions are a funny thing .
And when they ’re a healthy thing , I call them gladdictions ( glad + addictions ) .
ASCII art is pretty geeky , and so is Star Trek .
When you put the two together , you get computer nerdom of astronomical proportions , and as a result , much progress is made .
Just as some of the aforementioned pre-ASCII art debuted in the 1960s , so did the classic Trek series .
There are many repositories of Star Trek ASCII art that take the familiar characters on your keyboard and shape them into familiar faces , like William Shatner ’s , and various starship classes .
Among my favorites is Joshua Bell ’s Star Trek ASCII Art Archive ( disclosure : Josh is a colleague of mine at Linden Lab ) , which is a meticulously classified collection and even hilariously warns the uninitiated :
Please stop sending me email complaining that the images are made out of little dashes .
It ’s an art form , albeit a strange one .
Also worth looking at , if you like a refreshingly clean , long - scrolling page , is the self - proclaimed Largest Compendium of Star Trek ASCII Art.
Picard ’s head at the end is somewhat misshapen and resembles a Tenctonese more than a human , but I ca n’t really complain .
The point of all this ?
Advancing art skills by practicing it on the zealot magnet that is Star Trek will lead to these images being uploaded and propagated via BBSes – including as downloadable files and email signatures – and thus promote awareness of ASCII art .
As a consequence , newer generations are exposed to the art , and the art flourishes beyond the artscene .
In time , select pieces will even become cultural phenomena .
And as text graduates to pictures , pictures graduate to …
ASCII art on the move : Full - motion videos
Simon Janson ’s Star Wars ASCIIMATION has proudly made the rounds .
It is , essentially , Star Wars as a text - art movie .
And thanks to Jeremy , aka bullfrog117 on YouTube , there ’s even an earlier version with sound :
Meticulously assembled frame by frame with dialog subtitles , it ’s far from complete but is a laudable effort that has spanned over a decade .
Simon started it in July 1997 and , as of this writing , last updated it in April 2008 .
It even has a nice little surprise at the end , if you ’re into Rick Astley .
Or is it …
Rick ASCII ?
This “ ASCIIroll ” points to the increasing automation of ASCII effects , which usually involve down - sampling still or motion pictures into a set of values that correspond to various characters .
Logically , sparser - looking characters like “ . ” would be lighter values , whereas busy , noisy ones like “ @ ” and “ & ” would be darker values .
Some purists decry this as cheating ; others see it as the best way to create effects that ca n’t otherwise be produced .
Other movies , like Pixar ’s The Incredibles , have been ASCIImated via automatic means .
( Although leaving the letterbox in does n’t make much sense . )
Tools like VLC ’s own “ Color ASCII art video ” output module ( found in Preferences > Video ) make it possible to ASCIIize any movie clip with minimal effort .
While it may not be art , it is a fun party trick and good for at least a few laughs .
These laughs just skim the surface of the most exciting possibilities .
So let ’s dive deep , really deep now .
ASCII demoscene : Not just for show
In a demoscene , the demo is essentially a showreel , a multimedia portfolio of a tight team ’s skills presented with pop !
I have high admiration for the demoscene ’s ethos of resourcefulness : where else can you find so much creativity packed in such a compact space ?
This is even truer when you look further to demos that carry a stompin ’ soundtrack while being efficiently economized in text mode .
Trauma ’s “ The Turing Machines Did n’t Care ” ( more info ) is a beautiful recent example , mixing stylized type with delicious flavors of transition effects , fluidly evolving geometric patterns through an ever - shifting gauntlet of color .
Accompanied by Crystal Method - worthy beats and snarling synth lines , it ’s hard not to rock out to the ragged forms before you .
Another perennial fave is the briefly titled “ BB , ” which , should be noted , can run entirely in DOS .
At first , it ’s hard to imagine such dynamism emerging from such a staid OS – the electronic soundtrack does help – but keep an open mind and enjoy :
Entirely in monochrome , the amount of variance is staggering .
From a Space Invaders - like blip to zooming fractals to flame simulation to text entry that conjures cyberpunk terminal hacking , it ’s a breathtaking show .
While watching it in its original non-YouTubed format gives the most authentic experience , it can also be a deterrent to the casual visitor , so I ’m thankful that DiimitR shared this with us .
For more awesomeness , see :
Emoticon evolution : The Japanese new wave
Emoticons have come a long way , from simple “ : ) ” smilies to fully featured expressions riding atop articulated characters made out of , well , characters .
It ’s unfortunate there are n’t more TV shows like Train Man , which highlight the life of a geek in a non-disgraceful manner .
In addition to the exposure it gave otaku , Train Man has some pretty wild scenes involving these evolved emoticons .
Project Densha has translated scenes that are helpful , and there ’s no substitute for watching one of the scenes for yourself :
Nothing like Electric Light Orchestra ’s “ Twilight ” accompanying a young chap gazing at ASCII art while he has an emotional outburst , eh ?
The story that inspired Train Man was , like so many other modern yarns , originally unspooled on Japanese uber - BBS 2 channel .
Photo by hawkexpress
2 channel has emoticons like you would n’t believe , in part because their extended character set – actually Shift JIS – contains characters that are apparently well suited to be shaped into cute little cats and radical soy sauce mascot Kikkoman .
As Lisa Katayama described in a lucid pictorial on Wired :
The Soy Sauce Warrior started as a simple ASCII image on a 2 channel thread .
But as more and more posters chipped in , he quickly developed into a fully fleshed - out character with an elaborate backstory .
Kikkoman hails from Soybean planet .
His friends Sugarman and Saltman help him battle the Sauce Brothers and Ketchup Man , and they employ powerful fighting moves like the Kikko - punch and the Kikko - beam .
The past is present : ANSI scrolls on
While ASCII art is a catch - all term , as I mentioned earlier , ANSI art is a special case , not just because it has extended characters , but precisely because its escape sequences allow for dithered blocks of varying shades .
These can approximate graphics much easier , and it ’s a close kin of pixel art .
Photo by Joe Smooth
ANSI art found a foothold in many BBSes , because it was easy both to add colorful vibrance and to transmit across dial - up modems in an age before widespread broadband .
As a type of digital graffiti , ANSI art often has an organic , grungy appearance , with type simulating fantasy flourishes .
Accompanying imagery often includes fierce dragons , surreal landscapes and – you guessed it !
– naked women .
ANSI art is impressive not just because it continues to go strong , but specifically because improved display technology , like flat - panel LCD and plasma screens , allow us to enjoy it in ways that were n’t originally envisioned .
As nostalgic as an amber CRT hooked up to a genuine IBM PC is , it does n’t hold a candle to today ’s massive monitors .
Here ’s a great example from Geek Entertainment Television , where ANSI art is decked out on widescreens like the cinematic posters they ’ve always dreamed of being :
ASCII art is n’t for everyone and never will be .
By virtue of its humble beginnings and subsequent growth , it demands an understanding of the dedicated culture in which it was born and recognition that while it originated with primitive technology , novel innovations are helping to expand it into unforeseen regions .
By viewing these electronic masterworks , I hope you ’ll be inspired to create new pieces to populate your own canon .
Do you have fave ASCII art ?

Real Price Of Gold Soars
Gold in " Real " terms is soaring .
" Real " in this case means how much an ounce of gold will buy .
Let 's compare gold to a commodities , to silver and to the stock market , starting with a basket of commodities as measured by $ CRB commodities index .
Charts are as of 2008 - 10 - 06 .
$ CRB Monthly
The world economy is rapidly slowing .
There is a recession in the US , UK , Australia , Japan , Spain , Ireland , New Zealand , France , and there is manufacturing contraction in China .
With that backdrop , one should expect the price of commodities to drop .
And drop they have as shown by the above chart .
For the time being , forget about China .
There is simply no way growth in China can make up for falling demand virtually everywhere else in the world .
U.S. and the Western World is the dog , China remains the tail .
That may change in the future , but it is important to concentrate on the present .
I expect the global slowdown to be far bigger than most expect , potentially wiping out all commodity price gains back to the beginning of 2004 if not further .
A drop in the $ CRB to the 200 day moving average would do just that .
Now let 's see how gold is holding up vs. commodities .
Gold vs. $ CRB Monthly
Gold buys a bigger basket of commodities now than any other point on the chart .
Silver Monthly Chart
Fundamentally , silver is more of an industrial commodity than it is a currency .
It is not holding up as well as gold in recent selloffs .
There is a very real possibility that silver falls back to the 2004 high around $ 8 .
Those who pay attention to moving averages will note that $ 8 happens to be the 200 day moving average as well .
In contrast , gold has almost no industrial use worth mentioning .
The demand for gold is the same as it has been throughout history , as money .
With that in mind , let 's compare gold to silver .
Gold vs. Silver Monthly
One of the ongoing debates was how well silver would hold up in deflation relative to gold .
I think we now have our answer , and it does not look pretty .
S&P 500 Index Monthly
In the wake of the dot - com bubble , banks were in bad shape because they made poor lending decisions to busted companies and also to countries like Argentina .
To reflate banks , Greenspan slashed rates to 1 % fueling a global liquidity boom that lasted 5 years .
The housing boom ended in 2005 , but the party in commercial real estate , commodities , and various carry trades continued on for two full years when the pool of greater fools finally ran out .
Since August of 2007 the world has been in a massive deleveraging mode .
The S&P 500 made a marginal new top in 2007 , but the reality is the secular bear market that started in 2000 is still ongoing .
In real terms , ( either compared to gold or the CPI ) the S&P 500 came nowhere close to making a new high .
Gold vs. S&P 500 Index
Congress passed a $ 700 billion bailout package but it was a total and complete waste of $ 700 billion .
Actually , it is worse than that as it further depletes the pool of real funding , slowing a possible recovery some point in the future .
Yes , the Fed has started a monetary printing campaign .
And yes , the SEC will suspend mark to market accounting allowing banks to pretend their book are in order .
But pretending is not reality .
I can pretend all I want that Madame Merriweather 's Mud Hut is worth $ 1 billion and I can pretend my pet rock is worth the same .
The reality ( sorry Madame ) , is that neither is worth the book value I place on them .
Suspension of the mark to market rules will accomplish nothing but further mistrust of banks and bank stocks .
Everyone will know they are lying .
No one will know by how much .
What we do know is that Citigroup alone holds $ 1 trillion in off balance sheet SIVs .
Pretending those SIVs are worth $ 1 trillion will not make it so .
Yes , $ 700 billion is a lot of money .
But let 's see just how fast it comes and let 's see if all of it comes .
But unless it can offset the countless $ trillions in total bank assets that are not marked to market , we are realistically still going to see credit contraction ( on a marked to market basis , and that is what counts ) .
Attempts To Spur Lending Are Failing
Bernanke and Paulson think that the Fed buying toxic garbage will spur institutions to start lending .
It wo n't .
Banks will know they are holding garbage , and the market can smell that garbage even if the rules allow banks to pretend that garbage is a rose .
For more on the Fed 's efforts to spur lending please see Pushing on a String In Academic Wonderland and Thoughts On The Commercial Paper Funding Facility .
Greenspan did not defeat deflation in 2003 as is widely believed .
Instead , he fueled the biggest credit boom in history , sowing seeds of the biggest deflationary bust since the great depression .
Deflation Back In The News
It took a while but the " D - Word " is back in the news after a long hiatus .
Bloomberg is reporting Deflation Threat Returns as Asset Markets Decline
As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and his global colleagues fight the worst financial crisis since the 1930s , one danger is looming larger by the day : deflation .
The deflation scenario might go like this :
Banks worldwide , stung by $ 588 billion in writedowns related to toxic assets -- especially mortgage - related securities -- will further reduce the flow of credit , strangling growth .
That will push house prices lower , forcing additional losses and making banks even more reluctant to lend .
As the credit crisis worsens , businesses will find it almost impossible to raise prices .
Prices are already falling in parts of the world economy .
Home values dropped more than 10 percent in the U.K. and in the U.S. in the past year .
Oil , copper and corn drove commodities toward their biggest weekly decline since at least 1956 on Oct. 3 , with the Reuters / Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials tumbling 10.4 percent .
The Baltic Dry Index , a measure of commodity shipping costs , has dropped 75 percent since May .
Prices manufacturers paid for materials last month plunged the most since at least 1948 , with the Institute for Supply Management 's index dropping 23.5 points to 53.5 points .
Deflation may be back in the news , but the context is still incorrect .
Falling prices are only a symptom of deflation , and not even a mandatory one .
Deflation properly defined is a net reduction in money supply and credit , so let 's take a look at at base money supply , courtesy of the St. Louis Fed .
Adjusted Monetary Base
The above charts shows the Fed went on a recent printing spree .
However , that printing spree is dwarfed by the decline in the value of credit marked to market on the books of banks and brokerages .
Unfortunately I cannot prove a decline in marked to market credit because the SEC has suspended mark to market rules .
However , one can judge by actions , and the Fed in particular , and global central banks in general are in easily verifiable panic mode over the ongoing credit crunch .
Nearly Everything Consistent With Deflation
Commodities are sinking , the dollar is strengthening , the stock market is getting crucified , treasuries are rallying , jobs have contracted for 9 straight months with no end in sight , banks do not trust each other , consumer spending is declining , foreclosures are soaring , the TED Spread ( 3 month Treasury vs. 3 month LIBOR ) is at an all time high , and the Fed Funds Rate fell at the fastest rate in history .
That list does not prove deflation , but it is consistent with what one would expect in deflation .
Given that gold is money , and money should do well in deflation , one would expect the purchasing power of gold to rise .
The above charts show exactly that .
Gold , especially in real terms is soaring .
So why have the miners gotten pounded ?
Hindsight may be 20 - 20 ( or not ) but here are a few possible explanations .
Mining stocks are leveraged compared to gold and a massive unwinding of that leverage is taking place , especially by hedge funds .
There are now ongoing funding questions for some of the miners and explorers .
There has been indiscriminate selling of virtually everything .
For more on how treasuries and gold should act in deflation , please see Treasuries and Gold Rise as Global Credit Freeze Prompts More Bailouts .
Those believing in stagflation , hyperinflation , or some sort of 70's rerun can now kiss those theories goodbye .
Deflation is here and now , the only question now is how long it lasts .

KARACHI , Dec 11 : The targeting of Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jamaatud Dawa and the rounding up of the activists belonging to the two jihadi organisations appear to have been triggered by information originating in India following the capture of one of the 10 men who attacked several targets in Mumbai towards the end of last month .
During the course of Dawn ’s own investigations last week our reporters were able to locate a family who claimed to be the kin of the arrested young man in Mumbai .
The sole survivor among the 10 attackers was named as Ajmal Kasab and was supposed to belong to the village Faridkot in the Punjab .
Media organisations such as the BBC and now the British newspaper Observer have done reports trying to ascertain the veracity of claims appearing in the media that the young man had a home there .
On Friday last , the BBC reported unusual activity in Faridkot near Deepalpur .
A BBC correspondent located a house in the village , the then inhabitants of which carried the surname of Kasab ( or Qasab as the word is often spelt here ) .
But the residents denied any link with either Ajmal or with any Amir Kasab , the name of Ajmal ’s father as reported by some of the media .
At the weekend , the Observer in England claimed that it had managed to locate the house everyone was looking for so desperately .
Its correspondent said he had got hold of the voters ’ roll which had the names of Amir Kasab and his wife , identified as Noor , as well as the numbers on the identity cards the couple carried .
Even though the news stories by both BBC and the Observer made a mention of the LeT , some television channels in Pakistan suggested that a connection between Mumbai and Faridkot could not be established beyond a shadow of doubt .
However , the man who said he was Amir Kasab confirmed to Dawn that the young man whose face had been beamed over the media was his son .
For the next few minutes , the fifty - something man of medium build agonized over the reality that took time sinking in , amid sobs complaining about the raw deal the fate had given him and his family .
“ I was in denial for the first couple of days , saying to myself it could not have been my son , ” he told Dawn in the courtyard of his house in Faridkot , a village of about 2,500 people just a few kilometres from Deepalpur on the way to Kasur .
“ Now I have accepted it .
“ This is the truth .
I have seen the picture in the newspaper .
This is my son Ajmal . ”
Variously addressed as Azam , Iman , Kamal and Kasav , the young man , apparently in his 20s , is being kept in custody at an undisclosed place in Mumbai .
Indian media reports ‘ based on intelligence sources ’ said the man was said to be a former Faridkot resident who left home a frustrated teenager about four years ago and went to Lahore .
After his brush with crime and criminals in Lahore , he is said to have run into and joined a religious group during a visit to Rawalpindi .
Along with others , claimed the Indian media , he was trained in fighting .
And after a crash course in navigation , said Amir Kasab , a father of three sons and two daughters , Ajmal disappeared from home four years ago .
“ He had asked me for new clothes on Eid that I could n’t provide him .
He got angry and left . ”
While Amir was talking , Ajmal ’s two “ sisters and a younger brother ” were lurking about .
To Amir ’s right , on a nearby charpoy , sat their mother , wrapped in a chador and in a world of her own .
Her trance was broken as the small picture of Ajmal lying in a Mumbai hospital was shown around .
They appeared to have identified their son .
The mother shrunk back in her chador but the father said he had no problem in talking about the subject .
Amir Kasab said he had settled in Faridkot after arriving from the nearby Haveli Lakha many years ago .
He owned the house and made his earnings by selling pakoras in the streets of the village .
He modestly pointed to a hand - cart in one corner of the courtyard .
“ This is all I have .
I shifted back to the village after doing the same job in Lahore .
“ My eldest son , Afzal , is also back after a stint in Lahore .
He is out working in the fields . ”
Faridkot is far from the urbanites ’ idea of a remote village .
It is located right off a busy road and bears all the characteristics of a lower - middle class locality in a big city .
It has two middle - level schools , one for girls and the other for boys which Ajmal attended as a young boy .
For higher standards , the students have to enroll in schools in Deepalpur which is not as far off as the word remote tends to indicate .
It by no means qualifies as Punjab ’s backwaters , which makes the young Ajmal ’s graduation to an international “ fearmonger ” even more difficult to understand .
The area can do with cleaner streets and a better sewage system but the brick houses towards the side of the Kasur - Deepalpur road have a more organised look to them than is the case with most Pakistani villages .
The Observer newspaper reports that some locals seeking anonymity say the area is a hunting ground for the recruiters of LeT and provides the organisation with rich pickings .
The approach to Faridkot also points to at least some opportunities for those looking for a job .
There are some factories in the surroundings , rice mills et al , interspersed with fertile land .
But for the gravity of the situation , with its mellowed and welcoming ambience , the picture could be serene .
It is not and Amir Kasab repeats how little role he has had in the scheme since the day his son walked out on him .
He calls the people who snatched Ajmal from him his enemies but has no clue who these enemies are .
Asked why he did n’t look for his son all this while , he counters : “ What could I do with the few resources that I had ? ”
Otherwise quite forthcoming in his answers , Amir Kasab , a mild - mannered soul , is a bit agitated at the mention of the link between his son ’s actions and money .
Indian media has claimed that Ajmal ’s handlers had promised him that his family will be compensated with Rs150,000 ( one and a half lakh ) after the completion of the Mumbai mission .
“ I do n’t sell my sons , ” he retorts .
Journalists visiting Faridkot since Dawn reporters were at the village say the family has moved from their home and some relatives now live in the house .
Perhaps fearing a media invasion , nobody is willing to say where the family has gone .
On December 25 , 2003 at 11 PM , Indie 103.1 was first transmitted on the KDLD radio station .
The initial two tunes to play were The Ramones ’ “ We Want The Airwaves ” and The Clash ’s “ This Is Radio Clash ” trailed by a rundown of new tunes that had never observed business airplay , setting the tone for what might turn into a musically bold and defiant radio station .
The main workers were program chief Michael Steele , music executive Mark Sovel and TK .
For multi month the station kept running without any plugs or DJs and highlighted just the voices of audience members from telephones messages left on the demand line voice message .
A significant number of the telephone messages were furious audience members hollering “ You all suck ! ” and “ The end result for KDL the gathering station ! ”
The work of art for the Indie 103.1 logo was made by Obey Giant road craftsman Shepard Fairey , who might accomplish popularity as the planner of the Obama “ Advance ” and “ Expectation ” notices .
The station started as a cooperation amongst Entravision and Clear Channel .
Clear Channel principally took care of promoting on the station , but since the association officially claimed the most extreme number of stations in the Los Angeles advertise permitted by Federal Communications Commission directions , the game plan was ended in March 2005 .[ citation needed ]

When the first cell in one of Brenda Rosenthal 's ovaries mutated and turned cancerous , she felt no symptoms .
The telltale pains or lumps that signal cancer were still months , if not years , away .
But there were signs , sparks thrown off by the tumor that had begun to smolder in her belly .
As more cells were conscripted from the original task coded in their DNA and assigned a new , malignant mission , they produced proteins that leaked into Rosenthal 's bloodstream .
Had an effort been made to see these molecules , had there been a strategy for detecting them , the 69 - year - old would n't face such long odds today .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Certainly , there were statistical red flags , if only Rosenthal had known to look for them .
Twenty years before , she had survived a bout of breast cancer , increasing her risk for ovarian cancer in the future .
That risk was exacerbated by a mutation in her BRCA2 gene that 's been associated with much higher rates of breast and ovarian cancers .
Going purely by the numbers , Rosenthal , a New York City native now living in Delray Beach , Florida , was a prime candidate for ovarian cancer .
But even after the link between the BRCA2 gene and breast and ovarian cancer was discovered in 1995 , Rosenthal did n't think to get tested .
" It did n't even register , " she says .
" I went on with my life , and I did n't think about cancer . "
It was n't until 2005 , when she first noticed a physical symptom — " this huge lump in my stomach area " — that Rosenthal learned she was once again a cancer patient .
Ovarian cancer , like most cancers , is measured in four stages .
Stage I is early , when the disease is contained in the ovaries .
In stage II , it may be present in the fallopian tubes or elsewhere in the pelvis .
By stage III , it has migrated into the abdomen or lymph nodes .
And by stage IV , the malignancy has spread , or metastasized , into major organs like the liver or uterus .
( The first three stages are further subdivided into A , B , and C levels . )
For ovarian tumors discovered in stage I or II , the survival rate 10 years after diagnosis is reassuringly high — almost 90 percent — because treatment is straightforward : surgery , perhaps followed by low doses of radiation .
But survival rates drop precipitously as the diagnosis shifts to stage III or IV , when the cancer is well established and spreading .
Here , the survival rate falls to 20 percent and then to 10 percent .
Unfortunately , more than two - thirds of ovarian cancers are n't found until these later stages .
That was true in Rosenthal 's case :
By the time she noticed her lump , the disease had spread and progressed to stage IIIC .
Four years later , after two rounds of chemotherapy , Rosenthal 's cancer is in remission .
But she remains vigilant .
Every three months , her blood is tested for levels of CA125 , a protein marker used to monitor ovarian cancer .
She tracks clinical drug trials in the hope that she will qualify as a subject .
Yet she 'll always blame herself , if only a little bit , for missing a way to find the disease earlier .
" I could live 10 or 15 years more , but I still wo n't have the quality of life I would 've if we 'd found the cancer early , " she says .
" I do n't want anyone else to be in my position . "
The survival rate for many cancers is similar to the cliff - like curve that defines ovarian malignancies .
Find the disease early , thanks to a stray blob on an x-ray or an early symptom , and the odds of survival approach 90 percent .
Treatment — surgery — is typically low risk .
But find it late , after the tumor has metastasized , and treatment requires infusions of toxic chemicals and blasts of brutal radiation .
And here the prognosis is as miserable as the experience .
This reality would seem to make a plain case for shifting research and resources toward patients with a 90 percent , rather than a 10 or 20 percent , chance of survival .
But these are largely hypothetical patients .
Cancer may be present , but since it has n't been detected , as a practical matter these cases do n't yet exist .
People with full - blown cancer , however , are very real .
They are our fathers and mothers , our children and friends .
They 're right in front of us .
These are the 566,000 Americans who will die of cancer this year .
The US spends billions of dollars to save these late - stage patients , trying to devise better drugs and chemotherapies that might kill a cancer at its strongest .
This cure - driven approach has dominated the research since Richard Nixon declared war on the disease in 1971 .
But it has yielded meager results :
The overall cancer mortality rate in the US has fallen by a scant 8 percent since 1975 .
( Heart disease deaths , by comparison , have dropped by nearly 60 percent in that period . )
We are so consumed by the quest to save the 566,000 that we overlook the far more staggering statistic at the other side of the survival curve :
More than a third of all Americans — some 120 million people — will be diagnosed with cancer sometime in their lives .
Their illness may be invisible now , but it 's out there .
And that presents a great , and largely unexamined , opportunity : Find and treat their cancers early and that 566,000 figure will shrink .
The National Cancer Institute spends just 8 percent of its research funds on early detection .
Photo Illustration : Mauricio Alejo and Burkhard Schittny Cancer , in other words , has a perception problem .
We lack the ability to see what 's going on inside the body , to gaze through our too - solid flesh and glean information on a molecular level .
Conventional medical technologies — blood tests , x-rays , MRIs — can serve as proxies for proximity , but the picture they offer is often incomplete and obscured .
Without a way to positively identify illness early , to detect that first spark , medicine will continue to be a last resort .
But new technologies for the early detection of cancer are now at hand .
Researchers are refining sophisticated protein tests that can pick up molecular whispers in the bloodstream and are testing next - generation imaging techniques that can identify and isolate a tumor within the body .
These technologies build on screening methods already proven to reveal cancer — the Pap smear ( cervical ) , the antibody blood test ( prostate ) , the mammogram ( breast ) — but go further and deeper so that even stubbornly covert cancers might become visible .
This new approach treats diagnosis as an algorithm , a sequence of calculations that can detect or predict cancer years before it betrays symptoms .
It starts with a statistical screening to identify people , like Rosenthal , who have a genetically greater risk for disease .
A regular blood test follows , one primed to look for telltale proteins , or biomarkers , correlated to specific cancers .
A positive result prompts an imaging test to eliminate false positives or isolate a tumor .
The process is methodical , mathematical , and much more likely to find cancer than current diagnostic procedures .
This is the potential of early detection :
To use data instead of drugs , to reveal a cancer before it reveals itself , and to leave the miracles for the patients who really need them .
Don Listwin learned about the 90/10 survival curve after his mother , Grace , was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2000 .
Doctors had diagnosed her — twice — with a bladder infection and prescribed antibiotics .
Not surprisingly , that treatment did n't work .
By the time her doctor established that she had ovarian cancer , she was stage IV and 12 months from her death .
Listwin , a onetime heir apparent to CEO John Chambers at Cisco Systems , says his impulse was to sue the doctor , the hospital , and anyone else who looked culpable .
" I thought their incompetence had killed my mother , " he says now .
" But then I started staring at this 90 percent and this 10 percent , and I realized that if she had just been over here at 90 , she 'd be alive today . "
An electrical engineer by training , Listwin started to ask questions .
Why does survival drop off so steeply ?
What happens in later stage cancers that make them so lethal ?
And most obviously , why can't we find the killer cancers early ?
" This looked like an emergent systems engineering problem , a systems biology problem , " he says .
" And it looked like an opportunity to engineer solutions . "
Listwin , who says he was at Cisco during " the right 10 years , " left the company in 2000 at age 41 with $ 100 million in the bank .
Typically , people like Listwin — wealthy , philanthropic , and touched by cancer 's ruthlessness — get on the cure bandwagon .
But after looking at the numbers , Listwin was drawn to the problem of early detection .
In 2004 , he created the Canary Foundation , a research group with the single goal of bringing a battery of screening tests to patients and their doctors by 2015 , starting with ovarian cancer and moving on to pancreatic , lung , and prostate .
Listwin likes to explain the Canary approach with PowerPoint , and every presentation starts with a slide of the survival curve for cancer .
Pointing to the 90 percent , he makes this simple observation :
When we see cancer early , we have a chance to fight it .
In fact , much of the meager increase in cancer survival rates over the past 30 years can be attributed not to new chemotherapies or treatments but to early detection .
Deaths from skin cancer , which is the most obvious to diagnose and treat , have fallen 10 percent .
Since the Pap smear — a simple swab of the cervix for precancerous and cancerous cells — became part of routine care in the US in the 1950s , cancer incidence and mortality rates due to cervical cancer have fallen by 67 percent .
Five - year survival rates for breast cancer have likewise improved as mammography and MRI screening have increased .
There are tests for these diseases not because they are biologically different from other cancers but because they occur in accessible parts of the body .
It 's neither difficult nor prohibitively expensive nor dangerous to swab a cervix or perform a mammogram .
Other areas of the body , though — the lungs , the pancreas — are less accessible and harder to monitor .
Consequently , their malignancies are far more deadly .
Despite this proven model , early detection is an afterthought in cancer research .
The pharmaceutical industry spends nearly $ 8 billion annually on cancer research , according to the International Union Against Cancer , most of it steered toward drug development and late - stage treatments .
The major cancer foundations spend lavishly on cure - based research : The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation spent $ 180 million on cures in 2007 ; the Michael Millken Prostate Cancer Foundation spends about $ 14 million annually pursuing a cure for prostate cancer ; the National Cancer Institute spent just 8 percent of its 2007 budget , less than $ 400 million , on detection and diagnosis research .
Compared to these sums , Canary 's $ 5 million annual budget scarcely registers .
Yet Canary stands out in the cancer research community because its focus is on early detection rather than treatment .
The Riddle of Early Detection More than 140 million Americans will get cancer at some point in their lives .
Find the disease early and survival rates are high .
Catch it late and it's much more likely to be fatal .
There are three main hurdles to clear before widespread early detection becomes possible .
Some cancers can be too easy to find .
About 80 percent of prostate cancers are detected early .
Yet most patients survive at least five years even if untreated .
The problem : deciding whether medical intervention is necessary .
Other cancers are inherently elusive .
Pancreatic cancer , for one , betrays almost no symptoms , making diagnosis a matter of pure luck .
Only 3 percent of cases are found in the first , most curable stage .
The money goes where the cancer is .
Some malignancies , notably lung cancer , are mostly detected only in late stages .
As a result , that 's where most research is directed .
Shifting those priorities wo n't be easy .
A creature of Silicon Valley , Listwin based his foundation in San Jose and has structured it like a tech startup .
Canary has recruited some of the nation 's foremost oncologists , molecular scientists , and biostatisticians — researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , New York 's Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center , and Stanford School of Medicine — and assigned them to one of four teams , each of which concentrates on a specific cancer .
The foundation uses its grants as seed capital .
Research is closely tracked so that years are n't lost in the lab .
Failure is allowed , so long as it happens fast .
And in contrast to many big - ticket medical technologies , there 's a priority on making costs for a test low enough that innovations can be widely deployed .
The objective is to draw in research money from the NCI and other cancer foundations as well as venture capital , jump - starting an industry .
Once that happens , Listwin 's exit strategy will be easy : " I 'll be on the beach in Belize , " he says .
In case the allusion is n't obvious , the Canary Foundation takes its name from the avian early detection system used by coal miners .
Listwin , whose year - round tan , golf - pro good looks , and cheerful swagger make him seem younger than his 49 years , adopts the plumage of the namesake bird at every opportunity , wearing a canary yellow blazer at most foundation functions .
( At outside meetings , he goes with a buttercup oxford shirt , tucking a matching pocket square in a blue coat . )
Given his manner , though , the yellow jacket brings to mind less a songbird than a hornet , buzzing around and ever - ready to engage .
Last May , at the foundation 's annual science meeting at Stanford , Listwin was in typically high spirits .
The Canary Symposium pulls together the 125 scientists who work on Canary research in the US and Canada .
For them , the symposium is an opportunity to share progress , swap strategies , and meet such luminaries as NCI director John Niederhuber and Nobel laureate Lee Hartwell , director of the Hutchinson Center and chair of Canary 's science team .
It 's also a chance to get a taste of Silicon Valley swank .
Listwin makes a point of serving the best food and drink during the three - day event ; a friend who is an avid wine collector generously uncorks several cases of remarkable wines , from 30 - year - old Bordeaux to $ 300 California zinfandels .
It makes for a blithe mood , and this year , Listwin had extra reason to be jazzed .
He 'd just announced an agreement with Stanford to build a new research center focused on early detection .
Scheduled to open this year , the Canary Center at Stanford will be a headquarters for Sam Gambhir , director of the university 's molecular - imaging program and the developer of a promising new ultrasound technology that 's central to Canary 's efforts .
Listwin is much more engaged than the average philanthropist .
Rather than dole out research money and send the scientists back to their labs , he 's involved in each step of the scientific process , from generating hypotheses to analyzing the data .
Ever the engineer , he has schooled himself in the minutiae of biomarkers and cancer genetics and readily interrupts a presentation to correct a scientific point .
( At a recent meeting of the NCI 's Early Detection Research Network , he was mistakenly introduced as " Dr. Don Listwin . " )
And drawing from his corporate days , Listwin applies classic group management theories to the effort .
" It 's basic team - building , " he says .
" Forming , storming , norming , and performing . "
Each member of the team is responsible for a different link in the chain leading to a workable screening test — or more accurately , toward two tests : a biomarker blood test to identify a cancer , followed by an imaging test to isolate it in the body .
Some group members are engaged in proteomics — running tissue samples through mass spectrometers to uncover the proteins that may be biomarkers for a particular type of cancer and then handing off promising proteins to other specialists who use statistical methods to confirm the correlation .
Others are developing new imaging tools that can pinpoint a tumor as small as 2 millimeters across .
Still others design cost - benefit models to determine whether a test has commercial potential .
And in contrast to the five - year duration of a standard NCI grant , Canary reviews its grants annually .
" Most scientists are n't used to doing things this way , " says Martin McIntosh , a bioinformatics guru at the Hutchinson Center and member of Canary 's ovarian team .
" If something 's not working , Don 's not afraid to pull the plug .
So that takes some getting used to .
But there 's definitely a sense that we 're getting somewhere , that we 're working on this problem in a new and smart way . "
Despite the flush atmosphere that Listwin cultivates , most Canary grants are in fact relatively modest .
At an average of between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 , they are side projects for most researchers , covering their costs but hardly funding a full research lab .
The festivities and the team - building , though , get the scientists committed to the greater mission of early detection .
Soon enough , team members start assigning their junior scientists to early - detection work , and they engage outside resources and colleagues on the problem .
In this way , Canary 's strategy is to " create leverage , " Listwin says , giving the foundation access to far more brain power and institutional muscle than its size might otherwise command .
The Canary approach comes at a time when the NCI is in the midst of what director Niederhuber calls " a big pivot " away from a single - minded war approach and toward a portfolio of strategies , including prevention and early detection .
But 40 years into the war on cancer , he says , changing the course of the NCI is akin to turning around the proverbial aircraft carrier .
That leaves the " well - informed higher - risk activities " to more agile groups like Canary .
" New screening approaches are increasingly important .
I think eventually you 'll go in for a pit stop on a regular basis , " Niederhuber says .
" And with a little bit of blood , we 'll know what 's normal and what 's abnormal . "
The typical human body contains something less than 2 gallons of blood .
The bloodstream is basically a transport system , a combination of plasma — the fluid itself — and a number of passengers , mostly red and white blood cells , which distribute oxygen and fight infection .
Blood also contains thousands of proteins that serve a range of biological purposes , from distributing energy and nutrition to repairing injury and inflammation .
The science of proteomics is trying to correlate each of these proteins with its specific metabolic function .
When the first Canary team came together in 2004 , proteomics promised to be a powerful tool for early detection .
All the teams needed to do was pump biomarkers through the testing process , identify a handful that link to early - stage cancers , corroborate the results with a CT scan or MRI , and then roll out the early - detection test .
" It looked like a pretty simple problem , " says Patrick Brown , a molecular biologist at Stanford and member of Canary 's ovarian cancer team .
" Get a molecule , make a test , and you 're done .
It was just a matter of going out and finding them . "
Brown does n't think that anymore .
" It 's gone from something that seems really simple and really boring scientifically , " he says , " to something that 's not at all simple and , therefore , really compelling scientifically . "
He functions at Canary as something of a bug tester , probing for logical flaws , false assumptions , and wishful thinking .
The complications that have turned up around blood protein biomarkers , he says , are riddles that must be solved before the way forward becomes clear .
And two riddles stand out .
The first goes something like this :
In the past decade , proteomics has been great at discovery — the eureka moment when a protein is identified and strongly associated with a cancer .
The field has identified thousands of proteins in cancerous human tissue , and hundreds of research papers have claimed strong correlations between a particular new marker and a certain type of cancer .
But there 's been a dearth of validation — the more laborious process of confirming the results and establishing that a protein actually does work as a biomarker for a particular cancer and is n't the result of some unrelated condition like inflammation or anxiety .
The problem starts with the very structure of the proteomic investigations .
Most of these are case / control studies , in which proteins extracted from known cancer patients ( the cases ) are compared with proteins extracted from healthy volunteers ( the controls ) .
In a perfect study , you want the cases and the controls to match up in every way — age , sex , diet , home town — except for the fact that half of the sample has cancer .
That way , any differences that turn up are statistically likely to be due to the cancer .
But in reality , good samples of cancer tissue are in short supply , so most research is done in a take - what - you - can - get mode .
The controls are assembled afterward and matched as well as possible .
The result is that the cases and controls often have little in common — they can come from people of different ages , different towns , or countless other variables .
" So it 's not surprising that you find all sorts of differences between the cases and controls , " says Lee Hartwell , on whose watch the Hutchinson Center has become a leader in proteomics research .
" But those differences could have nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that they have cancer . "
Take the case of prolactin .
In 2005 , a research group at Yale announced it had identified several biomarkers that together could work as a test for ovarian cancer .
( More markers mean better odds of a true positive , since different people have different proteins in their blood at different times . )
The Yale markers included CA125 ; osteopontin , a protein believed to be overexpressed in several cancers ; and prolactin , a pituitary hormone found in the breasts , ovaries , and other organs .
The test for early detection of ovarian cancer was released commercially by LabCorp last June under the name OvaSure .
The results troubled the Canary ovarian team , which had already taken stock of a few of these and other markers and ruled them as insufficient for a valid test .
The inclusion of prolactin , in particular , stood out .
" It looked wrong to me , " says Nicole Urban , head of gynecological cancer research at the Hutchinson Center .
" It seemed highly unlikely that it was related to the cancer . "
So Urban ran her own study , comparing prolactin levels in women with ovarian cancer to those who were cancer - free .
She also introduced further variables : when and under what circumstances the blood was drawn .
It turned out that during a routine blood test , prolactin was present in normal levels among cases and controls alike .
But the levels spiked dramatically when blood was drawn right before the patient went into surgery — whether it was surgery for ovarian cancer or another procedure .
In other words , Urban concluded , it seems that prolactin is n't a biomarker for cancer .
It 's a biomarker for a stressed - out patient about to go under the knife .
( Last fall , after the Food and Drug Administration warned that there were " serious regulatory problems " with the OvaSure test , LabCorp withdrew it from the market ) .
The ambiguity over prolactin exemplifies the leap required to get from an apparent signal to a true signal .
" A good biomarker will tell us something we do n't know , " says Martin McIntosh , who crunched the prolactin numbers with Urban .
" But even worse is when you think you have a good biomarker , and it 's telling us something we do n't actually want to know . "
And that 's the first riddle of biomarkers .
But assume that science eventually makes that leap and that a list of biomarkers with proven links to specific cancers is in hand .
The next step is to find these markers in the blood .
This is the second riddle :
It 's one thing to find a biomarker in the research lab , using tissue known to be cancerous .
But putting a test into clinical practice means finding a marker when it 's floating around in those gallons of human blood .
Doing that accurately and consistently is a far more daunting proposition .
Patrick Brown first noted this problem in a presentation at the 2007 Canary Symposium .
He started by laying out the yardsticks .
The basic premise of early detection assumes there 's a window of opportunity when a would - be lethal cancer is germinating but potentially curable .
For ovarian cancer , Brown put this window at about four years .
Assuming annual or biannual screening , an effective test then must be able to detect a cancer when it's too small to be lethal but large enough for a significant number of proteins to spill into the bloodstream .
This boils down to a question of signal versus noise :
Are current testing technologies , known as assays , accurate enough to catch those few extra molecules , or will they be mistaken for randomness ?
Brown offered some preliminary calculations .
He started by estimating the size of a pre-advanced - stage ovarian tumor during this window of opportunity .
On average , these tumors are just 2 millimeters in diameter , or 4 milligrams in mass .
" That 's less than one - ten - millionth of the mass of the average adult ! " Brown noted .
But with current assay technology , a tumor would have to be closer to 30 millimeters in diameter , he figured , to throw off enough biomarker molecules to exceed levels for normal women and to be reliably spotted amid all the other stuff in the blood .
And at that size , he acknowledged , most ovarian cancers have already metastasized , so early detection would n't likely save a life .
According to these calculations , the prospects for blood - based early detection looked bleak .
For more than a year , Brown 's presentation hung over the project .
It seemed to expose a paradox at the very core of early detection :
What use is a biomarker if it does n't show up on a test until it 's too late ?
The Canary approach may be collaborative , but it 's also competitive .
Sam Gambhir , Brown 's Stanford colleague , had been working on a mathematical model to address the problem .
Though Gambhir 's specialty is radiology and imaging , his PhD is in mathematics , and he thought some additional number - crunching might point the way .
His model re-created the human bloodstream and sent some CA125 , the known marker for ovarian cancer , into the mix .
Soon enough Gambhir had his answer : According to his calculations , a blood test for a biomarker like CA125 can reveal a growth as small as one - half of 1 millimeter , " maybe even one - tenth of 1 millimeter , " says Gambhir , who published his calculations in PLoS Medicine this past August .
" So it 's not out of the question to have a blood test that can detect a tumor that 's very small , small enough to work for early detection . "
In other words : A biomarker test is possible .
The cancer can be perceived .
Computerized tomography was developed in the 1960s in London at EMI , the electronics and recording giant .
Legend has it that the Beatles made the technology , better known as CT scanning , possible ; sales from their hit records allowed EMI to fund an engineer 's dabbling in medical imaging .
The machines are like an x-ray machine in orbit .
Where a traditional x-ray creates a two - dimensional image of the human body , a CT instrument rotates an x-ray on an axis around the body , producing a three - dimensional image or " slice " that 's much sharper and more detailed than a conventional x-ray .
Used at first for brain images , CT scans were a slow and tedious technology lagging behind x-rays , ultrasound , and MRIs for decades .
In the 1990s , though , faster computation allowed for faster image processing , and several companies engaged in what came to be known as the slice wars .
Image quality soon climbed along a geometric progression common to many technologies , from 16 slices per rotation to 32 to 64 to 128 .
The boom failed to reduce costs — the machines still run about $ 2 million apiece — but it made CT machines ubiquitous at American hospitals .
Today , about 62 million scans are performed in the US annually , about twice as many as a decade ago .
Even as warnings about overuse grow louder ( the machines send 50 or more times the radiation into the body than a conventional x- ray ) , there 's an increasing call for putting CT scans to greater use , particularly as a potential screening tool for hard - to - see and hard - to - diagnose diseases like lung cancer .
While lung cancer kills more people worldwide than any other form of the disease , it remains comparatively under - researched .
In part , this is because of the stigma it carries as a self - inflicted smokers ' disease .
But it is also neglected simply because its location , deep within the body , makes it exceptionally hard to detect and treat .
To this problem , CT scans offer a remedy .
Compared with the foggy blur of an x-ray , a CT scan of the lungs is sharp and detailed .
The lobes of each lung show up as a river system , the bronchioles that conduct air from the trachea fanning out into the alveoli , one tributary branching into a hundred more .
Any unusual blip , be it from infection or cancer , shows up on this map as a well - defined land mass with a precise longitude and latitude .
In the mid-1990s , the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program began a 12 - year study to examine the potential of CT scans as a screening tool for the disease .
The study brought 30,000 smokers into hospitals and scanned their lungs , following up with another scan a year or so later .
The scans turned up 484 cases of potential cancer , and subsequent biopsies confirmed that 85 percent of those patients did indeed have stage I lung cancer .
It was a stunning result , far higher than many screening tests would have predicted .
Even more remarkable was the survival rate :
Of the 375 patients who opted for surgery , 92 percent were still alive 10 years later .
The triumphant findings , published in 2006 in The New England Journal of Medicine , seemed to make a clear case for the widespread use of CT scans as a screening test for the early detection of lung cancer .
But there 's one question the study did n't ask .
" What if they 're finding things that look like cancer — even things that may be cancer under the microscope — but that are n't the cancers that actually kill people ? " asks Peter Bach , a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York and a member of Canary 's lung cancer team .
Though Bach and his Canary colleagues are eager to find a viable imaging test for lung cancer , they are wary about jumping onto the CT bandwagon .
Their concern is that , by itself , a CT scan makes it too easy to rush to judgment .
With no knowledge of a tumor 's molecular characteristics — the sort of information a biomarker test might provide — a CT scan offers an alluring but potentially deceptive image .
Bach decided to follow up the Early Lung Cancer Action Project study with his own assessment of CT screening for lung cancer , analyzing three large studies of CT scans among smokers in the US and Italy .
As with the Action Project , these studies found that , yes , CT scans detected a huge number of early cancers — 10 times as many as they would expect to find without scanning .
In that regard , the scans did their job as a screening test .
And as expected , the number of surgeries based on those diagnoses jumped .
But when Bach looked at the resulting mortality rates , he found essentially no difference between those who received a CT scan and those who had not .
Despite the additional surgeries , just as many people were dying as before .
And in this regard , CT scans seemed to be a failure as a screening test — they did n't appear to save any lives at all .
Bach 's counter - research has kicked up a storm in radiology circles , and various organizations now give conflicting recommendations .
The NCI has started a major study to assess the true usefulness of CT scans for lung cancer ; early results could appear this year .
So if these are n't all lethal cancers , what exactly are the CT scans finding ?
Bach believes it's what some radiologists call pseudodisease .
His theory is that lung cancer may come in at least two forms : fast - growing , lethal tumors that appear " like a meteor " and spread quickly , and slow - growing masses that are essentially benign .
This is n't the same thing as an imprecise test turning up false positives or false negatives — on a molecular level , these are real cancers .
They 're just not the kind of tumors that would eventually kill a patient .
Oncologists call this cancer heterogeneity , and it's one more riddle that seems to be at work across Canary 's research .
Heterogeneity is a factor in prostate cancer , which many men have but few will die from .
And it looks to be a factor in ovarian cancer , too .
Indeed , Urban believes the most deadly type of that disease may not start in the ovaries at all ; it may be another kind of malignancy that starts in the fallopian tubes .
By the time it appears in the ovaries , the disease has already progressed .
The issue of heterogeneity leads directly to a central quandary for early - detection researchers :
What is the baseline for growths and tumors in the human body ?
In other words , how do we distinguish between what 's normal — which would include cancers that are n't lethal or that our immune system can remedy — and abnormal , defined as cancers that are lethal and demand intervention ?
Remarkably , the question of what constitutes normal has been neglected by medicine .
But for early detection to work , groups like Canary will have to establish that baseline .
Otherwise , high - resolution imaging may cause more trouble than it 's worth .
A CT scan may offer a profound window into the body .
But it tends to find both kinds of cancer .
So as a tool for early detection , it 's still too blunt an instrument .
ROUND ROCK , Texas -- Computer giant Dell Inc. said this summer that it has become " carbon neutral , " the latest step in its quest to be " the greenest technology company on the planet . "
What that means , and what it does n't , may surprise Dell customers and other consumers who have been bombarded with bold environmental promises from major corporations .

The Game
The Game
What 's this game about ?
Game MechanicsRequestsTroubleshooting
You 're a citizen of Malton , a city that 's in the process of being evacuated and quarantined to contain a sinister contagion - you play as either a trapped civilian , a member of the evacuating military , a scientist operating in the background , or a victim of the early outbreaks .
Malton is a grid of 100x100 city blocks , each of which is either a nondescript street , or a particular type of building - you move around the map by clicking on the names of the blocks .
Buildings can be entered and barricaded by survivors , to shelter from the zombie hordes that roam the city .
Other citizens of Malton appear on the map as names in coloured boxes ( the colour matching their class ; green for Military , blue for Science , red for Civilian and grey for Zombie ) ; they also appear in the location 's description .
Some character classes start with equipment , and all characters can search to find further objects during the course of the game - some are weapons , some are one - use items , others have subtler or more permanent effects .
All characters start with at least one Skill , which grants them an extra ability or bonus in the game - by gaining experience points , players can buy further skills and develop their characters .
Players get fifty " actions " per day - these are be used to move , attack , search or otherwise interact with the city .
When your action points are gone , you have to wait for them to recharge .
( Players remain visible and vulnerable on the map when they 're out of Action Points or logged out ; survivor players should find secure shelter between logins . )
What should I be doing ?
It 's up to you how to play the game , but as a general guidline : as a survivor , you should search the city for helpful equipment , and for other people to team up with .
You 'll be quite vulnerable to begin with , so do n't risk drawing too much attention to yourself ( some higher - level zombies have the ability to follow a survivor that 's attacked them and run away ) , and make sure that you 're safely hidden in a building that 's either secured or barricaded , when you 've finished for the day .
Existence as a zombie is rather simpler .
It can be a good idea to find a horde at the end of the day , though - a lone zombie is a much easier target for a passing zombie hunter .
( There are some more in - depth player guides in the Wiki . )
Is there a mailing list or discussion forum for Urban Dead ?
There are a few .
The Wiki has comprehensive list of forums , mailing lists and online chat areas , and the Wiki itself has discussion space for each of its pages .
Is there a full map of the city ?
The Wiki suburb map gives an overview of the city , along with danger levels and links to each suburb to show what 's going on in your area .
Am I allowed to play multiple characters ?
You are , provided that they lead completely separate existences within the game - your characters should not collaborate , nor share ( or stand outside ) the same building .
Multiple characters found to be working together in a suspicious fashion will be automatically flagged , penalised or even banned permanently by the system .
If you 're running a few characters , it 's best to make sure that they stay in separate suburbs .
( If you 're sharing a computer or workplace with other players , it 's recommended that you do n't work together too closely , as this may be wrongly interpreted as a single player using several accounts . )
How do I report game abuse or zerging ?
You do n't .
A number of automated detection systems and countermeasures are already in place , and time is better spent on improving those systems , rather than carefully investigating reports and screenshots ( and all reports would have to be investigated at length , given that any of them could be easily - faked attempts to get innocent characters banned ) .
There 's no need to email reports in - if there 's some exceptional bug - based game abuse going on , you can file it as a bug report on the Wiki for attention .
How should I report bugs ?
The best place to report a bug ( or check whether it 's already been reported ) is the Bug Reports page of the Wiki .
Is n't this game similar to some other games ?
The basic grid -map idea was derived conceptually and with full permission from RavenBlack 's Vampires ( whose basic idea was itself derived from my annoying brain - eating viral ) , with a touch of the Zombie Infection Simulation .
Raven and I know each other , this all goes back years - Urban Dead and Vampires really take their roots from the grid - map PBM games we were both playing in the early 90s .
A lot of Urban - Dead - style games have sprung up as a result of this game 's popularity , but they all post - date Urban Dead , and ( apart from some friendly consultancy on Shartak ) none of them are anything to do with me , or use any of the Urban Dead code .
Is there any merchandise ?
There 's an official Urban Dead Mall at Cafepress where you can buy T - shirts , mugs and badges , if you really want to .
It 's all base - price , we do n't make any money from them .
Game Mechanics
What are Action Points ?
You spend an Action Point every time you move , use an object , make an attack , or take any other action in the game - when they 've run out , you have to wait for them to be replenished .
They 're refilled at the rate of one every half hour ( whether or not you 're logged in ) , with a default maximum of fifty .
Fifty Action Points is n't enough !
The limit of 50 AP per 25 hours is to keep the game balanced and to stop too much from happening overnight ; if we doubled the recharge rate , it 'd mean people getting in a hundred APs ' worth of actions while other players were offline , which is enough to cross the city or deal an easily fatal amount of combat damage .
What are Experience Points ?
You earn Experience Points from successful combat ( getting more XP for fighting the " other side " - survivors attacking survivors only get half the XP they would fighting a zombie , and vice versa ) , healing other players , and various other types of game behaviour .
You can click the " Buy Skills " button to spend your XP on new character skills from the skills tree - these typically cost 100XP , although Military and Scientist characters can buy skills within their own class for 75XP , and in the opposite class for 150XP .
What are Suburbs ?
The city of Malton is divided into a hundred smaller 10x10 block sections known as ' Suburbs ' - the name of the Suburb you 're currently in is given at the top of your city view .
If you use the city map , this can help you work your way towards other people you know who are playing the game .
How do I talk to other players ?
You can speak to citizens in the same block as you , using the text box that appears when people are nearby - zombies can speak as well , but with a very limited vocabulary .
Zombies can understand the speech of survivors .
Because people log in at different times , you should n't expect to get an immediate response to anything you say - people you 're talking to will see your dialogue the next time they log in , or take a turn .
You 'll eventually be able to use the mobile phones to communicate long - distance , as well , when the power to the transmitters comes back on .
How does searching work ?
Each search you perform has a percentage chance of turning up an item relevant to the location you 're searching .
This chance is affected by various factors - installing a generator in a building will get the lights working and make it easier to find things , while a building that has fallen into disrepair will be much harder to search .
Items do n't " run out " ( if they did , new players would have a pretty hard time of things ) .
If you 've had a run of fruitless searching , either you 're in a type of building that does n't have anything useful , or you 've just had bad luck .
What do all the items do ?
The game wiki has a detailed analysis of all game items , including their effects and locations .
Can I still use my life skills when I 'm a zombie ?
Some of them , but any that rely on the dexterity or agility of a living body become dormant while you 're undead .
How do some survivors have zombie skills ?
NecroTech staff are able to return zombies to fully conscious life ; virtually all zombie skills become dormant , only being activated when the player dies again .
How does graffiti work ?
If you 've found a spraycan , graffiti can be sprayed on the inside or outside wall of a building , or on random walls in empty blocks - new graffiti is assumed to be spraypainted over the top of the old .
Zombies are able to read or interpret graffiti in the same way as survivors .
How effective is closing the doors of a building ?
It 'll automatically stop lower - level zombies from being able to enter the building at all , but any zombie who has developed the " Memories of Life " skill will be able to open the doors , and leave them open for other zombies to follow .
Closing the doors might be enough to stop a wandering zombie from investigating your hiding place , but you should really find a barricaded building if you want to be safe .
How do barricades work ?
Any survivor with the Construction skill can start to build a barricade inside a building , or strengthen a barricade that already exists - any barricade at all will stop zombies from being able to enter the building , although they ( or other survivors ) will able to weaken the barricade by continually attacking it , eventually destroying it .
Building up a barricade so that it becomes " heavy " means that other survivors can no longer enter the building either .
Those inside the building may still leave by the higher windows , by clicking on an adjacent block , but will not be able to return .
How do video diaries work ?
During February and March 2008 , characters on the limited - edition Monroeville map had access to video cameras , which could be used to record diaries of the locations and events they encountered , with prizes being awarded to the best filmmakers when the quarantine closed .
Video cameras are no longer available .
I 'm dead !
Is that it ?
Death is only a temporary inconvenience in the quarantine zone ; anyone dying in any manner whatsoever will be able to rise as a zombie , at a cost of 10 AP .
In Monroeville , zombies stay zombies forever .
For the dead of Malton , there are rumours that the zombified state is reversible , that higher - level NecroTech staff are trained and equipped in the science of full - body , full - consciousness revivification .
( There are a number of NecroTech - supported revivification points around the city . )
If you 're knocked down again while a zombie , you wo n't be eliminated .
Death is never permanent .
Wishlist
Why can't I trade items with other players ?
This would be such a dangerously game - altering change that it 's going to be implemented very carefully , and probably not for a while .
The convenience of being able to give your friend a spare gun is fairly minor compared to the inconvenience of the massive abuse that this change could make possible ( primarily the risk of players using multiple characters just to search for equipment and hand it over to the primary character ) .
Why can't zombies be killed permanently ?
Because they 're people too .
You can slow them down , but giving a mechanism to remove them from the game permanently would - although fitting the canon of the genre - frustrate people who'd been playing the same character for a long time .
We do n't want to frustrate our players .
Can I disable my character while I go on holiday ?
If you do n't log in for five days , your character becomes " hidden " and is no longer at risk ; if you 're in a strong safehouse when you leave , you should be okay .
There 's no way to disable a character immediately , though .
Can I modify my profile or password ?
Clicking the " settings " button below the stats window will allow you to change your character 's visible description , as well as your login details and game preferences .
At the moment , password changing is unavailable .
Can I delete or rename a character ?
No - there 's too much scope for in - game confusion if players are allowed to change their name , or start as a new character with the same name , or have their abandoned name taken up by someone else .
But any character that has n't been logged in for more than five days is considered to have spent that time finding and reinforcing a place to shelter , and becomes " hidden " , effectively disappearing from the game .
They 'll re-emerge if you log back in , but if you never use the account again , the character wo n't ever appear on the streets again .
Can I send you some ideas ?
All players are welcome to suggest alterations and additions that they think would improve the game - we can't guarantee that they 'll be implemented , but anything submitted to the Suggestions page of the Urban Dead Wiki will certainly be passed on and read , if it passes peer review .
Troubleshooting
Why am I being told that I have " accessed this server too many times today " ?
( This limit is now being waived for players who have donated to support the game ; anyone donating more than $ 5 may nominate one character to have unresticted access , per $ 5 . )
Players of Urban Dead are limited to hitting the main game script 160 times per day - this is to stop the server from becoming overloaded and unresponsive , or from incurring bandwidth costs that would require the site to be shut down .
160 hits is more than enough to run one character , and should be enough to play even three characters comfortably .
We 're aware that this causes problems for users who are sharing a machine or network with other players , but there is no way to automatically distinguish three housemates from one person logging on three times .
If you 're using AOL ( or another ISP or university network that uses a small range of proxy servers ) then this may cause problems - the fact that every user is being mapped to a very small range of IP addresses can mean that other users of the same IP address have used up all the hits that you would have used .
You might like to try using a browser other than the default AOL one - we 're told that only the actual AOL browser uses the proxies , and that others are okay .
Alternatively , try reconnecting , if you 're on dial - up ; you 'll probably be assigned a different IP address .
( We have taken some steps to fix this , but AOL 's constantly - changing proxies make it difficult to provide a permanent solution . )
I attacked 50 times at 30 % , and only hit seven times !
Is this a bug ?
Or you searched and found nothing , or were n't able to break down some barricades .
It 's either a run of bad luck , which can happen and has to happen to someone , or it's the game 's anti-abuse countermeasures kicking in - if the system detects a number of characters apparently controlled by the same player and working together , it will adjust their dice rolls to stop them gaining an unfair advantage over other players .
Zombies got into my locked and barricaded building .
How ?
They smashed the barricades down with their hands , and a zombie with the " Memories of Life " skill was able to open the doors for them .
Or if your barricades are still up and there 's a zombie inside , it 's likely that someone rebuilt the barricade but forgot to dump a dead body outside , and it 's risen .
( Or that one of the other survivors in the safehouse was killed , perhaps through an Infection , and rose . )
I forgot my password but did n't specify an email when I signed up .
What now ?
Sorry , that 's it ; you were told when you signed up that you should provide an email address if you ever want your password mailed to you - obviously we can't give out a password to anyone who mails us asking for it , because they might not be you , we have no way of knowing who the lost - password character really belongs to .
If a character 's been idle for more than a week because whoever owns it really has n't been able to log in , then we might concede and reset the password for whoever 's claiming it , but this is really a case - by - case thing , and not something we want to encourage .
A player is saying offensive things to me - what can I do ?
If you add a player as a contact , you can set them as " ignore " on your contacts page - you 'll no longer see any game dialogue or radio broadcasts from that user .
How do I transfer my Monroeville donation status to a Malton character ?
Just click the " Settings " button on the main game page , and enter the name of the Maltonian character that you wish to transfer the donation flag to .
Note that this is permanent ; the flag cannot be transferred back , or to a further character , later on .

How Natural Oils Can Be Hydrogenated Without Making Unhealthy Trans Fats UC
Riverside researchers illustrate how controlling shape of heterogeneous catalysts can promote desired chemical reaction
NEWS MEDIA CONTACT

RIVERSIDE , Calif . –
To prolong the shelf life of foods , manufacturers often add hydrogen to natural oils , a process called hydrogenation .
But hydrogenation also results in the production offats , which have adverse health effects such as raising bad cholesterol and increasing the risk for coronary heart disease .
fats are found in vegetable shortenings , some margarines , crackers , cookies and snacks .
Health authorities worldwide recommend that people reduce their consumption offats .
Now UC
Riverside chemists have designed a catalyst – a substance that accelerates a chemical reaction – that allows hydrogenated oils to be made while minimizing the production offats .
In their experiments , the researchers , led by Francisco Zaera , a professor of chemistry , used platinum , a common catalyst for these processes .
By controlling the shape of the platinum particles , the Zaera group was able to make the catalyst more selective .
Catalytic selectivity refers to the ability of a catalyst to select a specific pathway from among many possible chemical reactions .
In the case of the researchers ’ experiments , selectivity refers to the production of partially hydrogenated fats without the making offats .
Zaera ’s lab found that the platinum catalyst performed most selectively when its particles assumed tetrahedral shapes , with the atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice .
Particles with these shapes allow for the preservation of the harmlessconfiguration in the hydrogenated fats .
Other lattices , the researchers found , favor the production offats .
Platinum catalysts such as those used by the Zaera group are considered heterogeneous because they exist in a different phase ( solid ) than the reactants ( liquid or gas ) .
Compared with homogeneous catalysts , where the catalyst is in the same phase ( liquid ) as the reactants , heterogeneous catalysts have the advantages of easy preparation , handling , separation from the reaction mixture , reuse , high stability , and low cost .
But their main disadvantage is that , unlike homogeneous catalysts , which tend to be molecular , heterogeneous catalysts must be dispersed as small particles in a high surface - area support in order to optimize their use .
This typically results in catalysts with surfaces of ill - defined structures .
The research by Zaera and his colleagues is a breakthrough also because it shows for the first time that it is possible to achieve selectivity with heterogeneous catalysts like platinum by controlling the structure of their surfaces .
"
The more control we can exert on how we prepare catalysts , the more we can control the catalytic selectivity of a particular chemical process , " Zaera said .
" Our work shows that it is possible to make heterogeneous catalysts that afford us more control on selectivity .
This opens the door , we hope , for chemists to think about achieving selectivity for other reactions via the design of specific heterogeneous catalysts with specific shapes .
" Zaera explained that heterogeneous catalysts tend to be more practical in terms of manipulation , but are harder to control .
" Our paper shows that , thanks to new advances in nanoscience , sophisticated and highly selective heterogeneous catalysts can be made by controlling their structures , " he added .
" In this sense , our paper changes the paradigm of heterogeneous catalysis .
These catalysts can now compete more closely with homogeneous catalysts , which industry traditionally uses for reactions that require high selectivity such as those involved in the manufacture of medicines or other fine chemicals .
" Study results appeared online earlier this week in Nature Materials Next in their research , Zaera ’s lab plans to find other reactions where selectivity is needed .
The researchers also plan to improve on the synthetic techniques used to make selective catalysts .
Nearly 80 percent of all chemical industrial processes use catalysts .
With annual global sales of about $ 1500 billion , catalysts contribute approximately 35 percent of the world ’s gross domestic product .
They are used in the manufacture of commodity , petro- and agro-chemicals , pharmaceuticals , cosmetics , foods , and polymers .

Nutrient levels in food supply eroded by pursuit of high yields
When we sit down to a meal of supermarket - bought produce , we like to think we ’re getting a reasonable cross-section of the body ’s nutrient requirements , but studies are showing that our chemical intensive monocrop farming systems are not delivering the vital ‘ secondary nutrients ’ that our ancestors enjoyed .
Plants ‘ flourishing ’ on fast , soluble chemical fertilisers get ‘ lazy ’ and do not develop the deep , healthy root systems that pull additional elements out of the soil .
In addition , the soil micro-organisms that break down organic matter and minerals to feed to plant roots are being slaughtered through chemical bombardment and violent mechanised manipulation of their environment .
Essentially , we ’re getting robbed , and having to pay for it in reduced health / vitality / longevity and increased medical bills .
Actually , if you understand a little about soil science and plant health , the information in the recently released report – Still No Free Lunch – should be obvious to all .
But , for many of us , the closest we get to the land is when we take a walk down the aisles of our local shopping centre .
American agriculture ’s single - minded focus on increasing yields over the last half - century created a blind spot where incremental erosion in the nutritional quality of our food has occurred .
This erosion , modest in some crops but significant in others for some nutrients , has gone largely unnoticed by scientists , farmers , government and consumers .
Government data from both America and the United Kingdom have shown that the concentration of a range of essential nutrients in the food supply has declined in the last few decades , with double digit percentage declines of iron , zinc , calcium , selenium and other essential nutrients across a wide range of common foods .
As a consequence , the same - size serving of sweet corn or potatoes , or a slice of whole wheat bread , delivers less iron , zinc and calcium .
Fewer nutrients per serving translate into less nutrition per calorie consumed .
This erosion in the biological value of food impacts consumers in much the same way as monetary inflation ; that is , we have more food , but it ’s worth less in terms of nutritional value .
…
Agronomic practices have worked hand - in - hand with plant breeding in setting the stage for this nutrient decline .
Together , the tactics farmers use to increase yields — including close plant spacing and the widespread use of chemical fertilizers , irrigation and pesticides — tend to create big plants that grow fast , but do not absorb a comparable quantity of many soil nutrients .
The plants are dependent on highly soluble , readily available sources of nutrients applied by the farmers , as opposed to those distributed through each acre ’s layer of topsoil .
In fact , recent studies have shown that crops grown in poor quality , low organic matter soil sometimes have higher rates of root disease , and can struggle to absorb nutrients even when the nutrients are present at high levels in the soil profile – Executive Summary , Still No Free Lunch : Nutrient levels in U.S. food supply eroded by pursuit of high yields ( PDF )
Nitrogen , Phosphorus , and Potassium on the Menu

The main ingredients in the chemical soup poured onto our fields are Nitrogen ( N ) , Phosphorus ( P ) and Potassium ( K ) .
Plants will grow on little more than this , but like a kid fed only on chocolate all his life , the plant ’s growth is not matched with corresponding vitality .
Essential nutrients are missing from the diet and this shows up in poor plant health ( remember , you are what you eat ) .
Plants become vulnerable to disease – necessitating further applications of chemicals – and they perish faster , which has contributed to the birth of the concept of food irradiation .
These additional polluting and resource / energy intensive practices are simply patching holes in the globalised monocrop farming system , a system that will inevitably collapse .
The report shares the results of studies that show organic farming practices , conversely , produce crops with higher nutritional value – including boosted rates of cancer - preventing antioxidants :
Some studies have reported even more dramatic differences in concentrations of specific phytochemicals — for example , nearly twice as much of two common antioxidants in organic tomatoes compared to conventional tomatoes .
Organic forms of fertilizer , like manure or cover crops that offer more balanced mixes of nutrients and release the nutrients more gradually , encourage plants to develop more robust root systems that more aggressively absorb nutrients .
At the same time , for a wide range of fruits , vegetables and grains , reducing pesticide use has been shown to boost phytochemical content , sometimes dramatically .
…
High levels of readily available nitrogen tend to reduce nutrient density and the intensity of flavors , and sometimes make crops more vulnerable to pests .
Nutrients in compost , manure , cover crops and other soil amendments tend to be released more slowly in step with crop needs , and often help to boost crop nutrient levels , the efficiency of nutrient uptake , and flavor profiles .
The large amounts of organic matter returned to the soil in organic farming systems encourage healthier , more robust roots , higher levels of available micronutrients , water infiltration and retention , and below - ground microbial activity that can help increase crop nutrient density . -
Executive Summary , Still No Free Lunch : Nutrient levels in U.S. food supply eroded by pursuit of high yields
If you are not already growing your own food , then , as you transition , do support local growers that are working with natural systems – and experience the benefits .
The advantages of food grown with a focus on soil health are more than just being able to eat ‘ chemical free ’ produce .
Truly organic food is not just a subtraction of a negative , but also an addition of many positives — health - giving and disease - preventing nutrients are not the least among these .

Lifestyle drugs -- chiefly Viagra -- are costing General Motors $ 17 million a year and the cost is passed along to car , truck and SUV consumers .
The blue pill is covered under GM 's labor agreement with United Auto Workers , as well as benefit plans for salaried employees .
GM executives estimate health care adds $ 1,500 to the price of each vehicle but they do not break out how much of the premium is caused by erectile dysfunction expenses .
GM provides health care for 1.1 million employees , retirees and dependents and is the world 's largest private purchaser of Viagra .
GM recently raised the co-pay for erectile dysfunction drugs to $ 18 under a new agreement with the UAW and the company has also pared benefits for salaried workers .
The automaker spends almost $ 5.6 billion each year on health care .
While lifestyle drugs are a small fraction of the total medical bill , every health care expense is added into the price of every new vehicle and is a drag on the struggling goliath 's earnings .
Given the large number of aging autoworkers in the U.S. , the industrys Viagra tab and bill for other erectile dysfunction drugs is certain to continue rising .
Neither Ford nor Chrysler will disclose the amount spent on erectile dysfunction drugs .
While many government and company health plans have eliminated impotence drugs from coverage plans , GM has more than two retirees for every active worker on its rolls and must negotiate eliminating the drugs from the union health plan with the UAW .

In announcement made today on the Fedora mailing list , project leader Paul W. Frields announced that Fedora 11 — the next major version of the popular Linux distribution — will be codenamed Leonidas .
According to the codename proposal wiki page , Leonidas was a " ship in the Union navy . "
What the Fedora developers failed to realize , however , is that the USS Leonidas was a derelict vessel that the Union army obtained to intentionally sink .
It was part of the Stone Fleet , a group of antiquated whaling ships that the Union army loaded with stone and sank in Charleston Harbor in order to impede blockade runners .
The Fedora crew is salvaging a bit of their dignity by saying that the name came from Sparta 's King Leonidas , who was slain valiantly defending Greece at the Battle of Thermopylae .
It 's not exactly a happy ending either , but at least Sparta 's Leonidas had an opportunity to go down fighting .
Leonidas , which is already under active development , will be released in May .
Several features are already planned .
It will also include Presto by default , a new plugin for Yum that will allow the package manager to download the parts that have changed instead of entire packages during system updates .
The developers are also integrating DeviceKit , a new hardware abstraction layer that simplifies device management .
Other new features include a new volume control user interface that leverages PulseAudio , faster boot time , KDE 4.2 , and Python 2.6 .
The Fedora developers have gathered in Boston at the FUDCon event this week , where they are collaborating on development and discussing emerging Linux technologies .
You can get some first - hand perspectives on FUDCon at the Planet Fedora web site .
Low oil prices and the credit crunch are threatening to stall the green revolution .
The value of crude has dropped from a summer high of nearly $ 150 a barrel to below $ 40 , taking the wind out of the sails of turbine manufacturers and others ­trying to build low - carbon alternatives .
Jeremy Leggett , founder and executive chairman of Solarcentury , says : " Talk of the death of renewables is premature but clearly big solar farms and wind projects are being cancelled .
Everything is suf­fering in the current climate but its my contention that the low oil price is a temporary thing and the growth of renew­ables will resume . "
Michael Liebreich , chief executive of information provider New Energy Finance , says his leading index of clean - technology companies has fallen from a high of 450 points 12 months ago to 175 points , hit by a triple whammy of lower oil prices , higher costs of capital and fear of more speculative start - up businesses .
But he too is confident that the sector can bounce back .
" There was no doubt that there was a certain amount of irrational exuberance over the low - carbon economy .
No industry in history has kept up the kind of 40 % compound growth rates being ascribed to clean tech so share prices had run up too far and it was time for a correction . "
Clean - tech and renewables stocks have been struggling with more than just sentiment .
Indian - based wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon Energy , which has seen its share price plunge by 90 % this year , has also been hit by malfunctions and the kind of teething problems it says is are inevit­able with new types of technology .
Wind developers in the US have been cutting back in the face of tough new conditions .
FPL Group , the US 's largest wind - power operator , is cutting its ­spending this year by nearly a quarter to $ 5.3 bn ( £ 3.7bn ) and new wind - power generation from 1,500 to 1,100 megawatts .
Confidence in the sector has also been rattled by T Boone Pickens , a veteran oil man who delighted environmentalists with a very public conversion when he promised to build the world 's largest wind farm in Texas .
He slammed on the brakes in November on the basis that lower oil prices had changed the economics of a scheme that would have powered 1.3 m homes .
However the US wind sector has generally been faring better than the British one , thanks to tax breaks .
Shell and BP have made it clear they are no longer interested in pursuing UK farms when the investment numbers stack up much better across the Atlantic .
The decision by Shell to pull out of the London Array wind farm was a particular blow to British confidence .
The project has been billed as the biggest offshore scheme of its kind in the world but the oil company said the margins were too thin , leaving E.ON of Germany and Dong Energy of Denmark to go it alone .
Anton Milner , the chief executive of Q - Cells , the world 's largest manufacturer of solar cells , cut earnings forecasts recently after being hit by what he described as a " flood " of cancellations from developers of solar - power projects struggling to raise finance .
The US manufacturer Evergreen Solar has since delayed an $ 800 m new factory in Asia that would have manufactured enough solar cells to power a city of 500,000 people .
But most industry figures are convinced that though the threat of global recession is slowing down the industry , the future remains bright enough , especially with a new figure taking over the White House .
Liebreich says his clean - tech index has seen an " Obama bounce " , rising from a low of 130 to 175 on the back of optimism about the incoming president 's policies .
A raft of radical political appointments – such as Nobel physics laureate Steven Chu as energy secretary – has convinced environmentalists that Barack Obama is serious about his stated aim of hastening progress towards a low - carbon economy with a green New Deal that will reduce his country 's dependence on imported oil .
A quarterly review of climate change - related business opportunities just published by analysts at HSBC says governments are increasingly active .
" The engagement of governments has grown globally , " they say .
" Across the political spectrum there is now more recognition that climate change is a genuine long - term global issue with real growth potential . "
Martin Wright , managing director of Marine Current Turbines , says no one should expect oil and gas prices to stay low .
" Vladimir Putin has already said the era of cheap gas is over and no one knows when peak oil really will come about .
So we can expect enormous price volatility , which all points to the need for Britain to develop an independent low - carbon alternative . "
The military medical community has been using all sorts of alternative therapies – yoga , meditation , even animal - petting – to ease the strains of post - traumatic stress disorder FOR returning troops .
One of the non-traditional treatments will be used in a war zone for the first time .
" The Air Force will begin teaching ' battlefield acupuncture ' early next year to physicians deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan , " reports the Baltimore Sun 's David Wood .
" The initiative marks the first high - level endorsement of acupuncture by the traditionally conservative military medical community , officials said . "
Using tiny needles that barely penetrate the skin of a patient 's ear , Air Force doctors here say they can interrupt pain signals going to the brain ... reliev[ing ] even unbearable pain for days at a time ....
" This is one of the fastest pain attenuators in existence – the pain can be gone in five minutes , " said Col.
Richard Niemtzow , a physician , acupuncturist and senior adviser to the Air Force surgeon general .
Niemtzow , an oncologist , also sees acupuncture as a way to treat obesity and macular degeneration .
Meanwhile , other Eastern - inspired techniques are slowly spreading throughout the services .
Walter Reed hospital is using yoga to combat PTSD .
Submariners and Camp Lejeune marines are using " Warrior Mind Training " to improve mental focus .
And the Army is spending $ 4 million to study various alternative - therapies , including a research project that examines " how holding and petting an animal can treat PTSD . "

Chinese man hangs girlfriend out the window in lovers ' quarrel
It 's not the best way to resolve an argument :
Hang your lover out the window until the police take you away .
But that appears to be just what this man tried .
The unidentified man was caught by a passing photographer forcing a woman , said to be his girlfriend , out a third - storey window in the Chinese city of Kunming today .
Lovers ' spat ? :
The man hangs the woman upside down from the window in Kunming , China
Terror is clear on the woman 's face as the man appears to be on the verge of climbing out the window with her and sending them both to their deaths
The enraged man kept the woman pinned to the windowsill and in fear for her life for more than two hours .
Horrified crowds gathered before the building as police frantically tried to talk him down .
They finally succeeded - but he took the woman with him as a hostage , holding a knife to her neck .

Gay - marriage opponents filed legal briefs Monday accusing California Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown of having “ invented an entirely new theory , ” one that “ fails at every level , ” in his quest to find a reason to invalidate Proposition 8 , which passed with 52 % of the vote in November .
“ The people have the final word on what the California Constitution says , ” lawyers for the Protect Marriage Coalition wrote .
“ The practical result of the attorney general ’s theory is that the people can never amend the Constitution to overrule judicial interpretations of inalienable rights . ”
The filing , which was co-written by Whitewater prosecutor and Pepperdine Law School Dean Kenneth Starr , came in response to a brief filed two weeks ago by the attorney general in which Brown surprised legal experts with a novel theory to argue that Proposition 8 should be invalidated .
Brown ’s theory , Starr wrote , is “ utterly without foundation in this court ’s case law ” and “ is not only unprecedented but contradicts the most basic understanding of the role of the judiciary in a constitutional democracy . ”

The attorney general has a legal duty to uphold state laws , and Brown , though he personally supports same - sex marriage , had pledged to defend Proposition 8 after gay - rights activists and California cities filed lawsuits challenging it the day after the election .
But in a move that outraged supporters of Proposition 8 and took even gay - rights activists by surprise , Brown ’s brief instead urged the court to toss the proposition , declaring that “ the amendment process cannot be used to extinguish fundamental constitutional rights without compelling justification . ”
Brown argued that the California Constitution protects the right to marry as inalienable .
Legal experts said Starr and the Protect Marriage coalition had made a strong counter - argument in their filing Monday .
Santa Clara University Law professor Gerald Uelmen , an expert on the state high court , said it “ hits the nail on the head . ”

“ If you think of the Constitution as a compact between the people and those who govern us , to say the people have no power to amend a court ’s ruling simply because the court . . . says this is an inalienable right -- I think that is pretty far out . ”
Monday ’s legal filing came because the court gave permission for supporters of Proposition 8 to file responses to Brown ’s brief .
The court will consider the briefings and could hear oral arguments as soon as March .
Opponents of the measure , including Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights , also filed briefs Monday .
They agreed with Brown that Proposition 8 should be invalidated , but differed with the attorney general on the question of whether the proposition was enacted properly .

In their lawsuits , gay - rights activists had argued that the measure should be rejected because it was a revision of the Constitution instead of a more limited amendment .
A constitutional amendment can be passed by a majority vote after being put on the ballot by a signature drive ; only a two - thirds vote of the Legislature or a constitutional convention can put a revision on the ballot .
Brown has rejected the argument that Proposition 8 is a revision .
Shannon Minter , the lawyer for the National Center for Lesbian Rights , said his team ’s legal position nevertheless has the same “ core principles ” as Brown’s .
“ To be candid , we had n’t thought of framing it in this way , ” he said of Brown ’s approach .
“ But when I read the argument , I was immediately persuaded . ”
Advertisement
Other experts said Brown may have a more difficult task persuading the state Supreme Court justices .
“ It faces an uphill battle , ” said UC Berkeley Law School professor Jesse Choper .
The question of gay marriage may also have political implications for Brown .
The former governor has been exploring a run to return to that job , and one of his potential opponents may be San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , a hero to gay - rights advocates , who began marrying same - sex couples in 2004 .
In an interview , Brown said Monday that the court has “ a difficult job . ”

“ This is certainly a challenging case , and the court and each of those judges will reflect long and hard before they decide how they are going to vote , ” he said .

I was n’t sure what to expect from ‘ Unmade Beds ’ based on the synopsis and other things I had heard .
What I got was a UK art - house flick about a couple of 20 something drifters who made it from bed to bed while trekking through Europe .
Axl keeps count of all of the beds he has slept in since he left home on his journey .
He was up to 20 until he landed himself in a communal home / bar and gets to live with them for free .
The main goal of his journey to find his dad and see why he abandoned him .
The other story is follows is from a girl named Vera who seems to have recently gotten her heart broken .
She goes around taking pictures of all of the beds she sleeps in with a Polaroid camera .
She meets a guy at random and starts a low key love affair with him .
The stories finally come together towards the end of the movie with both Axl and Vera have a chance encounter and she leaves him something that he can remember .
The movie was very art house and was visually stunning , but the story is strung together and at points things seem to make very little sense .
All in all its a great film that deserves to be seen just understand that the story is a little slow , just keep watching .

CHARLOTTE , N.C. --
After 19 straight wins and an NBA record 27 - 2 start , the Boston Celtics have lost that swagger .
The lockdown defense and the poise are missing , too , as teams line up to get a shot at the defending champions .
On Tuesday , it was the lowly Charlotte Bobcats , as Raymond Felton scored 25 points and rookie D.J. Augustin added 11 of his 20 in overtime in a stunning 114-106 win that sent the Celtics to their fifth loss in seven games .
Going from unbeatable to vulnerable in less than two weeks , the Celtics were searching for answers after being left battered , bruised and angry by Larry Brown 's upstart Bobcats .
" We told our team before the season it will be 82 Game 7s .
Every time we play it 's a Game 7 for the other team , " coach Doc Rivers said .
" On the nights we 're not ready mentally for that , we 're going to have to get lucky and play over our head to win . "
It did n't happen against Charlotte , and there was plenty of blame to go around .
Paul Pierce scored 28 points , but had a key turnover in overtime .
Ray Allen scored 20 points , but shot 7 - for - 20 .
Rajon Rondo committed nine turnovers .
Kevin Garnett had 14 points and 13 rebounds , but shot only 7 - of - 18 and was called for traveling in Charlotte 's decisive spurt .
And the NBA 's worst offensive team had its second - best scoring night of the season .
Gerald Wallace chipped in with 23 points , but it was Augustin who hit a 3 - pointer and two free throws in a 7 - 0 run that put Charlotte ahead 108- 101 .
Augustin even talked some trash at the champs ' expense .
" They come in and intimidate you and try to punk you , " Augustin said .
" But if you do n't back down from them , they kind of fold . "
That would have been laughable before Boston visited the Lakers on Christmas .
But Boston was frustrated again at key times .
After Pierce dribbled the ball out of bounds with Charlotte leading by five in the final minute of OT , Pierce gave Augustin a slight shove , as the turnover ended Boston 's chances in a physical game that saw the Celtics continue their surprising struggles against one of the Eastern Conference 's worst teams .
The Bobcats , despite entering with a 44 - 72 record over the past two seasons , won in Boston last season .
They lost on Allen 's buzzer - beater in another game , and dropped a close contest in the first meeting this season in November .
Tuesday was another thriller , as the Celtics rallied from a 10 - point , third - quarter deficit , took 79 - 72 lead in the fourth quarter , then allowed the Bobcats to get back in it .
Felton 's fadeaway with 38 seconds left in regulation put Charlotte ahead 96 - 95 .
After Allen missed a jumper , Felton was fouled and hit only one free throw with 20 seconds left .
Pierce then dribbled off a screen and drilled a turnaround jumper with 3.4 seconds left to tie it .
Felton missed a straightaway 20 - footer at the buzzer to force OT .
But the Bobcats dominated the extra period , despite playing again without Raja Bell ( groin ) , getting five straight defensive stops to pick up one of Brown 's biggest wins since taking over his record ninth NBA team .
" The one thing I always remember is when you 're a good team , every team you play against is trying to bring their best game , " Brown said .
" That 's a pretty special group that Boston has .
We 've got to learn to bring it every night like that and not just against Boston . "
The Celtics were without reserve guard Tony Allen , who injured his right ankle in Sunday 's loss to New York , and again looked out of sync in a bruising game .
As Bobcats part - owner Michael Jordan sat courtside and spent much of the game barking at referee Dick Bavetta , there were angry words and blood on the court .
Charlotte 's Juwan Howard picked up a flagrant foul for leveling Glen Davis early in the fourth quarter , leading Davis to play with cotton in one nostril .
Technicals were called on Rivers and Felton , after he confronted Davis following a hard foul away from the ball .
" We 'll get better , " Garnett promised .
" We 're a team of confidence , a team of character .
We 're just getting everybody 's best shot right now .

Israel unleashed an artillery bombardment on Gaza today for the first time in its week - long offensive , prompting increased speculation that a ground invasion is about to begin .
Palestinian medical officials also said that an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza mosque had killed 10 people and wounded dozens more .
Al Jazeera quoted witnesses as saying there were at least 200 people at prayer inside the Ibrahim al - Maqadna mosque in northern Gaza when the missile struck .
The Israeli TV station Channel 10 said the entire length of the Gaza Strip was under attack .
Palestinian witnesses told Reuters the shelling had caused a large explosion in Gaza City and there were a series of blasts close to the frontier with Israel .
There were no immediate reports of casualties .
Israeli TV commentators said shelling could be used to clear Hamas - laid minefields ahead of a possible ground invasion .
Israeli troops are massed on the border waiting for orders to go in .
Speaking from Syria , the exiled Hamas leader , Khaled Mashaal , warned that any ground assault would lead Israel to " a black destiny of dead and wounded " .
Sustained artillery fire is likely to significantly increase the number of civilian casualties , according to a report on the website of the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz .
Israel 's first artillery use came shortly after Gordon Brown telephoned his Israeli counterpart , Ehud Olmert , urging him to stop the attacks .
" The prime minister has spoken again today to Prime Minister Olmert , and is pressing hard for an immediate ceasefire , " a Downing Street spokesman said .
" We are working urgently with international partners to address the underlying causes of the conflict , including trafficking of arms into Gaza ... Moderation must prevail . "
Earlier today , Israeli aircraft and gunboats continued attacking targets in Gaza .
The Israelis struck the homes of two Hamas operatives , saying the buildings were used to store weapons and plan attacks .
Hamas said one of its military leaders , Abu Zakari al - Jamal , was killed in an air raid last night .
More than 400 Palestinians and at least four Israelis have been killed since Israel launched its offensive last Saturday .
The UN estimated yesterday that a quarter of the Palestinians killed were civilians .
George Bush today blamed the continuing violence on Hamas terrorism and offered no criticism of Israel in his first comments since the offensive began a week ago .
The US president condemned Hamas 's campaign of rocket attacks on Israel as an " act of terror " and said no peace deal would be acceptable unless the flow of smuggled weapons to terrorist groups was monitored and stopped .
" This recent outburst of violence was instigated by Hamas , a Palestinian terrorist group supported by Iran and Syria that calls for Israel 's destruction , " he said .
The White House will not comment on whether it views the Israeli response as proportionate .
In his weekly radio address , Bush said Washington was " leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected " .
He said he would keep the president - elect , Barack Obama , updated on the negotiations .
Obama has refused to comment on the crisis while Bush remains in office .
The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon last night urged world leaders to intensify efforts to achieve an immediate ceasefire .
Israel has said it will accept a ceasefire only if it is enforced by international monitors .
Palestinian militants continued to fire rockets into southern Israel today .
There were no injuries , though one rocket hit a house in the southern city of Ashkelon , police said .
President Obama 's silhouette is seen as he greets people in a receiving line in the Blue Room Wednesday .
What we do n't know about Obama
We know a lot more about Barack Obama than we did on Election Day .
He wastes little time making big decisions .
He was serious about surrounding himself with seasoned people , even if they are outsized personalities likely to jostle one another and unlikely to salute on command .
He intends to move quickly to put his personal stamp on government and national life .
Yet much about how the 44th president will govern remains a mystery — perhaps even to Obama himself .
The stirring rhetoric witnessed on the campaign trail and in Tuesday ’s inaugural address is laced with spacious language — flexible enough to support conflicting conclusions about what he really believes .
Only decisions , not words , can clarify what Obama stands for .
Those are coming soon enough .
Advertisement
Until then , here are the questions still left hanging as the Obama administration begins :
DOES HE REALLY THINK AFGHANISTAN IS WINNABLE ?
The new president has strongly signaled that he thinks the answer is yes .
But neither his rhetoric nor his policy proposals so far have fully reckoned with the implications .
If he intends to win in Afghanistan , he is not going to be a Peacemaker President .
To the contrary , he is committing himself to being just as much of a War President as George W. Bush , certainly for the first term and very possibly for a potential second .
Most military experts think a decisive win in Afghanistan — as opposed to a muddle - through strategy leading to a gradual withdrawal — will involve a major surge in troops and a willingness to tolerate high costs and high casualties .
In any event , the country and its unruly neighbor , Pakistan , will quite likely dominate Obama ’s attention much more than Iraq .
Obama advisers say one of the biggest surprises of recent secret briefings on trouble spots around the globe was how unstable , exposed and dangerous Pakistan is .
A nuclear neighbor that harbors terrorists injects all the more danger and uncertainty to the war on the other side of its border .
Joe Biden ’s first trip abroad as vice President - elect included a stop in Afghanistan .
When he returned home , he told Obama : “ The truth is that things are going to get tougher in Afghanistan before they ’re going to get better . ”
If that ’s true , Obama may in the end find muddle - through more attractive than victory .
DO DEFICITS MATTER ?
In the short - run , Obama and his advisers believe , just like Bush and his advisers , that pumping up the economy is the top priority — budget deficits be damned .
But when does the short - run become the long - run ?
Obama has said long - term , trillion - dollar deficits are “ unsustainable . ”
His inaugural address warned about the need to cut programs that do n’t work and make “ hard choices . ”
Does he really mean it ?
If so , the second half of Obama ’s first term likely will be marked by austerity just as much as the first half is going to be marked by massive spending in the name of economic stimulus .
Embracing balanced budgets would also mean embracing steep cuts in weapons systems and entitlement programs , as well as curbing his ambitions for new initiatives in health care and energy .
Tax hikes would also be part of the remedy .
With unpleasant medicine like this , Obama may instead find common cause with Democratic liberals and with Dick Cheney , who , according to former Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill , once dismissed GOP deficit hawks by saying that Ronald Reagan proved that deficits do n’t matter .
HOW FAST IS TOO FAST IN IRAQ ?
The president says he still wants U.S. troops out of Iraq in 16 months .
Tellingly , he always adds caveats that conditions and advice from commanders will dictate the pace .
Defense Secretary Gates recently made this clear : “ He also said he wanted to have a responsible drawdown .
And he also said he was prepared to listen to his commanders .
So , I think that that ’s exactly the position the president - elect should be in . ”
What if conditions change for the worse ?
Violence is way down and many of the most troubled areas are showing signs of stability .
But this remains an extremely volatile region that could erupt in new bloodshed .
Will Obama still cling to a speedy pull - out if it means the country could implode ?
Obama met with his military commanders on Wednesday .
But it ’s anyone ’s guess whose advice he ’ll be listening to most closely , and which members of his heavyweight foreign policy team – within which there are significant disagreements over the Iraq war – will really have his ear .
WHAT ’S IN THE FILES ?
Any time someone criticized their policies on use of force , covert surveillance , or detention or interrogation of terrorism suspects , Bush and Cheney had an answer that was impossible for any outside critic to fully contend with :
You do n’t know what we know .
What they said they knew was top - secret intelligence showing how many people with murderous designs on the United States are roaming the planet , how imminent the threats are , or how effective controversial anti-terrorist programs had been in averting another attack .
Since no one else could see the files , no one else could be on equal footing in deciding whether the administration was right or wrong .
Since Tuesday , Obama has all the same files , and all the same access to the nation ’s top secrets , that Bush and Cheney ever did .
How will Obama react when he gets a constant morning diet of dire warnings ?
The president today moved to shut down the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay and end torture – and has surrounded himself with critics of both who are unlikely to tolerate backsliding .
But it is not unfathomable that Obama has a “ Few Good Men ” moment and has to tell liberals and civil libertarians they can’t handle the truth – and that drastic steps sometimes need to be taken to avert disastrous consequences .
What ’s more , it is hardly a given that any president — no matter his philosophy — would wish to give up the expanded executive power that Bush claimed in the name of national security .
DO UNIONS WEAR WHITE HATS ?
Obama , for the entire campaign , said all the right things when it comes to keeping peace with Big Labor .
He praised the power and fairness of unions .
He expressed skepticism about free trade agreements like NAFTA .
Most of all , he proudly sponsored legislation to make it much easier for workers to unionize .
Lately , he sounds like a man rethinking his enthusiasm .
In a recent interview with the Washington Post , he suggested he would not aggressively push for legislation to free workers to easily unionize ( the bill is known as the Employee Free Choice Act .
“ If we are losing half a million jobs a month , then there are no jobs to unionize . ”
Even Nancy
Pelosi seems inclined to cut him some slack for a while on this one – but at some point the pressure will intensify and we will learn if this is truly a pro-union White House .
CAN U.S. POWER SAVE DARFUR ?
Darfur will be the first test case - but almost certainly not the last one - in which we will learn just how strongly Obama believes his stated view that the United States should act aggressively when it can use its military power to stop genocide or other humanitarian catastrophes .
There is powerful momentum inside the Democratic Party to come to the aid of the suffering people of Darfur .
Among the biggest advocates are two of Obama ’s top advisers : Biden and U.N Ambassador - designate Susan Rice .
But with the military stretched thin , and with many others in his administration more skeptical about the use of force on problems that do n’t directly threaten national security , nothing is likely to happen unless Obama puts his own influence and reputation strongly behind an intervention .
During the campaign , he signaled a willingness to intervene , but also cautioned : “ There ’s a lot of cruelty around the world .
We ’re not going to be able to be everywhere all the time . ”
HOW MUCH DOES HE HAVE TO PLACATE THE LEFT ?
In his inaugural speech , Obama spoke of tired ideologies and a time to think anew about policy and politics .
That is easy to do if he simply means rejecting Bush ’s idea .
But he has suggested this rethinking will hit the left , too – that ’s trickier .
Some times , Obama has been wiling to tick off the left .
He picked Rick Warren , a Christian conservative , to deliver Tuesday ’s opening prayer and filled his cabinet and staff mainly with centrists .
Other times , he seems to bend to liberal frustration .
Obama nixed John Brennan ’s appointment to be CIA director after anti-torture advocates expressed outrage over Brennan ’s involvement in Bush - era interrogations .
Brennan ’s going to be working in the White House anyway , but not in any position that requires Senate confirmation .
Obama also quickly moved to give a prime role to Episcopal Bishop Gene Robinson , an openly gay religious leader from New Hampshire , when liberals protested the choice of Warren to deliver the inaugural prayer .
Politically savvy liberal activists are an important reason Obama beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic nominating contest , and a big reason he blew through all fund - raising records .
It will be hard for Obama to govern without their enthusiasm , onthe other hand , it will be tough to reinvent politics if Obama is forced to routinely throw bouquets to the various factions of the Democratic Party .
“ Researchers in Australia say the growth of coral on the country ’s iconic Great Barrier Reef ( GBR ) has fallen since 1990 to its lowest rate in 400 years , ” variations of this message have been repeated around the world from South Korea to London with global warming , and the associated acidification of oceans , claimed to be the cause .
These reports are repeating claims in an Australian Institute of Marine Science ( AIMS ) media release made just last Friday to coincide with the publication of research findings in the journal Science [ 1 ] .
The media release also claimed the research to be “ the most comprehensive study to date on calcification rates of GBR corals ” .
Having followed GBR issues for many years I was surprised to hear global warming associated with slow coral growth rates , indeed AIMS ’s researchers Janice Lough and David Barnes have published detailed studies concluding that coral growth rates increase significantly with an increase in annual average sea surface temperature [ 2 ] .
Furthermore growth rates actually decrease from north to south along the GBR as this corresponds with a cooling temperature gradient of 2 - 3 degrees C .
If there has been a slowing in growth rates of coral over the last nearly 20 years , as suggested by this new research , a most obvious question for me would be : Have GBR waters cooled ?
This new research paper in Science presents evidence for a decline in coral growth rates since 1990 , but no credible reason for the decline .
While the study hints that the cause could be ocean acidification no direct evidence is provided to support this claim – not even a correlation .
Indeed no data is presented to suggest the PH ( a measure of acidity ) of GBR waters has changed , and based on modelling of hypothetical changes in PH associated with increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide there is a timing problem – the decline in calcification rates should apparently have started years earlier .
Confronted with a lack of evidence in support of this hypothesis – that ocean acidification has caused the drop in growth rates – the researchers suggest in the paper “ synergistic effects of several forms of environmental stress ” and implicate higher temperatures .
But no data is presented in the paper to contradict the well established relationship between increasing temperature and increasing growth rates – though various confusing statements are made and it is suggested that global warming has increased the incidence of heat stress in turn reducing growth rates – while at the same time the researchers acknowledge higher growth rates in northern , warmer , GBR waters .
Marine Biologist Walter Starck has perhaps aptly described the research as part of “ the proliferation of subprime research presenting low value findings as policy grade evidence ” and has suggested this has “ science headed in the same direction as Wall Street . ”
Interestingly , Queensland Premier , Anna Bligh , has decided the “ massive decline in the reef ’s growth ” will require new laws .
None of this , however , gets us any closer to understanding why there has been an apparent dramatic decline in the growth rates of GBR corals over the last 20 years .

Revisiting " Purely Functional Retrogames "
I wrote the Purely Functional Retrogames series as an experiment .
There 's been so much empty talk about how functional languages are as good or better than imperative languages -- yet very little to back that up .
Doubly so in regard to interactive applications .
I 'd bet there are more people learning to program the Atari 2600 hardware than writing games in Haskell .
For people who only read the beginnings of articles , let me say this up front : Regurgitating the opinion that functional programming ( or any technology ) is superior does absolutely nothing .
That 's a road of endless conjecture and advocacy .
One day you 'll realize you 've been advocating something for ten years without having any substantial experience in it .
If you think a particular technology shows promise , then get in there and figure it out .
The rest of this entry is about what I learned by writing some retro-style games in Erlang .
The divide between imperative and functional languages , in terms of thinking about and writing code , is much smaller than I once thought it was .
It is easy to accidentally introduce side - effects and sequencing problems into purely functional code .
It is easy to write spaghetti code , where the entanglement comes from threading data through functions rather than unstructured flow of control .
There 's mental effort involved in avoiding these problems , just as there is when programming in any language .
Not being able to re-use names for values in functions sometimes led to awkward code .
I could have said " not being able to destructively update local variables ... " but that would show a lack of understanding that local " variables " are just names for things , not storage locations .
For example , the initial position of an object is passed in as " Pos . "
I use it to create a new position , called " NewPos . "
Sometimes , because it was the most straightforward approach , I 'd end up with another value called " NewPos2 " ( which I will agree is a horrible name ) .
Then I 'd find myself referring to " NewPos " when I meant " NewPos2 . "
If the need arose to shuffle the logic around a bit , then it took care to manually rename these values without introducing errors .
It would have been much nicer to create the new position and say " I 'm repurposing the name ' Pos ' " to refer to this new position .
The lack of a simple dictionary type was the most significant hindrance .
This is where I found myself longing for the basic features of Perl , Python , Ruby -- pretty much any common language .
The ugliness of Erlang records has been well - documented , but syntax alone is not a reason to avoid them .
The real problem is that records are brittle , exactly like structs in C .
It 's difficult to come up with a record that covers the needs of a dozen game entities with varying behaviors .
They all have some common data , like an X/Y position , but some have special flags , some use velocities and acceleration values instead of simple motion , some need references to other entities , and so on .
I could either make a big generic record that works for everything ( and keep adding fields as new cases arise ) or switch to another data structure , such as a property list , that does n't allow pattern matching .
The biggest wins came from symbolic programming and consciously avoiding low - level efficiency .
I spent a lot of time focused on efficient representations of entity states and other data .
The more thought I put into this , the more the code , as a whole , became awkward and unreadable .
Everything started to flow much more nicely when I went down the road of comical inefficiency .
Why use a fixed - size record when I can use a tree ?
Why use bare data types when I can tag them so the code that processes them is easier to read ?
Why transform one value to another when I can instead return a description of how to transform the value ?
Some years ago , John Carmack stated that a current PC was powerful enough to run every arcade game he played when he was growing up -- some 300 or so games -- at the same time .
Yes , there 's a large execution time penalty simply for choosing to write in Erlang instead of C , but it 's nowhere near enough a factor to matter for most game logic , so use that excess to write code that 's clear and beautiful .

The post Sequences , streams , and segments offered an answer to the the question of what ’s missing in the following box :
infinite finite discrete Stream Sequence continuous Function ???
I presented a simple type of function segments , whose representation contains a length ( duration ) and a function .
This type implements most of the usual classes : Monoid , Functor , Zip , and Applicative , as well Comonad , but not Monad .
It also implements a new type class , Segment , which generalizes the list functions length , take , and drop .
The function type is simple and useful in itself .
I believe it can also serve as a semantic foundation for functional reactive programming ( FRP ) , as I ’ll explain in another post .
However , the type has a serious performance problem that makes it impractical for some purposes , including as implementation of FRP .
Fortunately , we can solve the performance problem by adding a simple layer on top of function segments , to get what I ’ll call “ signals ” .
With this new layer , we have an efficient replacement for function segments that implements exactly the same interface with exactly the same semantics .
Pleasantly , the class instances are defined fairly simply in terms of the corresponding instances on function segments .
You can download the code for this post .

The problem with function segments
The type of function segments is defined as follows :
data t :-># a = FS t ( t -> a )
The domain of the function segment is from zero up to but not including the given length .
An efficiency problem becomes apparent when we look at the Monoid instance :
instance ( Ord t , Num t ) => Monoid ( t :-># a ) where mempty = FS 0 ( error " sampling empty 't :-># a ' " ) FS c f `mappend` FS d g = FS ( c + d ) ( t -> if t <= c then f t else g ( t - c ) )
Concatenation ( mappend ) creates a new segment that chooses , for every domain value t , whether to use one function or another .
If the second , then t must be shifted backward , since the function is being shifted forward .
This implementation would be fine if we use mappend just on simple segments .
Once we get started , however , we ’ll want to concatenate lots & lots of segments .
In FRP , time - varying values go through many phases ( segments ) as time progresses .
Each quantity is described by a single “ behavior ” ( sometimes called a “ signal ” ) with many , and often infinitely many , phases .
Imagine an infinite tree of concatenations , which is typical for FRP behaviors .
At every moment , one phase is active .
Every sampling must recursively discover the active phase and the accumulated domain translation ( from successive subtractions ) to apply when sampling that phase .
Quite commonly , concatenation trees get progressively deeper on the right ( larger t values ) .
In that case , sampling will get slower and slower with time .
I like to refer to these progressive slow - downs as “ time leaks ” .
There is also a serious space leak , since all of the durations and functions that go into a composed segment will be retained .
Sequences of segments
The problem above can be solved with a simple representation change .
Instead of combining functions into functions , just keep a list of simple function segments .
-- | Signal indexed by t with values of type a. newtype t :-> a = S { unS :: [t :-># a ] }
I ’ll restrict in function segments to be non-empty , to keep the rest of the implementation simple and efficient .
This new representation allows for efficient monotonic sampling of signals .
As old segments are passed up , they can be dropped .
What does it mean ?
There ’s one central question for me in defining any data type :
What does it mean ?
The meaning I ’ll take for signals is function segments .
This interpretation is made precise in a function that maps from the type to the model ( meaning ) .
In this case , simply concatenate all of the function segments :
meaning :: ( Ord t , Num t ) => ( t :-> a ) -> ( t :-># a ) meaning = mconcat .
unS
Specifying the meaning of a type gives users a working model , and it defines correctness of implementation .
It also tells me what class instances to implement and tells users what instances to expect .
If a type ’s meaning implements a class then I want the type to as well .
Moreover , the type ’s intances have to agree with the model ’s instances .
I ’ve described this latter principle in Simplifying semantics with type class morphisms and some other posts .
Higher - order wrappers
To keep the code below short and clear , I ’ll use some functions for adding and removing the newtype wrappers .
These higher - order function apply functions inside of ( :->) representations :
inS :: ( [s :-># a ] -> [t :-># b ] ) -> ((s :-> a ) -> ( t :-> b ) ) inS2 :: ( [s :-># a ] -> [t :-># b ] -> [ u :-># c ] ) -> ((s :-> a ) -> ( t :-> b ) -> ( u :-> c ) )
Using the trick described in Prettier functions for wrapping and wrapping , the definitions are simpler than the types :
inS = result S . argument unS inS2 = result inS . argument unS
Functor
The Functor instance applies a given function inside the function segments inside the lists :
instance Functor ( ( :->) t ) where fmap h ( S ss ) = S ( fmap ( fmap h ) ss )
Or , in the style of Semantic editor combinators ,
instance Functor ( ( :->) t ) where fmap = inS . fmap .
fmap
Why this definition ?
Because it is correct with respect to the semantic model , i.e. , the meaning of fmap is fmap of the meaning , i.e. ,
meaning .
fmap h == fmap h .
meaning
which is to say that the following diagram commutes :
Proof :
meaning .
fmap h == {- fmap definition -} meaning .
S . fmap ( fmap h ) .
unS == {- meaning definition -} mconcat .
unS . S . fmap ( fmap h ) .
unS == {- unS and S are inverses -} mconcat .
fmap ( fmap h ) .
unS == {- fmap h distributes over mappend -} fmap h .
mconcat .
unS == {- meaning definition -} fmap .
meaning
Applicative and Zip
Again , the meaning functions tells us what the Applicative instance has to mean .
We only get to choose how to implement that meaning correctly .
The Applicative morphism properties :
meaning ( pure a ) == pure a meaning ( bf <*> bx ) == meaning bf <*> meaning bx
Our Applicative instance has a definition similar in simplicity and style to the Functor instance , assuming a worker function appl for ( <*> ) :
instance ( Ord t , Num t , Bounded t ) => Applicative ( ( :->) t ) where pure = S . pure . pure ( <*>) = in S2 appl appl :: ( Ord t , Num t , Bounded t ) => [t :-># ( a -> b ) ] -> [t :-># a ] -> [t :-># b]
This worker function is somewhat intricate .
At least my implementation of it is , and perhaps there ’s a simpler one .
Again , the meaning functions tells us what the Applicative instance has to mean .
We only get to choose how to implement that meaning correctly .
First , if either segment list runs out , the combination runs out ( because the same is true for the meaning of signals ) .
[ ] `appl` _ = [ ] _ `appl` [ ] = [ ]
If neither segment list is empty , open up the first segment .
Split the longer segment into a prefix that matches the shorter segment , and combine the two segments with ( <*> ) ( on function segments ) .
Toss the left - over piece back in its list , and continue .
( fs:fss ' ) `appl` ( xs:xss ' ) | fd == xd = ( fs <*> xs ) : ( fss ' `appl` xss ' ) | fd < xd = ( fs <*> xs ' ) : ( fss ' `appl` ( xs ' ' : xss ' ) ) | otherwise = ( fs ' <*> xs ) : ( ( fs ' ' : fss ' ) `appl` xss ' ) where fd = length fs xd = length xs ( fs ' , fs ' ' ) = splitAt xd fs ( xs ' , xs ' ' ) = splitAt fd xs
A Zip instance is easy as always with applicative functors :
instance ( Ord t , Num t , Bounded t ) => Zip ( ( :->) t) where zip = lift A2 ( , )
Monoid
The Monoid instance :
instance Monoid ( t :-> a ) where mempty = S [ ]
S xss `mappend` S yss = S ( xss ++ yss )
Correctness follows from properties of mconcat ( as used in the meaning function ) .
We ’re really just using the Monoid instance for the underlying representation , i.e. ,
instance Monoid ( t :-> a ) where mempty =
S mempty mappend = inS2 mappend
Segment
The Segment class has length , take and drop .
It ’s handy to include also null and splitAt , both modeled after their counterparts on lists .
The new & improved Segment class :
class Segment seg dur | seg -> dur where null :: seg ->
Bool length :: seg -> dur take :: dur -> seg -> seg drop :: dur -> seg -> seg splitAt :: dur -> seg -> ( seg , seg ) --
Defaults : splitAt d s = ( take d s , drop d s ) take d s = fst ( splitAt d s ) drop d s = snd ( splitAt d s )
If we wanted to require dur to be numeric , we could add a default for null as well .
This default could be quite expensive in some cases .
( In the style of Semantic editor combinators , take = ( result.result ) fst splitAt , and similarly for drop . )
The null and length definitions are simple , following from to properties of mconcat .
instance ( Ord t , Num t ) => Segment ( t :-> a ) t where null ( S xss ) = null xss length ( S xss ) = sum ( length < $> xss ) ...
The null case says that the signal is empty exactly when there are no function segments .
This simple definition relies on our restriction to non-empty function segments .
If we drop that restriction , we ’d have to check that every segment is empty :
-- Alternative definition null ( S xss ) = all null xss
The length is just the sum of the lengths .
The tricky piece is splitAt ( used to define both take and drop ) , which must assemble segments to satisfy the requested prefix length .
The last segment used might have to get split into two , with one part going into the prefix and one to the suffix .
splitAt _ ( S [ ] ) = ( mempty , mempty ) splitAt d b | d <= 0 = ( mempty , b ) splitAt d ( S ( xs:xss ' ) ) = case ( d `compare` xd ) of EQ -> ( S [ xs ] , S xss ' ) LT -> let ( xs ' , xs ' ' ) = splitAt d xs in ( S [ xs ' ] , S ( xs ' ' : xss ' ) ) GT -> let ( S uss , suffix ) = splitAt ( d - xd ) ( S xss ' ) in ( S ( xs:uss ) , suffix ) where xd = length xs
Copointed and Comonad
To extract an element from a signal , extract an element from its first function segment .
Awkwardly , extraction will fail ( produce ⊥ / error ) when the signal is empty .
instance Num t => Copointed ( ( :->) t) where extract ( S [ ] ) = error " extract : empty S " extract ( S ( xs : _ ) ) = extract xs
I ’ve exploited our restriction to non-empty function segments .
Otherwise , extract would have to skip past the empty ones :
-- Alternative definition instance Num t => Copointed ( ( :->) t) where extract ( S [ ] ) = error " extract : empty S " extract ( S ( xs:xss ' ) ) | null xs = extract ( S xss ' ) | otherwise = extract xs
The error / ⊥ in this definition is dicey , as is the one for function segments .
If we allow the same abuse in order to define a list Copointed , we can get an alternative to the first definition that is prettier but gives a less helpful error message :
instance Num t => Copointed ( ( :->) t ) where extract = extract .
extract . unS
See the closing remarks for more about this diciness .
Finally , we have Comonad , with its duplicate method .
duplicate :: ( t :-> a ) -> ( t :-> ( t :-> a ) )
I get confused with wrapping and unwrapping , so let ’s separate the definition into a packaging part and a content part .
instance ( Ord t , Num t ) => Comonad ( ( :->) t ) where duplicate = fmap S . inS dup
with content part :
dup :: ( Ord t , Num t ) => [t :-># a ] -> [t :-># [t :-># a ] ]
The helper function , dup , takes each function segment and prepends each of its tails onto the remaining list of segments .
If the segment list is empty , then it has only one tail , also empty .
dup [ ] = [ ] dup ( xs:xss ' ) = ( ( : xss ' ) < $> duplicate xs ) : dup xss '
Closing remarks
The definitions above use the function segment type only through its type class interfaces , and so can all of them can be generalized .
Several definitions rely on the Segment instance , but otherwise , each method for the composite type relies on the corresponding method for the underlying segment type .
( For instance , fmap uses fmap , ( <*>) uses ( <*>) , Segment uses Segment , etc. )
This generality lets us replace function segments with more efficient representations , e.g. , doing constant propagation , as in Reactive .
We can also generalize from lists in the definitions above .
Even without concatenation , function segments can become expensive when drop is repeatedly applied , because function shifts accumulate ( e.g. , f . (+ 0.01 ) . (+ 0.01 ) .... ) .
A more drop - friendly representation for function segments would be a function and an offset .
Successive drops would add offsets , and extract would always apply the function to its offset .
This representation is similar to the FunArg comonad , mentioned in The Essence of Dataflow Programming ( Section 5.2 ) .
The list - of - segments representation enables efficient monotonic sampling , simply by dropping after each sample .
A variation is to use a list zipper instead of a list .
Then non-monotonic sampling will be efficient as long as successive samplings are for nearby domain values .
Switching to multi-directional representation would lose the space efficiency of unidirectional representations .
The latter work well with lazy evaluation , often running in constant space , because old values are recycled while new values are getting evaluated .
Still another variation is to use a binary tree instead of a list , to avoid the list append in the Monoid instance for ( t :-> a ) .
A tree zipper would allow non-monotonic sampling .
Sufficient care in data structure design could perhaps yield efficient random access .
There ’s a tension between the Copointed and Monoid interfaces .
Copointed has extract , and Monoid has mempty , so what is the value of extract mempty ?
Given that Copointed is parameterized over arbitrary types , the only possible answer seems to be ⊥ ( as in the use of error above ) .
I do n’t know if the comonad laws can all hold for possibly - empty function segments or for possibly - empty signals .
I ’m grateful to Edward Kmett for helping me understand this conflict .
He suggested using two coordinated types , one possibly - empty ( a monoid ) and the other non-empty ( a comonad ) .
I ’m curious to see whether that idea works out .

Asthma inhalers becoming eco-friendly at a cost
Last warning : Asthma inhalers go green on Dec. 31 , forcing patients still using the old - fashioned kind to make a pricey and even confusing switch .
The medicine inside these rescue inhalers - the albuterol that quickly opens airways during an asthma attack - is n't changing .
But the chemicals used to propel that drug into your lungs are .
No more chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , that damage Earth 's protective ozone layer .
By year 's end , all albuterol inhalers must be powered by the more eco-friendly chemical HFA , or hydrofluoroalkane .
The down side :
The new inhalers cost more , $ 30 to $ 60 compared with as little as $ 5 or $ 10 for the disappearing generic CFC inhalers .
And patients face a learning curve .
HFA inhalers must be used differently from the old - fashioned kind .
The medicine feels and tastes different , sometimes alarming new users despite doctors ' assurances that it works just as well .
" There 's still significant confusion , " says Dr. Harvey Leo of the University of Michigan 's C.S. Mott Children 's Hospital .
" Patients will tell you , ' I do n't feel the puff anymore . ' "
Calls from parents unsure how to use the new inhalers , or even what they are , have increased in the past two months as more drugstores run out of CFC - powered inhalers and automatically switch people who'd been expecting a refill .
Lung specialists have spent the past year helping many of the nation 's 20 million asthma patients - as well as millions of emphysema sufferers who also use albuterol to ease breathing - to switch to the new device .
But industry figures show that in mid-November , 20 percent of all albuterol prescriptions still were being filled with CFC versions .
Albuterol inhalers are for emergencies , for quick relief of wheezing .
Patients also need daily medication to control their asthma and prevent flareups .
The Guardian reports : Private firm may track all email and calls , quoting Sir Ken Macdonald , the recently retired Director of Public Prosecutions :
Private firm may track all email and calls
' Hellhouse ' of personal data will be created , warns former DPP
Alan Travis and Richard Norton - Taylor
The Guardian , Wednesday 31 December 2008
The private sector will be asked to manage and run a communications database that will keep track of everyone 's calls , emails , texts and internet use under a key option contained in a consultation paper to be published next month by Jacqui Smith , the home secretary .
A cabinet decision to put the management of the multibillion pound database of all UK communications traffic into private hands would be accompanied by tougher legal safeguards to guarantee against leaks and accidental data losses .
[...]
" Authorisations for access might be written into statute .
The most senior ministers and officials might be designated as scrutineers .
But none of this means anything , " said Macdonald .
" All history tells us that reassurances like these are worthless in the long run .
In the first security crisis the locks would loosen . "
[...]
Macdonald , who left his post as DPP in October , told the Guardian : " The tendency of the state to seek ever more powers of surveillance over its citizens may be driven by protective zeal .
But the notion of total security is a paranoid fantasy which would destroy everything that makes living worthwhile .
We must avoid surrendering our freedom as autonomous human beings to such an ugly future .
We should make judgments that are compatible with our status as free people . "
Maintaining the capacity to intercept suspicious communications was critical in an increasingly complex world , he said .
" It is a process which can save lives and bring criminals to justice .
But no other country is considering such a drastic step .
This database would be an unimaginable hell - house of personal private information , " he said .
" It would be a complete readout of every citizen 's life in the most intimate and demeaning detail .
No government of any colour is to be trusted with such a roadmap to our souls . "
ChinesChinese Premier Wen Jiabao ( L ) speaks while German Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on during a news conference in Berlin Jan. 29 , 2009 .
( Xinhua / Lan Hongguang )
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao addresses the Fifth Chinese - German Forum for Economic and Technological Cooperation in Berlin , Jan. 29 , 2009 . ( Xinhua / Yao Dawei )
BERLIN , Jan. 29 ( Xinhua ) -- China and Germany have vowed to make joint efforts to stabilize the global economy amid the ongoing financial and economic crisis , said a joint statement issued Thursday .
The cooperation between China and Germany , the world 's two major export - driven economies , is of special significance for the world 's efforts to tackle the financial downturn , said the statement released after visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao 's meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
The two sides agreed to strengthen dialogue on economic and trade , currency and fiscal policies and pledged to support each other on their economic stimulus plans based on their own situations , it said .
China and Germany have agreed to enhance their comprehensive strategic partnership and cooperation in jointly dealing with the global economic crisis , Wen told a press conference following his meeting with Merkel .
The strengthened Sino - German cooperation is of special significance in the context of the current world economic downturn , said Wen .
The two nations should strengthen cooperation in various fields and press ahead with their comprehensive strategic partnership , which bears global responsibility amid an ailing global economy , the Chinese premier added .
Echoing
Wen 's remarks on bilateral cooperation , Merkel said his visit has further promoted German - Chinese cooperation in such fields as politics , economy and culture .
Germany is ready to promote bilateral cooperation in improving energy efficiency , environmental protection and intellectual property protection , she said .
Merkel also called on the two nations to further enhance bilateral trade and economic relations despite the harsh economic environment .
According to the joint statement , both nations will also seek to broaden their cooperation and inject new impulse into the economic growth , especially on such fields as climate change , infrastructure construction , transportation and logistics , financial services , and information technology , it noted .
The two nations will continue to strengthen cooperation , especially in the sector of the innovative technology through such mechanism as the China - Germany joint commission for economic cooperation and the Sino - German economic and technical cooperation forum , it said .
Meanwhile , the two nations also agreed to encourage bilateral cooperation between small and medium - sized enterprises ( SMEs ) pledging to introduce supportive measures for SMEs activities in investment , financing , taxing and trade , it added .
The two sides also stressed the importance of curbing trade protectionism , saying they will oppose trade and investment protectionism in whatever forms .
They also pledged to implement the consensus reached in the G20 Washington Summit in efforts to push forward the reform of global financial system .
At a forum on Sino - German economic and technical cooperation on Thursday , Wen proposed that in addition to trade in goods , the two sides should expand cooperation in such service sectors as banking , insurance , telecommunications , logistics .
European enterprises can absolutely increase their exports of advanced technical equipment , which would overcome the difficulties they are facing currently , but also meet the demand from the Chinese market , said Wen .
The Chinese government welcomes German enterprises to play a more active role in promoting technical innovation , upgrading industrial structure , and fostering development coordination in various regions in China .
Chinese companies are also encouraged to build manufacturing bases , marketing network , and research institutions , said the premier .
Also on Thursday , China and Germany signed six deals , including a memorandum of understanding on the transfer from Germany of parts of the core technologies for the maglev railway projects in China .
Other agreements cover cooperation in climate protection , the car industry , construction of Chinese ecological city Xuzhou , and exchanges between the museums of the two countries .
Germany is the second leg of Wen's European tour after Switzerland , where he attended the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) .
The week - long trip will also take him to the European Union headquarters in Brussels , Spain and Britain .

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered the Guantanamo Bay military prison closed within one year and established a cabinet - level task force to determine what to do with the remaining 245 detainees held at the facility .
Obama signed the executive order on Guantanamo following meetings Thursday morning with a group of former military officers who have been urging him to shut down the facility .
" Guantanamo will be closed no later than one year from now , " Obama said , adding that the move will be carried out " consistent with national security . "
The decision to shut the controversial military camp adds new pressure on Ottawa to repatriate 22 - year - old Omar Khadr , the only remaining Canadian at Guantanamo .
Khadr has spent more than six years in detention at the prison awaiting trial on charges of terrorism and murdering a U.S. special forces soldier .
All legal proceedings against him — and all other Guantanamo detainees — were halted for 120 days as the new U.S. administration reviews their cases .
" The message we are sending around the world is that the United States intends to prosecute the ongoing struggle against violence and terrorism ... and we are going to do so in a manner consistent with our values and our ideals , " Obama said .
" We are not going to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals . "
Obama said a task force , including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Defence Secretary Robert Gates , the director of the CIA , the director of national intelligence and the new U.S. attorney general will come up with recommendations on how to deal with the Guantanamo detainees .
Obama 's order on Guantanamo came in tandem with an order banning the Central Intelligence Agency from using coercive interrogation methods and requiring agents instead to follow military rules when questioning terror suspects .
Obama said the interrogation order will " ensure compliance with the treaty obligations of the United States , including the Geneva Convention . "
It means " any interrogations taking place are going to have to abide by the army field manual , " he said , adding that " the rule that says we do n't torture , but that we can still obtain the intelligence we need . "

My mouth watered in anticipation as the waiter placed a large bamboo steamer in front of us .
Inside , nestled on top of Napa cabbage leaves were ten succulent little soup dumplings waiting for me to eat up .
Known as Xiao Long Bao , or Shanghai steamed dumplings , these labor - intensive dumplings of love are a favorite among foodies , and for good reason .
Once you bite through the thin , smooth skin , your mouth is flooded with a shock of hot , rich , broth and a savory pork filling .
Shanghai Dumpling
King ’s xiao long baos are appropriately delicate , juicy , and satisfying .
The swift churning out of their house specialty helps to ensure that you will get a fresh batch out of the steamer .
Smaller than those I ’ve previously encountered , I was at first disappointed with their diminutive size , but I quickly realized the genius behind it .
I could pop the whole dumpling in my mouth and experience the explosion of intensely tasty , hot soup without wasting a single drop .
The smaller size also provides a strategic health benefit .
The dumplings are able to cool faster , effectively preventing the common case of burning one ’s mouth in the excitement of getting XLBs into one ’s tummy .
Well played , Dumpling King , well played .
The Hangzhou Crab and Pork Steamed Dumplings similarly contained flavorful soup , but alas , were not as juicy .
I was also left wishing the filling had more substantial amounts of crab in it .
The bit of crab roe on top added a nice touch of color though ( I’m a sucker for presentation ) .
A few dollars more expensive than the standard pork XLB – and with a few less pieces given – I would rather have had another steamer of the classic version .
In fact , an entire meal of just xiao long bao would be totally acceptable , and probably preferable .
The Scallion Pancakes sprinkled with sesame seeds were a miss .
They were too thick and not full enough of the green onion flavor I expected .
The Beef Chow Mein was respectable , with tenderized and well - seasoned meat , but the dish was nothing spectacular .
And the Spicy Chive and Pork Dumplings were ok , although again , they did n’t hold a candle to the xiao long bao .
The thicker skin of these boiled dumplings had a nice balance of chewiness and tenderness though , and they were served with an array of fragrant accoutrements .
Fried garlic , scallions , sesame seeds , and a pool of tangy , spicy sauce .
I was pleasantly surprised that the fiery looking chili oil was not too hot .
Be forewarned though , this is an oily dish .
Towards the end of the meal , a server came around to each table offering plates of Egg Puffs – huge sugar - dusted balls of fried temptation .
It was ambiguous as to whether these were complimentary … it seemed like every table got one .
No , not free .
Just a brilliant marketing ploy to make sure everyone sees these golden beauties .
Who could refuse freshly fried dough covered in exorbitant amounts of sugar , dangling right before your nose ?
Clearly not me .
I would have never thought to order these off the menu , so I ’m glad I ’m a sucker for direct marketing .
These little bombs were delightfully airy and the texture was more like light eggy custard than dough .
The owners are hoping to expand to another location in the city in the near future .
Fingers crossed it happens soon .
More xiao long baos for all !
*****
Update ( February 2013 ) : SDK still reigns supreme in my book .
I have since returned so many times to this beloved hole in the wall that I thought this review ( from way back in 2009 ) was in sore need of an update .
The regular pork Xiao Long Bao ( aka Shanghai Steamed Dumplings ) are still my favorite .
I could seriously eat an entire meal of just these soup dumplings .
SDK has switched from using cabbage leaves on the bottom of the steamers to parchment paper — a smart move because I find that it helps the delicate dumplings stay intact as you transfer them from steamer to spoon .
Next up on our regular order are the Green Beans .
I do n’t know how they do it , but these are the best green beans I ’ve ever had .
My previous disappointment with the Scallion Pancakes was quickly forgotten as soon as I discovered the Shanghai Style Crispy Salt Pancakes .
With a super crispy fried exterior and creamy molten center of cabbage and onions , they are the like the scallion pancake ’s better looking , more refined and charming older brother .
Other must - try items : Pan -Fried Pork Buns ( fluffy white bun , pork meatball center , pan- fried crispy crust ) , Pot Stickers ( a classic that is exceptional here ) , the Lion ’s Head Meatballs ( ginormous , not too dense , and swimming in gravy — perfect with a side of rice ) .
And of course , the Egg Puffs .
You ’ll find room for these even if you ’re filled to the brim with dumplings .
Besides , they ’re mostly air , right ?
Right …

Jurors would have convicted Lori Drew on three felony counts for unauthorized access to MySpace 's computer system if they had been given the evidence from prosecutors , the jury forewoman in the Drew trial said Monday .
They had to convict her of misdemeanors , instead , given what they had to work with .
" Trust me , I was so for this woman going away for 20 years , " Valentina Kunasz told Threat Level .
" However , on the harsher felony charge , it was very hard to find her guilty on the specific [ evidence ] given to us . "
Kunasz said despite all the debate outside the courtroom about the prosecution 's use of an anti-hacking statute to charge Drew for violating a website 's terms of service , jurors never considered whether the statute was appropriate .
However , she said she agrees with the idea that users who violate a website 's terms of service should be prosecuted .
" The thing that really bothered me was that [ Drew 's ] attorney kept claiming that nobody reads the terms of service , " she said .
" I always read the terms of service ....
If you choose to be lazy and not go through that entire agreement or contract of agreement , then absolutely you should be held liable . "
Should they be punished with a federal prison sentence ?
" I guess that 's an option for debate , " Kunasz said .
" When it 's gross circumstances of someone killing themselves .... "
Kunasz , a 25 - year - old resident of Long Beach , California , who volunteered to be forewoman , said the emotional case was very difficult to handle .
" This was a very serious subject for every single one of us .
We wanted to make sure that we came to the right decision and that there was no question on anything , " she said .
With regard to the three felony charges accusing Drew of obtaining illegal access to MySpace 's computers , jurors acquitted Drew unanimously because they felt the evidence prosecutors presented did n't rise to the level of maliciousness required to convict Drew .
To find her guilty on felony charges they would have had to find that Drew intentionally accessed MySpace 's computers to commit a tortious act – that is , to intentionally inflict emotional distress on 13 - year - old Megan Meier , who subsequently committed suicide .
The jurors instead convicted Drew on three counts of a lesser misdemeanor charge for simply accessing MySpace 's computer system to obtain information about and from Megan .
Drew , of O'Fallon , Missouri , was charged with one felony count of conspiracy and three felony counts of unauthorized computer access for helping create a fake MySpace account for a non-existent 16 - year - old boy named " Josh Evans " to woo Megan and determine if Megan was spreading rumors about Drew 's then - 13 - year - old daughter Sarah .
She faced up to 20 years in prison for the four charges .
According to testimony during the trial , Ashley Grills , a then - 18 - year - old employee of Drew , created the " Josh Evans " account with Drew 's approval and conducted most of the communication between " Josh " and Megan .
After " Josh " sent Megan a final message in October 2006 telling her " the world would be a better place without you , " Megan hanged herself in her bedroom .
Kunasz said jurors were given printouts of three conversations between Megan and " Josh " as evidence of Drew 's three alleged felony violations .
But Kunasz said the final message that Megan received was n't among the printouts , and the three that jurors did receive were n't malicious .
" They were 'oh you 're so hot , ' ' I love you ' and who - loves - who messages , " she said .
" It was n't something that to me personally – and I think the rest of the jury felt the same way – was malicious in mind . "
Kunasz said jurors were not allowed to take into account the last message sent to Megan , because the message was not sent through MySpace .
Ashley Grills testified that she sent the message through American Online 's instant messaging service .
To find Drew guilty of a felony or misdemeanor , the correspondence had to involve interstate communication , but prosecutors never introduced evidence discussing whether the final AOL message involved interstate communication .
The AOL message also would not have been covered by MySpace 's terms of service , which were at the core of the case against Drew , hence the message was not included in the juror 's evidence packet .
Testimony did establish , however , that the three messages jurors saw that were sent through MySpace were interstate communications because they traveled from the Drew computer in Missouri through MySpace 's servers in Los Angeles County .
" The last message was a huge piece of evidence , " Kunasz said , " but we had no way of knowing whether it was interstate or not .
I honestly think that if they gave us a little more solid , hatred - type e-mails or MySpace messages it would have been a lot easier [ to convict her ] . "
Kunasz also said that eight jurors were ready to convict Drew of a fourth felony count for conspiracy but were deadlocked by four jurors who did n't think Drew committed a tortious act .
" The tortious thing was a huge issue for us , " Kunasz said .
" The definition of ' tortious ' was the first thing on the first day that we all sat there and thought about for an hour . "
They read carefully through jury instructions from the court and even asked Judge George
Wu for clarification on the definition of " tortious " before they finally came to a consensus definition .
Unlike the other three felony counts , the conspiracy charge did n't rely on specific messages to obtain a conviction .
Instead , it was based on the case as a whole – testimony and evidence .
Based on all of this , eight jurors felt that Drew 's behavior on the conspiracy charge was a form of cyberbullying that rose to the level of tortious or malicious behavior due to Megan 's mental state .
Megan 's mother and even Drew 's daughter Sarah testified that Megan was on medication for depression and was seeing a psychiatrist .
They also said Megan expressed suicidal thoughts and had scratched her wrists at one point , suggesting a suicide attempt .
" We felt that ... knowing that she 's got mental stuff going on , was enough to turn what normally would n’t be tortious into tortious or malicious , " Kunasz said .
" And the fact that this 47 - year - old woman is participating – whether it be physically or just egging them on verbally – to me something was very off .
What they were trying to do as a whole in the long - run was humiliate this girl , make her feel like a piece of [ dirt ] , and make her feel sad ....
They were intentionally trying to hurt her . "
But four jurors felt that because Megan and Sarah Drew had a opened a MySpace account months earlier to meet boys , that Megan was emotionally functional and should have known what she was getting herself into by communicating with " Josh . "
She should have been prepared to be rejected by " Josh . "
After voting on the conspiracy count nine times , the four jurors could n't be persuaded to convict Drew of the felony .
Because the jurors could not agree on acquitting her of the felony either , they could n't find her guilty of a lesser misdemeanor charge and , therefore , ended in a deadlock on that count .
Kunasz said because the testimony of so many witnesses contradicted each other it was hard to determine who did what with the " Josh Evans " account .
She found the testimony of Ashley Grills and Sara Drew to be non-credible and said it as " very obvious " that Sarah Drew was coached extensively , particularly when the 16 - year - old used the phrase " after the fact " several times in testifying about what her mother knew and when she knew it .
Kunasz said all the jurors picked up on the phrase .
" It was too grown - up for a 16 - year - old ; even an 18 - year - old would not say that over and over again , " Kunasz said , adding that Drew 's testimony was " very detrimental " to the defense .
" It was a joke to me .
And between her and Ashley 's testimony , it was really hard to believe anything that either one said . "
Nonetheless , Kunasz said Lori Drew bore ultimate responsibility because she should have known better and put an end to the ruse .
" It was so very childish ; so very pathetic , " Kunasz said .
" This was Sarah 's parent , her guardian .
She could have done quite a few things to stop it , and she chose not to .
And I think she got kind of a rise out of doing this to another person and that bothers me , it really irks me . "
Kunasz said she 's found it difficult to shake the case .
" I still have dreams about the testimony , " she said .
Right before the court clerk read the jury 's verdict last week , Kunasz had glanced toward the gallery at Tina Meier , Megan 's mother , as if to convey a message to her .
I asked what she 'd meant to say to Meier .
" I honestly wanted to reach out to this woman and give her a hug and tell her I 'm sorry – sorry for what she went through and sorry for what she felt and sorry for losing her child .
I wanted to say ' I understand what happened to you , ' and we did everything in our power within the law to give this woman the justice that should have been served upon her .
The reason I looked at Tina was because I felt like I did n’t serve her the justice she was looking for . "
Drew 's attorneys will be seeking a re-trial on the three misdemeanor counts but are awaiting a decision from U.S. District Judge George
Wu who can decide to acquit Drew .
If Wu lets the verdict stand , Drew 's lawyers plan to appeal the case to the 9th Circuit Court .
Legal experts say the court is likely to overturn the jury 's verdict on grounds that prosecutors overstepped in using the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act to criminally charge a contract breach , which is normally a civil violation .

Tivo made a name for itself with a set - top box that performed magic : at the touch of a remote you could pause the present , slip into the past or leap over ads into the future .
Now , the future of the company which defined the DVR is likely to depend on dumping the magic box altogether .
The eleven - year - old DVR company was so universally loved on its entrance into the marketplace that it got to date a character from " Sex and the City . "
And yet Tivo ’s stock has been languishing at or below $ 6 for months , it has only a 10 percent share of the DVR market and its market cap ( $ 619 million ) is so low that any one of our nation ’s beloved moguls could buy the company for some loose pocket change .
Tivo , a company known for innovation and user satisfaction , has yet to prove its dominance in the marketplace .
Under Tivo ’s new CEO Tom Rogers , the company has been hard at work coming up with advertising solutions , partnering with cable companies and bringing new features and content options to subscribers .
Still , only 3.6 million of the nation ’s 36.2 million DVR users in the United States are willing to fork over $ 300 for three years of Tivo service .
Why ?
Because the Tivo box is dying .
Until recently , Tivo was spending over $ 300 per user on subscriber acquisition ( through hardware discounts , sales and marketing , retail rebates and incentives ) — barely breaking even when new customers purchased a Tivo box .
" That ’s one of the reason why the standalone business has so many flaws , ” says Mark Harding , an analyst at Maxim Group .
” Adding another device to the entertainment hub is not what people want to do . ”
But the small penetration of Tivo boxes in American households is surprising compared to the high levels of customer satisfaction that Tivo routinely receives .
Ten years ago , Tivo was seen as a game changer : it empowered viewers , who swooned over the ability to pause and fast - forward through commercials , and stoked fears among network executives about delivering eyeballs to advertisers .
But TiVo has repeatedly failed to gain traction in the marketplace even though it has been hard at work creating innovative ad solutions and coming up with ways to help advertisers and networks recoup ad dollars .
Tivo sells advertising units that play when users fast - forward through commercial breaks and pause video content .
But not many television users have seen these things , and there ’s the rub .
" Advertisers are n’t buying it because it is n’t at scale , " said one executive in the TV advertising space .
" That ’s not interesting .
Come back when you can do it at scale . ”
The way to change that , of course , is through strategic partnerships , which has been a focus at Tivo of late .
This year , they announced that Tivo subscribers would have access to content from YouTube , Amazon ’s Unbox , Rhapsody and Jaman .
Thursday they announced that subscribers would have access to the Netflix streaming media library of 12,000 movies and TV shows .
“ We want to bring our Tivo - friendly menu — everything we ’re known for in making television available – to content that has n’t been available on the TV for consumers ” says Tara Maitra , Vice President of Content Services at Tivo .
But Tivo still has a long way to go if it wants to entice subscribers to pay for content that can often be found online .
Daniel Taylor , an analyst at Yankee Group , says that the " TV - Killer " may find itself facing irrelevance long before television networks have to face up to the problem :
“ DVR and video on demand are struggling for relevance today .
The challenge that Tivo faces — the challenge that any device - based service faces — is how they ’re going to address user behavior .
For every one person who plans ahead to tape shows they ’ll miss , there are nine other that want to go online now that they ’ve missed it . ”
But that ’s why Tivo is moving away from pushing stand alone boxes and towards offering TiVo content as an additional option to cable subscribers .
“ I look at this way , ” says Maitra .
“ Is Tivo continuing to offer the best experience for consuming TV ?
Are we continuing to find the best ways of giving you all the content you want to watch at your fingertips ?
If so , then I think we ’re doing OK . ”
With movies on demand from Amazon and Netflix , Tivo has already increased its reach and hopes to continue offering content from online sources like YouTube to bring the content users want to television screens .
According to Harding , the future of Tivo exists in licensing agreements with the cable companies : " It ’s easier to sell consumers on an upgrade to the Tivo interface on an existing cable company provided DVR .
It ’s also a lot more profitable . "
If Tivo can keep providing the goods that users want to see , its signature box may go away , but the brand has a strong chance of survival .

ABBOTSFORD , B.C. --
Nearly 60,000 turkeys from a B.C. farm will be killed as early as Monday after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed a positive test result for avian flu on the weekend .
A spokesman for the federal agency said agricultural experts were spending Sunday preparing for the cull which would likely take place Monday or Tuesday .
" Today we 're prepping , sealing up barns for the gas that sort of thing , " said Mark Clarke , adding that gas was the method that would be used to kill the turkeys .
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said all birds on the infected premises will be humanely euthanized and disposed of , in accordance with provincial environmental regulations and internationally accepted disease - control guidelines .
Clarke said it will another five days before further testing to confirm pathogenicity and precise subtype and virus strain will be completed .
The agency confirmed the presence of H5 avian flu virus on Saturday after initial tests showed the turkeys from E&H Farms , in Abbotsford , B.C. , were infected .
Abbotsford is about 70 kilometres southeast of Vancouver , near the U.S. border .
" Once all birds have been removed , the CFIA will oversee the cleaning and disinfection of the barns , vehicles , equipment and tools to eliminate any infectious material that may remain , " the CFIA said in a news release .
The CFIA confirmed the presence of AI strain , which is low - pathogenic .
The term pathogenicity refers to the severity of the illness .
Twenty - two farms within a three - kilometre radius of E&H Farms have been under quarantine since Wednesday night .
Food safety is not at risk due to avian influenza viruses , as long as poultry products are properly handled and cooked thoroughly .
Avian flu rarely affects humans - unless the person has had close contact with infected birds .
" In order to limit any potential virus spread , the CFIA is applying restrictions on the movement of poultry and poultry products within three kilometres of the infected premises , " said the news release .
" The CFIA is relying on all backyard poultry owners to monitor their flocks and immediately report sick or dead birds .
Poultry owners are urged to take an active role in protecting their flocks by employing strict biosecurity measures on their property . "
Any recent movement of birds , bird products and equipment involving the infected property will be probed by the CFIA , which is also conducting a thorough epidemiological investigation of the farm .
The tests were ordered after a farm worker noticed some of the turkeys were having respiratory problems .
A Ministry of Agriculture spokeswoman said the farm has been diligent about biosecurity .
Initial tests done in Abbotsford showed the H5 strain of the virus , which can become highly pathogenic .
A related virus - H5N1 - has killed about 250 people .
In 2004 , 17 million birds from the Fraser Valley were slaughtered - the largest animal cull in Canadian history .
The virus was never detected in humans .
Farmers have been working to improve biosecurity and communication since the 2004 outbreak .

Newswise —
For many thrill - seekers , extreme ( " x - treme " ) sports can be fun way to get an adrenaline rush during those long winter months .
Recently televised events such as the X Games have led to increased participation in such sports , including downhill ski racing and jumping , snowboarding , snowmobiling , snow biking , and ice climbing .
As part of its commitment to injury prevention , the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ( AAOS ) advises caution before participating in extreme winter sports .
Extreme sports often involve risky stunts , such as trick jumps and flips at high speeds — there can be a high chance of injury for participants .
" Kids watch extreme sporting events on television and they think flying through the air on a snowboard looks easy , " says George Russell , MD , spokesperson for the AAOS .
" They do not see all the practice it takes to do that — and they do n't see how often extreme athletes get injured while learning their stunts . "
While it is difficult to track injuries due to extreme sports specifically : " ¢Snowboarding is the leading cause of winter sports injuries , sending 149,388 people to hospital emergency rooms , doctors ' offices , clinics and other medical settings in 2007 , according to the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission .
" ¢Skiing resulted in 131,454 injuries and snowmobiling caused 34,699 .
The Academy offers the following tips to help prevent injuries from extreme winter sports :
" ¢Cold muscles , tendons and ligaments are more susceptible to injury .
Do some light exercise for at least 3 to 5 minutes , then slowly and gently stretch the muscles to be exercised , holding each stretch for at least 30 seconds .
" ¢Do not try to imitate stunts seen in televised events .
The people in those events — even the X Games , which appear to be less formal than events like the Olympics — are professional athletes with years of training .
If you have children who watch these events , make sure that they understand this .
" ¢Never participate in extreme sports alone .
Many extreme sports enthusiasts have a coach or responsible party overseeing any activity .
Have a partner who can assist you or go for help if you get injured .
" ¢Wear appropriate protective gear , including goggles , helmets , gloves and padding , and make sure equipment is in good working order and used properly .
" ¢Take frequent water breaks to prevent dehydration and overheating .
" ¢Avoid participating in any sport when experiencing pain or exhaustion .
" ¢For warmth and protection , wear several layers of light , loose and water - and wind - resistant clothing .
Layering allows you add and remove clothing to accommodate your body 's constantly changing temperature when outside or in a cold environment such as an indoor ice rink .
" ¢Wear proper footwear that provides warmth and dryness , as well as ample ankle support .
" ¢When falling , try to fall on your side or buttocks .
Roll over naturally , turning your head in the direction of the roll .
" ¢Pay attention to warnings about upcoming storms and severe drops in temperature to ensure safety .

It 's farewell for quite a few months , I fear , as I head off to Africa , Mauritius , Indonesia , New Zealand and the Sea of Cortez to make a documentary about disappearing species .
I shall be out of reach of broadband , mobile phone and even landlines for much of the time .
That will not stop me from taking a suitcase full of cables , chargers , memory cards and connectors , however , and I thought I might , by way of valediction , give you an inventory of what this particular dork packs when he travels .
First of all , should all else fail , I will make sure that there 's at least one of Trevor Baylis 's products in my bag .
Baylis , you may remember , pioneered the wind - up radio .
On the eco - gadget site biggreensmile.com you can find his company 's practical and hardy hand - crankable media players , the latest ( the Eco Media Revolution ) offering radio , video , music , photo , text , phone - charging , memo recording and storage in most of the useful formats and codecs , all for £ 129.99 .
One minute of winding makes for 45 minutes of play , that 's the promise : a big British bargain .
The same site has a Freeloader solar charger for £ 24.95 that will help with juicing up all my gadgets when I 'm too hot and knackered to crank .
I shall also take my iPhone 3G , without which I 'm pretty much an empty vessel these days , but I will bring along a collection of sim cards , too , and my unlocked first generation iPhone , which can run on any network , in case there 's a signal that the official iPhone can't receive .
Because they 're so colourful , pretty and neat , I will also pack one of the new iPod Nanos : they combine the old Nano clickwheel and anodised metal finish with a new - style accelerometer , so you can shake it to shuffle songs and turn it sideways to watch music and flick through album covers .
As for reading , well , I have a Sony eReader , a Kindle and an Iliad , all dedicated electronic book readers , but the fact is , the iPhone has already proved itself ( according to Forbes Magazine ) the most popular ebook reader on the market .
Nearly half a million people have downloaded the free Stanza application for iPhone ( from the iTunes store ) .
Via Stanza files , just about all the classics in prose and poetry can be easily downloaded and read clearly and easily on screen .
You can transfer Kindle and pdf files from your desktop , too , so a vast quantity of books and newspapers is available .
Electronic books are made ( as the name suggests ) of electrons , which weigh nothing ; whatever one 's view of the feel and qualities of a proper book , when travelling , zero ounces of electron is better than the heavy molecular mass that makes up the real thing .
For photography I shall take the Canon 1000D I reviewed the other week , enraging loyal Pentax and Nikon users , for which I apologise : if Canon did n't exist , I 'd be a perfectly happy Nikon / Pentax / Minolta user .
I shall also pack a Sony Cybershot - W170 , a competent all - round compact digital camera .
I would rather take the slimmer and cuter Casio Exilim , but it has a complicated recharging station that takes up too much precious packing space .
Cables , of course , are the bane of any globetrotting geek 's life , and while there seems to be no perfect solution to the misery of self - knotting spaghetti , I am taken with the ease and simplicity of the Proporta magnetic cable tidies ( £ 2.95 for a pack of two , from proporta.com ) .
The same outfit 's Gadget Bag ( £ 24.95 ) will house my Nintendo DS Lite , dozens of game cartridges and the phones and iPod .
As for laptops , I shall flip a coin to decide whether to take a MacBook Air , the lightest of the MacBook range , or the Livono ThinkPad X300 .
Whichever I choose will come preloaded with as many films and TV shows as I can download .
Their weightlessness will save me having to lug DVDs about .
Thank you for reading this column over the past few months .
I apologise for errors and inconsistencies .
Yes , I believe in Open Source and Free soft - ware , but I 'm too much of a fanatic to be pure about it .
I like to try everything , even if it 's proprietary and closed .
And I like to share what 's out there with those who are less assured in the digital world .
By the time I get back , who knows what goodies and innovations will await me ?
The International Monetary Fund added to Gordon Brown 's woes last night when it warned Britain will be at the bottom of the league table of major developed countries this year , in the weakest year for the global economy since the second world war .
After seeing activity collapse in every continent over the past three months , the Washington - based fund said it expected the UK economy to contract by 2.8 % this year – its worst single - year performance since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The IMF said Britain would be especially hard - hit by a slump in the west that would see a 2.5 % contraction in ­Germany , a 2.6 % drop in output in Japan and a 1.6 % retrenchment in the US .
Developed nations would suffer a recession as severe as those of the mid-1970s and early 1980s , and for the first time in the post - war era collectively suffer a year of falling output .
A separate report yesterday from the International Labour Organisation said a worsening economy could see 50 million more people out of work worldwide as a result of the financial and economic crisis that began in 2007 .
Brown was forced to admit for the first time yesterday that the UK is in " a deep recession " , sounding a very different note from his claims in the autumn that Britain was better prepared than other countries to resist the downturn .
The forecasts from the two organisations came as business leaders gathered in sombre mood for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos .
News International chief Rupert ­Murdoch told delegates the crisis was getting worse : " It 's going to take drastic action to turn it around , if it can be turned around quickly .
I believe it will take some time .
We 've been living in the western world way above our means .
We 've been on a great binge and it's come to an end ; and we have to live though the correction . "
Howard Davies , director of the London School of Economics , said : " People in the UK and the US are going to get poorer .
They will have to spend less than their income for a while . "
No 10 resisted claims that the IMF report showed Britain was going to fare worse than all other large economies , pointing out that Japan and Italy were predicted to do worse than Britain over the full 2008 to 2010 forecasting period .
The IMF highlighted the rising risk of deflation and said there were signs of a " pernicious feedback loop " between the crisis - stricken financial markets and the real economy , as it cut its global growth forecast from the 2.2 % forecast two months ago to 0.5 % .
Although growth in the rest of the world is also expected to slow sharply , the fund said expansion in China and India would spare the global economy as a whole from shrinking this year .
For the UK , the IMF said it was revising down its growth forecast from - 1.3 % to - 2.8 % , and had also become gloomier about the prospects of recovery in 2010 .
With the government obliged to call a general election by the spring of 2010 , ministers have been hoping that the economy will bounce back from the middle of this year to record growth of around 1.75 % next year .
The IMF said it expected the UK to register virtually no growth at all in 2010 , with GDP expanding by 0.2 % .
Alistair Darling will present updated Treasury forecasts for the economy in his spring budget , but the chancellor is already reconciled to revising down his prospects for the UK .
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , said : " Gordon Brown cannot answer the simplest question of all : if Britain is well prepared , as he claims , why are we facing the worst recession in the world ? "
' Real - Time ' BitTorrent search engines are the trend of 2008 , and new sites emerge every other week .
It all started in January with the launch of YouTorrent , but soon after it went legal , other sites took over .
We catch up with the founder of one of YouTorrent 's successors to find out more .
The “ real - time ” search approach YouTorrent introduced appealed to many users , and it is no surprise that most of the new meta - search engines that were inspired by it have been growing steadily .
PizzaTorrent and NowTorrents serve hundreds of thousands of searches a day , and newcomers such as TorrentFly and the more basic looking Gpirate ( not real - time ) are picking up steam as well .
In March , we mentioned both PizzaTorrent and NowTorrents in our top 10 YouTorrent ( meta - search ) alternatives .
Since then , a lot of things have changed , both in design and feature - wise .
We decided to catch up with Godius , the founder of NowTorrents , to find out what ’s happened since Spring .
“ We recently re-coded and designed the whole website , ” Godius told us .
“ The new site has a more user friendly layout and has a bunch of new features .
For example it ’s now possible to filter site - by - site results , filter keyword and categories , all in real - time .
We also build a popular searches caching system , this has greatly improved loading times .
And we added more personal search preference settings . ”
One of the new features at NowTorrents ( and Gpirate ) is the BoxOffice listings .
The MPAA probably wo n’t be too happy with such a feature , but the users love it according to Godius .
“ We are planning to expand the BoxOffice torrents feature with a latest Games and Music Albums charts section .
We have noticed that users greatly appreciate the BoxOffice section , so we feel that adding games and music charts will satisfy their needs even more .
Many people do n’t know what to search for ; they just want to download the latest stuff that has just been released . ”
BoxOffice torrents at NowTorrents
Godius is not too worried about the MPAA showing up at his doorstep , as he told us : “ Basically we are doing exactly what Google is doing only we do not list non-torrent related results .
We feel as long as Google gets away with it , and the torrent sites we link to get away with it , we have nothing to worry about . ”
One of the downsides of all these new meta - torrent search engines is that they all rely on a handful of BitTorrent trackers , and sites that actually host torrent files .
Running a meta - search engine is easier , less costly , and probably safer from a legal point of view .
Nevertheless , they become useless if there are no torrent files to index , or torrents to track .
The oceans are getting noisier , and that 's bad news for whales , dolphins , and sea turtles who use sound to communicate and navigate , researchers declared at a United Nations wildlife conference .
Rumbling ship engines , seismic surveys by oil and gas companies , and intrusive military sonars are triggering an " acoustic fog and cacophony of sounds " underwater , scaring marine animals and affecting their behavior .
" There is now evidence linking loud underwater noises with some major strandings of marine mammals , especially deep diving beaked whales " [ Reuters ]
, says Mark Simmonds of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society .
Researchers have long worried that high - powered sonar pulses confuse whales and dolphins and may cause the animals to beach themselves .
Marine mammals are turning up on the world 's beaches with tissue damage similar to that found in divers suffering from decompression sickness .
The condition , known as the bends , causes gas bubbles to form in the bloodstream upon surfacing too quickly .
Scientists say the use of military sonar or seismic testing may have scared the animals into diving and surfacing beyond their physical limits , Simmonds said [ AP ] .
He points to two recent strandings as possible results of the noisy waters ( although a link has not been proved ) : the 100 melon - headed whales that were found on a Madagascar beach , and the two dozen dolphins that got stranded in southern England .
The current U.N. conference is considering a resolution that would
oblige countries to reduce sound pollution .
Other suggested measures include re-routing shipping , cutting speed and banning tests and sonar use in the habitats of endangered animals ....
A spokesman for the UN Environment Programme said governments seem ready to take action to alleviate the problems caused by noisy oceans .
[ BBC News ] .
However , whale conservationists had a recent setback in the United States , where the Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing the Navy to conduct military exercises using high - powered sonar .
A study published this fall also found an indirect cause of noise pollution : global warming .
Researchers found that
rising levels of carbon dioxide are increasing the acidity of the Earth 's oceans , making sound travel farther through sea water .
The study by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ... shows the changes may mean some sound frequencies are traveling 10 percent farther than a few centuries ago .
That could increase to 70 percent by 2050 if greenhouse gases are not cut [ AP ] .
Animals like humpback whales that " sing " to each other during mating season may be having trouble finding each other , researchers said , as marine noise is drowning out their songs .

McAfee warns that lots of fake Google Code projects have been created by cyber - criminals in order to push malware to unsuspecting users .
The projects promote adult videos that prompt users to download malware in the form of fake video codecs .
Google Code is a popular service used by numerous software developers to promote and host their projects .
A similar service , called MSN Spaces , is being offered by Microsoft , and has been abused by hackers in the past .
Chris Barton , research scientist for McAfee , points out that , in addition , Google automatically indexes the projects in it 's search engine .
The McAfee researcher explains that , when attempting to watch the videos , which are actually just linked images , the users are redirected to a fake codec download website that actually serves them a malicious application .
“ Repeated clicks will take you to an adult site , ” he also notes .
The server hosting the malware is located in Latvia , and is also being used in other malicious campaigns .
Mr. Barton even gives some suggestions to Google on how to identify these projects and close them down .
He points out that the video.gif image , which gets loaded from the same link all the time , is one of the consistent elements that can be used for tracking .
Another one is a link to an in.cgi script , which is also present on all of the rogue projects .
The analyst notes that , despite constant reports , Microsoft has proven reluctant to clean up the MSN Spaces of such scams , even though some of them are one - year old .
“ I trust Google would like to appear less evil and will take more decisive action , ” he writes .
He also demonstrates how to use Google search with a specific string , in order to get a list of the fake projects .
This latest development is just another indication of an increasing trend of cyber - criminals using free services to distribute malicious applications or launch spam and phishing campaigns .
For example , the hackers behind the notorious Koobface worm that spreads on Facebook , started using Google Picasa Web Albums service to host their malicious videos .
Another recent phishing scam has been making use of the Google Calendar .
Google AdSense has also been used to display malicious advertisements that promote malware .
One explanation behind this practice is that the malicious campaigns have better success rates , since users tend to trust well - known services more than other websites .
WASHINGTON -- President - elect Barack Obama intends to nominate his technology adviser , Julius Genachowski , to head the Federal Communications Commission , a Democratic source close to the Obama transition team said .
Mr. Genachowski , 46 years old , is a former Harvard Law School classmate of Mr. Obama .
He previously worked at the FCC during the Clinton administration .
More recently , he co-founded LaunchBox Digital , a Washington , D.C. - based venture capital firm .
He worked at Barry Diller 's IAC / InterActive Corp. in various executive ...
Two US states rejected proposals to limit abortion rights while others said no to gay marriage , in a mixed message over contentious social issues as Americans elected their first black president .
Results of votes on more than 150 proposed state measures across the country showed a more complex cultural map than last night 's historic election of Democrat Barack Obama might indicate .

In California , same - sex couples were poised to lose the right to marry , while Florida and Arizona voted to ban gay marriage outright , joining dozens of other states that define marriage as only between a man and a woman .
Attempts to restrict abortion in South Dakota and Colorado met strong voter resistance .
Halting abortion and same - sex marriage are key issues for many conservative Christian voters , an important base for the Republican Party .
With 89 per cent of precincts reporting , the California proposition - which came about half a year after the state court opened the way to gay marriage - was trailing by nearly 4 per centage points .
" We have Obama , " Noelle Skool , 29 , said of her hopes for change as she checked identification at a popular lesbian bar in San Francisco 's Mission district .
" It 's small steps .
Eventually they 'll warm up to the fact that , hey , we 're all equal . "
Mathew Staver , founder of the conservative Liberty Counsel , had success as a proponent of the Florida gay marriage ban but saw the state vote for Obama the Democrat .
" The passage of this amendment is a bright star on an otherwise dismal night , in which America elected the most liberal President in her history , " Staver said in a statement .
Colorado voters rejected a measure that would have made abortion the legal equivalent of murder by defining human life as beginning at conception .

South Dakota defeated a ban on abortion that , if passed , had been expected to spark a court battle leading to the Supreme Court .
" We defeated it here , and it wo n't spread to other states , " said Sarah Stoesz , president of the local Planned Parenthood chapter .
" And now we 've started a counter movement in a very conservative part of the country . "
In other state ballots , Michigan voted to allow medical use of marijuana , Nebraska ending affirmative action to help minorities and Washington allowing doctor - assisted suicide .

Brain rot .
While others were enjoying the final months of their college senioritis , I was worried about brain rot .
It hit me that in order to be bad or at best mediocre at something , all I had to do was … nothing .
From a boring job to a bad marriage , it seemed that the secret to mediocrity was to coast along and not make any adjustments or actively work to make things better .
Towards graduation , I knew that I had the option of going into the workplace and just let things happen , stop actively learning , and let my brain rot .
It ’d take awhile for people to realize that I ’d stopped caring about learning .
But by then , I ’d be locked into a job where it did n’t matter .
The alternative was to force myself to keep learning and accept the fact that it would never be easy .
Fearful of brain rot , I decided to pick this second path .
But I was on my own .
Unlike school , there would n’t be anyone forcing me to learn new things .
Even with this decision , there was a slight feeling I was part of a losing game .
Throughout my school years , the consistent message about the brain was that you were given a limited number of brain cells at birth and you had to do your best to keep all the ones you could .
At best , you could hope to somehow mature the ones that remained .
Popular culture promoted this message and sometimes joked about it , such as Cliff ’s “ Buffalo Theory ” on Cheers :
“ Well you see , Norm , it ’s like this …
A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo and when the herd is hunted , it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first .
This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole , because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members .
In much the same way , the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells .
Now , as we know , excessive drinking of alcohol kills brain cells .
But naturally , it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first .
In this way , regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells , making the brain a faster and more efficient machine .
And that , Norm , is why you always feel smarter after a few beers . ”
I kept this depressing view of brain cell scarcity until I learned about neurogenesis :
Fortunately , professor Elizabeth Gould thought otherwise .
In a discovery that turned the field on its ear , she discovered neurogenesis – the continued birth of new brain cells throughout adulthood .
But here ’s the funny part .
The reason researchers had never witnessed neurogenesis previously was because of the environment of their test subjects .
If you ’re a lab animal stuck in a cage , you will never grow new neurons .
If you ’re a programmer stuck in a drab cubicle , you will never grow new neurons .
On the other hand , in a rich environment with things to learn , observe , and interact with , you will grow plenty of new neurons and new connections between them .
For decades , scientists were misled because an artificial environment ( sterile lab cages ) created artificial data .
Once again , context is key .
Your working environment needs to be rich in sensory opportunities , or else it will literally cause brain damage .
Pragmatic Thinking and Learning , p.67
Neurobics
While listening to a segment on Radio Lab , I finally realized that the brain does n’t have one central command structure that interprets the world .
It ’s more likely that each sensory organ feeds in its own “ note ” to your mind and it ’s the combined musical “ chord ” that you perceive as a thought or memory .
In an attempt to take advantage of this discovery , I checked out the book “ Keep Your Brain Alive : 83 neurobic exercises to help prevent memory loss and increase mental fitness . ”
It was a bit odd for me to read since the book is targeted at people twice my age , but it highlighted the interesting concept of “ neurobics ” which are like neural aerobics .
The book explains how neurobics take advantage of the decentralized nature of your brain :
Involve one or more of your senses in a novel context .
By blunting the sense you normally use , force yourself to rely on other senses to do an ordinary task .
For instance :
Get dressed for work with your eyes closed .
Engage your attention
To stand out from the background of everyday events and make your brain go into alert mode , an activity has to be unusual , fun , surprising , engage your emotions , or have meaning for you .
( e.g. turn the pictures on your desk upside down )
Break a routine activity in an unexpected , nontrivial way .
Novelty just for its own sake is not highly neurobic .
Routine breakers include taking a completely new route to work and shopping at a farmers market instead of a supermarket .
- Keep Your Brain Alive , pp.33-34
Some of my favorite suggestions from the book include :
Shower with your eyes closed . ( p.43 )
Brushing roulette : brush your teeth with your nondominant hand .
( p.44 ) This also works for other routine activities like using your mouse .
The sightless start : enter and get ready to start your car with your eyes closed .
( p.55 )
Take brain breaks : a walk or social lunch break can help invigorate the mind . ( p.81 )
Have an ongoing chess game .
The last was the most interesting , and had me involve coworkers :
We know of one office where a chessboard was left out near the water cooler .
Any employee could come to the board ( preferably during a break ) , assess the situation , and make a move .
It was an ongoing game , with no known players , and no winners or losers .
Even a novice chess player will weigh dozens of possible moves , attempt to visualize the consequences of each one , then select the move that offers some strategic advantage .
This type of “ Random - player ” chess game does n’t allow anyone to develop a long - term strategy .
But it does require visual - spatial thinking that is different from what most of us do at work .
The brief gear switching provides a break from verbal , left - brain activities and lets the “ working brain ” take a breather .
- Keep Your Brain Alive , p.83
In my case , the chess game did n’t work out exactly like the book described , but it has been fun .
I set up a small magnetic chess board on my desk and encouraged anyone to come and make a move .
I thought it ’d be interesting to have clear winner and loser .
This posed a challenge of how to keep track of the game that had no time limit or fixed set of players .
I used a business card to track of whose turn it is .
When the side with the printing on it is turned up , it means that it ’s black ’s turn ; otherwise it ’s white ’s turn .
This “ protocol ” has worked out well and has allowed several coworkers to play throughout the day .
As a side benefit , it ’s caused me to actively work at getting better at chess .
Refactoring Your Wetware
Last week , I read through Andy Hunt ’s excellent “ Pragmatic Thinking & Learning : Refactor Your Wetware ” that has many more pragmatic brain tips that are written from a programmer perspective .
The book is centered around the Dreyfus Model of skill acquisition where learning starts at a beginner stage where you need a lot of rules to function and then transitions all the way up to an expert level where you rely heavily on intuition .
Here are just a few of the many ideas presented in the book :
Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain : continuing on the neurobics theme , Andy Hunt has some interesting ideas ( pp.74-75 ) :
Instead of UML diagrams , try toy blocks or Lego bricks .
Use physical CRC cards to engage your touch and spatial senses .
Draw a picture ( “ not UML or an official diagram ; just a picture ” )
Describe your design verbally .
Act out your software design with coworkers .
Create a “ Pragmatic Investment Plan ” where you treat your skills and what you want to learn with at least as much care as you take with your finances and apply similar skills ( e.g. diversify , have short and long term goals ) .
Make sure your goals are Specific , Measurable , Achievable , Relevant , and Time - Boxed ( SMART ) ( pp.154-156 )
Consider starting a reading group with people in the office to help learn a skill from a book .
( p.164 )
Make sure you have freedom to explore ideas by having a “ starter kit ” infrastructure of version control , unit testing , and build automation .
This gives you the safety to fail , which is often needed when learning .
( p.192 )
Unscaffolding : artificially make things harder than they need to be so that when you have to do it for real , it seems a lot easier ( e.g. train for running by tying weights to your ankles ) .
I like how the author claims that this is why Ruby programmers should at least spend some time working in C++ ( p.206 )
Develop Your Exocortex :
Have a place outside your brain where you can store and organize thoughts .
The author recommends a personal wiki .
I personally prefer to use Google Notebook . ( p.221 )
Be the Query
I enjoyed the discussion in the book on changing your perspective , especially when it comes to feeling like you ’re inside the system you ’re creating :
Imagine yourself as an integral component of the problem you ’re working on : suppose you are the database query or the packet on the network .
When you get tired of waiting in line , what will you do ?
Who would you tell ? - ( p.107 )
I think that this approach can help lead to a richer Object Thinking in software designs .
For example , if you can picture yourself as a database query , I think you ’ll have much more empathy for what ’s going on .
This thinking might influence your design to avoid painful table scans and favor indexes .
Another way to change your perspective is to use oblique strategies :
These questions and statements force you to draw analogies and to think more deeply about the problem .
They are a great resource to draw on when you ’ get stuck .
- ( p.108 )
Some example strategies include :
Use fewer notes
Do n’t be afraid of things because they ’re easy to do .
What would n’t you do ?
I printed a bunch of cards with each strategy on them and keep them by my desk in a coffee mug .
It ’s a new addition , so I do n’t have long term results , but it is fun to take one out and think of how it might relate to a problem I ’m working on when I get stuck .
Keep Your Brain Cache Warm
Many brain changing ideas require you to focus .
This is hard to do when our jobs often require us to multitask or our culture encourages us to check email frequently in order to respond quickly and look good among our peers .
There are dangers to this :
Scientists agree that trying to focus on several things at once means you ’ll do poorly at each of them .
And if that was n’t bad enough , a controversial study done in the United Kingdom noted that if you constantly interrupt your task to check email or respond to an IM text message , your effective IQ drops ten points .
By comparison , smoking a marijuana joint drops your IQ a mere four points .
- Pragmatic Thinking and Learning , p.228
This is really hard to overcome .
Since reading this , I ’ve tried to avoid checking Outlook more than once an hour .
After each check , I shut it down to prevent the distraction .
I ’ve found that it ’s helpful to actually shut it down ; otherwise it ’s too tempting to ALT + TAB to it or get lured in by a notification message .
If you replace “ phone ” with “ email ” , you can see that Peopleware described over two decades ago why most people are working far below their potential of being in a state of “ flow ” where you actually get stuff done :
If the average incoming [ email ] takes five minutes and your reimmersion period is fifteen minutes , the total cost of that [ email ] in flow time ( work time ) lost is twenty minutes .
A dozen [ emails ] use up half a day .
A dozen other interruptions and the rest of the work day is gone .
This is what guarantees , “ You never get anything done around here between 9 and 5 . ” - Peopleware 2nd edition , p.63
Therefore , for the sake of your sanity and focus , be careful before flushing your brain cache by doing a context switch .
The time saved can be used for more creative thinking and getting things done .
Is this All a Bunch of Hooey ?
I admit that some of these ideas sound silly .
I have n’t yet worked up the courage to bring Legos to a design meeting yet , but I can see how it would help use a different neural pathway and activate more gray matter .
Surely that could n’t hurt , right ?
It ’d probably bring a new perspective and overcome a road block .
This is probably why some of the most creative companies encourage playful behavior at work .
This might be seen as a horrible waste of time to traditional management ( and shareholders for that matter ) , but it ’s much more likely to use more of your brain which in turn might create better solutions .
One alternative to all of this is to just coast along and not take thinking and learning into your own hands .
Left on their own , your company is likely to put you through a sheep dip using a “ training course ” in an artificial environment that will easily wear off just like a farmer might dunk his sheep into a chemical bath to get rid of parasites which will also wear off and need to be repeated .
While sometimes uncomfortable at first , I ’ve enjoyed incorporating some “ wetware refactoring ” into my daily life as a way to overcome brain rot and aid learning and thinking .
It sure beats a sheep dip .
What do you do ?
Do you have specific wetware refactorings that you do ?
I ’d love to hear them ; the “ crazier ” they are the more likely they ’ll probably activate different neural pathways and probably lead to a better result .
Let me know in the comments .
The videos taken on my Cambodia trip were taken by Kassie Bracken , a young woman who is a staff videographer for the Times .
I thought that it would be interesting to get her perspective , since she has n’t been to the region before and since she is the same sex as the girls we interviewed in the brothels and not all that much older .
Here ’s Kassie ’s take :
I ’d never been to Southeast Asia before , nor had I ever stepped foot in a brothel .
I suppose the word summoned up grainy red images of numbered young girls for sale , but I do n’t know that I really knew what to expect .
Each brothel we visited had a completely different energy and vibe , but for the most part , all of the girls seemed young – the majority looked to be in their teens .
They were all tiny in stature too , which only made them seem even younger .
Nick has asked me for my reflections in part to get a female perspective – and this is difficult to put into words when I think about the moments we were in the presence of these girls .
I did n’t see sexy or feminine , I saw adolescent energy , and that trumped anything else .
Outside of one brothel a staunch mama - san never made eye contact with Nick and looked past him , calculating the street as they spoke .
I was surprised that she continued speaking to us , knowing that it would n’t lead to a sale .
Behind her , young girls mechanically reapplied lipstick and mascara over and over again under red lights .
One woman ’s face will stay with me – she kept circling lipstick around her lips with a desperation .
She ’d put the cap on and then open ten seconds later and do it again .
Later that night we also spoke with a younger mama - san , heavily made up in a strapless cocktail dress with multiple gold rings and bracelets and long pressed - on nails .
She and said she could fulfill a request for a virgin girl with a few days ’ notice , and never lost her flirty smile when she spoke .
When we walked away she kept smiling and as we turned our backs she smashed three full beer bottles into the street behind us .
At both of those brothels , the girls had a deadness in their eyes that I sort of did n’t want to contemplate for fear that I would become completely depressed about the world .
But at the karaoke shacks I was struck by the youth and energy in the laughter of some of the girls with whom we spoke .
The mood seemed lighter and I generally could n’t tell who the mama - sans were .
For brief moments I would completely forget why we were there , and just see the enthusiasm of
teenage girls talking to what probably appeared to them to be two odd Westerners .
Then it would hit me that like all of the other young women we ’d met , they would have to offer sex to the next man who wanted to pay two dollars .
No matter what he looked like , smelled like , or his physical
manner .
It ’s difficult to imagine where I would be mentally and emotionally under those conditions .
I think in general , I felt emotionally abstracted from the girls in the brothels , in part because I never directly interacted with them and let Nick handle the conversations .
And in a weird way , I think I did n’t feel comfortable speaking .
I had this weird feeling that to speak was to somehow expose an inexplicable inequity – namely all of the choices I ’ve had in my life in a world where many women by virtue of their gender have close to none .
I felt that to speak to them would somehow solidify that they were selling their bodies and I was not .
There was an older – by older I mean , maybe 20 ?
Maybe 30 ? — woman in a brothel in Poipet where Nick had conducted a sit - down interview with the mama - san .
During the course of the hour we were there , the woman had had sex with six men , for a total of perhaps 15 – 18 dollars .
She was beautiful – high cheekbones and a slightly square face , thick black hair and dark eyes – but she also looked like a tired woman at work .
As we were about to leave she looked me in the eye – we just sort of looked at each other and took one another in – and then she smiled at me .
I smiled back , awkwardly .
At the moment , I did n’t know why I felt nervous , but I think now it ’s because it was one of the only moments of mutual vulnerability – albeit brief and innocuous – I felt on the entire trip .
I ’d like to think I am a fairly strong person , but in meeting Long Pross and hearing her tell her story , I wondered if I could ever match her strength .
Long Pross was the woman we did a video about who had been abducted in her Cambodian village and sold into forced sexual slavery .
She ’d been beaten regularly , electrocuted , and had gotten pregnant twice .
She kept resisting her customers .
When after a painful abortion she ’d begged for a week off , the mama - san gouged her eye out with a metal shard .
During the interview she sat with Sina Van , who ’d also suffered sexual slavery and who seemed like a big sister to Pross – Pross very rarely looked up during the interview , and Sina would hold her and touch her hair as Pross told her story .
It ’s been a week since Cambodia , and I am thinking about it every day , and talking to friends willing to listen , just telling them what I saw .
I ’ve always thought that the concept of selling one ’s body is a tricky one – I ’ve read a lot of comments on Nick ’s blog saying that it ’s not the worst thing these women could be doing , given the extreme poverty in Cambodia , and that he is overplaying the abuse angle .
Ultimately , I wonder most not about the reality of a young girl in a sexual act with a paying stranger , but I wonder about the impact on that girl ’s future – will she be able to be vulnerable to another human – will she be able to experience love ?
And I think about the end of Nick ’s interview with Pross .
Sina was attempting to make Pross smile by saying “ when we get your eye fixed up and get you beautiful again , we ’re going to find you a husband . ”
When I watch Pross ’s expression in the video footage I see light in her eyes for
the briefest moment – then it ’s gone .
It ’s the moment from the trip that haunts me the most .

Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated last night after it was claimed that the only terrorist to have survived three days of deadly battles in Mumbai was from Pakistan , and that his nine fellow Islamist militants were either from that country or had been trained there .
The claims about responsibility for the attack , in which almost 200 people were killed , came from leaked police accounts that gave details of the interrogation of Azam Amir Kasab , 21 , said to have been the man pictured at Mumbai 's main train station carrying an assault rifle and grenades .
According to the reports , which could not be independently verified , Kasab said that the operation was the responsibility of Lashkar - e - Taiba , a jihadist group based in Pakistan , and its aim was to ' kill as many as possible ' in what was intended to be India 's 9/11 .
The claims were made as Indian special forces ended the violent sieges around Mumbai with the killing of the final three terrorists holding out in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel - where British survivors had walked through rooms strewn with bodies and ' blood and guts ' as they were led to safety .
The allegations about Pakistan emerged as India was confronted with the full horror of the past few days .
Reporters were allowed into the wrecked and scorched remains of the Taj Mahal and Trident - Oberoi hotels , where scores of victims had been murdered .
Public anger in India has been mounting following allegations linking Pakistan to the attacks .
They include :
• Kasab's claim that militants were trained in two camps run by Lashkar - e - Taiba in Pakistan .
• Allegations that phones found on a trawler suspected of ferrying the gunmen to Mumbai had been used to contact Pakistan .
• The claim by India 's minister of state for home affairs , Sri Prakash Jaiswal , that ' the investigation carried out so far has revealed the hand of Pakistan - based groups in the Mumbai attack ' .
In response to the claim that the attackers were either Pakistanis or had been trained there , a senior Pakistani official said troops would be sent to the border if tensions continued to rise .
However , despite initial claims , it became increasingly certain that there was no involvement of British - based fundamentalists .
Police forces across the UK denied they were investigating named individuals and Gordon Brown said there was no evidence linking any of the terrorist to the UK .
The escalating war of words between India and Pakistan has set alarm bells ringing in the United States , where President Bush convened an emergency meeting with senior security officials .
President - elect Barack Obama , who has said that reconciliation between the nuclear - armed neighbours is essential to stabilise Afghanistan and defeat al - Qaeda , called Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday night to offer condolences .
The cold - blooded intent of the militants has shaken India .
Officials said just 10 gunmen , with enough arms and ammunition ' to kill 5,000 people ' , had attacked the Taj , the Trident - Oberoi , the main railway station , a popular restaurant and a cinema .
In the siege of a Jewish centre , which was retaken by security forces on Friday night , the militants had bound and shot five people , including a rabbi and his wife , before they were killed .
A handful of gunmen held out for almost three days , taking hundreds of people hostage , many of them Westerners .
Twenty - two of those killed were foreigners .
Last night emergency services raised the prospect that many - including three Britons - were still missing from the Taj .
The gunmen set the 105 - year - old hotel ablaze as they evaded scores of India 's best - trained commandos .
They left bodies with grenades stuffed into their mouths .
The photograph of a baby - faced militant , whom newspaper reports claim is Kasab , wearing combat trousers and swinging an AK47 in Mumbai 's main railway station , is the defining image of the rampage .
His victims are said to include Mumbai 's anti-terror squad chief Hemant Karkare , whose body was cremated yesterday .
Under questioning , Kasab is said to have admitted to being a resident of Faridkot in Pakistan 's Punjab province .
' I was trained by Lashkar - e - Taiba and asked to cause maximum casualties in Mumbai , ' he is alleged to have said , referring to an organisation which India says is sending armed militants into Kashmir .
Kasab was arrested on Wednesday night after his partner , said to be Ismail Khan , was shot dead .
The duo's night began when they fired on commuters in the railway station and in two hospitals .
Kasab told police that they had learnt about Mumbai 's geography using Google Earth .
According to Indian media reports , the captured militant said that a room booked in the Taj had been used to store explosives and ammunition ahead of the attacks .
This might explain how the squads of gunmen were able to reload their weapons over more than 50 hours and appeared to have an inexhaustible supply of grenades .
Asif Ali Zardari , the President of Pakistan , yesterday appeared on Indian television in an attempt to defuse tensions .
' As President of Pakistan , if any evidence comes of any individual or group in any part of my country , I shall take the swiftest action in the light of evidence and in front of the world , ' he said .
Analysts said that the omens did not look good for the peace process between India and Pakistan .
' I expect a very difficult time ahead , ' said Tariq Fatemi , a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington .
' Anything short of a real and genuine effort to co-operate by Pakistan would send very , very bad signals - not just to India but to the US and to Europe too . '
Ms Cordoba ( speaking to reporters ) helped arrange a release last February
Colombia 's main leftist rebel group , the Farc , plans to release several high - profile hostages on Sunday , a prominent politician says .
Senator Piedad Cordoba , who helped negotiate a previous release , said she had been given exact co-ordinates for the location of the planned release .
She said that two local politicians and four security force members would be freed in three successive stages .
Colombia 's army freed several top Farc hostages last July .
These included former presidential election candidate Ingrid Betancourt .
The International Committee of the Red Cross and Brazil are both involved in co-ordinating future releases and picking up the hostages in the release predicted by Ms Cordoba .
She told reporters : " I already have the coordinates , the liberation is under way and the first release will take place on Sunday , and there will be three successive handovers . "
It would be the first voluntary move by the Farc to free hostages since February 2008 , when Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez brokered a deal to free four kidnapped Colombian politicians with the senator 's help .
The rebel group , founded in 1964 , has suffered a series of setbacks including the loss of senior commanders and numerous desertions .
President Alvaro Uribe has pursued a tough campaign against the rebels , driving them further into mountain and jungle areas .
The group is believed to currently hold 28 " political hostages " which it has tried to exchange for its jailed members .

ABHAY ASHTEKAR remembers his reaction the first time he saw the universe bounce .
“ I was taken aback , ” he says .
He was watching a simulation of the universe rewind towards the big bang .
Mostly the universe behaved as expected , becoming smaller and denser as the galaxies converged .
But then , instead of reaching the big bang “ singularity ” , the universe bounced and started expanding again .
What on earth was happening ?
Ashtekar wanted to be sure of what he was seeing , so he asked his colleagues to sit on the result for six months before publishing it in 2006 .
And no wonder .
The theory that the recycled universe was based on , called loop quantum cosmology ( LQC ) , had managed to illuminate the very birth of the universe – something even Einstein ’s general theory of relativity fails to do .
 Einstein ’s relativity fails to explain the very birth of the universe 
LQC has been tantalising physicists since 2003 with the idea that our universe could conceivably have emerged from the collapse of a previous universe .
Now the theory is poised to make predictions we can actually test .
If they are verified , the big bang will give way to a big bounce and we will finally know the quantum structure of space - time .
Instead of a universe that emerged from a point of infinite density , we will have one that recycles , possibly through an eternal series of expansions and contractions , with no beginning and no end .
LQC is in fact the first tangible application of another theory called loop quantum gravity , which cunningly combines Einstein ’s theory of gravity …
A Solar - Powered Pissing Contest – Who Wins ?
December 10th , 2008 by Jerry James Stone
Maybe it ’s just me .
But it seems like you ca n’t crack open a clean tech blog these days without uncovering a post on The World ’s Most Super Duperest Solar Project Ever .
In the last month alone we ’ve seen everyone from China to Los Angeles rolling out big budget solar plans .
All I can say is , finally !
But I must admit , it ’s feels like some global pissing contest as to who can roll out the biggest one first .
China ’s pollution problems have affected everything from the 2008 Olympics to Batman .
The Dark Knight survived , but there is still much concern about China , environmentally speaking .
And while I do n’t think they are quite out of hot water just yet , their massive 166 Megawatt solar power plant in Yunnan gives me hope .
The project is expected to cost $ 1.3 billion and scheduled to start operation in 2010 .
If you watch things like 90210 ( the original or version 2.0 ) , you ’d believe California is nothing but sun , beaches and palm trees .
But those of us north of Santa Barbara know better !
Okay , it is kinda sunny .
And that same sun that gives us our tasty wines is also helping farmers go green .
Woo hoo !
As a defector from Los Angeles county , I was pleased when I heard that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa had plans to gather enough solar power to meet 10 - percent of LA ’s energy needs by 2020 .
Yah , LA is trying to give us San Francisco hippies a run for our money !
Arizona ’s Global Solar Energy features a ground - mounted solar array consisting of 6,600 thin - film solar cells .
The facility will generate more than 1.1 million Kilowatt - hours , providing about 25 % of the facility ’s electricity needs , offsetting 30,000 tons of CO2 over its expected 25 - year lifetime .
And it ’s 100 - percent Palin free !
The Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville , NY is constructing a solar module factory with the help of $ 55 Million from Spire Corp .
I guess license plates are passé .
I want to say “ cool ” but I ca n’t help but flashback to scenes from
Oz that ended in death , or ever worse – sodomy .
So , who wins ?
Well , I think we all do .
As long as countries , states and communities continue to push forward , how can we not ?

Much of the EU 's gas from Russia arrives via Ukraine Russian gas giant Gazprom has renewed its threat to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 1 January , saying a contract dispute has reached a " critical " stage .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Ukraine faced Russian " sanctions and demands " if it did not pay off its gas debt " to the last rouble " .
Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov stressed that the dispute would not disrupt gas deliveries to Europe .
Ukraine owes $ 1.67 bn ( £ 1.1 bn ) for gas and $ 450 m in fines , Gazprom says .
Gazprom denied that any agreement had been reached with Kiev on postponing the repayment , contradicting an announcement by Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko On Tuesday , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin warned that the era of cheap gas was coming to an end .
Earlier , Gazprom said it had warned European customers about possible disruption linked to the Ukraine dispute .
The EU gets 42 % of its gas imports from Russia , mostly via pipelines across Ukraine .
A similar row in 2006 led to gas shortages in several EU countries .
' Pay up '
" If a contract for 2009 is not signed [ with Ukraine ] then we are not going to deliver gas without a contract , " Mr Kupriyanov told reporters in Kiev .
" When there is no contract we can not realise deliveries .
The situation is not simple .
It is even critical . "
But Gazprom , he added , would " deliver the full volume of gas destined for transit and ... fulfil all [ its ] obligations towards European consumers " .
Speaking to Russian TV channels in Moscow , President Medvedev said the non-payment situation could not be allowed to continue .
" They should pay the money to the last rouble if they do n't want their economy eventually running up against sanctions and demands from the Russian Federation , " he said .
" It is impossible to go on like this .
Let them pay the money . "
Economic woes Ukraine 's President Yushchenko said earlier on Wednesday that an agreement had been reached with Gazprom to reschedule repayment .
" A portion of the debt will be restructured " over several months , he said , adding that Kiev might return some gas held in storage to Gazprom as reimbursement .
" The question has not been solved as was announced in Kiev , " Gazprom 's Sergei Kupriyanov said in response , in televised comments .
Analysts say Kiev will struggle to find the money to pay for the gas .
Shaken by the global financial crisis , Ukraine is relying on a $ 16.4bn emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund to see it through a halving of exports and a sharp devaluation of the national currency .
On Tuesday , Vladimir Putin told a meeting of major gas - exporting countries in Moscow that because of extraction costs , " the era ... of cheap gas ... [ was ] coming to an end " .
The Gas Exporting Countries Forum ( GECF ) meeting in Moscow agreed a charter and plans for a permanent base .
Some observers say the GECF may develop into an Opec - style producers ' cartel .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures jumped $ 70 an ounce Wednesday , the biggest daily gain in dollar terms in more than two decades , as anxiety highlighted by the U.S. takeover of American International Group fueled massive safe - haven buying .
Gold for December delivery ended the day up 9 % at $ 850.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange .
That represents gold 's biggest one - day jump in dollar terms since at least 1980 , the earliest year historical data were available on the Comex .
Gold futures started trading in the U.S. in 1974 .
After the market closed , gold continued to rise more than $ 20 to $ 870.90 an ounce in electronic trading .
" Gold is acting like it is supposed to on a flight - to - safety move , " said Amaury Conti , an equity trader at investment adviser Austin Calvert - Flavin .
" We have a global financial crisis and nobody has a clear answer .
Therefore stocks , currencies and debt are being questioned and nobody wants to own a ' paper ' asset , " he said .
See Commodities Corner .
The Federal Reserve late Tuesday seized control of AIG AIG , - 1.23 % with an $ 85 billion bailout aimed at averting a potentially catastrophic bankruptcy .
The move was the government 's latest and most dramatic attempt yet to halt threats to the world 's financial system .
See full story .
The government 's move came just two days after it refused to save Wall Street icon Lehman Brothers LEH , from a similar fate .
After AIG 's takeover , the hunt resumed on Wall Street for the credit crisis ' next potential victims , with the market seeming to focus for now on other investment firms Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % and Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % in the U.S .
Jon Nadler , senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers , also pointed to concerns about Swiss bank UBS UBS , - 0.54 % .
Meanwhile , the financial turmoil accelerated in Russia as trading on the country 's major exchanges was halted for a second day and the finance ministry announced plans to loan the country 's three largest banks up to $ 44 billion .
See full story .
Also fueling the turmoil , market fund pioneer The Reserve shook the market Wednesday when it cut the net asset value of its flagship Primary Fund , leading firms like Deutsche Bank , Legg Mason and others to try to calm investors and prevent a run on their funds .

Beyond gold , the recent turmoil could also encourage traders to put their money back into commodities .
It can " buy the commodities sector some time , " Nadler said .
" A stoppage of forced sales and a hoped - for return of some of the speculative spirit in various assets and the easing up in the hoarding of cash is what markets are effectively expecting out of the Fed 's move , " he said .
The bug is back
Gold bugs were also quick to point out technical and fundamental support for the precious metals .
According to Brien Lundin , editor of Gold Newsletter , a piling of short positions -- or bets that gold would fall -- had led gold 's recent correction to under $ 750 an ounce .
This , he said , was unjustified , " just as gold 's run over $ 1,000 this year was unjustified . "
" Now , the fundamentals of gold are coming back into play , and we 're seeing the resulting snap - back in the price , " Lundin said .
" Physical demand is breaking records , mining supply continues to fall , and the economic environment is , of course , promoting safe - haven demand , " Lundin continued .
" The shorts are covering , the funds are buying back in , and everyone wants the safety of gold . "
Dollar falls
Deepening financial upheavals also hit the dollar , which fell against the euro and the British pound .
The dollar index DXY , +0.09 % , which tracks the value of the greenback against other major currencies , was at 78.015 , down from 79.149 late Tuesday .
See Currencies .
A weakening dollar tends to raise dollar - denominated gold prices .
Also moving gold prices was crude oil .
After slumping 10 % in the past two sessions , crude gained $ 6.01 , or 6.6 % , to close at $ 97.16 a barrel Wednesday .
Read Futures Movers .
Other metals also moved higher .
December silver surged 11 % to $ 11.68 an ounce , October platinum added 1.7 % to $ 1,086.30 an ounce , and December palladium rose 0.5 % to $ 227.10 an ounce .
However , copper for December delivery fell slightly to $ 3.04 a pound .
In spot trading , the London gold fixing price 38099902 , used as a benchmark for gold for immediate delivery , stood at $ 813 an ounce Wednesday , up $ 33.5 from Tuesday afternoon .
Metals equities and exchanged - traded funds rallied along with gold prices Wednesday .
On the equities side , the Amex Gold Bugs Index HUI , added 11.7 % to 314.33 points .

Noam Chomsky has been a tireless voice of support for the Palestinians , and his words carry an authority matched by few .
Chomsky is a Jew , a Hebrew scholar who once lived on a kibubbtz in Israel with strong ties to the country .
He has been relentlessly smeared in the press by other Jews like Alan Dershowitz , mainly because he speaks the painful truth .
And the truth is what we must hear if we are to honor our own history as a persecuted people , murdered for no other reason than the fact we were Jews .
Chomsky says :

Eban 's justification for state terror is regarded as persuasive by respected authorities .
As the current US - Israel assault raged , Times columnist Thomas Friedman explained that Israel 's tactics both in the current attack and in its invasion of Lebanon in 2006 are based on the sound principle of " trying to `educate ' Hamas , by inflicting a heavy death toll on Hamas militants and heavy pain on the Gaza population . "
That makes sense on pragmatic grounds , as it did in Lebanon , where " the only long - term source of deterrence was to exact enough pain on the civilians -- the families and employers of the militants -- to restrain Hezbollah in the future . "
And by similar logic , bin Laden 's effort to " educate " Americans on 9/11 was highly praiseworthy , as were the Nazi attacks on Lidice and Oradour , Putin 's destruction of Grozny , and other notable attempts at " education . "
Israel has taken pains to make clear its dedication to these guiding principles .
NYT
correspondent Stephen Erlanger reports that Israeli human rights groups
are " troubled by Israel 's strikes on buildings they believe should be
classified as civilian , like the parliament , police stations and the
presidential palace " - and , we may add , villages , homes , densely
populated refugee camps , water and sewage systems , hospitals , schools
and universities , mosques , UN relief facilities , ambulances , and indeed
anything that might relieve the pain of the unworthy victims .
A
senior Israeli intelligence officer explained that the IDF attacked
" both aspects of Hamas -- its resistance or military wing and its dawa ,
or social wing , " the latter a euphemism for the civilian society .
"
He
argued that Hamas was all of a piece , " Erlanger continues , " and in a
war , its instruments of political and social control were as legitimate
a target as its rocket caches . "
Erlanger and his editors add no comment
about the open advocacy , and practice , of massive terrorism targeting
civilians , though correspondents and columnists signal their tolerance
or even explicit advocacy of war crimes , as noted .
But
keeping to the norm , Erlanger does not fail to stress that Hamas
rocketing is " an obvious violation of the principle of discrimination
and fits the classic definition of terrorism . "

A gay version of the Bible , in which God says it is better to be gay than straight , is to be published by an American film producer .
New Mexico - based Revision Studios will publish The Princess Diana Bible – so named because of Diana 's " many good works " , it says – online at princessdianabible .com in spring 2009 .
A preview of Genesis is already available , in which instead of creating Adam and Eve , God creates Aida and Eve .
" And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Aida , and she slept : and he took one of her ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ; and the rib , which the Lord God had taken from woman , made he another woman , and brought her unto the first .
And Aida said , ' This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of me .
Therefore shall a woman leave her mother , and shall cleave unto her wife : and they shall be one flesh . '
And they were both naked , the woman and her wife , and were not ashamed . "
The film studio said it would also adapt and direct the revised Bible as a two - part mini-series , The Gay Old Testament and The Gay New Testament , once it is completed .
" There are many different versions of the Bible ; I do n't see why we can't have one , " said Max Mitchell , who directed the science fiction comedy Horror in the Wind , in which an airborne formula invented by two biogeneticists reverses the world 's sexual orientation .
" I got the idea for the Princess Diana Bible from Horror In The Wind , " he added .
" After the world becomes gay , religious people create The Princess Diana Bible , which says that gay is right and straight is a sin .
Then they burn all the King James Bibles . "
The move has already provoked upset among Christians , with the blogger Douglas Howe at the Idol Chatter site describing it as " inspired by a political agenda and one person 's desire to contort not only the text but the very context of it to suit his own perspective " .
There was also criticism on Mitchell 's Princess Diana Bible site , where one commentator said the choice of title was " very disrespectful to the late Princess Diana …
It 's just one more thing to link her to what many people believe is immoral .
Sad , very sad indeed . "
But Mitchell said : " There are 116 versions of the Bible , why is any of them better than ours ? "
Tomb Raider is in trouble .
The videogame series was once so popular no less a star than Angelina Jolie played thigh - holstered Lara Croft in the 2001 movie adaption and its sequel .
Now , the tired franchise saw its latest release flop , sending British game publisher Eidos running to its financiers to renegotiate debt covenants .
But here 's one innovative idea to reinvigorate the character : Have Lara Croft get NC - 17 .
Part of the game 's appeal has always been watching the buxom protagonist leap over obstacles , with the game giving lots of cheap thrills in the way of gratuitous camera zooms on Lara 's feminine curves .
But so far , Tomb Raider has always maintained an ESRB " Teen " rating , which allows " suggestive themes " but draws the line at " sexual content . "
No more ?
Over on tombraiderforums.com , a poster believed to be ( but not confirmed as ) " Tomb Raider : Underworld " creative director Eric Lindstrom says future Lara Croft games may go for a " Mature " rating .
The Teen rating meant we could n’t do things we wanted to or were done in the past , but it was a publisher mandate at the tmie [ sic ] .
It wo n’t always necessarily be so , though , the future can always be different .
Shares in Eidos rose 8 % in morning trading .

The Structured Informer
Dell on TwitterDell is on Twitter in a major way .
But , they do n’t use Twitter the way most do …. with conversations .
They use Twitter very much like “ The Sweet Deal Shouter ” above .
However , the difference is that “ The Structured Informer ” uses Twitter as a sort of news feed for its followers .
For example , if you are looking for Dell deals there is the Dell Outlet .
If you are looking for deals for the small business or deals for the home ….
they have Twitter profiles for just those deals .
Or , maybe you are a gamer that wants to keep up with the updates for that type of news they have that too .
Dell has about 17 different Twitter profiles that you can follow for those particular type of news .
There are many choices for its Consumers .

Three years ago , Hurricane Katrina and its chaotic aftermath produced a collage of indelible images .
Among them was a photo of President Bush , viewing the devastation from the comfort of Air Force One as he jetted to Washington .
Now , some of Bush ’s closest advisors say his administration ’s response to the disaster marked a turning point in what has become the most unpopular presidency in modern history .
From then on , they say in a magazine article published this week , his tenure entered a downward spiral from which he could never recover .
“ Katrina to me was the tipping point , ” said Matthew Dowd , the president ’s pollster and chief strategist in his 2004 reelection .
“ Politically , it was the final nail in the coffin , ” added Dan Bartlett , former White House counselor and longtime aide to Bush .

Their comments are part of an oral history of the Bush administration included in the February issue of Vanity Fair .
Some polling supports their conclusion .
After Katrina , Bush never again would see even the lukewarm approval ratings that he enjoyed in the summer of 2005 .
Even then , less than a year after he had secured reelection , his support nationally was eroding largely because of the extended conflict in Iraq .
After early 2005 , his approval ratings dropped below 50 % , never to reclaim a majority of the public ’s support .
After Katrina struck in late August , plunging New Orleans and the surrounding Gulf Coast underwater , Bush ’s numbers went into “ free - fall , ” according to John Zogby , president of the polling firm Zogby International .
“ The decline was accelerated , ” he said .
With the government ’s halting and confused response to the calamity , the “ president broke his bond with the public , ” Dowd told Vanity Fair .
“ Once that bond was broken , he no longer had the capacity to talk to the American public .
State of the Union addresses ?
It did n’t matter .
Legislative initiatives ?
It did n’t matter .
Travel ?
It did n’t matter . ”

For many , Bush ’s actions epitomized the government ’s slow response .
The storm barreled through Louisiana on the morning of Aug. 29 , 2005 .
By that afternoon , several levees had failed and much of New Orleans and the surrounding parishes were flooded .
Bush had been vacationing at his Texas ranch .
On the Monday the storm hit , he traveled to Arizona and California to champion Medicare legislation .
The next day , as Americans heard reports of looting in New Orleans and of thousands trapped in the city ’s Superdome and convention center , Bush spoke at San Diego ’s North Island Naval Air Station and was photographed playing guitar with a country music performer .
On Wednesday , he cut his trip short and decided to return to Washington to monitor the crisis .
Along the way , Air Force
One dipped low over the devastated city .
Bush was captured by a White House photographer , peering out the window .
The shot was meant to show the president was engaged , but it ultimately sent the opposite message .

“ It was the wrong visual , ” Zogby said .
“ It was emblematic of a failing presidency . ”
That Friday , as televised images of a city under siege bombarded viewers worldwide , the president returned to the region and issued his now infamous validation of the efforts of Michael D. Brown , then - director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
“ Brownie , you ’re doing a heck of a job , ” Bush said .
Brown resigned 10 days later .

Brown provided his own perspective to Vanity Fair , blaming himself for failing to advise the president of the severity of the crisis and for sticking to “ talking points ” when addressing the public .
He also slammed Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff for inserting “ a massive bureaucracy ” into the government response .
Michael Dimock , associate director of the Pew Research Center , says the images from Katrina sharpened feelings that many Americans already held toward the Iraq war , which was dragging into its third year .
“ Katrina was the most vivid in the public mind , ” Dimock said .
“ It suggested a lack of caring , a lack of being in touch .
It reinforced what was in people ’s thoughts about what was going on in Iraq at the time . ”
In the months after the 9/11 attacks , Dimock said , when his polling asked for a single word to describe Bush ’s presidency , the most frequent responses were “ leadership ” and “ strength . ”
After Katrina , he said , “ the top word was ‘ incompetent . ’ ”

Bush leaves the White House in January with some of the lowest marks of any recent president .
According to a Pew survey released this month , just 11 % of Americans rate Bush as an “ above - average president , ” compared with 59 % for Ronald Reagan and 44 % for Bill Clinton as they left office .
And 58 % of those surveyed scored Bush as “ below average . ”

Over a hundred conservation , wildlife , and animal welfare groups have sent a letter to incoming Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack urging him to rethink the often cruel practice of “ lethal control ” of wildlife by the USDA .
The coalition contends that animals are killed through such means as shooting from airplanes and helicopters , poisoning , gassing dens , bludgeoning after capture , and strangling in wire snares .
[ social_buttons ]
In 2007 , the USDA spent $ 100 million of taxpayer money to kill 2.4 million wild animals , including 90,262 coyotes , 2,277 gray foxes , 2,412 red foxes , 2,090 bobcats , 1,133 cats , 552 dogs , 577 badgers , and 340 gray wolves .
“ Wildlife Services has much blood on its hands .
The agency is committing crimes against animals that make Michael Vick ’s Bad Newz Kennels look like doggy day care , ” said Brian Vincent of the group Big Wildlife .
Other members of the 115 - group coalition include the Center for Biological Diversity , Creation Care Study Program , Christians for Environmental Stewardship , Humane Society of the United States , Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility , Sierra Club , and Ranchers for Rural Responsibility .
The coalition advocates non-lethal livestock protection methods in the letter .
They commend ranchers who protect their property with dogs , llamas , and burros , and those who mix cattle and sheep to reduce attacks from predators .
The groups also recommend nighttime penning , penning during lambing and calving season , removing livestock carcasses from pastures , and the use of strobes and sirens .
Add your voice and tell Vilsack and the Obama administration that the cruel practices should end .

Last night before a benefit he was scheduled to participate in at a loft in Soho , the street artist known as Poster Boy was arrested by an undercover cop .
Poster Boy was listed on a flyer for the event , a festival put on for Friends We Love , a series of videos documenting the process of a dozen different artists , including Poster Boy , who talked with us just last week .
Photographer Jim Kiernan tipped us off to the arrest .
He arrived at event at Broadway and Howard Street to meet up with Poster Boy around 7 p.m. , but police had already arrived after spotting the Poster Boy 's name on the flyer .
Kiernan says , " There was an undercover cop on the block and they came and picked him up .
As far as I know , he 's still in Central Booking right now and waiting to get in front of a judge ... It 's the second time they 've gotten him . "
There does n't appear to be one specific piece or incident that triggered the arrest , but Kiernan wonders if it might have something to do with Poster Boy 's recent move above ground , taking his " photochop " style and applying it to a Van Wagner billboard in Brooklyn .
He told us , " He 's f*ckin with money .
He 's cutting up advertising .
Advertisers are n't happy about that .
And I 'm sure the Van Wagner people were n't thrilled . "
Friends are waiting for Poster Boy to go before a judge and have bail set with hopes that it will happen today , but fearing that it may not be until Monday .
Collaborating artists Ellis G. and Aakash Nihalani photochopped up a couple of impromptu pieces at last night 's event declaring " Free Poster Boy ! " and " NYPD=Joke " .
When asked if he thought the arrest would deter Poster Boy , Kiernan said , " It definitely wo n 't — no way .
His whole concept is that it 's a movement .
It 's bigger than him . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have discovered tuberculosis in 9,000 year - old human bones found submerged off Israel ’s coast -- evidence the disease is at least 3,000 years older than previously thought , researchers said on Wednesday .

Scientists have discovered tuberculosis in 9,000 year - old human bones found submerged off Israel 's coast -- evidence the disease is at least 3,000 years older than previously thought , researchers said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Tel Aviv University / Handout
The findings show how tuberculosis has evolved over thousands of years and provides a better understanding of ways it may change in the future , the researchers said .
“ Examining ancient human remains for the markers of TB is very important because it helps to aid our understanding of prehistoric tuberculosis and how it evolved , ” said Mark Spigelman of University College , London , who worked on the study .
“ This then helps us improve our understanding of modern TB and how we might develop more effective treatments . ”
Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease typically attacking the lungs that newly affects about 9.2 million people each year and kills an estimated 1.7 million around the world .
The emergence and spread of drug - resistant germs makes treating it much harder and could make the disease even deadlier .
The international team , which also included researchers from Israel ’s Tel Aviv University , found the bones believed to be a mother and baby submerged off the coast of Haifa .
DNA analysis and bone lesions characteristic of tuberculosis showed that the skeletons from a 9,000 year - old Pre-Pottery Neolithic village were infected with the disease , the team said in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS One .
The village was located in a place that is now submerged .
Further tests showed that the strain was a type found only in humans and is similar to common bacteria that infects people with tuberculosis today .
Previously , the oldest confirmed human TB strain was from a group of Egyptians dating back to around 3,000 BC , said Helen Donoghue , a University College , London , researcher who worked on the study .
“ We can tell that it was human because it was missing part of its DNA that is characteristic of the human lineage , ” she said in a telephone interview .
“ The strain we have found as far as we can tell is identical to some of the bacteria that are going around and infecting people today , ” she added .
Things are looking pretty bleak .
There is bad news in housing , the stock market , commercial real estate , jobs , and wages .
Unfortunately , no matter how bad things are , someone always comes along to propose a " solution " that is guaranteed to make the situation much worse .
Please consider the following ideas .
Scary Idea # 1
Anatole Kaletsky is proposing to Punish savers and make them spend money .
Near - zero interest rates and even a tax on bank deposits are necessary to force those with cash to use it productively .
Instead of reducing taxes on interest payments , the Government could tax all bank deposits and other risk - free savings .
This would create a negative risk - free interest rate , encouraging savers either to invest in property , shares and other productive assets - or simply to save less and consume more .
In either case , the result would be more consumption and physical investment , less unemployment and faster recovery from the slump .
Scary Idea # 2
Today in his press conference , a reporter questioned Obama about Krugman 's criticisms .
Obama said that he is open to the economist 's ideas : " If Paul Krugman has a good idea , in terms of how to spend money efficiently and effectively to jump - start the economy , then we 're going to do it . "
Last month , Krugman told radio host Bill Press that he is " in communications " with the Obama team .
The Obama Gap
Mr. Obama ’s prescription does n’t live up to his diagnosis .
The economic plan he ’s offering is n’t as strong as his language about the economic threat .
In fact , it falls well short of what ’s needed .
Bear in mind just how big the U.S. economy is .
Given sufficient demand for its output , America would produce more than $ 30 trillion worth of goods and services over the next two years .
But with both consumer spending and business investment plunging , a huge gap is opening up between what the American economy can produce and what it ’s able to sell .
And the Obama plan is nowhere near big enough to fill this “ output gap . ”
To close a gap of more than $ 2 trillion — possibly a lot more , if the budget office projections turn out to be too optimistic — Mr. Obama offers a $ 775 billion plan .
And that ’s not enough .
Scary Idea # 3
Thirty years ago , Americans were told that government was part of the problem , not the solution .
We bet on the magic of the marketplace , but the magic proved illusory .
Every major part of the economy — health care , energy , transportation , food and finance — is deeply troubled .
Now we are ready to invite government back in to help solve our problems , if the price is right and the strategies are convincing .
By spending more through government and treating government as a partner rather than an enemy of the private sector , we can potentially save vast sums in the long run through a more efficient health - care system , safer climate , more competitive economy and more secure country .
Although Obama 's tax cuts might stimulate consumer spending — and placate Republicans — any permanent cut would be a huge error , and even short - term tax cuts are an unnecessary risk .
Obama 's long - term success will depend on his ability to lead Americans to a new , even revolutionary consensus that the U.S. government can offer value for money .
What Hath Big Government Wrought ?
It was big government that brought us Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
It was big government that sponsored the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq .
It was big government that gave us nightmare problems we face with Medicaid and Medicare .
It was big government that gave us overlapping hundred billion dollar systems in the Army , Navy , and Air Force .
It is big government that sponsored 10's of thousands of pork barrel projects and bridges to nowhere .
It is big government that gave us the Davis Bacon Act and the insanity pf prevailing wages .
It was big government sponsorship of the rating agencies that created the " AAA " rated securities that went to zero .
It was big government that took us off the gold standard and illegally confiscated citizen 's money .
It was big government that allowed fractional reserve lending and theft by inflation this is the root cause of a shrinking middle class today .
It was big government that created the Fed , and it was the Greenspan Fed that blew serial bubble after bubble culminating in the housing crash we are in today .
Khaled Abed Rabbo in the remains of his family house , destroyed during the three - week Israeli offensive
Grieving Palestinian father says children were killed after family obeyed order from troops to leave Gaza home
By Donald Macintyre in Gaza City
January 21 2009
A Palestinian father has claimed that he saw two of his young daughters shot dead and another critically injured by an Israeli soldier who emerged from a stationary tank and opened fire as the family obeyed an order from the Israeli forces to leave their home .
Khaled Abed Rabbo said Amal , aged two and Suad , seven , were killed by fire from the soldier ’s semi-automatic rifle .
His third daughter , Samer , four , has been evacuated to intensive care in a Belgian hospital after suffering critical spinal injuries which he said were inflicted in the attack early in Israel ’s ground offensive .
Mr Abed Rabbo stood near the wreckage off his subsequently destroyed home on the eastern edge of the northern Gaza town of Jabalya yesterday and described how a tank had parked outside the building at 12.50 pm on 7 January and ordered the family in Arabic through a megaphone to leave building .
He said his 60 - year - old mother had also been shot at as she left waving her white headscarf with her son , daughter in law and her three grandchildren .
“ Two soldiers were on the tank eating chips , then one man came out of the tank with a rifle and started shooting the kids , ” Mr Abed Rabbo , who receives a salary as a policeman from the Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said .
The family say they think the weapon used by the soldier was an M16 and that the first to be shot was Amal .
Mr Abed Rabbo said that Suad was then shot with what he claimed were 12 bullets , and then Samer .
The soldier who fired the rifle had what Mr Abed Rabbo thought were ringlets visible below his helmet , he said .
The small minority of ultra-Orthodox Jews who serve in the army are in a unit which did not take part in the Gaza offensive and only a very small number of settlers who also favour that hairstyle serve in other units .
It has so far been impossible independently to verify Mr Abed Rabbo ’s claim and the military said last night Israeli Defence Forces “ does not target civilians , only Hamas terrorists and infrastructure ” .
It added : “ The IDF is investigating various claims made with regard to Operation Cast Lead and at the end of its investigation will respond accordingly . ”
The district is named Abed Rabbo after the clan who live in most of it .
The dense concrete roof of the house now hangs at more at more than a 45 - degree angle , and at least three other substantial buildings have been flattened in the agricultural , semi-rural immediate neighbourhood .
Khaled Abed Rabbo said that there had been a delay before the ambulance could reach the building because the road from the west had been made impassable by the churning of the tanks .
The soldiers had in the end let the family leave on foot , he said .
He added that they walked two kilometres before finding a vehicle to take them to Kamal Adwan Hospital .
He said : “ I carried Suad , who was dead , my wife carried Amal and my brother Ibrahim carried Samer . ”
He added : “ We are not Hamas .
My children were not Hamas .
And if they were going to shoot anyone it should have been me . ”
He added : “ I want the international community and the International Red Cross to ask Israel why it has done this to us .
They talk about democracy but is it democracy to kill children ?
What did the kids do to them ?
What did my house do to them ?
They destroyed my life ?
Gaza City is showing signs of returning to a form of normality as more shops reopen .
The offices of the main Palestinian telephone company Jawwal reopened though this has not eased severe problems of connectivity on the Palestinian mobile network .
Some Hamas policemen were back directing traffic , though in smaller numbers than before the offensive .
Unconfirmed figures are that 270 Hamas policemen were killed , mainly in the air attacks during the first week .
In a victory rally in Gaza city yesterday , Hamas supporters converged on a square near the remains of the bombed parliament building ..
‘ Heartbreaking ’ :
The ugly face of war
The UN secretary general , looking distressed , described the devastation of Gaza as “ heartbreaking ” on a visit to the area yesterday after the 22 - day Israeli assault .
“ I have seen only a fraction of the destruction , ” said Ban Ki-moon , as he stood in front of a UN warehouse set on fire by Israeli shells last Thursday .
“ This is shocking and alarming .
These are heartbreaking scenes I have seen and I am deeply grieved by what I have seen today . ” he said .
Mr Ban demanded a full investigation into the Israeli shelling of the UN Relief and Works Agency compound .
UN officials say the compound , still smouldering yesterday , was targeted by white phosphorus munitions which are not supposed to be used in densely populated areas because of the harm to civilians .
Mr Ban said the Israeli attacks on UNRWA headquarters and two UN schools in Gaza , one of which killed 40 sheltering Palestinians , were “ outrageous ” .
Amnesty International said Israel ’s repeated use of the munitions despite evidence of their indiscriminate effects and harm to civilians “ is a war crime ” .
The Israeli army has launched an investigation but says Hamas fighters operate from densely populated areas , and used UN buildings as cover for attacks .
Mr Ban said : “ It has been especially troubling and heartbreaking for me as secretary general that I could n’t end this faster , ” he said .
He urged Israel and Hamas to “ exercise maximum restraint and nurture the ceasefire ” .

UN wants all Gaza borders opened
By EDITH M. LEDERER
January 21 2009
U.N. humanitarian chief John Holmes said Tuesday he ’s heading to Gaza .
A top priority will be to get all border crossings opened , he said , not only for food and medicine but for desperately needed construction materials which Israel has refused to allow in since Hamas seized power in June 2007 .
He said “ it ’s absolutely critical ” that cement , pipes and other building materials are “ unbanned ” by Israel and allowed into Gaza to start rebuilding the war - ravaged Palestinian territory .
“ Otherwise , the reconstruction effort wo n’t get off first base , ” Holmes said .
Holmes , who expects to arrive in Israel on Wednesday , told a news conference he will also be pressing Israeli authorities to allow humanitarian staff from international organizations into Gaza .
“ In theory , they have permission , ” he said .
“ In practice , it ’s proving very difficult to get into Gaza . ”
Holmes said Monday that hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid will be needed immediately to help Gaza ’s 1.4 million people and billions of dollars will be required to rebuild its shattered buildings and infrastructure .
Israel launched the war on Dec. 27 in an effort to halt years of militant rocket fire by Hamas on its southern communities and arms smuggling into Gaza .
The Israeli government declared a cease - fire that went into effect early Sunday , and hours later , Hamas agreed to silence its guns , too .
Israel had withdrawn the bulk of its forces from Gaza by Tuesday evening , ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President Barack Obama , but the temporary cease - fire remained shaky .
Holmes said Tuesday the U.N. is “ trying to ramp up the humanitarian efforts in Gaza , ” and while some trucks and fuel are getting into Gaza , the number remains small and “ very inadequate ” compared to the number of trucks allowed in before Hamas seized power .
“ We need more food , wheat grain in particular both for the humanitarian food distribution and for local bakeries , ” Holmes said .
Gaza also needs continuing supplies of fuel for its power plant , for hospital generators and for bakeries to bake bread , he said .
Holmes said a lasting and durable cease - fire and the reopening of all border crossings are essential to get humanitarian aid , commercial goods and construction materials into Gaza .
The temporary cease - fire does n’t include an agreement on the opening of border crossings , he noted .
“ There ’s a lot of talk about it but it does n’t exist yet .
So that ’s one of the points I ’m very keen to pursue when I go there myself later this week , ” Holmes said .
Under an Egyptian - French initiative being discussed , the temporary cease - fire would be followed by separate talks with Israel and Hamas on a permanent cease - fire in which weapons smuggling routes into Gaza would shut down with international help .
Discussions on opening Gaza ’s blockaded border crossings would take place at a later date .
Holmes said construction materials “ were effectively to virtually 100 percent banned from entering into Gaza since the Hamas takeover in 2007 , which meant even before these hostilities a lot of humanitarian projects which had been planned were not able to be completed . ”
He cited the repair of Gaza ’s sewage system , which was further damaged in the latest conflict , as an example .
“ So it ’s absolutely critical that these kind of materials now be allowed into Gaza on a regular … basis … without too much bureaucracy , ” Holmes said .
“ That is something we need to pursue with the Israeli authorities to make sure they are doing that , and that ’s one of the things we ’ll be pursuing . ”
John Ging , head of Gaza operations for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency which helps Palestinian refugees , said that when Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon visited the seriously damaged UNRWA office in Gaza City on Tuesday , representatives of Gaza civic organizations told him the cycle of violence in the territory must end , “ even in terms of building . ”
They want to make sure that “ what is built now will remain standing because many of the buildings that have been destroyed _ the ministry buildings , other vital infrastructure here _ they were built with international money in the last 15 years , and now they ’re piles of rubble , ” he said .
“ What a waste of money , ” Ging said .
“ We unfortunately now have to put money back into building that should be going into further development . ”

Right now , one of the issues with refinancing and first mortgage financing is that it is hard to get approved .
Mortgage applications are way up , but approvals are n't making that much headway .
And those who do get approved are finding that they are not enjoying the mortgage rate they had hoped for .
Mortgage interest rates at multi-year lows
Mortgage interest rates are at multi- year lows — in some cases as low as 4.5 % .
Many mortgage lenders are advertising a low mortgage rate , but it is important to realize that is the best rate .
Not everyone gets that low rate .
In order to get that best rate , you will likely need the following :
Credit score of at least 740 or 750 . of at least 740 or 750 .
* 80 % loan to value ratio ( for refinancing ) . *
At least 5 % to 10 % ( some mortgage lenders asking 15 % or 20 % ) down payment for first time mortgage financing .
Approval is n't as onerous ; you likely only need a credit score of 680 and a 3 % to 5 % down payment , along with adequate income .
However , if you meet only the minimum , you probably will not get the best mortgage rate .
Even so , mortgage interest rates are low enough to make it worth your while — if you can get approved .

This is a brief guide on how to estimate the amounts of staple , calorie dense , foods to be stored at a household scale .
People choose to store food for a number of reasons , including being prepared for an emergency situation and saving money .
Knowing some basic facts about human needs and the nutrient density of different kinds of food can help a family create a food buffer .
However , people consume a great variety of food , and so planning for a household also requires accounting for special dietary needs and preferences .
Given that I may have frightened some readers ( and validated others ) with my post on Scenario 2020 about a breakdown in the " Just - in - Time " delivery system , I thought it would be kind to talk a bit about preparation for transportation hiccups , specifically regarding food supplies .
From what I have seen elsewhere , this food storage guide is unique because it clearly presents the dietary information , with respect to calories , that approximate the quantities of foods to keep .
It is a kind of " bottom up " analysis that the technically - oriented readers of The Oil Drum may appreciate ( or at least I hope so ) .
This guide was originally written with background and summary tables AND a detailed worksheet .
On The Oil Drum pages I will not provide the worksheet , but will attach the original document for those interested in such details .
It may also serve as a useful handout for family , friends , neighbors , community preparedness , and emergency services groups , etc .
Some Basic Nutrition Facts
On average a person needs about 2400 food calories per day , and most people prefer to consume less than 5 lbs of food per day .
Obtaining a proper balance of proteins , vitamins and nutrients , requires a variety of food sources .
Some food comes dry and is prepared in water to make palatable , such as rice and beans , while other foods are usually eaten fresh and full of water weight , such as vegetables and fruits .
The table below shows how a nutritionally balanced diet of about 2400 calories per day can be had by consuming different kinds of foods .
Following the detailed worksheet for planning for the needs of an average adult for one year would approximately yield this table .
This information is useful for planning a household food buffer , including deviations for personal preference .
For example , a vegetarian will have to make up for an absence of meat and eggs by increasing other foods proportionally .
On the other hand , some people prefer more meat and less starch , etc .
The caloric density values given are approximate for the food class .
For example , potatoes have about 350 calories per pound whereas lettuce is only about 50 ( other food classes are not so variable ) .
Estimating Your Needs
This guide ’s worksheet is based on average needs of adults .
Consider whether your family ’s needs approximate the average — for example young children and the elderly eat less food , while teenagers and large men eat more .
A very active adult may need nearly 4000 calories per day .
You may want to use the worksheet to calculate the needs of your household specifically .
Alternatively , three scenarios based on the worksheet are given in the table below that may be similar to your situation ( Scenario 1 approximates the above table , i.e. , 1 person for 1 year ) .
Keeping Food Fresh
This guide emphasizes dry food storage because these foods have the longest shelf life and do n’t require costly preservation methods .
Even dry foods can deteriorate and spoil , with the major causes being incursion of moisture , oxygen , high temperatures , light , and animal infestation .
The following table highlights the shelf life of different food classes stored at room temperature ( 70 degrees F ) and kept dark and dry .
Try to find a place in your home that does n’t fluctuate in temperature very widely and does n’t get above 70 degrees F often — a cellar or basement away from the water heater , or a closet in a cold room , for example .
If you store mainly what you normally eat , then your food is unlikely to spoil .
The best strategy to keep your food stores fresh is therefore one of lifestyle and habits — for example a diet primarily based on whole grains and beans , seasonally available foods , and drawing from bulk household supplies of sweeteners , oils , and preserved out of season produce .
Primarily local sources of meats , egg and dairy products might be healthy additions too .
If you store several months of food or more , clearly label the containers by date and content and always eat from the older stores and refresh periodically to maintain your buffer .
Storage containers need to be “ food grade , ” meaning they wo n’t deteriorate and contaminate food , and be able to seal completely .
A common and inexpensive container is the plastic bucket ( HDPE , type 2 ) with a rubber gasket lid manufactured specifically for holding food .
( Used buckets may be contaminated with non-food items and so only new buckets are recommended ) .
Bucket lids may need a prying wrench to open , or a more expensive option is to buy screw top lids .
You may want a scooper to remove grain from 5 gallon buckets and into kitchen containers .
Alternatives to the plastic bucket include one or half gallon glass jars and metal cans , but these are not as widely available .
Grains and dry beans can be treated in various ways to slow the rate of deterioration and reduce the risk of pest colonization .
“ High tech ” methods include placing oxygen absorber packets , flushing with dry ice , carbon dioxide or nitrogen , and vacuum sealing in mylar bags .
These might be good choices for items you intend to keep for many years and not open .
Otherwise , several “ low tech ” and less expensive options exist .
Two bay laurel leaves per gallon of grain may keep bugs away ( perhaps fewer leaves with the native and more pungent California Bay Laurel ) .
Mix one cup of diatomaceous earth per 40 lbs of grains or beans to prevent insect outbreaks ( be sure to buy the organic version suited for gardening , not pool filters , and wear a mask when handling ) .
Keeping waterproof buckets outside during a hard frost each year will likely kill any bug larvae that may be inside .

Brazilian authorities rescued more than 4,500 slaves from captivity last year , carrying out a record number of raids on remote ranches and plantations , according to figures released this week by the country 's work ministry .
The government said its anti-slavery taskforce , a roaming unit designed to crack down on modern - day slavery , had freed 4,634 workers from slave - like conditions in 2008 .
The taskforce , which often works with armed members of the federal police , said it had undertaken 133 missions and visited 255 different farms in 2008 .
The ministry said former slaves had been paid £ 2.4 m in compensation .
Brazil officially abolished slavery in 1888 but activists believe thousands of impoverished Brazilians are still being lured into debt slavery .
Leonardo Sakamoto , head of a Sao Paulo - based NGO , said slavery remained a big problem despite growing attempts to eradicate it during the government of leftwing president Luiz Inacio " Lula " da Silva .
" It is a very sad situation that leaves you feeling impotent .
The federal government has acted - but having slave labour in a country where the wealth is so evident is a very painful contradiction , " said Sakamoto , who is a member of Brazil 's National Commission for the Eradication of Slave Labour and runs the NGO Repórter Brasil .
Many of Brazil 's slave workers come from the impoverished backlands of north - eastern Brazil , where unemployment is high .
Rounded up by middlemen who promise them employment , the workers are packed on to coaches and taken to remote farms , often in the Amazon or Brazil 's midwest .
Once there , the slaves are put to work producing charcoal , cutting sugar cane or clearing tracts of Amazon rainforest for cattle ranchers .
Housed in isolated and often squalid jungle camps , they are forced to work until they have paid off debts for food , medicine and housing .
Many lose contact with their families .
Activists claim that ranchers in the Amazon often employ small armies of gunmen to stop workers fleeing .
During a visit to Sao Felix do Xingu , a remote Amazon settlement notorious for illegal deforestation and slave labour , the Guardian met members of the CPT , a Catholic land commission , which often tips off the anti-slavery taskforce .
Maria Nizan de Souza , a CPT representative , said it was common to hear stories of workers being murdered after demanding payment from their employers .
She said one rural worker had told her he had seen the body of a colleague floating in a river , bound to a tractor tyre , after he had tried to flee .
Sakamoto said that while the government offered financial benefits to those rescued from slavery , more initiatives to counter poverty and unemployment in the north - east of the country were needed to prevent people from becoming slaves in the first place .
It was summer in London – warm , clear skies and we had just finished an amazing day of sightseeing .
I was on a once - in - a - lifetime trip with some of my best friends .
It stayed bright until late in the day so even though it was already evening , the sky was lit up with color .
As we entered the tube station surrounded by other tourists jabbering in different languages , I heard a busker strumming Oasis ’ Wonderwall on his guitar down the hall and singing the first verse –
Today is gonna be the day
That they ’re gonna throw it back to you
By now you should ’ve somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I do n’t believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
– Oasis – Wonderwall from ( What ’s the Story ) Morning Glory
We tossed in a few coins and kept walking .
After we passed and he finished the verse , he went silent for a few seconds .
We were almost to our platform when I heard him start strumming again .
I assumed he was going to continue the song – but he did n’t .
Instead , he began singing the opening verse again –
Today is gonna be the day
That they ’re gonna throw it back to you …
He Does n’t Know The Lyrics ?
We could n’t believe it .
Surely he knew the lyrics ?
I ’m pretty sure our busker knew the whole song .
So …
Why not play it all the way through – why repeat the verse ?
Well let ’s take a step back : what matters in this situation ?
Two things :
First , making sure the “ customer ” is happy .
Second : making sure your busking is as profitable as possible
Let ’s dig a little deeper : who are his customers ?
Are they all locals ?
Are they tourists ?
Are they in a hurry , or sitting around ?
In this case – I know the answer .
We were mostly tourists , leaving a tourist destination to get back to our hotels .
So with that important context and information , the reason he kept playing the first verse is this I believe is this :
Playing the first verse over and over again made most people happier , and was more profitable than playing the full song .
Many people know the beginning of Wonderwall , and he probably discovered that tourists tipped more often when they recognized the song in the brief few seconds as they walked by .
This sounds like a lesson in business in marketing … but I think it ’s broader than that
The Lesson : Focus On What Matters
In the busker ’s case , what mattered in that specific situation was giving the customers a show they enjoyed .
If people were standing around to watch him play , I have no doubt he would have kept singing and completed the whole song .
But when your have mostly tourists , in London , walking to a train – they do n’t have time or need a 5 minute song … but a lot of them will enjoy a 30 second verse they recognize and tip him for it .
For that specific situation , for that specific context : he had learned the best thing to do was to pay attention to what actually mattered to those people – a short , entertaining verse .
Focus On What Matters In Each Situation and Context
In your life , you ’ll probably find yourself in a situation where for one reason or another you ’ll forget the context or lose focus , and you might start down a path that you did n’t intend to .
When that happens , it ’s important to zoom out , get some context so you can focus on what matters and what the end result is you were going after .
End Results and Examples
For example , sometimes you might start a discussion to try to improve some process at work – but the conversation deteriorates into trying to find who is to blame , and perhaps personal attacks .
It ’s time to take a step back : because none of that really matters , what you ’re trying to do is make things better .
Or another example – I ’ll open up my email , start replying , and then that reply reminds me of something else that I was talking to the same person about .
I might then go open a new tab to research that …and then end up being drawn into that whole separate issue .
Now I ’ve wasted time researching a tangent , and depending on how time sensitive my reply was to them – I ’ve cost them valuable time as well .
I ’ve got to focus on what matters : getting back to my friend or client or family and focus on the specific topic of that email .
Context Matters
So the context really matters .
It ’s very important to remember what it is that you ’re trying to do , what matters – and stay focused on that .
It ’s not that there is always a right thing to do – but there is very often a right thing that needs to be focused on for that specific task .
Take a step back , look at the bigger picture and ask yourself : what are my main goals for what I ’m doing in this situation ?
Why am I taking these actions ?
If you can do that and get some context , you ’ll find it much easier to then identify exactly what outcome you ’re looking for .
That in turn helps you figure out what needs to be done – and focus on what matters .

Are you running MySQL on Debian or Ubuntu with InnoDB ?
You might want to disable / etc / mysql / debian - start .
When you run / etc / init.d / mysql start it runs this script , which runs mysqlcheck , which can destroy performance .
It can happen on a server with MyISAM tables , if there are enough tables , but it is far worse on InnoDB .
There are a few reasons why this happens — access to open an InnoDB table is serialized by a mutex , for one thing , and the mysqlcheck script opens all tables .
One at a time .
It ’s pretty easy to get into a “ perfect storm ” scenario .
For example , I ’m working with one client right now who has a hosted multi-tenanting application that keeps each customer in its own database .
So they have a lot of databases and a lot of tables .
And they ’re running on Amazon EC2 with 8G of RAM and EBS storage , which is slower than typical directly - attached server - grade RAID storage .
Since they have a lot of tables , InnoDB uses over 3.5G of memory for its data dictionary ( the subject for another post — we ’re working on a fix ) and so we ca n’t make the buffer pool as large as we ’d like to .
To avoid physical I/O all the time we need to get some reasonable amount of data into the buffer pool .
But we have to do this without death - by - swapping , which would be extremely slow on this machine , so we need to stop the buffer pool and the OS cache from competing .
My chosen strategy for this was to set innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT .
We could also tune the OS , but in my experience that ’s not as effective when you ’re really pushing to get memory into the buffer pool .
Remember we have 3.5G of memory less to play with , solely due to the data dictionary .
But this strategy will only reduce physical reads if the buffer pool follows a typical access pattern .
That is , some of the data is in your working set and will stay in the buffer pool , some small part of it will move in and out of the buffer pool , and some wo n’t be needed .
And that ’s where the Debian startup script breaks down entirely , because it does n’t follow this pattern .
It ’s going to open every table , regardless of whether user queries require it or not .
On big servers I ’ve seen it literally run for days ( or longer ) .
In the meanwhile , it ’ll interfere with everything else going on .
Look what happens :

Everyone is waiting for mutexes , and they are all waiting for thread 1158064464 which has reserved it .
If you hunt through the TRANSACTIONS section , you can see the OS thread IDs , and that one is the debian - sys - maint thread .
You also see the other threads :

And correlating the thread ID back to the semaphores , you see thread 1159956816 is waiting for the semaphore .
Notice that this is effectively a global lock .
The debian - sys - maint thread is not touching the same tables as the other queries ; it ’s just touching the same internal structures .
So a user working on table A can interfere with a user that wants access to table B .
The real solution is to disable this startup process .
It ’s not even needed for InnoDB .
Sooner or later you ’ll find yourself fighting with it .
You can just put “ exit 0 ; ” at the top .
The solution I chose in this case ?
mysql > KILL 7 ; 1 mysql > KILL 7 ;
Immediately afterward everything cleared up .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama told military leaders on Wednesday to make additional arrangements to execute a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq .
On his first day in office the new president met with military and national security advisers to discuss the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq .
“ During the discussion , I asked the military leadership to engage in additional planning necessary to execute a responsible military drawdown from Iraq , ” Obama said in a statement after the meeting .
Pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq was a cornerstone of Obama ’s campaign for the presidency , during which the war was a top concern of voters until it was eclipsed by the economy .
Obama said the meeting was productive and he would consult with the military leaders at the Pentagon in the coming days and weeks to discuss the issues further .
“ We will undertake a full review of the situation in Afghanistan in order to develop a comprehensive policy for the entire region , ” he said .

Goldman Sachs ready to hand out £ 7bn salary and bonus package ... after its £ 6bn bail - out
U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs
HQ which has set aside £ 7bn for bonuses and salaries this year
Goldman Sachs is on course to pay its top City bankers multimillion - pound bonuses - despite asking the U.S. government for an emergency bail - out .
The struggling Wall Street bank has set aside £ 7 billion for salaries and 2008 year - end bonuses , it emerged yesterday .
Each of the firm 's 443 partners is on course to pocket an average Christmas bonus of more than £ 3 million .
The size of the pay pool comfortably dwarfs the £ 6.1 billion lifeline which the U.S. government is throwing to Goldman as part of its £ 430 billion bail - out .
As Washington pours money into the bank , the cash will immediately be channelled to Goldman 's already well - heeled employees .
News of the firm 's largesse will revive the anger over the ' rewards for failure ' culture endemic in the world of high finance .
The same bankers who have brought the global economy to its knees seem to pocketing the same kind of rewards they got during the boom years .
Gordon Brown has vowed to crack down on the culture of greed in the City as part of his £ 500 billion bail - out of the UK banking industry .
But that wo n't affect the estimated 100 London partners working at Goldman Sachs 's London headquarters .
The firm - known as Golden Sacks for the bumper bonuses it pay its top bankers - is expected to cut the payouts by a third this year .
However , profits are
falling much faster .
Earnings have plunged 47 per cent so far this year amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
This has wiped more than 50 per cent off the company 's market value .
The news comes after it was revealed that even bankers working for collapsed Wall Street giant , Lehman Brothers , could receive huge payouts .
Its 10,000 U.S. staff are expected to share a £ 1.5 billion bonus pool .
The payouts were agreed as part of the rescue takeover of Lehman 's American arm by Barclays last month .
The blockbuster handouts caused consternation among London employees of the firm , many of whom have now lost their jobs .
Even workers at the nationalised Northern Rock will scoop bonuses worth up to £ 50 million over the next three years .
The extraordinary handouts include more than £ 400,000 for Rock 's boss , Gary Hoffman , who is likely to become Britain 's best - paid public sector worker .
The majority of Northern Rock 's 4,000 workers will receive four separate bonus payments - the first of
which will be made next March .
Staff will get an extra 10 per cent on top of their basic salary .
Lloyds TSB also intends to pay its employees bonuses despite taking a £ 5.5 billion emergency cash injection from the taxpayer .
News of Goldman 's bonus plan came as the firm promoted 92 of its bankers to partner level .
A quarter are based in Fleet Street , London .
Partnership is the holy grail of the investment banking world as the exclusive club shares around a fifth of the firm 's total bonus pool .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo last night warned that Wall Street firms taking government - money risk breaking the law if they hand the cash straight back to employees .
Cash - strapped workers are being penalised by pay rises which are far below the soaring cost of living , research reveals today .
Despite inflation soaring to a 16 - year - high of 5.2 per cent , the average worker got a pay rise of just 3.8 per cent in September .
The research , from the pay specialists Incomes Data Services , highlights the financial problems facing millions of workers .
Most of their household bills , particularly food and fuel , are rocketing by up to 35 per cent .
However , their meagre pay rise does not begin to cover the extra cost .
The majority of the 50 pay settlements investigated by IDS were in the private sector covering around 1.1 million employees .
They range from just 2 per cent for workers at the BBC to 5.3 per cent for workers at a firm of dockyard workers .
Incomes Data Services warned pay rises are likely to fall even further over the coming year as inflation is expected to drop sharply .
Economists predict inflation will fall below the Government 's 2 per cent target next year .

Tamarkan , Thailand .
c. 1945 .
Train crossing the wooden bridge which spanned the Mae Klong River ( renamed Kwai Yai River in 1960 ) .
Begun in October 1942 , using prisoner of war ( POW ) labour , it was completed and operational by early February 1943 .
Both the wooden and the adjacent steel bridge were subjected to numerous air raids between January and June 1945 .
POW labour was used to repair the wooden bridge on each occasion .
Tamarkan is fifty five kilometres north of Nong Pladuk ( also known as Non Pladuk ) , or five kilometres north of Kanchanaburi .
( Donor A. Mackinnon ) Tamarkan , Thailand .
c. October 1945 .
Located fifty five kilometres north of Nong Pladuk ( also known as Non Pladuk ) , 359 kilometres south of Thanbyuzayat , and five kilometres north of Kanchanaburi ( Kanburi ) .
The photograph shows the two bridges built by the Japanese , using prisoner of war ( POW ) labour , which spanned the Mae Klong river ( renamed Kwa Yai river in 1960 ) .
The wooden trestle bridge was completed in February 1943 , and the steel bridge in April 1943 .
This eleven span bridge had been dismantled by the Japanese and brought to Tamarkan from Java in 1942 .
Both bridges wee subjected to numerous attacks by Allied aircraft during the period December 1944 to June 1945 .
One span of the steel bridge was destroyed in a raid mid February 1945 .
Two more spans were dropped during raids between April and June 1945 .

The Bridge on the River Kwai , the movie The Bridge on the River Kwai ( 1957 ) , the memorable , epic World War II adventure / action , anti-war drama , was the first of director David Lean 's major multi-million dollar , wide - screen super - spectaculars ( his later epics included Lawrence of Arabia ( 1962 ) and Doctor Zhivago ( 1965 ) ) .
The screenplay was based upon French author Pierre Boulle 's 1954 novel of the same name .
[ Boulle was better known for his screenplay for Planet of the Apes ( 1963 ) . ]
Although he received sole screenplay credit , other deliberately uncredited , blacklisted co-scripting authors ( exiled Carl Foreman - who scripted High Noon ( 1952 ) - and Michael Wilson ) had collaborated with him , but were denied elibigility .
They were post - humously credited years later , in late 1984 , in a special Academy ceremony .

[ The film 's story was loosely based on a true World War II incident , and the real - life character of Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey .
One of a number of Allied POW's , Toosey was in charge of his men from late 1942 through May 1943 when they were ordered to build two Kwai River bridges in Burma ( one of steel , one of wood ) , to help move Japanese supplies and troops from Bangkok to Rangoon .
In reality , the actual bridge took 8 months to build ( rather than two months ) , and they were actually used for two years , and were only destroyed two years after their construction - in late June 1945 .
The memoirs of the ' real ' Colonel Nicholson were compiled into a 1991 book by Peter Davies entitled The Man Behind the Bridge . ]
The film was the number one box - office success of the year ( the highest grossing film ) and it won critical acclaim as well - eight Academy Award nominations and seven Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Actor ( Alec Guinness ) , Best Director , Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium ( Pierre Boulle ) , Best Cinematography , Best Score , and Best Film Editing .
Only Sessue Hayakawa , a former silent screen star and one of the first important Asian stars , who was nominated for his Best Supporting Actor role as the hot - tempered Japanese colonel , lost .
The film created an additional stir when it debuted on ABC television on September 25 , 1966 .
The date was dubbed " Black Sunday " due to the loss of business at movie theatres on account of its popular airing .

Tamarkan POW camp was located adjacent to both the bridges and a nearby Japanese anti-aircraft battery .
It also suffered during these air raids , the worst being on 29 November 1944 .
During this attack on the Ack Ack battery , three bombs overcarried and demolished the top ends of POW huts 1 and 2 , burying a number of the occupants .
The POW casualties numbered nineteen killed and sixty eight wounded .
During a four hour attack on the bridges and Ack Ack battery on 5 February 1945 , a further fifteen POWs were injured .
The camp site was littered with great fragments of shrapnel , and one hut and the canteen were burnt to the ground .
On 14 February 1945 , the Japanese evacuated the remaining POWs to the Chungkai camp which was located approximately two kilometres north on Kanchanaburi , on the bank of the River Kwai Noi .

1 . During the Second World War the Japanese Army constructed a military railway line branching off the southern line at Nong Pladuk ( also known as Non Pladuk ) Station , Km.64+196 .
This line crossed over the River Kwae Yai at Kanchanaburi , traversed along the bank of Kwae Noi River , cut across the Thai - Burma border at Chedi Sam Ong , continued on into Burma and joined the Burma railway line at Thanbyuzayat .
The total length of line constructed was 419 kms. , being in Thailand 303.95 kms. and in Burma 111.05 kms .
2 . Construction work started in October 1942 .
A year later on 23 October 1943 rail laying was completed .
About 60,000 men consisting of Indian , Burmese , Malaysian , Indonesian , Chinese and Thai labourers as well as prisoners of war took part in the construction work .

Strengthened and rebuilt to the original design in the post - war years , the viaduct forms part of the railway which is still operational as far as Namtok ( Tarsau ) .
4 . In speeding up construction work the Japanese Army built a temporary railway bridge across the River Kwae Yai downstream close to the existing bridge .
After completion of the existing bridge composing of 11 steel spans with the rest of timber spans , the temporary bridge was dismantled to ease off river traffic inconvenience .
Three steel spans nos .

After taking over the line the State Railway of Thailand replaced the three damaged spans with two steel spans and changed all timber spans at the far end with six steel spans .
5 . When the war come [ sic ] to an end in 1945 the British Army dismantled 3.95 kms. of track at the Thai - Burma border .
The remaining length of 300 kms. was handed over to the State Railway of Thailand in 1947 .
With due and careful consideration in regard to transport economic as well as other aspects , the State Railway of Thailand was authorised to dismantle the track from the end of the line to Nam Tok Station and to upgrade the remaining length of 130.204 kms. to Nong Pladuk Station conforming to operational permanent way standard .
Subsequently , the section between Nong Pladuk and Kanchanaburi Stations was officially opened to traffic on 24 June 1949 , between Kanchanaburi and Wang Pho Stations on 1 April 1952 and the last section from Wang Pho to Nam Tok Stations on 1 July 1958 .

History + Comedy = Rothbard By Bryan Caplan
For centuries , the State ( or more strictly , individuals acting in their roles as “ members of the government ” ) has cloaked its criminal activity in high - sounding rhetoric .
For centuries the State has committed mass murder and called it “ war ” ; then ennobled the mass slaughter that “ war ” involves .
For centuries the State has enslaved people into its armed battalions and called it “ conscription ” in the “ national service . ”
For centuries the State has robbed people at bayonet point and called it “ taxation . ”
In fact , if you wish to know how libertarians regard the State and any of its acts , simply think of the State as a criminal band , and all of the libertarian attitudes will logically fall into place .
– Murray Rothbard , For a New Liberty
If anything is simultaneously obvious and brilliant , it is Rothbard ’s insight that governments are glorified gangs of criminals .
How can anyone who knows the basic facts of history disagree ?
If you strip virtually any chapter of world history down to a postcard , it ’s a story of vicious murderers killing each other in order to enslave nearby civilians .
Nearly every guy nicknamed “ the Great ” was a serial killer on a massive scale – and not the nice kind , either .
If all this is so obvious , why do n’t most works of history have a Rothbardian flavor ?
The answer , in short , is that most historians are serious .
When they tell the story of William the Conqueror , for example , they take a considered , pompous tone , and treat all the key historical players with respect .
They ’ve usually got their facts straight , of course .
But they do n’t want to write the “ story of William the Mass Murderer , ” so they briefly mention his body count , then move on to William ’s land titling policy .
It is because of these shortcomings of traditional history that I enthusiastically recommend the complete Cartoon History of the Universe series by Larry Gonick .
While he relays the same facts as an orthodox historian , Gonick is a comedian who freely ridicules the great and powerful .
When an historical figure makes an inane mistake , Gonick draws him as a doofus .
When an historical figure murders millions , Gonick draws him as a blood - soaked tyrant .
And when an historical figure puts out the eyes of his predecessor … well , you get the idea .
Gonick is the ultimate Actonian , for he never stops reminding us that , “ Great men are almost always bad men . ”
But wait , there ’s more !
Cartoon history also turns out to be excellent pedagogy .
I ’ve read many traditional works of Chinese history , but nothing sticks .
Gonick ’s cartoon history of ancient China , in contrast , is so vivid that it has a real chance of becoming part of my mental furniture .
If I had my way , every elementary school in the country would dump traditional “ serious ” history in favor of Gonick cartoon histories .
Not only would our children actually learn the material ; they ’d learn to treat history ’s “ great leaders ” with the respect they deserve .

When a woman has a mastectomy to remove breast cancer in one breast , what should she do about the other breast ?
Her first breast cancer may hold some clues , according to a new study , published in the advance online edition of Cancer .
" Not every woman who has breast cancer will get another breast cancer in the opposite breast , " researcher Kelly Hunt , MD , tells WebMD .
" We tried to distill down some of those factors with our study and figure out which ones may be the most important ones , " says Hunt , a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center .
But the findings do n't amount to a checklist for getting a preventive mastectomy ; breast cancer experts say that 's still a personal decision that each patient must weigh with her doctors .

The Latter - Day Saints ( LDS ) church contributed a significant amount of money and effort to endorse PROP 8 in California via its network of church , media , and community outlets enshrining discrimination under the law for thousands of Californians and their families .
This initiative will cause great emotional and financial harm to thousands of California couples and their families who will not enjoy spousal rights under the law as granted different - sexed married couples .
In exchange for their legislative efforts , the LDS church 's tax - exempt status should be revoked by the IRS .
" In general , no organization , including a church , may qualify for IRC section 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status if a substantial part of its activities is attempting to influence legislation ( commonly known as lobbying ) .
" ( See : http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1828.pdf
I believe the church 's involvement in YES ON 8 is in violation of Federal Tax code .
Another example is the influence by church leaders in the 1996 same - sex initiative in Hawaii ( see : http://www.lds-mormon.com/article9.shtml ) and the 1998 same - sex marriage initiative in Alaska .
( see : http://www.lds-mormon.com/gaylds.shtml
The petition has nothing to do with the tenets of the church itself but only in the context of contributing funds , providing a de facto bully pulpit , and motivating satellite churches across state lines to influence key political processes and outcomes .
Your prompt attention to these serious violations of the tax - exempt 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status is greatly appreciated .
Every day this week I ’ve gone to the computer and googled the same question : “ How many attackers Mumbai ? ”
And I still have n’t gotten anything like a straight answer .
Of course the official Indian story is “ ten . ” Right .
Ten guys , kids by the look of them in the closed - circuit tv pictures , did all that ?
Well … that ’s not actually impossible .
I ’m not one of these people that underestimate the bloodlust and craziness of ten teenagers with some basic training , a good plan , AKs with plenty of ammo , and heads full of cocaine ’n ’ Quran .
That ’s a powerful cocktail , that cocaine / Quran mix .
They ’ll have to come up with a good street name for it , something like Mecca - chino .
Keeps you awake and firing for two days straight .
Some parts of the story have been pretty well confirmed , like the guess that these guys were Kashmiris from Lashkar - e - Tayyiba .
I suspected that ’s what these Mumbaikar eyewitnesses were hinting at when they described the attackers as “ pale ” and “ foreign - looking . ”
If you ’ve seen their pictures , you ’ll see they were n’t exactly pale by , say , Scottish standards , but to Mumbaikars they did look pale , like Kashmiris from up there where you have to wear a sweater a few weeks a year .
Then there was the fact that the attackers carried almonds to munch .
Almonds are the “ State Tree ” of Kashmir , believe it or not .
But as for numbers , that ’s where the official story wears kind of thin .
Ten guys did all that ?
Excuse me if I snicker .
Of course the Mumbai police and Indian government would like to stick to that number because they only have nine bodies and one live prisoner .
So if there were only ten guys , total , then they ’re all accounted for , it ’s a wrap , and we can all go on with our lives and drop embarrassing questions about where the rest went .
Not to mention how come it took so long for the anti-terrorist Black Cats ( Dudes , change that name ! ) to arrive , etc .
Unfortunately for the Delhi bureaucrats , there ’s a very good source , this ex-CIA analyst lady named Farhana Ali , who says she has definite info that there were at least 23 attackers .
That sounds like a more reasonable number to me .
And the evidence keeps piling up for a big attacking force , like the fact that they ’ve discovered a second dinghy used to ferry the attackers into the city from their hijacked trawler .
And then of course there ’s the fact that they did so much damage in so many different locations .
That ’s what made me guess , in the column I wrote while the attacks were in progress , that there were probably about 70 attackers .
When I wrote that , I took the news reports of ten different sites that had been attacked to mean that there were ten separate sieges taking place in different locations in Mumbai .
It turns out that , because the cops turned and ran like rabbits at the first shots , the attackers were able to walk down the middle of the damn street from one attack to the next , throwing grenades and shooting everyone in sight , like the two cokehead jihadis who walked into Leopold ’s café , killed everyone they could , then strolled over to the Taj Mahal Hotel complex .
But were those two the only attackers in the Taj Mahal ?
If you were watching the news , you ’ll remember that this is one of those incredibly gigantic old stone hotels that take up a whole city block .
The place is solid and huge ; no matter how many grenades went off in there , no matter how many fires started , it held up through days of fighting .
It ’s hard to imagine that two kids who strolled over from the café held it by themselves , especially since there ’s also a story going around that the attackers had an inside confederate who was working in the Taj ’s kitchen .
( I ca n’t find the link for that story .
Anybody got one ? )
It ’ll take a while for us to get a really solid number for the attackers .
Too many people in authority in Mumbai and Delhi and Islamabad have reasons to keep the picture blurry for now .
One thing that ’s clear is that for all this talk about hi-tech “ force multipliers , ” these guys gave the whole world a lesson in how to multiply a miserable force , half a platoon of half - trained kids , into something with the power of a tactical nuke .
Ten village kids from Kashmir gave a whole huge city a stroke it ’ll take years to recover from , with a simple set of tactics .
You may not like these tactics , but we ’d better notice them .
This habit of “ It ’s not moral so I ’ll pretend it is n’t happening ” really gets me down .
So like it or not , listen up : the attacks showed what a lot of hostage - taking urban sieges have shown already : if you ’re going to do one of these sieges , you have to kill ruthlessly , kill everyone in the enemy city from the moment you jam your clip in to the moment you die .
Do n’t ask questions , do n’t ask who ’s a Muslim ( at least 40 Muslims were killed in Mumbai ; these dudes were n’t counting turbans ) ; kill everyone .
Then hole up in the highest - value target you can find , because by doing that you , the half - trained guerrilla kid , go from a low - value military asset to a very high - value one .
You take on the value of the target , because they ’ll have to destroy it to get you .
If you think that ’s an exaggeration or something , here ’s a quote from the instructions the Mumbai attackers were given :
“ … open random fire , kill as many people as you can , take hostages , then go to a vantage location and stay put . ”

No -one was hurt in the synagogue attack in Saint - Denis
Two petrol bombs have been thrown at a synagogue north of Paris , police have said , days after another French synagogue was attacked .
Police in the Seine - Saint - Denis region said no injuries were caused , but a restaurant next door to the synagogue was damaged .
Interior Minister Michele Alliot - Marie said the attack was " intolerable " .
The incident came amid tensions in France over the violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza , now in its 17th day .
Ms Alliot - Marie vowed to find and punish those who carried out the attack in Saint - Denis on Sunday .
French officials have been keen to stress to Jewish and Muslim community leaders that the unrest in Gaza should not lead to violence in France .
Protests against Israel 's military action in Gaza attracted more than 100,000 people in France during the weekend .
In last week 's attack , a burning car was rammed into a synagogue in the south - western French city of Toulouse .
The car , packed with a petrol bomb , was set alight and then pushed into the synagogue door by a second car .
No - one was hurt in that attack .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian ballerina Olga Lepeshinskaya , who danced for decades at the Bolshoi Theater and captured the attention of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin , died on Saturday at the age of 92 .
Born in Kiev in 1916 , Lepeshinskaya joined the Bolshoi ballet troupe in 1933 and for the next 30 years became known for her starring roles in “ Don Quixote ” and “ The Nutcracker . ”
Stalin watched her perform at Moscow ’s 18th - century Bolshoi Theater several times and she was widely reported to have been his favorite ballerina .
She continued to dance at the Bolshoi into the 1960s .
“ It is a huge loss for national culture , and for Russian ballet in particular , ” Itar - Tass agency quoted Vladimir Vasilyev , the former chief choreographer at the Rome Opera house , as saying .
Lepeshinskaya died in her Moscow home in her sleep and will be buried on Tuesday , Russian agencies said .
The government said President Dmitry Medvedev sent his condolences to Lepeshinskaya ’s friends and family .

This morning I stopped at Starbucks for a treat – a soy gingerbread latte .
As I walked through the door berating myself for not bringing my travel mug , I noticed again all of the disposable cups and associated waste we now accept as part of our morning coffee ritual .
Over 50 % of adult Americans , more than 150 million people , consume coffee daily .
That ’s a lot of joe , and a huge opportunity to caffeinate more sustainably .
Here are a few tips to green your morning coffee .
1. Brew Your Coffee at Home
Or , in the words of Bon Appetit , become your own barista .
In addition to reducing landfill waste , you ’ll save money and have more control over the beans you brew , not to mention any sweetener or milk you add .
I ’m currently in love with coffee made with a French press , and ask for a medium grind when I buy beans at my local specialty roaster .
2. Support Sustainable Coffee Farms
Whether you ’re brewing at home or buying a cup , pay attention to where your coffee comes from .
Rainforest Alliance - certified coffee , for example , is grown sustainably on farms that meet high social and environmental standards .
Meanwhile , the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center ( SMBC ) offers the only certification for 100 % organic shade - grown coffee .
Avoid supermarket brands with poor environmental records .
3. Check Your Coffee Shop ’s Street Cred
Coffee shops are increasingly under pressure to green their operations .
Choose one that is upfront about its buying practices and sustainability .
Starbucks shares its corporate responsibility , as do several of the larger chains .
Smaller specialty stores and roasters often develop lasting relationships with small coffee farmers , and should be more than happy to discuss their practices with you .
Bring awareness to your morning coffee , and start your day with a more sustainable sip !

Pot - growing charges against a Toronto man were tossed out this week after an Ontario court judge found police inserted “ cut and paste … fluff ” and used a stereotype about Asian people in order to obtain a search warrant .
In his written ruling , Judge William Bassel said given the “ boiler plate ” information used by police that had “ no connection to the investigation in question , ” he had no choice but to exclude the evidence of 600 marijuana plants found on Dec. 11 , 2006 in the west - end house at 26 Poynter Dr .
“ There was no urgency in obtaining the warrant and the steps taken suggests an almost rubber stamp , ” he wrote in the 26 - page ruling .
“ A search warrant ’s reach is so serious and so intrusive that there is an objective that must be met , and if that objective is not sought and recognized by the police , the very rationale and heart of the protection of Section 8 will be relegated to the dustbin . ”
Section 8 of the Charter Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides everyone in Canada with protection against unreasonable search and seizure .
All drug - related charges against Tien Van Nguyen were withdrawn after the ruling .
Defence lawyer Kim Schofield challenged the constitutional validity of the warrant , which was issued after her client was arrested and his house searched .
“ People would be shocked if they knew the ease at which the police can obtain a search warrant to enter a private residence , ” Schofield said yesterday .
Bassel noted police became interested in the dwelling after an anonymous tipster advised , that the “ front yard is looked after enough to avoid suspicion ” and “ two years ago Asian people bought the house . ”
The police also cited hydro records showing the average consumption for the preceding five months was 80.566 kWH , compared to the average 38 and 39 kWH used in neighbouring homes .
The judge questioned the reference to Asians : “ What possible relevance can the fact that the supposed owners are Asians have , other than to subtly mark this fact as an improper stereotypical message … that here goes again yet another Asian grow operation ? ”

EDMONTON , Alberta , Dec. 2 ( UPI ) --
A move is afoot by Canadian student atheists and agnostics to have references to God removed from the University of Alberta 's convocation ceremony .
For more than 100 years , the chancellor 's address to the graduates has included the call for graduates use their degrees " for the glory of God , " the Edmonton Journal reported .

Monday night , the U of A Atheists and Agnostics group petitioned a committee to change the wording to a compromise that encourages graduates to use their degrees " for the uplifting of the whole people ; to inspire the human spirit ; for all who believe , to serve your God ; and to pursue more steadfastly whatsoever things are true . "
Ian Bushfield , president of the atheists and agnostics society said he was disappointed any reference to God had to be made in the compromise wording , but Andrew Chan of the group Christians in Action Bible Study told the newspaper it was reasonable .
" For those who believe , they will still have their faith recognized as part of their schooling , " he said .
" For those who do n't , it still asks them to use their degree for the betterment of mankind . "
Further debate on the wording is scheduled for Jan. 26 .
Fifty - two people were killed at the Taj hotel , Indian officials say Guests trapped in a Mumbai hotel seized by gunmen last month have told the BBC they were given instructions by police that may have led to more people dying .
A survivor who had been hiding at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel said some guests were shot and killed by the militants after police said it was safe to leave .
The senior policeman in charge of the operation in the hotel has denied the allegations against his officers .
The attacks left at least 173 people dead , including nine of the 10 gunmen .
India blames Pakistan - based militants Lashkar - e- Taiba ( LeT ) for the 26 November attacks .
LeT and the Pakistani government have denied any involvement .
Two of the hotels caught up in the attacks , the Trident - Oberoi and Taj Mahal Palace , are to re-open on Sunday .
Armed guards and sniffer dogs have been stationed at both hotels and X - ray machines are to screen guests ' bags .
' Suspicious '
A prominent Mumbai gynaecologist , Dr Prashant Mangeshikar , was trapped in the Taj Mahal hotel along with hundreds of other guests as gunmen stormed into the building , firing indiscriminately .
Terrified , he and others barricaded themselves into a room and waited .
I refused to move away and the people who ran ahead of me , about 20 or 30 of them , all of them died
Dr Prashant Mangeshikar
Mumbai attack hotels greet guests
How Mumbai attacks unfolded Eventually , in the early hours of the morning , police officers made it through to where they were hiding and told people it was safe to leave the hotel because the gunmen were cornered on another floor .
Some went ahead but Dr Mangeshikar held back .
" I was a little suspicious that the police were actually sending these guys down a different route where the terrorists were supposed to be , " he told the BBC's Adam Mynott .
" I refused to move away and the people who ran ahead of me , about 20 or 30 of them , all of them died . "
A dress designer from the city says her aunt was shot dead and her cousin seriously wounded because they followed police instructions to try to leave .
The designer , Shilpa , described the police conduct as disgraceful .
They had no right , she said , to risk people 's lives .
Hotels re-open
The senior policeman in charge of the operation in the hotel has denied these allegations against his officers .
But they add to growing criticism of the police and how they responded to the attack , says our correspondent .
The government of India 's Maharashtra state has already announced an investigation into two senior policemen over alleged failure to act on warnings of the attacks .
India 's interior minister and Maharashtra state chief minister have already resigned .
Pakistan 's President Asif Ali Zardari said claims that the sole surviving attacker had been identified by his own father as coming from Pakistan had not been proven .
The man has been named as Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab and is in Indian police custody .

BOSTON - A day after voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot question to decriminalize marijuana , Hampden District Attorney William M. Bennett said Wednesday that he will drop all pending charges of possessing an ounce or less of marijuana and will no longer prosecute new cases .
Bennett said he wants to honor the spirit of the ballot initiative , which makes possession of an ounce or less of marijuana punishable with a civil fine of $ 100 .
The law will take effect in late December or early January , officials said .
" I 'm going to act as if the law were in effect now , " said Bennett , who campaigned against the ballot question and said he hopes the results do n't send the wrong message .
Bennett said he did n't know how many pending marijuana possession charges would be dismissed , but said he did n't think it would be significant .
In the future , he said , he wants to focus on arresting drug dealers .
Voters approved the ballot question by about 65 percent to 35 percent .
District attorneys , county sheriffs and police chiefs all opposed the question , saying marijuana leads to use of harder drugs and causes serious health and safety problems .
Bennett said because of the strong support of the question he wo n't support any effort to repeal or amend the law .
Prosecutors or police might eventually ask the state Legislature to alter the pending ballot law .
Elizabeth D. Scheibel , the district attorney for Franklin and Hampshire counties , said prosecutors would likely talk about their next step and what , if any , action they would pursue on Beacon Hill in response to approval of the ballot question .
The ballot question establishes a new system of civil penalties for possession , while retaining current criminal laws against cultivating , dealing and driving under the influence of marijuana .
Bennett said he also plans to end a program in his office that provides counseling for first - time drug offenders .
The so - called diversion program includes a lot of marijuana cases .
In other post- election developments , Gov. Deval L. Patrick reiterated Wednesday that he plans to run for a second term .
Patrick said he does n't plan to accept a job in President - elect Barack H. Obama 's administration .
" Are you asking me if I am going to Washington again ? " Patrick said at a Statehouse press conference .
" No , I am not .
I intend to stay in my job .
There is a lot of work to do .
There is a very ambitious agenda .
Frankly , if the people will have me , I intend to be here for a second term as well . "
Speculation also continued about whether U.S. Sen. John F. Kerry , D - Mass. , would become secretary of defense or secretary of state under Obama .
After he was re-elected on Tuesday , Kerry said he would be willing to discuss a job with Obama .
If Kerry left , Patrick said he would consider a change in state law to appoint a successor rather than fill the seat through a special election .
Under the current law , the governor must call an election within 145 to 160 days of receiving a resignation letter .
A primary would be held five or six weeks beforehand further reducing the time candidates would have to raise money for a campaign .
Also Wednesday , during a news conference in Springfield , U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal , D - Springfield , said he is looking forward to returning to Congress with a stronger Democratic majority in place .
Neal , who ran unopposed on Tuesday , said he will remain a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee .
Neal , a former Springfield mayor , was first elected in 1988 .
During Tuesday 's election , Democrats enjoyed a net gain of at least 14 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives , giving the party at least 250 posts in the 435 - member chamber .
In the U.S. Senate , the net gain for Democrats was at least five , providing the party with a minimum 56 Senate seats , counting two independents who caucus with Democrats .
The " Open folder " option appears in the " Install or run program " list The Conficker virus has opened a new can of worms for security experts .
Drives such as USB sticks infected with the virus trick users into installing the worm , according to researchers .
The " Autoplay " function in Vista and early versions of Windows 7 automatically searches for programs on removable drives .
However , the virus hijacks this process , masquerading as a folder to be opened .
When clicked , the worm installs itself .
It then attempts to contact one of a number of web servers , from which it could download another program that could take control of the infected computer .
Bad guys
The worm is unusually clever in the way that it determines what server to contact , according to F - Secure 's chief research officer Mikko Hypponen .
" It uses a complicated algorithm which changes daily and is based on timestamps from public websites such as Google.com and Baidu.com , " said Mr Hypponen in a blog post .
" This makes it impossible and / or impractical for us good guys to shut them all down  most of them are never registered in the first place .
" However , the bad guys only need to predetermine one possible domain for tomorrow , register it , and set up a website  and they then gain access to all of the infected machines , " he added .
It has also emerged that the virus automatically disables the automatic updates to Windows that would prevent further infection .
As the virus - also known as Downadup - has spread to an estimated 9 m computers globally , a number of high - profile instances of the virus have arisen .
The Ministry of Defence has been battling an outbreak of the virus across its network for more than two weeks , and on Tuesday a network of hospitals across Sheffield told technology website The Register that more than 800 of their computers had been infected .
Users are urged to download the KB958644 Security Update from Microsoft to mitigate the risk of infection .

On the U.S. - Mexico border , the American government has been trying , with limited success , to set up a string of sensor - laden sentry towers , which would watch out for illicit incursions .
In Israel , they 've got their own set of border towers .
But the Sabras ' model comes with automatic guns , operated from afar .
The Sentry Tech towers are basically remote weapons stations , stuck on stop of silos .
" As suspected hostile targets are detected and within range of Sentry - Tech positions , the weapons are slewing toward the designated target , " David Esheldescribes over at Ares .
" As multiple stations can be operated by a single operator , one or more units can be used to engage the target , following identification and verification by the commander . "
We flagged the towers last year , as the Israeli Defense Forces were setting up the systems , designed to create 1500 - meter deep " automated kill zones " along the Gaza border .
" Each unit mounts a 7.62 or 0.5 " machine gun , shielded from enemy fire and the elements by an environmentally protective bulletproof canopy , " Eshel explains .
" In addition to the use of direct fire machine guns , observers can also employ precision guided missiles , such as Spike LR optically guided missiles and Lahat laser guided weapons . "
For those of you who were old enough to worry about the “ mighty ” Soviet Union in the 70s and 80s , you all lost sleep about nothing .
News broke about the story of an ex-KGB analyst turned professor Igor Panarin predicting that the United States will fall apart in 2010 .
If this is the best that a KGB analyst and current US - Russia relations expert can come up with , they never stood a chance against the US or against anybody , for that matter .
And of course , this theory currently has a huge following in Russia , so we can kiss goodbye any fear of Putin being able to turn Russia back to the old Soviet glory .
I do n’t want to undermine the wishful thinking of an old dog , but there are gaping holes in his understanding of America .
The very map of how he says the United States are going to be split up illustrates that he fails to show even a layman 's knowledge of our great nation .
Let ’s examine his theory and see how likely these are and what could be the consequences .
The most logical of the fragments that Panarin talks about is the “ Central North American Republic ” that comprises of the Midwest plus Montana , Wyoming and Colorado .
This is supposed to be a part of Canada or under Canadian influence even though I cannot fathom a scenario where Kansans would want anything to do with Canadians .
However , Illinois would be a solid addition to Canada and Rod Blagojevich has already earned enough political game points with the recent Burris Senate seat pick to get a post in the Cabinet of Stephen “ Prorogue ” Harper .
If it stays as an independent republic , one can easily imagine Obama retaining the Presidency there after coming back to Chicago and bring about hope and change to the new country with a bailed - out Detroit .
Also , it would prove to be an easy transition as he can retain Daschle , Vilsack , LaHood , Salazar , Gates and Jones in his Cabinet and not to mention Rahm Emanuel .
The more reasonable prediction is the California Republic which consists of everything west of New Mexico and is supposed to be a part of China or under Chinese influence .
One obstacle that could come would be how Mormons in Utah would find fault with Chinese government 's ban on unapproved religion and one - child - only policy and may revert to sponsoring a Constitutional Amendment proposition to overcome them .
Another serious impediment to such an outcome would be real communists in Berkley find the capitalistic tendencies of the Chinese government unacceptable and may call for a People 's revolution .
On the other hand , the Chinese government would be really interested in making this land a part of China because it will guarantee a huge revenue stream from the royalties of every Oregon Trail game sold on iPhone App Store .
Another thing that I could predict is that Shaq would be traded to Houston for Yao Ming so that Shaq can get away from Kobe once and for all and Yao can return to the homeland .
The prediction takes an ugly turn with the prophecy of Texas Republic purported to be a part of Mexico or under Mexican influence .
I have to question the sanity of anyone who suggests such a scenario while leaving Southern California and Arizona out of it .
Moreover , to suggest that Mississippi , Alabama or Mike Huckabee would want anything to do with Mexican influence demonstrates yet again a clear ignorance on the part of Panarin when it comes to American political reality .
The business repercussions would be far reaching since Tyson would n’t be able to supply its chicken to KFC — according to Panarin , Kentucky will be separated from the rest of the South ( about that later ) .
So , ruling out being a part of Mexico , the Texas Republic would in time prove to be the most powerful and greatest nation god has ever given to mankind : Huckabee as the president , Chuck Norris as the Secretary of Defense , George W. Bush as the Secretary of State or National Security Advisor and Sean Hannity as Supreme Court Chief Justice .
Coming to the biggest blunder in Panarin 's theory , let us inspect his Atlantic America that stretches all the way from Tennessee and the Carolinas to the New England .
I cannot comprehend how Tennessee , South Carolina or West Virginia would want anything to do with New York or Massachusetts let alone join the European Union as he suggests .
On the other hand , most of Boston and Upper West Side liberals lament the historic mistake of the North winning the civil war and thus having to bear with the Southern states in the union .
So , they may not want anything to do with the Carolinas , Kentucky or West Virginia even though they might want to keep Tennessee just for Jack Daniels .
New Jersey may become a part of or under the influence of India and may become the hub of call centers , Dunkin Donuts and gas stations .
The last two pieces in the hypothesis are Hawaii and Alaska .
Rather than going to the Japanese or Chinese , I predict the former will become the wintertime capital of the Central North American Republic .
This would ensure President Obama 's eligibility for the presidency , as he will remain a natural - born citizen and could keep the winter vacation schedule without having to go out of the country .
I ’m not really sure about Panarin 's prediction that Alaska will become a part of Russia .
As much as he and his fellow countrymen would love for that to happen , I am pretty sure that Todd Palin and his Alaskan Independence Party would get the real American parts of the state to secede away from the Russian Federation and become an independent nation thereby paving way for Sarah Palin to become the president ( Finally ! ) .
So if this old KGB guy ’s crackpot theory comes true and I have to choose between these divided states , I should make a decision pretty soon .
Even though my huge crush on Rachel Maddow compels me to join the Atlantic America , I realize I stand zero chance of getting her because of her sexual orientation .
I will gladly take Central North American Republic any day with Obama , Mount Rushmore , Kansas City Barbecue , Ethanol , Yellowstone , Warren Buffet and the makers of Chevy HHR .
Also , I would love to get away of the Yankees and all the obnoxious Boston sports teams , and a smaller league would give a better chance for my beloved Cubs to win the World Series .
And you cannot go wrong with Miller , Budweiser and Coors all together .

Raging inflationary fire will collapse economy and dollar , says top analyst
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Tuesday , October 14 , 2008
Investment analyst Puru Saxena told a CNBC audience this morning that the Wall Street bailout was akin to treating a drug addict with shots of heroin , and warned that flooding the financial system with overprinted currency would lead to poverty , raging inflation and eventually a total collapse of the U.S. economy and the dollar .
“ It ’s very good to prop up the asset markets … but many , many other countries have tried to print themselves out of trouble and the end result has been a total collapse of the economy as well as the currency , ” Saxena warned .
“ What this is going to cause is sky - high commodity prices in the next few years and a general deterioration of the standard of living and sharply rising consumer prices and a huge contraction in the purchasing power of money , ” he added .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Saxena noted that commodities such as grain inventories and metal stockpiles were at their lowest levels for decades , adding that panic buying of gold across Europe is indicative of fears of hyperinflation .
“ Already we are seeing shortages of physical gold bullion and hoarding of gold going on all over the world , ” Saxena said .
Saxena labeled bailout measures as “ poison ” in the long term , adding that tradable rallies will mask the problem until the second quarter of next year but the meltdown will ensue soon after .
Saxena ’s warning echoes similar sentiments expressed in recent days by people like Jim Rogers , who last week accused global central banks of unleashing an inflationary holocaust .

CLEVELAND --
A fire engine that would have been the first truck sent to the
fatal fire on Crawford Road Tuesday
was never sent because its firefighters were at the Cleveland Clinic moving an obese patient .
The hospital called 9 - 1 - 1 and asked for help moving a morbidly obese man with high - blood pressure to another Clinic building one block away .
The man was on an examination table surrounded by hospital staff when a worker called 9 - 1 - 1 , according to an audiotape of the call .
City officials do n't know if the firefighters from Engine 17 could have saved Delores Richardson , the 70 - year - old woman who died in the fire .
But the safety director does n't understand why the hospital needed four firefighters and two EMS paramedics to do work that could have been done by orderlies at the hospital .
Cleveland Safety Director Martin Flask plans to demand answers from hospital officials .
Cleveland Clinic officials declined to answer questions about the incident .
They e-mailed the following response :
" Cleveland Clinic transports patients in need to the emergency department .
Healthcare providers on the scene assess patients and determine the need for assistance .
Due to transport needs of multiple patients , the Clinic requested an ambulance from Cleveland EMS , a service they have provided to Cleveland Clinic in the past . "
No fire or EMS official could recall ever receiving a similar type of call from the Clinic , Flask said .
Dispatchers sent both Engine 17 and an EMS ambulance because two EMS paramedics could not have handled a morbidly obese patient by themselves , Flask said .
Stephen Palek , president of the EMS union , said the Clinic should have the staff and equipment to move any patient without calling EMS or the fire department for help .
Firefighters estimated the patient 's weight between 350 and 400 pounds , said Chester Ashton , president of the firefighters union .
The man scooted off the exam table onto an EMS cot and was rolled from the fourth floor to the first and placed in the EMS ambulance .
The man was dropped off around the block at the Cleveland Clinic emergency room , Ashton said .
Engine 17 would have been the first to respond to the fatal fire if it was not tied up at the Clinic , Ashton said .
He could not estimate how much faster Engine 17 would have gotten there than the other fire engines that responded .
Eyewitnesses said Richardson nearly escaped her burning house , but a wall of flames halted her a few steps from the front door on Crawford Road .
Her husband , son and grandson escaped the blaze uninjured .
Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the fire .
Here is how the calls came in :
The Clinic called at 1:14 p.m. asking for help moving the obese patient .
Dispatchers sent the EMS unit and Engine 17 from East 66th Street .
Both units arrived within minutes .
At 1:20 p.m. , the city received the call for the fire on Crawford Road .
Engine 10 , based at 1935 East 101st Street , would have been the closest unit but was doing a routine drill at the Fire Training Academy on Lakeside Avenue .
Ladder 10 , based at the same station , was returning from a false alarm on Mayfield Road .
With Engine 17 at the Clinic , Ladder 10 was sent to the fire .
Engine 22 , based at 7300 Superior Ave. , was also sent to the fire .
Both units and Rescue Squad 3 arrived within four minutes and 39 seconds after receiving the call , officials said .
Ashton said firefighters do n't question any call they receive .
" We should not have sent either unit , " he said .
" My God .
It is a hospital . "
Shaun Gatter , 38 , left his position as a vice president and counsel at a large investment bank last year to work on his novel about a Jewish South African family , a story set against the backdrop of apartheid .
Mr. Gatter says that the decision has meant a huge financial adjustment , but that the payback  having more mental energy for his book  has been worth it .
“ It ’s been euphoric to be able to think mainly about the book and less about equity derivatives and client risk . ”
Greg Collett , 37 , left his job as a director in the commodity exchange - traded fund business at Deutsche Bank in June to explore a career in stand - up comedy .
“ I had this gnawing feeling that things were only going to get worse and that Wall Street was not the place to be , ” Mr. Collett said , adding that it was easier to leave knowing that compensation packages were going to be a fraction of what they were a few years ago .
Richard Florida , author of “ Who ’s Your City ? ” and director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto , sees the gravitational pull away from Wall Street and toward more creative industries as part of a necessary economic recalibration .
“ The economy could n’t survive on speculation and what really amounted to advanced financial alchemy , ” he said .
“ We are now realizing it is our human creativity that is our real capital .
In the early days , Employco played fast and loose with job titles .
Ten years ago , the founders of the company , an HR consulting firm and insurance provider , decided that heavyweight titles would lend credibility to their new venture and help land customers .
A company is n't a company without a CIO , they figured .
And with cash tight , doling out a few lofty titles served as a low - cost way to attract smart employees -- and keep them around .
Over the next decade , Employco , based in Westmont , Illinois , evolved from a start - up with fewer than 10 employees to an established business with 17,000 full - and part - timers .
Unfortunately , as the company expanded and the roles of top executives became more complex , some employees were n't up to the demands that came with their titles .
Others lacked traditional senior - level credentials altogether , having landed their titles by default or out of necessity .
So two years ago , Rob Wilson , Employco 's president , decided to overhaul the company 's titling policy , giving lower titles to half a dozen senior staffers .
He did n't make the decision lightly .
" If you take someone 's title away , there 's a good chance you 're going to lose that person , " he says .
" But we had to look at what was best for the company . "
HR pros call it " overtitling , " and Employco is far from the only company that 's been stung by it .
The practice became widespread when the economy floundered in 2000 and cash - strapped companies began handing out flashy titles in lieu of raises or bonuses .
But it soon became apparent that what seemed like a cost - saving move came with a price tag .
Not only did many vice presidents and senior managers prove to be unqualified for their jobs , employees began to comb the Internet to find out what people with similar titles were being paid .
The result was widespread disgruntlement over the relative size of their paychecks , says Bill Coleman , senior vice president of compensation for Salary.com .
Indeed , a recent survey by Salary.com found that nearly 80 percent of employees who claim to be underpaid are actually overpaid , fairly paid , or holding titles that do n't match their jobs .
About 30 percent of those respondents most likely were overtitled , according to Coleman .
" A lot of managers out there do n't manage anybody or anything , " Coleman says .
" They are not rationally linked to a corporate hierarchy . "
Today 's tightening labor market is making titling even trickier because quality job seekers can afford to be picky .
" We 're in a worker - centric era , " says Sharon Jordan - Evans , co-author of Love 'em or Lose 'em : Getting Good People to Stay .
" The talent war is raging and that means employees have more choices , more power . "
By offering fancy job titles , you can stoke egos and coax talent through the door , she suggests .
But doing so can be risky .
Employco 's Wilson , for example , wishes he had been more careful about job titles from the outset .
Things became especially difficult a few years ago when Employco started to hire truly seasoned managers for the first time .
The company already had several VPs of sales when Wilson hired a new person with the title of vice president to oversee the department , a move that sparked confusion and resentment among some staffers .
" It was n't that the other VPs were not good at what they did , " Wilson says .
" It 's just that they were not effective leaders and managers . "
After the overtitling problem became apparent , Wilson and a few other managers began to review employees in key positions .
When they determined that a staffer lacked the skills and experience needed , they met with each one to explain that the job title was being changed .
In some cases , employees were told that they would be sharing their title with a more experienced co-worker .
The news did not go over well .
No one quit on the spot , but most have since moved on .
In one instance , Wilson informed a well - liked payroll manager that she would be sharing her title with an employee she had been supervising .
" There was a fair amount of crying , " he recalls .
" She was a good employee , but we needed to bring in a stronger manager . "
The arrangement lasted for about a year before the miffed employee left to start her own business .
One way to avoid such headaches is to standardize the qualifications necessary to ascend to a certain title .
If possible , reward restless stars with perks like cash or extra days off instead of new titles .
Also , consider handing out less generic job titles .
For example , Wilson changed the title " account executive " to " risk consultant . "
The new title is more accurate , he says , since employees holding the position assess a client 's risk exposure related to workers ' compensation , taxes , and benefits costs .
And thanks to the more specific name , staffers have a tougher time comparing their titles , and paychecks , to those of their friends and on salary surveys .
The new policy has eliminated overtitling and made job requirements and expectations more clear .
" Now everyone knows that if there is a promotion , that person deserves the new title , " Wilson says .
Doing away with titles is another option .
That was the approach taken by the Richards Group , a Dallas - based marketing firm .
As the company grew , so did the tendency to add bigger and better titles , recalls Diane Fannon , a principal at the company .
" You start thinking if you 're going to give Sue a new title , then are you going to give Jane one , too ? " she says .
" It was creeping in like bad weeds . "
Executives began to spend an inordinate amount of time matching employees with titles .
Meanwhile , they worried that employees would become obsessed with climbing the corporate ladder .
By 2003 , there were more than five different titles , including account executive and account director , in the company 's brand - management department alone .
Fannon and her colleagues began to think that the various titles were unnecessary and often meaningless .
That 's when they began toying with the idea of drastically revamping the company 's approach to job titles .
First , they took an informal poll of their clients , who said that they did n't care about the title of people who handled their accounts .
A few clients even viewed the idea of eliminating job titles as cutting edge -- not a bad impression for a marketing firm .
Three years ago , the Richards Group erased the titles of 560 employees and gave the company 's 20 executives the same title : principal .
Some longtime employees were leery of the move , particularly those who had spent years earning lofty titles .
Still , nobody quit , and staffers now seem to be more focused on their jobs than on their titles , Fannon says .
The lack of hierarchical titles has also helped lure new recruits .
Shortly after the Richards Group implemented the new policy , a job applicant who was fresh out of school asked Fannon , " Does this mean I can take on any project without a title holding me back ? "
At that moment , Fannon knew the new system was going to work .
Husqvarna Showcasing Robotic Solar Hybrid Lawnmower at CES
January 6th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
For those of you itching to take a look at Husqvarna ‘s Automower , the sleek robotic solar hybrid lawnmower will be exhibited at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas later this week .
The Automower uses solar and battery power , and is completely emissions - free .
During daylight , the 12 watt solar panel allows the mower to extend its cutting periods before needing a recharge .
The mower , which is equipped with a 4.4
Ah , 18V NiMH battery , has a maximum working area of 2,220 m2 ( 0.65 acre ) .
A wire staked beneath grass level around the lawn perimeter keeps the Automower in the mowing area .
If the machine bumps into an obstacle , it reverses and heads in a different direction .
And if power is low , the Automower returns to its base for recharging .
Husqvarna ’s 22 pound mower also features a 4 digit pin lock code and a security alarm in case the neighbors decide they want to swipe it .
The Automower is available now for the low price of $ 2999.95 .

How hard would it be to fix ?
I 'm not sure .
It 's easy to be an armchair programmer , and I 've never worked on Wine before .
The clip and stretch problems , I 'd say , should n't be too bad .
As far as I know , the real DirectDraw only clips blits to pixel precision on both destination and source , which is easier but leads to seam artifacts .
There is a path that does clip properly , but it 's only used by Direct3D Present ( ) calls .
A more worrisome problem is that the old Microsoft DirectDraw Test ( ddtest.exe ) program does n't work at all under Wine , as it displays garbage in its status panes and crashes out as soon as you try to create the primary surface .
I suspect the reason might be that the DX3 interfaces are n't implemented properly and are expecting and returning DX7 structures , which would require a much bigger fix than just a few tweaks to the clipping and scaling routines .
The clipping situation is still pretty bad in the current version , as blits that are partially outside of the primary surface still fail , even if a clipper is attached .
It seems that the top - level Blt ( ) function immediately rejects any blits where the destination rect overlaps the right or bottom boundary , clipper or not .
The underlying blit code in wined3d seems to be able to handle clipping to some extent , but unfortunately it lacks the ability to clip a stretchblt .
It 's a relatively minor issue , but it looks like the fractional stepping on the stretchblt case is also off by half a pixel .
In the current alpha release -- I think it was Wine - 1.1.2 that I tested -- the situation is a bit better , as the video panes no longer blank the screen .
There appear to be two changes possibly involved , although I 'm not sure which are in the mainline :
Note that VirtualDub is blitting with both a destination subrect and a clipper attached , so the entire screen should definitely not be getting overwritten in this way .
In Wine 1.0 , the current stable release , the old screen blanking problem is still around .
I did n't have a debugging setup that I could use to check the Wine code -- realistically , I should n't even have been installing and running Wine on a running MythTV box -- but as best as I could tell from behavior and the Wine source , here 's what 's going on :
VirtualDub does n't do anything too fancy in its default DirectDraw mode .
It creates a single off - screen surface in default memory ( usually video , can be system ) and then calls Blt ( ) to draw it onto the primary surface through a clipper .
I use the older DirectDraw 3 API , because that was the highest version supported by Windows NT 4.0 and there is n't anything in DirectDraw 6 or 7 that I need .
There was a problem with Windows Vista where the panes sometimes would n't update ( mixed DX and GDI in the same window no longer allowed , first I 'd ever heard of it ) , but I fixed that by splitting off the display minidrivers to a child window , at the cost of flickering at mode switches .
As far as I know , everything works now , both in XP and Vista .
But it does n't work in Wine , at least not so well .
A long time ago , when I released VirtualDub 1.5.5 , I started receiving reports of issues with Wine .
Specifically , as soon as VirtualDub tried to display any video , the entire screen would be overwritten .
Wine was fairly immature at the time and still had a lot of major problems with commercial applications , so I was n't surprised to determine that it was an issue with Wine and left it as such .
That was the first version that had full support for DirectDraw video display , and so the workaround was to disable it in Options and fall back to GDI .
I had a support question about VirtualDub blanking out screens again in Wine , so I decided to take another look out of curiosity .

Just a question , did / do you ever consider implementing an SDL mode ?
Yogarine ( link ) - 06 01 09 - 08:46
avidemux is a nice replacement for virtualdub .at least the last version of virtualdub I actually used , which was some long years ago .
bart9h - 06 01 09 - 12:03
SDL is kinda awkward to use when you only want to use it for a single window / HWND in your program .
You have to pass the handle around in an environment variable before making the SDL calls .
Darkstar - 06 01 09 - 18:06
@mark : Current versions of Wine do look pretty nice -- in fact , they 've got most of the UI metrics tuned well enough that it 's a pretty close visual match .
I have n't really tried any other apps , but I can believe that a lot of them are very usable with what I saw of 1.0.@bart9h :
That 's nice .
I do n't care and it's off - topic .
@Yogarine : SDL is an application layer that rides on top of the OS APIs , so it would n't buy me anything .
DirectDraw through SDL would n't be any more compatible than using DirectDraw directly .
In portable code , I would n't choose a video display method first without looking at what integration problems might arise with the widget toolkit used .
I actually do have a display minidriver layer in place , so I could hook it up if I were bored .
So far , though , I 've avoided creating a display plugin API for lack of interest .
Phaeron - 07 01 09 - 01:29
Bart9h 's comment is , obviously , off - topic - but if you consider Yogarine 's comment , it raises an interesting question : if Virtualdub added support for SDL , how hard would it be to have a native Linux version of Virtualdub ?
OK , the controls alone would be a problem , the codec issue another headache - inducing work , and a bunch of code behind the UI would probably need some modifications .
I do n't even want to think about what would be required to support V4L and / or V4L2 for video capture ( as far as I know , SDL handles sound , 2D and 3D graphics , but not video / stream handling ) .
Finally , a Linux port would probably be successful only with a plain C/C++ version as fallback , instead of the current highly optimized but platform specific assembly code .
That would probably lead to a complete rewrite , making Virtualdub look like Avidemux in the end .
Or , Virtualdub adds support for SDL , a Wine SDL layer mapping to a Linux SDL install is made ( akin to the OpenGL layer in wine ) , and all is well with the world .
Still , both solutions would require quite a lot of work - when there 's already Avidemux on UNIX systems .
Would it be an interesting engineering achievement ?
Yes .
Would it be useful ?
Not really .
Mitch 74 ( link ) - 07 01 09 - 05:33
I think the best option is to let the Wine developers fix their bug , or bring some help at it , as it may fix problems with another apps as well .
I do n't think that a bug in Wine justifies a big change in VirtualDub 's display code ...
If they got to modify Wine to somehow map Windows SDL to Linux libraries , they may better use their time to fix the DirectX emulation bug .
sarkw - 07 01 09 - 07:04
I agree .
I am pretty satisfied how well VD works under Wine .
One can use it productively to work with videos .
Any minor things left , should not be worked aroun in VD but if someone has a nice idea how to fix it , he should submit it the the wine bug database and help wine .
Thus other allications benefit too .
DJT - Rex - 07 01 09 - 11:16
the discussion ( and more technical details ) on the Wine bug can be found at http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1..
Avery , it may be worth it to add this bug reference to your post , as it is quite enlightening - your comments included .
Mitch 74 ( link ) - 08 01 09 - 06:01
I did n't want to link to the Wine bug because the original specific issue ( screen blanking ) does n't affect VirtualDub anymore , and I did n't want to slashdot the bugzilla entry .
The Wine guys are already aware of the issues I 've raised .
Phaeron - 09 01 09 - 00:16
@ Mitch 74 Yeah that was more or less the issue wanted to raise . ;-)
Thanks for doing it for me .
However I was thinking about how possible it would be to make VirtualDub portable not because we need a VirtualDub for Linux per se , but rather because I read so much posts from Phaeron on this blog complaining about MS Visual Studio & co that I thought it would really be nice if he focused all his programming skills and experience towards free & open source projects like Eclipse / CDT / GCC / GTK ++ which are developed by communities that actually care when someone complains ( or where you have the possibility to send patches ) .
@PhaeronEverytime
I read a post from you complaining about VS I just thinkg , " why do n't you just start developing on Linux with GCC ? "
Linux is a platform that embraces programmers , that loves programmers , etc , etc ...
So my question is : did you ever try developing on a modern distro ?
If yes , what is it that made you return to Windows ?
If not , is it because your job requires you to work mainly on Windows projects , or just because you can't be bothered ?
Yogarine ( link ) - 09 01 09 - 11:38
Please feel free to try your hand at Wine programming , Phaeron .
We 're always looking for new contributors , and you seem to have a handle on what 's going on here .
I think you 'll find that hacking Wine is just freakishly hard .
Frankly , most C programmers just flat out are n't good enough to do it .
But the folks who * do * have the chops to hack Wine seem to find the ridiculous degree of difficulty sort of intriguing .

Jon Parshall ( link ) - 09 01 09 - 12:20
As much as I have issue with Visual Studio , I 'm not at all fond of GCC and its customary development environments .
You might say that one of the reasons I complain about Visual Studio is because I do n't want to have to go to GCC !
If I had had Wine built from source , I probably would have just hacked on it and seen if I could have fixed the problem .
Unfortunately , it was a system that was n't set up for development and I just pulled binaries via the package manager .
Like I said , I just abused a MythTV box for the evening .
I already had someone ask about test cases , which I can do since I can develop them on Windows , but I 'm not really set up for Linux development simply because I do n't maintain a Linux box .
My computing life is in Windows , and I 'm afraid that 's all I really have time for .
I am curious as to why DDTest blows up , though ....
Phaeron - 10 01 09 - 02:08
would you have any idea of launching for Mac OS X ?
Gopal Balaji ( link ) - 11 01 09 - 22:54
To get a cross platform UI for VirtualDub would require two steps .
1 ) Designing it2 )
Hooking it up to the code .
Already I had designed the main window and the menu items ( as accurately as I could with screenshots , but I think I still made mistakes in the design ) and buttons with scroll bar .
I do n't really want to do the dialogs until I can actually " hook up " the code to the main window UI code , which I 'm trying to figure out .
Pharaoh Atem ( link ) - 03 02 09 - 04:31
And in case anyone was wondering , the UI was designed with QT Designer ( Qt 4.4.3-msvc )
That 's what McCain calls Obama in his new ad .
Palin used this line in the debate .
It 's part of the negative tsunami they are now unleashing on Obama , for lack of any positive message :
Here 's an LA Times article from last month about air - stikes in Afghanistan .
We rely heavily on aerial bombing in Afghanistan , this has caused many civilian causalities , and popular support for an American presence in Afghanistan has fallen markedly as a consequence .
Acknowledging these facts is n't an act of disrespect towards our soldiers .
From Fact - Check.org :
The Associated Press fact - checked this one , and found that in fact U.S troops were killing more civilians at the time than insurgents : " As of Aug. 1 , the AP count shows that while militants killed 231 civilians in attacks in 2007 , Western forces killed 286 .
Another 20 were killed in crossfire that ca n’t be attributed to one party . "
Afghan President Hamid Karzai had expressed concern about these civilian killings , a concern President Bush said he shared .
Whether Obama said that this was " all we 're doing " is debatable .
He said that we need to have enough troops so that we 're " not just air - raiding villages and killing civilians , " but did not say that troops are doing nothing else .
Running a war so you can smear opponents at home is not the same as running a war so you can win against the real enemy .
And that 's the national security choice in this election .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

WASHINGTON — A federal intelligence court , in a rare public opinion , is expected to issue a major ruling validating the power of the president and Congress to wiretap international phone calls and intercept e-mail messages without a court order , even when Americans ’ private communications may be involved .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The court decision is expected to be disclosed as early as Thursday in an unclassified , redacted form .
It was made in December by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review , which has issued only two prior rulings in its 30 - year history .
The decision marks the first time since the disclosure of the National Security Agency ’s warrantless eavesdropping program three years ago that an appellate court has addressed the constitutionality of the federal government ’s wiretapping powers .
In validating the government ’s wide authority to collect foreign intelligence , it may offer legal credence to the Bush administration ’s repeated assertions that the president has constitutional authority to act without specific court approval in ordering national security eavesdropping .

( Updates with Finance Minister comment )
OTTAWA , Jan 12 ( Reuters ) - Canada should push ahead with efforts to create a national securities regulator without necessarily waiting for consent from provinces opposed to the idea , a government - commissioned panel recommended on Monday .
The panel said the global financial crisis highlights the need for a single Canadian regulator that can move with greater speed to address financial instability .
“ This is a report that speaks the language of modern financial markets , ” said Finance Minister Jim Flaherty , who created the panel in February 2008 ..
Canada is the only developed nation in the world that does not have an overarching regulatory body that oversees capital markets .
Instead , it has a patchwork system of 13 provincial and territorial regulators that requires companies to file documents such as prospectuses and financial statements in each jurisdiction separately .
Provincial opposition , particularly from French - speaking Quebec , has traditionally hindered efforts to reform the system .
“ It ’s time to give investors a stronger voice with better enforcement and quicker response .
It ’s time to create a common securities regulator , applying one set of principles , one set of rules , one set of fees , ” the panel ’s chairman , Tom Hockin , told a Vancouver business group .
Critics of the current provincial - regulation system , including Flaherty , argue it adds unfair costs to investors and makes it harder from companies to raise capital .
COALITION OF THE WILLING
The panel ’s report contained model legislation for the creation of a national securities regulator with “ willing ” provinces , even if there is no unanimous agreement .
The panel stressed that such a structure would be strictly temporary .
However , it suggests that if after an unspecified period of time , a “ sufficient ” number of jurisdictions still do not join in , that Ottawa could allow market participants to join the single national regime directly .
For example , a company operating in Quebec could choose to be regulated by the national regulator even if Quebec is not participating in the regime and continues to regulate on a provincial basis .
Once a market participant has “ opted in ” to the national regulator , it would be able to undertake a prospectus distribution in any province or territory .
If some provinces are still holding out after a two - year transition period has passed following parliamentary passage of the new law , the panel recommends the federal government take unilateral action to impose a new regime .
Hockin and Flaherty defended the measures on Monday as good for the whole country , and predicted provinces would sign on .
“ This is about market participants , about investors .
This is not about provincial governments , ” Hockin said .
The panel cited constitutional experts saying the federal government has the constitutional authority to regulate markets .
The report was welcomed by several financial industry groups , which see the current system as needlessly costly and inefficient .
“ At least it ’s defined and it ’s feasible .
It puts a little discipline into the process it wo n’t just fizzle out into nothing , ” said Ian Russell , president and chief executive of the Investment Industry Association of Canada .
“ The trick is we have to get the large provinces into this thing . ”
Ontario -- which accounts for about 80 percent of all securities transactions -- reiterated its support for a single regulator on Monday .
British Columbia gave preliminary support .
But the oil - rich Western Canadian province of Alberta said it was remained “ steadfastly opposed to a single federal regulator ” , which it said would intrude on its jurisdiction .
“ If this is going to work , the regional differences , different attitudes towards business , different attitudes towards regulation they ’re going to have to be ironed out , ” said Eric Kirzner , a finance professor at the University of Toronto ’s Rotman School of Management .

Not quite an apology .
Not nearly enough .
Self serving political maneuvers probably directed by the Obama camp .
Warren supposedly went to a West Hollywood to get some photo ops to further his propaganda .
The religious right must think that the gay community is full of GOP southern state like lock step Palin loving clones .
Warren is not fooling anyone ; he is however apparenlty running scared .
Quit running ; just apologize .
Retract your hate speech , your gay racist rhetoric .
Then we 'll all join in prayer ; until then you 're just another conservative GOP liar and the gay community is standing firm .

They lose all credibility in citing the Living Bible in their scripture citations .
This " translation " is an un-scholarly desecration of the Bible .
The quote " Homosexuality is absolutely forbidden , for it is an enormous sin " ( TLB ) is a poor evangelical INTERPRETATION of Lev. 18:22 , which reads in any other translation , " You shall not lie with a male as with a female , for this is an abomination . "
In the same book eating shrimp is denoted as an abomination .

Melissa Ethridge is a kind good hearted person .
Who is capitulating to Obama and Warren without said pastor retracting his hate speech ; that makes her just as complicit as Obama .
She joins the tema of those offering an hand out in unity where it is not deserved .
This man is running a Rove like propaganda campaign now to defer the rhetoric he has used in the past .
His web site toning down its fpr who 's purpose , certainly not the gay community .
Has he apologized , has he rallied his Christian supporters and asked them to tone down the politics .
He is on high gear .
Those that call the gay community to tone it down are Pelosi / Reid like capitulators .
The gay community stands to gain nothing from ignoring or accepting or toning down anything about Warrens selection .
Never forget it .
For those that urge you to ; let them be fools if they want .
There is nothing improper about the level of anger this selection has wrought .
The pacifist among us however ; are perfectly willing to accept this man without him uttering any remorse .
I say that is foolish .
Gays are not the horrible things this man preaches , and letting him off the hook , allowing Obama to feel his calculated actions are somehow ok , and joining the ranks of wishful thinkers like Mrs Ethridge is not proper or acceptable .
Tone down the politics ; did his with Prop 8 ?
Tone down the politics , did Obama by selecting him ?
When Obama returns from Hawaii , there should be nation wide rallys like right after Prop 8 asking him to rescind his selection until this man apologizes .
That is the proper response , not this caving in that is being asked of us .

In fact , what Leviticus 18:22 literally translated , in Hebrew ( I am Israeli ) is that men sleeping together in the manner they sleep with women is forbidden and and an abomination .
In the eyes of the time , this almost certainly states that you can't use homosexual sexual relations as a means of " birth control " to avoid - purposefully or as a result thereof - fathering children .
The same old testament that says this also comments on the various kings and other notables and their " special " relationships outside their primary marriage to one or more women with a man - and not a one with a negative connotation !
This same old testament specifically allows for multiple wives and mistresses - all with various legal rights and obligations , as well as same - sex " special friends " - finally , it makes no direct mention of female - female relationships - and NO negative ones - curious .
We ( NOT I ) pick and choose among the various rules and regulations the old testament handed down , we pick the ones that feel right to us and discount the rest .
This is not belief , it is pragmatic choice - and it would seem that over the years this pragmatic choice has resulted in much division , hatred , and misery .
ALL people ( every one of us ! ) sin by the exact word of the book , and religious people by and large sin far more since they break the vary rules they claim to adhere to routinely .

The bible part about men not sleeping with men as they do women is about not getting your dick all covered with germs that climb up into a woman 's insides and KILL her .
Simple as that , and it was righteous advice at the time .
Still is for anyone ignorant of the biological facts involved .
Same with the injunctions against pork .

There are some / many Christians who think that the Old Testament statements are against fertility rights , particularly those of Astarte .
Agent 99 , I doubt that germs and filth were even in the equation at the time , or that anyone cared about women 's health , except women .
The exhortations about sexual sins most likely refer to the sexual scandals of the day : Caligula and others were actually along the lines of infamous serial killers like Gacy and Dalmer .
Sexual misbehavior then was horrendous .
I am waiting to see how this plays out , and give Warren the benefit of the doubt , because everyone evolves .
I belong to a " reconciling " church , which is the same as an " open and accepting " church .
There was a lot of controversy about this a few years ago , and now it is all gone .
Many of the oldsters who opposed this embrace it fully , and openly admit that they had it wrong and now see the light .

72 , I am given to understand that Jesus cared about women .
I also know that the deal at the time , and still in some places , was that women are for babies and men are for fun ....
Even modern day wife beaters are very , very seriously bummed when their wives die in agony .
It was not merely an indictment of debauched evildoers .
One hardly need mention their sexual excesses to deal with that .

From 99's first link ( emphasis mine ) : " Anytime there is an anti-LGBT initiative , we tend to see spikes both in the numbers and the severity of attacks , " [ Avi Skolnick ] said .
" People feel this extra entitlement to act out their prejudice . "
Rick Warren 's type of rhetoric fuels the nutcases who commit these crimes .
Rick Warren may be acting all conciliatory toward Melissa Etheridge but in the end he equates homosexuality with sinning .
That 's what he means , that 's what he preaches , and that 's what people will learn from him .

Yes , and my point , of course , is that progressives and gays pitching fits about him ONLY fuels his power amongst his constituents , and gives him MORE power over politicians , who in turn use our manias , for or against , to get our sorry asses out on election day , while NOT solving the problem .
The Constitution solves it .
Press it in the courts and shut up about the preachers and homophobes and bad progressives , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera , before you set gays ' human rights back even further .
It 's as damn plain as the noses on our faces and yet really very few people are paying attention .
They just want to fight and whine and complain .
It 's driving me out of my skull crazy .
SO stupid .
We 're supposed to be ADULTS .
How the heck can we have a better society , a better world , when most people WON'T let go of their kneejerk reactions and use their intelligence ?
Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggghhhhhhh !

Dear 99 , With great respect and gentleness , I do claim the right to disagree with you .
Shutting up about wrong moves by our leaders has never been and never will be the right thing to do .
IMHO .

You have every right to disagree with me , Lora !
If you did n't make it sound like I was trying to stifle your free speech , instead of trying to direct people 's energies somewhere productive of positive things , instead of continuing only to feed the circus , I 'd feel better about it .
What are you saying / doing about our leaders ' participation in this ?

99 , Well I do n't think you would stifle my free speech but you have come down heavy on me each time I 've expressed my opinion on the subject of Warren , or so it seems .
Your opinion being that I / we should n't even be discussing this stuff , while not precisely stifling , does send the message : do n't talk about it .
And it is your right of course to decide I 'm only " feeding the circus . "
I like to argue points and toss around ideas .
If that is your idea of feeding the circus and not being productive , so be it .
It 's not mine .
As to your challenge thrown , all I 'm doing at the moment , on that and most issues , is to try to educate myself about it and engage in dialogue when others have a different view .
The Israeli / Palestinian conflict is not one I know very much about .
I should educate myself further , I know .
I have on occasion written letters to the editor , signed petitions , made phone calls , sent emails , worn symbols , even marched years ago in support of various issues .
I have n't done much of it and I respect and appreciate those who do so much more .
I did not mean to suggest that you were not trying to direct people into positive action .
As far as being productive and positive with people 's energies , well , that 's my day job , in a sense , I guess .
Anyway , I 'm not looking for a fight , just a chance to exchange ideas and opinions .
Maybe I 'm too much talk and too little action , but talking and thinking things through is my style .
If you think raising objections ( like those against Warren ) harms a cause , I 'd like to see the evidence .
If you think there 's a specific action I should be doing besides talking , give me the details and I 'll consider it .

I have a thought exercise for you .
Try to think of me as an old family friend , someone who babysat you as a child , took you to the zoo , attended your graduation , that sort of thing .
I 'm someone who wants the best for you and am never attacking you .
I 'm someone who knows the nuances of the political perfidies of our world , and who knows the gay - rights - cum - human - rights thing has run its course .
Contrary to the beliefs of those still locked in the pall of lifetimes full of persecution and / or derision , gays have won .
It 's all over but the signing on the dotted line .
The cultural push is over , and high time .
It outlasted its benefits , and is only serving to feed those who wish them ill , those wish to legislate away what is their Constitutional right .
It has been for long an extremely selfish , if understandable battle , but since the battle has been won , it 's way down the list of things that should be taking up our attention and energy , and only giving fodder for the pastors to get more money and clout through their churches .
The work left to be done is in the courts .
There are good , solid , rational , determined groups who are dealing with this , and if you still want to do something about it , donate to them , or volunteer .
Or just get about the business of living like the rest of us , showing us you are one of us just by joining in with the big planetary emergencies and human suffering going on full steam .
It 's not the most important thing .
In fact , making a hairy deal out of it has turned only destructive to the victory already won .
This war is over ... unless you keep giving the Christianists fodder to bring back and say , See , the queers hate God .
Discussing it as though it were something that yielded to discussion anymore is not just waste , but counterproductive .
Take on something more needful of your time and understanding now .
Above all , examine your obvious need to feel innocent of wrongdoing , or error , or omission , and to point at others who seem not to be innocent to you .
Basically , do the thought experiment of changing me out of whatever label you 've given me , and see if my points do n't sink in better , when you are provisionally not bucking a stranger who 's had it up past her eyeballs with the incessant gay human rights cause .
I 'm on your side .
Gays are human .
They have guaranteed rights in this country .
Period .
And , I am mortally sick of this whole thing .

So discussion IS allowed , despite all your efforts to stop it ?
That 's good , as I believe that is the policy on this site ( emphasis mine ) :
We prefer a free , courteous and open exchange of ideas --- even those we may disagree with .
As for this cuteness at my expense : Above all , examine your obvious need to feel innocent of wrongdoing , or error , or omission , and to point at others who seem not to be innocent to you .

I do n't know where you are coming from .
How have I portrayed myself as innocent of error , omission , or wrongdoing ?
I do think you are wrong to try to quell discussion on this topic .
It goes against stated policy .
I had no " need " other than to find out if this site really believes in free and open discussion as it states .
I had no label for you .
I am only " bucking " you for the right to have a discussion , even one you disagree with and are sick to death of .
My suggestion to you is to just scroll by if you are that sick of it and let other people talk about it if they want .
If that is not possible , then fine , I am done , as no one else either disagrees with you or wishes to run the gauntlet .
I wo n't respond further on this thread .

The Nintendo Switch is one - part handheld and one - part home console , and hopes to be the only device you 'll ever need for gaming , wherever you are .
The hybrid console is an undeniable success , offering up an exceptional level of handheld graphical quality , while seamlessly transitioning into a home console – though this very adaptability has required compromises on power and functionality compared to the dedicated consoles and handhelds that came before it .
The Nintendo Switch is a console that does a lot of things all at once .
Like the motion controls of the Wii , or the glasses - free 3D of the Nintendo 3DS , or the experimental second screen of the Wii U , the Switch 's innovative hybrid design has helped Nintendo to continue to blaze its own trail and do something different .
In the three years since its launch , the Nintendo Switch has become a true gaming hit — every holiday season it's one of the most popular devices around , and as social distancing rules have taken effect during the coronavirus pandemic it's become a firm favorite with gamers and non-gamers alike .
A large part of the Nintendo Switch 's success is its hybrid design which has allowed it to bridge the gap between handheld console and home console in a totally unique way .
The way that the Nintendo Switch combines gaming on - the - go and gaming at home , making each a delight in its own way , is a credit to Nintendo 's team .
With its ever - growing library of exclusive first - party games and top - tier third - party titles , the Nintendo Switch is a better proposition than ever .
Whether you 've already made your purchase or not , you have to agree that the Nintendo Switch is a fine idea , mixing together some of what made the Wii and Wii U appealing for gamers ( even if developers had a harder time figuring out how to make the most of the latter device ) .
The Nintendo Switch brings with it a central idea that can benefit literally every game , not just the select few that can use motion control or a second screen .
Who has n't at one time wanted to pack up their console and take it with them ?
Largely , the Switch delivers very well on this hybrid idea .
You 'll find it a solid , premium - feeling handheld , which can then flip into docked mode and work more or less as you 'd expect a home console to , if and when needed .
At the same time , the Nintendo Switch certainly is n't perfect : most of the issues it has are a consequence of the way that it dares to try and do everything at once , and it does n't always get the compromise right .
Those who are n't sold on its hybridity and just want that classic Nintendo handheld experience will no doubt be interest in the compact , lighter alternative : the Nintendo Switch Lite , which offers a solely handheld Switch gaming experience .
Update :
We 're hoping to see Nintendo Switch deals figure in Amazon Prime Day 2020 .
While the console has been out of stock for much of the year , some countries have seen resurgences in recent months , following a wave of demand kicked off by the pandemic earlier this year .
We 're also hoping to see some Nintendo Switch bundles in time for Black Friday 2020 and Cyber Monday 2020 .
What is it ?
Nintendo's hybrid console

Nintendo Switch : design
Three form factors : handheld , console ( docked ) and tabletop
Lots of accessories , which are at risk of being misplaced
In the box with your shiny new Nintendo Switch you get the main console , two detachable controller sides ( Joy - Cons ) , a grip which enables you to combine these controller portions into a more traditional gamepad , two straps which can make them into two individual controllers , and a dock for plugging the console into your television .
You also get a USB Type - C power cable ( with a non-detachable power brick ) and an HDMI cable for connecting the device to your TV .
If you think that sounds like a lot of accessories then you'd be right : we suspect a lot of Nintendo Switch owners will have misplaced at least one or two of these within the space of a few months .
We 've taken to wrapping our Joy - Con straps around our Joy - Con grip just to keep everything together , but we'd love some way of attaching them to the console so they do n't end up getting misplaced .
It 's a pretty novel ( not to mention somewhat complicated ) setup , so it 's worth delving into each of the different ways you can use the console .

Nintendo Switch vs Nintendo Switch Lite : is bigger really better ?
Nintendo Switch : handheld mode
Bigger than traditional handhelds
Slightly cramped for the right hand due to right analogue stick
Split D-pad on the left side
First in the Nintendo Switch modes is handheld mode , the form factor most like the hardware devices that came before the Switch .
In this configuration you attach the two controller portions ( the Joy - Cons ) to the left and right edges of the screen , then game much like you could do with the PlayStation Vita .
In fact , the size and shape of the console 's analogue sticks make it feel a lot like a modern Vita , though it 's not as solid because of the joints that exist between the Joy - Cons and the screen .
Along the top of the Nintendo Switch is a slot for game cartridges , a headphone jack ( Bluetooth headphones / headsets are currently not supported ) , a volume rocker and a power button .
The bottom of the device is less busy .
You 've got the kickstand for tabletop mode ( more on this later ) , which conceals a small microSD slot for expandable storage .
Internal storage on the Nintendo Switch is limited to just 32 GB , so if you 're planning on downloading games rather than buying them , you 'll want to invest in a Nintendo Switch SD card ( capacities up to 2TB are theoretically supported ) .
Check out our unboxing video of the Nintendo Switch below .
The detachable Nintendo Switch Joy -Cons have a lot going on .
The right hand side has the classic A , B , X , Y button configuration that Nintendo has used on and off since the SNES , an analogue stick ( slightly awkwardly placed underneath the face buttons ) and two shoulder buttons .
There 's a small plus - shaped button acting as the equivalent of the Wii U's ' Start ' button , and a home button for reaching the console 's system - level menus .
Across on the left Joy - Con it 's a very similar story , as you would expect .
You 've got a minus button that acts as the console 's ' Select ' button , a share button for taking screenshots and video ( in selected titles ) , an analogue stick , two shoulder - buttons , and the most un - Nintendo D - pad we 've ever seen .
Instead of the classic cross D - pad Nintendo has utilized since the NES , the left Joy - Con instead has a set of four circular buttons that are identical in shape to the face buttons on the right Joy - Con .
This design decision , which appears very odd at first glance , is so the left Joy - Con can be used as an individual controller , with the D - pad acting as face - buttons in this configuration ( again , more on this later ) .

Nintendo Switch Lite : release date , price , games and more
Nintendo Switch : console mode
Connects to your TV via an included dock
Docking process is seamless , and can be done mid-game
The second Nintendo Switch form - factor is console mode .
You place the main portion in the included dock , which connects the device to your television – you 're then free to detach the Joy - Cons to control the Switch from a distance .
The way the console transfers the viewing experience from its own screen to the television is as seamless as it could possibly be , and you do n't even have to pause your game .
Everything happens in real time .
Detaching the Nintendo Switch Joy - Cons can be a little fiddly , admittedly : it 's done by holding small buttons on their backs and sliding the controllers up .
The TV dock is roughly the same size as the Nintendo Switch 's middle portion .
Around the back you 've got a USB Type - C port to provide the console with power , an HDMI port to connect it to your television , and a USB Type - A port .
On the left - hand side of the console are a further two USB ports , mainly used for charging your Switch controllers as you play wirelessly ( more on this in a moment ) .
If you want to use the Nintendo Switch with multiple televisions throughout your home , you can buy additional docks , which make it easy to transition from one screen to another , plug - and - play style .
Nintendo Switch review ( Image credit : TechRadar )
Nintendo Switch : tabletop mode
Screen can also be detached and propped up on a table
Great for two - player gaming , but four players on the console 's small screen is a push
The final form factor for the Nintendo Switch is what Nintendo calls ' tabletop mode ' .
Using the kickstand that 's attached to the back of the screen , you can prop the console up on a table and then detach the Joy - Cons for some semi-portable gaming .
In theory , this is perfect for long journeys on public transport where you have a tray table to place the console on ; in reality , we found it a bit of a mixed experience .
We do like being able to use the Nintendo Switch Joy - Cons in the grip rather than having them attached to the console – the grip provides just enough extra plastic to make the controllers much more comfortable in the hands , and having the console a little further away means your sitting posture can be a lot more natural .
Tabletop mode is also great for multiplayer on the Switch .
Detaching both Joy - Cons to allow two people to play against one another is a pleasure : it makes the Nintendo Switch perfect for whipping out at small gatherings where you 'll already have everything you need for a multiplayer session .
However , there are a couple of issues that prevent the console from fully capitalizing on this rather intriguing tabletop mode .
First is the kickstand .
Although it 's rubberized , which means that the Switch does n't slide around , it only supports the console at a single height : if your tray table is a little closer to you then there 's no ability to prop the console up so that it 's facing you more directly , and instead you 'll be stuck with the screen pointing at your chest rather than your face .
Second is the Nintendo Switch charging port , which is inaccessible when you 're using it in tabletop mode .
During a recent train journey this meant that although we were in the perfect situation to use tabletop mode , we ended up using the console as a handheld so that we could charge it up .
Finally , for multiplayer gaming the NIntendo Switch screen is just a little too small for more than two players .
Four - player Mario Kart is almost impossible due to the size and resolution of the display ( we found ourselves putting our faces inches from the console to be able to make out distant details ) .
Overall , tabletop mode on the Switch feels better suited to short periods of use , which is a shame when it feels like it should be the de facto way to use the Nintendo Switch over long periods .
New Nintendo Switch : everything we want to see from the next Switch console
Nintendo Switch : set -up
Set - up is simple enough
Console needs to be told whether Joy - Cons are being used together or separately
Setting up a brand new Nintendo Switch is refreshingly simple , you 'll be pleased to learn .
If you 're using the device as a handheld , simply attach the Joy - Cons , press the power button , and ... er... that 's it .
If you want to play Nintendo Switch games on your TV , you need to plug the dock into the TV via HDMI , then hook it up to some power via the included USB Type - C power lead .
The console then easily slips into the dock .
Pairing the controllers is a little more complicated than with other devices because of the fact that they can either be paired or used separately .
The way you tell the Switch which controllers you 're using is to press both the L and R shoulder buttons in whichever configuration you 've opted for .
Nintendo Switch review ( Image credit : TechRadar )
So if you 're using the Joy - Cons individually , you press the buttons on the Joy - Con straps to indicate that this is the case .
On the software side , the console asks for the standard combination of Wi-Fi details and user account set - up info .
These details are a doddle to input on the console 's touchscreen – the keyboard is n't quite as good as a phone 's but it 's much better than a typical console experience .
After that 's taken care , games can be played off a cartridge or the Nintendo Switch 's internal memory .
Researchers have identified a new trojan that can tamper with a wide array of devices on a local network , an exploit that sends them to impostor websites even if they are hardened machines that are fully patched or run non-Windows operating systems .
The malware is a new variant of the DNSChanger , a trojan that has long been known to change the domain name system settings of PCs and Macs alike .
According to researchers with anti-virus provider McAfee 's Avert Labs , the update allows a single infected machine to pollute the DNS settings of potentially hundreds of other devices running on the same local area network by undermining its dynamic host configuration protocol , or DHCP , which dynamically allocates IP addresses .
" Systems that are not infected with the malware can still have the payload of communicating with the rogue DNS servers delivered to them , " McAfee 's Craig Schmugar writes here of the new variant .
" This is achieved without exploiting any security vulnerability . "
The scenario plays out something like this :
Jill connects a PC infected by the new DNSChanger variant to a coffee shop 's WiFi hotspot or her employer 's local network .
Steve connects to the same network using a fully - patched Linux box , which requests an IP address .
Jill 's PC injects a DHCP offer command to instruct Steve 's computer to rout all DNS requests through a booby - trapped DNS server .
Steve 's Linux box can no longer be trusted to visit authoritative websites .
Although the address bar on his browser may show he is accessing bankofamerica.com , he may in fact be at an impostor website .
The only way a user might know the attack is underway is by manually checking the DNS server his computer is using ( e.g. by typing " ipconfig /all " at a Windows command prompt ) .
There are several countermeasures users can take , Schmugar said , the easiest being hard - coding a DNS server in a machine 's configuration settings .
( In Windows , this can be done by going to Start > Control Panel > Network Connections and right clicking on Local Area Connection and choosing properties .
Scroll down to Internet Protocol ( TCP / IP ) and click the Properties button .
Then type in the primary and secondary for your DNS service .
We 're partial to OpenDNS , whose settings are 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 . )
In an interview , Schmugar said the DHCP attack does n't exploit a vulnerability in either user machines or network hardware , allowing it to work with a wide variety of home and enterprise routers .
It involves a ndisprot.sys driver that is installed on the infected box .
Once there , it monitors network traffic for DHCP requests and responds with bogus offers that contain the IP address to the rogue DNS server .
DNSChanger has already been viewed exploiting router weaknesses to change DNS settings , but the ability to poison other machine 's DHCP connections appears to be new , said Eric Sites , VP of research at Sunbelt Software .
For the moment , the new variant does n't appear to be widely circulated , but the prospect of a trojan that can poison other machines '
DHCP connections suggests this one is worth watching . ®
An increasing number of small boys seem to be affected An increasing number of small boys may be finding toilet training a more painful experience than they anticipated , say safety experts .
Doctors at one English hospital reported four cases in which a toddler 's penis had been injured by a falling toilet seat .
The fashion for heavy wooden and ceramic seats is worsening the problem , they say .
Figures suggest there may be up to 250 similar cases a year in the UK .
Perhaps it 's advisable that parents with toddlers think twice about having heavy toilet seats while their children are young
Sheila Merrill
RoSPA Dr Joe Philip , from Leighton Hospital in Crewe , said that parents might need to take more precautions to keep their young sons out of A&E .
He called for more seats to be designed to fall slowly , and for heavier seats to be banned from households with young boys .
He even suggested that the social norm of putting the seat down after use be suspended and the seat fixed in an upright position .
He said : " As Christmas approaches many families will be visiting relatives and friends and their recently toilet - trained toddlers will be keen to show how grown up they are by going to the toilet on their own .
" It is important that parents check out the toilet seats in advance , not to mention those in their own homes , and they should accompany their children if necessary . "
The four boys visiting the Crewe hospital , aged between two and four , all needed to stay in hospital overnight , although fortunately no lasting damage was done .
They had all lifted the toilet seats themselves , which had then fallen back down onto their penises , the journal BJU International reported .
Increasing risk Dr Philip said : " A recent market research report has suggested that there has been a worldwide increase in the number of wooden and ceramic toilet seats sold .
" We would not be surprised to hear that other colleagues have noticed an increase in penis crush injuries as a result of this . "
He said that parents should consider training their youngsters to hold up the toilet seat with one hand .
A spokeswoman for RoSPA confirmed that the cases at Crewe were not isolated examples .
Sheila Merrill , home safety manager for England , said : " The most recent figures show there are an estimated 250 visits to A&E each year by boys under the age of five involved in similar accidents .
" So perhaps it 's advisable that parents with toddlers think twice about having heavy toilet seats while their children are young .
" However , as with children of all ages , in all areas of the home , supervision is always the most crucial aspect in preventing accidents . "

In the final UFC event of 2008 , UFC 92 , we get to see battles betweeen two Ulimate Fighters ( season one and two ) , two submission superstars , and two long - time rivals .
Although this PPV does n’t have the best fight card we ’ve seen so far this year , the three great main events should be entertaining enough to get your attention .
Here are my predictions below .
Forrest Griffin vs. Rashad Evans
The reigning UFC light heavyweight champion , Forrest Griffin , will finally have his first title defense against the undefeated Rashad Evans .
I ’ll admit it .
I was n’t impressed with Forrest ’s last two victories .
Even now , I still ca n’t believe he ’s a title holder , and I highly doubt he ’s going to show us anything different this time .
But this does n’t mean Rashad Evans has what it takes to take out Forrest Griffin for sure .
After defeating Michael Bisping by split decision , and knocking out Chuck Liddell in the first round by luck or not , his ability is still questionable .
This will be a good test for both fighters to prove that either one deserves the title .
If the fight goes beyond the second round , I ’d expect Forrest picking Rashad apart .
Will Forrest be the first to put an “ L ” in Rashad ’s record ?
We ’ll find out on Saturday .
[ poll id = ” 10 ″ ]
Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira vs. Frank Mir
Nogueira , arguably one of the best pound - for - pound fighters in the world , in my opinion , is the toughest dude on the planet .
The scariest thing about “ Minotauro ” is not his Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu , it ’s his heart , his belief of never giving up until the time runs out .
Just number how many times you see him get beat then submit .
Believe it or not , if you put him and Fedor Emelianenko in a fight with no time limit , the winner will be Nogueira .
Do n’t count Frank Mir out though .
Compare the first time you saw him after his motorcycle accident and now , you can clearly tell that big beer gut is gone .
In his last fight against the now UFC heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar , he won the fight in Nogueira ’s style .
Frank is a very talented and intelligent fighter .
When in shape , he ’s a dangerous threat to many top heavyweight contenders .
However , like the majority , my money is on Minotauro simply because he ’s been around for too long and has fought all the toughest dudes around the world .
Even though Frank Mir comes out to this fight as a heavy underdog , we should expect an all out submission war between the two BJJ wizards .
[ poll id = ” 11 ″ ]
Quinton Jackson vs. Wanderlei Silva
These two exciting fighters will clash the third time on Saturday , with Jackson coming back from his title lost to Forrest Griffin by unanimous decision and Silva coming back from his first win over Keith Jardin by KO after three straight losses .
My prediction is Silva is going to win the third time by TKO based on three reasons .
First , I have a feeling that “ Rampage ” is not mentally ready for this fight after his last defeat .
Second , I really like Silva ’s new training regimen and I think it ’s going to work out for him .
Third , watching how Silva performed in his last fight shows that he ’s more motivated than he ’s ever been before .
Expect to see the good old Wanderlei Silva in “ Axe Murderer ” mode , but it ’s not going to be as easy as the first two times as the rules in UFC are different from Pride .
[ poll id = ” 12 ″ ]
Yushin Okami vs. Dean Lister
Hopefully this time the Japanese warrior can give us an interesting fight like he did in his last fight against the deceased MMA veteran Evan Tanner .
If he ’s able to get by the submission expert Dean Lister with a non-decision win , then Dana White should n’t have anymore excuses for not granting him a title shot against the invincible Anderson Silva .
Okami by TKO .
Matt Hamill vs. Reese Andy
After a devastating lost to Rich Franklin in UFC 88 , I really hope Hamill would come back and kick some ass this time .
The one - dimensional Greco - Roman wrestler that we saw in the Ultimate Fighter Season
Three has become a pretty good boxer in the past couple years .
However , as we ’ve seen so far , his gas tank has been his biggest reason for his losses .
Let ’s wish he ’s done some extensive cardio training for this fight .
If he does n’t gas out , he should TKO the former IFL star Reese Andy before the end of second round .
Cheick Kongo vs. Mustapha Al - Turk
Kongo should either KO or TKO Al - Turk in a stand - up game assuming there wo n’t be any surprises .
Seriously though , looking just at the differences between the wages of men and women in so - called democracies alone , Iceland leads with less than one percent of a difference , followed ( not closely , mind you , yet next in line , ) by Belgium at 11 % , Denmark at 12 % , France at 13 % , Australia at 14 % , Sweden at 17 % , and Finland at 21 % .
But , you may ask , who comes dead last in this match of democratic nations ?
Well , it ’s good old South Korea , with a whopping 41 % difference between the wages of men and women .
Expected ?
Probably .
Proper ?
Hell no .
Think about it this way :
On average , for every one hundred dollars made by a man , a woman in the same position with the same company in South Korea will make only fifty - nine dollars .
That , my friends , is sad .
Oh sure , it ’s worse in other countries , take the middle east for example , where women are n’t even allowed basic human rights – but that is , in itself a disgusting example of just how extremely male - dominated things can get , making it another matter entirely .
It ’s our so - called democratic nations , our supposedly civilized , first - world countries , the countries closer to home that claim equality for all that I ’m focusing on now .
It ’s countries like Japan , which is disturbingly right behind South Korea at a startling thirty - nine percent difference in wages between sexes , and of course the good old USA , which , for all its size and supposed glory , still has , on average , about a 23 % difference in wages between men and women .
Some might say it ’s progress– I say we have n’t gone far enough .
Even a 1 % difference is unacceptable .
After all , if men do n’t work any harder than women in the same positions , then why would they get paid more ?
At the very least , your successes thus far are hard - earned and admirable ladies , but keep your picketing signs handy .
It looks like the world still has a lot of pathetic gender - related issues to get over , even in westernized and democratic countries , before the whole of the female population of the world can experience the feeling of true economic equality .
Update : a follow - up post is here , for those who want more on Qi Gong , placebo effects and the like .
Well , we do n’t even know who the new FDA commissioner is going to be under the Obama administration , but people are already making their bid for a change in direction .
In Friday ’s Wall Street Journal , you can find Deepak Chopra , Rustum Roy , and Andrew Weil with an op - ed titled “ Alternative Medicine is Mainstream ” .
I think you can go ahead and silently append “ . . . And Deserves Serious Mainstream Funding ” .
My hopes for this piece were not high – Deepak Chopra , for one , I consider to be an absolute firehose of nonsense .
Both he and Andrew Weil should be whacked with sticks every time they say the word “ quantum ” .
But they manage to avoid that one here – the op - ed turns out to be a marbled blend of things that I can agree with and things that make me raise both eyebrows .
Its general thrust is :
1. Chronic diseases related to lifestyle ( diet , physical habits , etc. ) account for a large percentage of health care costs .
These could be ameliorated or downright prevented through changes that do n’t involve medical procedures .
2. “ Integrative medicine ” ( by which the authors mean , among other things , plant - based diets , yoga , meditation , acupuncture and herbal therapies , have been shown ( they claim ) to help with such lifestyle changes , and with less expense .
The definition of integrative medicine is not provided , nor is the boundary line between it and “ regular ” ( disintegrative ? ) medicine drawn .
3 . Therefore , the incoming administration should make these a big part of the health care system as soon as possible .
Did we mention the funding ?
Now , I ca n’t argue with that first point .
Cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes could both be much smaller problems if people in the industrialized nations would just eat less food ( and better food ) and exercise more .
The editorial makes it sound as if no one believes this or has ever heard of such a thing , but come on .
No one ’s heard anything else for decades .
However , it seems equally clear that jawboning people about this issue does not do nearly as much good as one might hope .
Whether “ integrative medicine ” is any more effective is something that I would very much like to see someone prove .
The authors seem to be familiar with a bunch of well - controlled studies that I have n’t heard about , and I invite them to trot out some data .
But some of the statements in the op - ed make me think that my cardiovascular health wo n’t be able to stand it if I hold my breath while waiting for that .
For example , we have :
” Chronic pain is one of the major sources of worker ’s compensation claims costs , yet studies show that it is often susceptible to acupuncture and Qi Gong .
Herbs usually have far fewer side effects than pharmaceuticals ” .
Studies show , do they ?
Is there really a believable study that shows that Qi-freaking - Gong , of all things , is good for chronic pain ?
Ancient hokum about “ energy fields ” and “ life force ” does the trick , does it ?
My idea of a good trial of Qi Gong would involve one group of patients getting the full hand - waving treatment according to the best practitioners of the art .
The other cohort gets random hand motions from a system I will gladly invent on request , and which I will have to be forcibly restrained from naming Don Ki Kong .
It ’ll be full of talk about holistic energies and connections to the universal flow , do n’t you doubt it , and I ’ll round up some impressive - looking worthies to administer the laying on of hands .
Their passes and taps will be carefully screened by the Qi Gongers beforehand to make sure that none of them , according to their system , have any chance of actually having any effects on the Qi ( assuming that any of them can agree ) .
We call that a controlled trial to investigate placebo effects .
And I hardly know where to start with those beneficial herbs .
The literature I ’ve been reading has been showing that many of the herbal treatments show no effects when they ’re looked at closely – St. John ’s Wort , Echinacea , and so on .
The larger and more well - run the trial , the smaller the effects go , in too many cases .
But I have no problem with the idea that plants and plant extracts can have medicinal effects , of course : they ’re full of chemicals .
My whole career is predicated on the idea that taking chemicals of various sorts can alter one ’s health .
Where I jump off the parade float is at the nature ’s - bounty - of - beneficial - herbs stuff , the idea that things are somehow more benign because they come from natural sources .
Vitalism , they used to call that .
It ’s hooey .
Strychnine .
Ricin .
Come on .
The editorial is full of fountains of happy talk like this one :
Joy , pleasure and freedom are sustainable , deprivation and austerity are not .
When you eat a healthier diet , quit smoking , exercise , meditate and have more love in your life , then your brain receives more blood and oxygen , so you think more clearly , have more energy , need less sleep .
Your brain may grow so many new neurons that it could get measurably bigger in only a few months .
Your face gets more blood flow , so your skin glows more and wrinkles less .
Your heart gets more blood flow , so you have more stamina and can even begin to reverse heart disease .
Your sexual organs receive more blood flow , so you may become more potent — similar to the way that circulation - increasing drugs like Viagra work .
Calling Dr. Love !
All I have to do is change one letter in my last name , and I ’m in business , expanding brains and other useful body parts .
Unfortunately , that first sentence typifies a lot of thinking in this area .
It ’s one of those “ is n’t it pretty to think so ” statements .
As far as I can see , deprivation and austerity have been the norm for most people throughout most of human history , even though they were eating natural foods and getting lots of exercise and fresh air .
And one of the big reasons that people put on weight is that they have the freedom to experience the joy of tasty food a bit too often .
No , this is noble - sounding stuff , but there ’s nothing behind it .
Update : Orac ’s take , with more on those “ studies ” .
McCain pollster : Wright would n't have worked
John McCain 's top pollster , Bill McInturff , said this evening that attacking Barack Obama over his relationship with Rev. Jeremiah Wright would not have helped McCain 's campaign and could have destroyed his presidency , had he been elected .
Some Republicans were angry during the campaign that McCain had -- reportedly for reasons of principle , and out of concern that he'd be viewed as racist -- refused to air ads with Wright 's inflammatory sermons , and believed they were fair game and a silver bullet against Obama .
An outside group did air one such ad in the closing days of the race .
" I said ' Look , if f we do win we ’ll win with about 273 electoral votes and we ’ll lose the popular vote by 3 million , ' " recalled McInturff of the internal discussions about cutting attack ads with Wright .
" If [ McCain ] had used that issue that way , you ’d already be delegitimized as a president .
You could n’t function as government . "
McInturff also said that McCain 's burden in the final days was to close the gap with young voters and Latino voters .
" John [ barred Wright attacks ] for instinctively all the right reasons , " McInturff said .
But " anybody who believed that his issue would have affected the groups we were losing by those margins had never talked to anybody in any of those subgroups about how they felt about those issues . "
McInturff also praised campaign manger Rick Davis for resisting the " enormous pressure " from the Republican Party to attack on the Wright issue .
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe concurred that , by the fall , Wright was not the toxic issue some thought .
" Voters had digested Reverend Wright , and it gave some of them indigestion -- I do n’t want to minimize it , " Plouffe said .
" People had seen the tapes , they had talked about it a lot , " he said , dismissing the notion that it could have changed the game in the final days .
Plouffe did concede an early failure to understand the power of Wright 's sermons .
" We failed as a campaign to do the proper research there , " he said .
" We had n’t done as thorough research , looked through every tape of every sermon , " he said , saying the " ferocity " of the tapes ' appearance on the scene " took us by surprise . "
" It was a moment of great peril , " Plouffe said of the day the story broke in the spring .
Chief strategist David Axelrod chimed in with a story about receiving the text of Obama 's speech on his Blackberry early in the morning he would deliver it .
" I spooled through the speech and I got to the end of it and I emailed him back and said , ' This is why you should be president . ' "

Snuggling under the duvet could also save on those heating bills
As the credit crunch bites , Britons may be turning to sex as a cheap way to pass the time , a charity says .
A YouGov survey of 2,000 adults found sex was the most popular free activity , ahead of window shopping and gossiping .
The Scots were most amorous with 43 % choosing sex over other pastimes , compared with 35 % in South England .
Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust , which published the survey , also welcomed recent figures showing an increase in condom sales .
Around one in 10 respondents to the survey , carried in November , said their favourite free activity was window shopping and 6 % chose going to a museum as the cheapest way to pass the time .
But the sexes differed on their priorities , with women preferring to gossip with friends while men had sex firmly at the top of their list .
Safe sex Publishing the results to coincide with World Aids Day , the Terrence Higgins Trust reminded people to practise safe sex and pointed out that a packet of condoms costs a fraction of the cost of a night out .
Rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections are on the up so when you snuggle down with a partner , make sure you do it safely
Lisa Power , Terrence Higgins Trust Lisa Power , head of policy , said :
We 're glad that people are finding ways of relieving some of their credit crunch woes , but if there 's one thing it 's worth forking out for , it 's condoms .
" Alternatively you can get them free from family planning and sexual health clinics .
" Rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections are on the up so when you snuggle down with a partner , make sure you do it safely . "
Rebecca Findlay , from the Family Planning Association advised : " If anyone 's having more sex at the moment whatever the reason , do think about your contraception , your condoms and any testing you might need for sexually transmitted infections .
" And you can get all of these for free on the NHS . "

Netbooks Head for the $ 200 Range : Good News for Open Source
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 14 , 2009
Related Blog Posts
At this year 's CES show , there was no shortage of netbooks , which have become a surprisingly strong challenge to the whole traditional notebook market .
I remain surprised that more people in the open source community do n't herald this trend as extremely positive for Linux , because Linux is making its way onto millions of netbooks and pre-loaded open source applications arrive with them .
Now , there are reports coming in that one of the biggest attractions to netbooks -- low prices -- could get a lot more attractive .
As Christopher Null reports , the netbook market may be headed for some steep price cuts :
" Netbook pricing has been slowly creeping up over the last year as buyers looked for bigger hard drives , better performance , roomier keyboards , and larger screens .
That feature creep means it 's not uncommon to see prices well above $ 400 for entry - level devices .
The folks at Freescale Semiconductor want to turn that trend around , offering a low - power chip designed to sip electricity while letting netbook makers offer devices for less than $ 200 . "
This is a perfect for trend for Linux netbooks to benefit from , since devices can ship with free operating systems and boatloads of free applications .
Asus has already confirmed that it has its sights set on a $ 200 netbook , and that should keep the number of units it is shipping high .
Meanwhile , Asus ' CEO also recently confirmed that rumors that buyers of Linux netbooks are returning them en masse are inaccurate .
He says that the return rates for Linux and Windows netbooks are about equal .
Look for Linux and open source applications to meet up with many new users because of all these trends .
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Global temperature rises due to climate change could be kept below the critical 2 degree mark by fast international action to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent by 2030 , a report said on Monday .
Scientists say that if temperatures increase beyond 2 degrees , humanity faces severe environmental fallout , such as melting polar ice caps and rising sealevels .
Increasing numbers of scientists and politicians question whether the 2 degrees goal is achievable , given the slow progress of international negotiations so far .
But it is not too late to avert dangerous climate change , said the report by consultancy McKinsey and backed by ten organizations including energy companies , Enel , Vattenfall and Royal Dutch Shell .
“ Achieving the deep emissions cuts required to keep global warming below the 2 degrees limit is possible but difficult , ” said McKinsey director Tomas Naucler .
Global investment of 530 billion euros ( $ 686 billion ) would be needed by 2020 , and 810 billion by 2030 , the report added .
Countries would offset much of the cost by simultaneously cutting their bills for oil , gas and coal , resulting in a net cost of less than 1 percent of gross domestic product .
The report comes one month after the European Union agreed ambitious measures to cut carbon dioxide and amid renewed optimism U.S. President Barack Obama will lend fresh momentum to global talks after having pledged to curb emissions at home .
Obama will start reversing former President George W. Bush ’s climate policies on Monday with steps to raise fuel efficiency standards and to grant states authority to limit emissions from cars , officials say .
Keeping climate change manageable would require fast global action , said the report .
A 70 percent cut in emissions by 2030 would see greenhouse gas emissions peaking at 480 parts per million ( ppm ) , roughly the level scientists say would cause a 2 degree rise .
But a 10 - year delay would make it difficult to keep greenhouse gas emissions below 550 parts per million ( ppm ) .
“ Every year of delay adds to the challenge , not only because emissions will continue to grow during that year , but also because it will lock the economy into high - carbon infrastructure , ” said the report .
What do we talk about when we talk about chicken wings ?
The now - classic buffalo wing , a paragon of bar - food excellence and the subject of passionate devotion for purists who , hailing from upstate New York themselves , have little else to inspire pride of heritage and place ?
One of the countless kinds of chicken wings and chicken - wing - like things purveyed by the fast - food outfits that get much of the credit for producing a nation of folks too fat to see their own toes and who have rarely tasted well - prepared food ?
The traditional chop-suey - joint chicken wing , a take - out staple dating to an era when Chinese food meant a bland , candified version of Cantonese and nothing else ?
Or how about them trendy Korean places quietly popping up all over the country , with their newfangled twice - fried wings and drumsticks ?
Me , I 'm talking about all of the above , because all of the above is what I et , in the span of an hour and a half and in no particular order .
One valiant sitting , in which I accomplished one simple task : chicken wings only , consumed exactly as they were prepared .
No dipping sauce .
No soft drinks , no beer , no possum , no sop , no taters ; water only , to keep the taste buds fresh .
I know , I know :
We 're talking about a festive food , a halftime snack , something to chow down with a cold one or six .
But this is n't happy hour , and I ain't looking for a good time I 'm seeking truth .
Ungarnished .
Truth ungarnished number one : Eating the stuff from Papa John 's first because it 's there is a very good and a very bad idea both .
Sold as " Spicy Buffalo " wings , they 're ugly as sin , a soggy , foil - wrapped mess of clumped chickenish parts that feature a skin of undercooked subcutaneous fat , a meat beneath that 's neither light nor dark it 's closest to gray and a chemical tang that could strip paint .
It was a good idea to try the Papa John 's first because every wing that followed , however mediocre , tasted good if not great .
But it was a bad idea because those two bites I gave two separate wings one hearty chaw each for duty 's sake and fairness , too will haunt me always , starting tomorrow morning .

Buffalo Wild Wings
*****
We had three boxes from Buffalo Wild Wings , a chain founded by two guys who did their time as Buffalonians .
A large box contains their medium wings , which are fine the plump drumettes are a particular pleasure , crisp - skinned and juicy .
One small box holds wings doused with a chipotle sauce : nice but nothing special .
Special are the wings inside the second small box , painted with a mango - habanero sauce of admirable complexity and decent bite .
This is good stuff of obvious quality , cooked right and not overly sauced , entirely worthy of its claim to the birthplace of the wing as we 've come to love it .
Bravo .
Jeffrey Westbrook / Studio D
Pizza Hut
*****
All I 'll say about Pizza
Hut 's chicken wings is that they 're even uglier than Papa John 's outside a hideous Day - Glo orange and just as gelatinous within .
I would n't feed this trash to my dog , and my dog would n't eat it if I did .
Feh .
Jeffrey Westbrook / Studio D < br/><br/><br/>
Hooters
*****
Hooters is included here only because Esquire 's chicken - wing editor insisted that we include its wings , which are as pedestrian as the concept that men are so transfixed by udders , and yet so disdainful of women , that they 'll flock to be served by buxom waitresses rather than spring for an honest lap dance and go home to a lonesome dish of ramen .
These wings are head , neck , and shoulders above the specimens provided by Papa John 's and Pizza Hut , rising all the way to nondescript .

T.G.I. Friday's
*****
T.G.I. Friday 's chicken wings , like its waitrons , seem interchangeable with Hooters ' , though Friday 's employees show less skin .
It sent over a box of " boneless " wings along with the traditional ones ; breaded and fried , hot and meaty , they raise an important question :
Is the wing qua wing truly worth all the mess and trouble ?
Is n't a fine breast - meat nugget enough ?
Jeffrey Westbrook / Studio D
Ocean Dragon
*****
That question lingers , hanging over the wings from Ocean Dragon , a neighborhood Chinese place .
These have a naked honesty and a dusting of five - spice powder , which imparts an always welcome hint of cinnamon .
Beyond that , not much not at this point .
Maybe I should 've taken it easier on those mango - habanero wings or spread the whole thing out over a couple of days .
Jesus , imagine if Garcia had n't been struck by that cab .
I 'd be doubled over in the washroom .
Jeffrey Westbrook / Studio D
Bon Chon
*****
The chicken wing they sling at Manhattan 's Bon Chon is Korea 's answer to Buffalo and the wing - qua - wing riddle are chicken wings worth all the bother ?
and the answer , from bite one , is the bliss of a whispered yes .
It is n't merely today 's best chicken ; it 's perfect , the best fried chicken I 've ever had .
On one level , this is delicate stuff , with a paper - thin skin that delivers a soul - satisfying crunch and a clean , subtle taste unmarred by anything beyond good fresh chicken and maybe a dash of salt and pepper .
One batch is barely brushed with a sweetish soy - garlic mix , the other with a " hot and spicy " blend whose snap builds nice and slow to a friendly scorch .
Both are superb .
I do n't know exactly how Korean chicken joints pull this off apparently Bon Chon fries in two stages at relatively low heat but it's a magnificent food zing , a mighty liftoff even after a pound or so of lesser stuff .
For the first time today , I tasted a side dish the cubed pickled daikon radish Bon Chon includes as an accompaniment to its chicken and then pushed back from the table to savor the buzz .
And then ?
Why , then I went back to work on the rest of the hot and spicy .
Domino's
Not Delivered
A special shout - out here to Garcia , the Domino 's deliveryman who never made it to Esquire 's offices .
At one point , Garcia did call to say that he was waiting downstairs with the wings and where the feckity - feck I 'm paraphrasing were we ?
Garcia was gone when we got downstairs , and a call to Domino 's brought the news that Garcia had been hit by a taxi .
It is unclear whether this occurred before or after his failed attempt to land the wings .
In fact , it may be that he was n't hit by a taxi , that in Manhattan , at least this may serve as Domino 's convenient , what - the - hell alibi for any missed connection .
One hopes so , for Garcia 's sake .

Get ready for a push for “ reasonable ” restrictions on the internet .
It appears Obama ’s presumptive choice for AG will be Eric Holder , a former Clinton Justice Department official .
As the corporate media throws confetti and heralds the possibility of America ’s first black AG , it ignores something more sinister lurking beneath the surface : in 1999 , Holder advocated internet regulation .
On May 28 , 1999 , Holder told NPR ( see video below ) :
The court has really struck down every government effort to try to regulate it .
We tried with regard to pornography .
It is gonna be a difficult thing , but it seems to me that if we can come up with reasonable restrictions , reasonable regulations in how people interact on the Internet , that is something that the Supreme Court and the courts ought to favorably look at .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Holder ’s frame of reference was the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre .
It was said at the time that shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris had learned how to construct bombs on the internet .
More troubling , however , is the fact Holder was a “ hate crimes ” advocate .
In an op -ed at the neocon standard , the National Review , the editors predictably drag out the old false left - right paradigm and lambaste Holder as a “ creature of the Left . ”
In an effort to portray Holder as a bad choice to fill the spot of AG in an Obama administration , they note that Holder is “ excited about hate crimes ” and would “ burden police departments with accusations of racial profiling and the states with charges of racially skewed death - penalty enforcement . ”
If an Obama administration is successful in establishing so - called “ hate crimes ” and this passes Supreme Court muster — and with the dinosaurs on the court , Obama may get to nominate one or two — it will not be simply guys ( usually undercover cops ) in white sheets fond of burning crosses that will be prosecuted , it will be critics of the government as well .
Since time immemorial , governments have gone after critics first and foremost .
An Obama administration will be no exception to the rule .

On his first day in office , President Obama put former president Bush on notice .
His administration just released an executive order that will make it difficult for Bush to shield his White House records–and those of former Vice President Dick Cheney –from public scrutiny by invoking the doctrine of executive privilege .
Shortly after taking office , Bush handed down his own executive order , amending the Presidential Records
Act to give current and past presidents , along with their heirs , veto power over the release of presidential records , which are considered the property of the American people .
“ [ Obama ] ’s putting former presidents on notice that if you want to continue a claim of executive privilege that [ Obama ] does n’t think is well - placed , you ’re going to have to go to court , ” says Anne Weismann , the chief counsel for Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington ( CREW ) .
During the campaign , Obama promised to “ nullify attempts to make the timely release of presidential records more difficult . ”
( A transition spokesperson promised Mother Jones essentially the same thing when we asked a few weeks ago . )
That was a reference to former president Bush ’s infamous Executive Order 13233 , which gave current and former presidents and vice presidents , along with their heirs , unprecedented authority to block the disclosure of White House records .
But Obama ’s taken his campaign promise a step further .
While revoking 13233 , Obama has also put forth a far stricter interpretation of executive privilege :
[ T ]he Executive Order on Presidential Records brings those principles [ of openness and transparency ] to presidential records by giving the American people greater access to these historic documents .
This order ends the practice of having others besides the President assert executive privilege for records after an administration ends .
Now , only the President will have that power , limiting its potential for abuse .
And the order also requires the Attorney General and the White House Counsel to review claims of executive privilege about covered records to make sure those claims are fully warranted by the Constitution .
Weismann explains :
[ Obama ] ’s basically saying if there ’s a dispute , and a former president thinks something should be covered by executive privilege and Obama does n’t agree , then Obama would direct the Archivist to release it [ despite the former president ’s claim of privilege ] .
The only option a former President would have at that point would be to go to court and sue .
[ Obama ] ’s set up a process to review these claims which requires the Attorney General and White House Counsel to agree that these claims should be invoked , which indicates that it wo n’t be either casually invoked or casually defended .
In Obama ’s remarks on Wednesday morning , he said that , “ Going forward , anytime the American people want to know something that I or a former President wants to withhold , we will have to consult with the Attorney General and the White House Counsel , whose business it is to ensure compliance with the rule of law .
Information will not be withheld just because I say so .
It will be withheld because a separate authority believes my request is well grounded in the Constitution . ”
The effect of that particular phrase is enormous , as emphasized by the response of a reader over at Talking Points Memo who works for the Justice Department .
“ That highlighted phrase has signaled a significant discussion around these parts . ”
You can be certain that Obama ’s early moves to promote government transparency and accountability will be the subject of discussion and debate for a long time to come .

It arrived in boxes at the Mary Rose Centre in Portsmouth Harbour last week for what is expected to be a 10 - year programme of preservation and reconstruction .
Archaeologists believe the craft was heading for Gela , then a Greek colony , when it was caught in a storm and sank with its cargo .
Charles Barker , of the Mary Rose Centre , said : " It has an elm keel , an oak frame and pine planking .
It is the most complete Greek trading vessel yet found . "
State Governors Ask For One Trillion Dollar Bailout
Somebody please tell me where it stops .
I am talking about this whole bailout fiasco .
The states are now looking for $ 1 trillion in “ aid ” money from the federal government .
Where does it stop ?
How the hell are we supposed to pay for it ?
Governors of five U.S. states urged the federal government to provide $ 1 trillion in aid to the country ’s 50 states to help pay for education , welfare and infrastructure as states struggle with steep budget deficits amid a deepening recession .
The states can call this money aid if they wish but it does n’t change the fact that this is more bailout bullshit .
The precedent has been set by President Bush that instead relying of free market economics and good business practices private institutions can rely on the big brother government to swoop in and save them from their mistakes .
This is no different here , in this case it is the state governments who have overspent and are now looking for a handout instead of doing what they should be doing and cutting back spending .
The Republican Governors Association sees this for what it is .
The proposal by the Democratic governors goes beyond things like ‘ shovel - ready ’ infrastructure projects and is essentially a bailout of these states ’ general funds , ” Nick Ayers , executive director of the Republican Governors Association , said in a statement .
He continues :
“ Now is the time to focus on finding cost - effective ways to provide essential services without burdening future generations with ever greater debt . ”
We simply cannot afford to keep rewarding bad behavior with “ free ” money .
We ca n’t keep doing this .
It is time for businesses and financial institutions , and yes GOVERNMENTS to bite the bullet and pay for their mistakes .
It may be painful but it is the only way to ensure that these entities learn from their mistakes .
What lesson will be learned from continued government bailouts ?
Simple , that the federal government will continue the bailouts .
What incentive is their for companies and state government to change their ways if they are under the belief that big brother is there to pick them up once they fall ?
Some lessons learned are hard lessons , but they are necessary lessons , this should be one of them .
It is time to stop using the “ timeout ” method of discipline with these entities and start using economic corporal punishment .
It is time for the states to realize they can’t spend money that they do n’t have .
It is time for state governments to get back to fiscal responsibility .
That has become a foreign concept in today ’s America but we must get back to fiscal responsibility .
NOW !
It ’s not just newmatilda.com writers Ben Pobjie and Scott Bridges who are up in arms about how best to teach English to kids .
Grandparents around the nation have been cackling with glee at the news that the young ’uns will soon be copping an ominously titled " back - to - basics " approach to grammar in schools , thanks to the recently proposed National Curriculum for English , which they no doubt hope will clean up the country ’s text messages and fix the price of a pint of milk at one shilling sixpence .
As the blogosphere demonstrates , it ’s also a deeply satisfying development for anyone outraged at the dropping of language standards in our community , and all that they are supposed to represent .
( Of course , it ’s worth noting that quite a lot of people really love this kind of outrage because it gives them so many opportunities to show off .
In countless blogs , such people would be heard right now urging the government " to bravely beat prescriptive grammar into young heads like hot cane into buttock " except that would be splitting the infinitive .
However in many of us , such smugness is mixed with the kind of creeping dread you feel when you begin to suspect that the privilege in all your learning is not being privileged by your society anymore . )
In general the blogosphere itself has not been given very high marks for its standards of grammatical rectitude .
But it ’s a big tent , and there ’s a table off in a dark corner of the net piled high with well thumbed editions of Fowler ’s and earl grey - stained copies of Strunk and White where a perpetually agitated huddle of grammar bloggers is seated .
These people stand ready to provide nerdy kids conjugating their way through primary school with crabby , narky and possibly valuable advice .
This is a good thing .
For it ’s a time of great uncertainty in the print media , and there are fewer and fewer sub-editors at the broadsheets to maintain the sanctity of the language .
( We were briefly excited to hear rumours of the appointment of a certain special someone — spelt " jay - oh - aitch - en - SPACE - aitch - oh - dubbel - yoo - ay - ar - dee — to the Fairfax board , hoping that his famous devotion to the monarchy might extend to protecting the Queen ’s English by not sacking editorial staff .
Then we remembered his eschewal of Received Pronunciation and general affection for easy sackings and we felt that hope die . )
First stop for a country getting back in touch with its grammatical roots is the Apostrophe Protection Society , a polite site devoted to that oft - misplaced curlicue .
It ’s a diplomatically smooth introduction to what lies ahead , featuring a simple punctuation recovery program and a non-judgmental tone — " we do not intend any direct criticism of those who have made the mistakes above " .
Note , however , that grammar maven Lynn Truss has issued an influential call for the emergence of a militant wing of the APS .
When courteous letters to serial abusers of the apostrophe do n’t work Truss advises would - be punctuation jihadis " to shin up ladders at dead of night with an apostrophe - shaped stencil and a tin of paint " .
Offenders are named and shamed at Apostrophe Abuse , Apostrophism and Apostrophe Catastrophes .
You get the picture .
Andrew Bolt also gets stuck into apostrophe misuse by teachers unions on his blog .
Or should that be " teachers ’ unions " ?
See the comments for a lengthy hair - splitting session .
In a manoeuvre that reveals either an inspired ironic consciousness or a regrettable lapse of proof - reading , Bolt brings his own apostro - clanger to the party : " a state school teacher emails his colleague ’s " .
There ’s a grammar blog for pedants of every persuasion .
If the wanton frequency of questions improperly begged bugs you , you can read all about it — and buy a mug — at Beg the Question .
On the other hand it might be that you ’ve had a gutful of " letter abuse " .
( You ca n’t really be sure if that includes you unless you know that letter abuse " is better known as the linguistic phenomenon of intentional misspelling of words and the substitution of incorrect letter usage found in our culture " .
If that is you , The Perplexikon will stoke that righteous fire you ’re feeling . )
There ’s also some important work being done over at The " Blog " of " Unnecessary " Quotation Marks , which sort of " speaks " for itself .
Literally , A Web Log tracks abuse of the word " literally " .
( But not in the sense that it ’s actually out there looking for hoof - prints and sniffing droppings . )
It ’s recommended reading for sports writers everywhere .
These bloggers would , for example , just love this profile of Stephanie Rice in the Courier Mail , which told readers that " now she had consolidated her initial promise the sky was literally the limit " .
That ’s a hell of a high dive .
One of our favourites from the site quotes Jerry Falwell , who said , " If you and I do not speak up now , this homosexual steamroller will literally crush all decent men , women and children who get in its way " .
Facebook is also doing its bit to help , providing ample forums ( fora ? ) in which to wax arcane about such matters as the confusion of " their " with " there " with " they ’re " .
Thus are social networks built .
And grammatical terrorist cells too , apparently .
The secret fantasies of countless vigilante grammar crusaders were acted out when Jeff Deck et al formed what they called the Typo Eradication Enhancement League ( TEAL ) and set off across America to edit every signage error that offended their keen sensibilities .
Their mission sparked a huge wave of blogger interest and Jeff Deck became some kind of highbrow folk hero ( if that ’s possible ) .
After a series of often tense interactions with people who felt that their signs did n’t need correcting , TEAL got into real trouble for defacing a rare hand - painted sign in Arizona .
The TEAL blog was worth reading before , but it ’s arguably even better now that it has been reduced to a one - page statement of extreme contrition :
" There are many aspects to the ongoing task of being a responsible American citizen .
One aspect in particular is often overlooked ; namely , that one should not vandalize or damage signs on the National Parks and public lands .
Such actions include but are not limited to fixing spelling mistakes on signs .
It is absolutely egotistical for one to think that one can tell others how to spell .
In addition , one never knows whether a sign has historic value concealed within it .
What appears to be an ordinary sign may in fact be the work of a heroic local artist .
Some signs may be irreplaceable and unfixable .
One should ask before modifying signs , because altering signs without the permission of the owner is a crime ! ! "
Clearly being a pedant is not all chit - chat about terminal prepositions and mixed metaphors .
There ’s more vigilante action over at Grammar Vandal .
Those living in fear of humiliation by grammar bloggers can visit Grammar Girl who podcasts " quick and dirty tips " — although her advice follows North American usage and is therefore open to attacks like this one from folks who believe that whole continent is holding the wrong end of the language stick .
All this scrupulousness has been well scrutinised by the behaviourologists at Stuff White People Like :
" If you wish to gain the respect of a white person , it ’s probably a good idea that you find an obscure but contentious grammatical question such as the " Oxford comma " and take a firm stance on what you believe is correct .
This is seen as more productive and forward - thinking than simply stating your anger at the improper use of " it’s " .
" Another important thing to know is that when white people read magazines and books they are always looking for grammar and spelling mistakes .
In fact , one of the greatest joys a white person can experience is to catch a grammar mistake in a major publication .
Finding one allows a white person to believe that they are better than the writer and the publication since they would have caught the mistake .
The more respected the publication , the greater the thrill .
If a white person were to catch a mistake in The New Yorker , it would be a sufficient reason for a large party . "
Of course all of this is demonstrably true , but where does such insight leave white Australians ?
Far from making pedants happy , could a return to starchy standards through the National Curriculum actually rob them of a great joy in life ?
How will well educated people distinguish themselves then ?
We do n’t know the answer to this , but we hope that newmatilda.com will continue to provide its readers with sufficient typographical , orthographic and grammatical errors to send hot flushes of pleasure surging through bile ducts well into the future .
But he told the AFP news agency that he had been told that his brother was being held by Iraqi forces in the heavily fortified Green Zone compound in central Baghdad where the US embassy and most government offices are housed .

Five more members of Congress being probed in bribery affair John Byrne
Published : Friday November 28 , 2008
Print This Email This
Five other members of Congress are being probed in association with the bribery scandal linked to former California Republican congressman " Duke " Cunningham , according to a little - noticed legal filing discovered Thursday .
The 42 - page sentencing memo was published online by Seth Hettena , an author who has published a book on Cunningham .
It was made by the attorney for Mitchell Wade , the former defense contractor who pleaded guilty to bribing Cunningham in 2006 who has cooperated with the government in their investigation .
In addition to the five current or former members of Congress , numerous government employees and several private contractors are also under scrutiny .
Of the five congressmembers , two are formally under investigation and three are being examined for their " receipt of straw contributions " -- contributions made to members of Congress in an effort to get facilities opened in their districts .
Investigators are also looking at a member of Congress for accepting undisclosed gifts , the crime that sunk Alaska Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens this year .
According to the filing , the five are being probed for " corruption similar to that of Mr. Cunningham . "
Cunningham , 64 , was sentenced to 8 years in prison in 2006 ; Wade faces sentencing Dec. 15 .
His cooperation with prosecutors has resulted in guilty pleas or conviction for seven other individuals , the sentencing memo said , which seeks to have his sentence reduced to a fine and five years ' probation .
Cunningham expert says Katherine Harris likely among those eyed Though none of the additional congressmembers are named , Hettena believes they are " no doubt " Republican Reps.
Virgil Goode and Katherine Harris .
Harris became famous during the Florida recount in 2000 , was elected to Congress in 2002 , and was defeated in a run for the Senate in 2006 .
Goode represents Virginia and was narrowly defeated in November .
Harris may be the member of Congress who underreported campaign contributions .
Wade took Harris to dinner at the posh French Georgetown restaurant Michel Richard Citronelle the year before her electoral defeat which cost $ 2,800 , according to Harris ' former political strategist Ed Rollins ; members of Congress are supposed to report any gifts larger than $ 50 .
Citronelle 's fixed priced menu costs $ 155 alone .
With " wine pairings , " a meal is $ 230 .
" Prosecutors drop tantalizing hints about an even bigger , ongoing investigation , " Hettena notes .
" Wade was debriefed in 2006 and provided ' moderately useful ' background information in another ' large and important corruption investigation ' that also has not yet resulted in any charges . "
An element of particular interest that remains unresolved is who utilized escorts and limousines another convicted contractor provided and who attended private poker games at the Watergate hotel .
Brent Wilkes , another contractor who went down in the Cunningham affair , used the services of Shirlington Limousine .
" He was a winer and a diner , " the company 's owner told the Hill in 2007 .
" He liked to take people to eat .
If a young lady gets in the car , or he asks us to pick up a young lady , we do n't know who it is .
We 're drivers . "
Shirlington sued the Department of Homeland Security after they dropped the firm as a contractor following the revelations .
Clarification : Harris was defeated in a run for the US Senate after she voluntarily gave up her House seat .
Moderate drinkers often have lower risks of Alzheimer 's disease and other cognitive loss , according to researchers who reviewed 44 studies .
In more than half of the studies , published since the 1990s , moderate drinkers of wine , beer and liquor had lower dementia risks than nondrinkers .
In only a few studies were there increased risks .
" Alcohol is a two - edged sword , " said Michael Collins , Ph.D. , a professor and neuroscientist at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine and lead author of the refereed report in the journal Alcoholism : Clinical and Experimental Research .
" Too much is bad .
But a little might actually be helpful . "
Moderate alcohol consumption generally is defined as 1 drink or less per day for women and 1 - 2 drinks or less per day for men .
The article will be published in the February 2009 issue of the journal , and is available on line now .
The article summarizes a roundtable , organized by Collins , held at the Research Society on Alcoholism meetings in Chicago in 2007 .
" The pathological damage and vast social havoc from addiction to and abuse of alcohol are well known , and of necessity should continue to receive primary attention by doctors , scientific researchers and health professionals , " Collins and colleagues write .
" However , light - to - moderate responsible alcohol consumption " appears to carry certain health benefits . "
Long - term alcohol abuse can cause memory loss and impair cognitive function .
It 's unknown why moderate alcohol use appears to have the opposite effect .
One theory is that the well - known cardiovascular benefits of moderate alcohol consumption also can reduce the risk of mini strokes that cause dementia .
Collins and another Loyola professor , neuroscientist Edward Neafsey , Ph.D. , suggest a second possible explanation .
Small amounts of alcohol might , in effect , make brain cells more fit .
Alcohol in moderate levels stresses cells and thus toughens them up to cope with major stresses down the road that could cause dementia .
For most people who drink responsibly and in moderation , there 's probably no reason to quit .
But because of the potential for alcohol to be abused , Collins and Neafsey do not recommend that abstainers begin drinking .
The researchers note there are other things besides moderate drinking that can reduce the risk of dementia , including exercise , green tea , education and a Mediterranean diet high in fruits , vegetables , cereals , beans , nuts and seeds .
Moreover , there are times when people should never drink , including adolescence , pregnancy and before driving , Collins said .

It is widely accepted that Upper Paleolithic early modern humans spread westward across Europe about 42,000 years ago , variably displacing and absorbing Neandertal populations in the process .
However , Middle Paleolithic assemblages persisted for another 8,000 years in Iberia , presumably made by Neandertals .
It has been unclear whether these late Middle Paleolithic Iberian assemblages were made by Neandertals , and what the nature of those humans might have been .
New research , published Dec. 8 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is now shedding some light on what were probably the last Neandertals .
The research is based on a study of human fossils found during the past decade at the Sima de la Palomas , Murcia , Spain by Michael Walker , professor at Universidad de Murcia , and colleagues , and published by Michael Walker , Erik Trinkaus , professor of Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis , and colleagues .
The human fossils from the upper levels of the Sima de las Palomas are anatomically clearly Neandertals , and they are now securely dated to 40,000 years ago .
They therefore establish the late persistence of Neandertals in this southwestern cul - de-sac of Europe .
This reinforces the conclusion that the Neandertals were not merely swept away by advancing modern humans .
The behavioral differences between these human groups must have been more subtle than the Middle - to - Upper Paleolithic technological contrasts might imply .
In addition , the Palomas Neandertals variably exhibit a series of modern human features rare or absent in earlier Neandertals .
Either they were evolving on their own towards the modern human pattern , or more likely , they had contact with early modern humans around the Pyrenees .
If the latter , it implies that the persistence of the Middle Paleolithic in Iberia was a matter of choice , and not cultural retardation .
From the Sima de las Palomas , other late Neandertal sites , and recent discoveries of the earliest modern humans across Europe , a complex picture is emerging of shifting contact between behaviorally similar , if culturally and biologically different , human populations .
Researchers are coming to see them all more as people , flexibly making a living through the changing human and natural landscapes of the Late Pleistocene .
Based on Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid Ibex , Linux 2.6.27 , Gnome 2.24 and Xorg 7.4 , Linux Mint 6 " Felicia " comes with a brand new " Software Manager " , FTP support in mintUpload , proxy support and history of updates in mintUpdate , mint4win ( a Linux Mint installer for Microsoft Windows ) , tabbed browsing in Nautilus and a lot of other improvements .
Linux Mint 6 " Felicia "
mintInstall 5 , the " Software Manager "
The content of the Linux Mint Software Portal can now be browsed offline and directly from the desktop thanks to a brand new frontend developed for mintInstall .
The frontend can be used to quickly browse through available software , view screenshots and user reviews , sort by various criterias of popularity , check installed and available versions and eventually install software .
mintInstall 5 from a simple installer to a full software manager
The frontend uses XML meta -data to synchronize its content with the online portal and also has the ability to support additional 3rd party portals if other portals decide to support our XML format in the future .
mintUpdate 3 , a brand new Update Manager
The Linux Mint Update Manager " mintUpdate " was refactored and its graphical interface was redesigned from scratch .
mintUpdate 3 brings numerous bug fixes and a brand new GUI
A new view was added to browse through the history of applied updates .
History of applied updates in mintUpload 3
Proxy support was added in the preferences .
Proxy support in mintUpdate 3
Many bug fixes and minor improvements were also introduced :
Log files are now saved in / tmp so they do n’t take unnecessary space in /usr / lib and in / home anymore .
The Internet detection was improved and the domain used for the ping is now configurable .
The routine which checks for the updates ( called checkAPT ) was improved and so was the way it communicates with mintUpdate .
The status reporting was improved .
Logs are now clearer and show more information .
In the GUI , status is now also reported via a status bar .
The configuration moved from /usr / lib / linuxmint / mintUpdate / config to /etc/ linuxmint / mintUpdate.conf and is now persistent ( it wo n’t be affected by package updates ) .
mintUpload 2 , with FTP support
MintUpload is the little tool which pops up when you right - click on a file and select “ upload ” .
Until now mintUpload was mostly used as a way to share files by uploading them to a public place somewhere on one of Linux Mint ’s servers and by sending the corresponding URL to friends and family members ( or to anybody really .. ) .
Some people also bought Mint - Space accounts and were able to set up mintUpload to add an additional upload service to it .
These people could then share files in a similar manner but instead of using a public storage space and being limited to 2 days , they could use their 1GB of Web space and have their files kept there indefinitely .
Initially mintUpload was designed with novice users in mind , people who wanted to share large files with each others and who did n’t know what FTP meant or where to get free web space to store them .
After gathering some feedback , we ’ve come to realize that mintUpload also got popular with experienced users , people who even had their own FTP accounts and wanted a quick way to upload files to it without launching an FTP client .
So we added FTP support to MintUpload by defining another type of service and letting the user define his own FTP services .
Upload files to your FTP server with one click of the mouse !
With mintUpload 2 you can now define “ upload services ” by adding files in /etc/ linuxmint / mintUpload / services / or in ~/.linuxmint/mintUpload / services /
Here ’s an example of an FTP upload service :
type=FTP
name=My own FTP service
host=myhost.com
user=myusername
pass=mypassword
path=myuploads
The “ path ” is optional , it lets you define where within your FTP service you want the files to be uploaded .
In this example we ’re not uploading them in the root folder , but within a directory called “ myuploads ” .
MintUpload will use any service defined with that format and saved as a file within /etc/ linuxmint / mintUpload / services / or ~/.linuxmint/mintUpload / services /
mintNanny - Minimal parental control
One of the features Mint has been lacking as a family desktop is the ability for parents to prevent their children from accessing certain websites .
Parental control is easy to set up in Microsoft Windows and we got a lot of feedback from people who migrated to Linux and who missed this feature .
Of course one could install DansGuardian and a few other packages but it ’s not easy , it usually requires the use of a proxy and it ’s also quite complex to configure .
For Linux
Mint 6 we came with a compromise and we decided to implement a minimal set of features but to make it as trivial to use as possible .
So here comes mintNanny .
mintNanny will block sites you really do n't want to see !
MintNanny is a small graphical interface which lets you “ block ” domain names .
You ca n’t block domains for particular users or particular programs , the block is for everyone on the computer and for any protocol .
When you “ block ” a domain in mintNanny it basically adds an entry to your /etc / hosts file and defines that domain ’s IP address as being 0.0.0.0 .
This results in your computer not being able to communicate with the domain anymore .
So if there are domains you really do n’t want your children to have anything to do with , put them in mintNanny .
Notes :
Remember that mintNanny blocks domain names , not IP addresses so if your children are smart enough to ping the domain from another computer they ’ll be able to access it via its IP address .
Certain domains use subdomains and redirect to them so you might have to block them to .
For instance if you want to block somewebsite.com you might also have to block www.somewebsite.com.
As a rule of thumb try to access the website after you block it to see if your block was efficient enough .
Firefox caches DNS resolutions to speed things up .
This means that it remembers where a website is until you close it .
In other words , after you block a website , you ’ll have to restart Firefox .
Command line goodies - search , apt content and apt contains
A new command called " search " was introduced to let you search for files containing a particular keyword .
The command searches recursively , it highlights the results in red with their corresponding filenames and line numbers and it can even search through binary files .
The content of a package can now be shown by typing " apt content packagename " and you can list the package providing a particular file by typing " apt contains filename " .
For more information on these three new command , read the following blog entry : http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=346
mint4win - A Windows installer for Linux Mint
If you run Microsoft Windows , insert the liveCD and a program called mint4win will launch automatically .
This program is an installer for Linux Mint which runs on Windows .
It installs Linux Mint within a file on one your partitions and it does n't touch your existing partitions .
It also sets up a Windows multiboot for you .
Install Linux Mint from within Windows .
Of course the performance wo n't be as good as if the system was installed in its own partition but if you just want to give Linux Mint a try this is a very good option .
You can remove mint4win from the Add / Remove applications tool within Windows and this will remove Linux Mint and restore your boot exactly as it was .
Note : Mint4win is based on Wubi .
New software
Giver
Giver is an amazing new tool which lets you send files from one computer to another on a local network .
The application lists all the users and their computers currently connected to the network .
Drag and drop files into Giver and the recipient is immediately notified .
As you can see , sharing files across the network has just become trivial ...
Giver now comes pre-installed on Linux Mint .
If it proves popular it will also come pre-loaded in the future .
Gufw
Gufw is an easy and intuitive Firewall configuration tool which now comes pre-installed in Linux Mint .
Open ports for certain applications and easily configure your firewall with Gufw .
Flegita
Flegita , a Gnome utility for scanner devices , was also installed by default .
Upstream Improvements
Kernel , system and X server
Linux Mint 6 Felicia comes with linux 2.6.27 - 7 , and Xorg 7.4 .
Read this article for an overview of the new kernel .
Dell 's DKMS was included by Ubuntu and allows modules to be automatically rebuilt when the kernel gets upgraded .
For more information about DKMS read this article .
On the desktop
Gnome 2.24 comes with tabbed file browsing and better support for multiple monitors .
Ubuntu 8.10 also enhanced multiple aspects of the desktop and the result shows many improvements .
Gimp 2.6 features a much nicer interface .
Network Manager 0.7 provides system - wide settings ( no need to log in to get a connection ) , management of 3G connections ( GSM / CDMA ) , management of multiple active devices at once , management of PPP and PPPOE connections , management of devices with static IP configurations and route management for devices .
The new version of the Ubiquity installer features a graphical representation of your partitions and a new auto - login option for GDM .
Totem comes with BBC and Youtube plugins .
The ClamAV antivirus is now officially supported by Ubuntu and should be kept up to date within the repositories .
It is now possible to start a guest session from the user - switch applet .
Other improvements
" Open as root " now uses Nautilus in root mode with a red background .
It is now possible to configure the menu icon and the search command in MintMenu 4.1 .
Linux
Mint now uses its own LSB information and no longer identifies itself to applications as Ubuntu .
This can potentially break compatibility with some 3rd party tools .
If you experience problems with this , let us know and we will contact the appropriate developers .
Meta -packages were introduced within the repositories to reflect the default selection of packages for the various Linux Mint editions .
The artwork now also comes as a package .
The Linux Mint project as a whole is going through important changes .
The new focus is given to R&D and the design of desktop utilities more than to the base system itself .
The project aims at automating the porting of its technology on top of the current base in an effort to rebase on every single Ubuntu release instead of following its own branch since the initial fork of Edgy .
Since the Edgy / Barbara fork , Linux Mint 6 Felicia is the first release of Linux Mint Main Edition to be built directly from Ubuntu and not from the preceeding Linux Mint release .
The advantages of this are to guarantee an even higher compatibility with Ubuntu , to speed up the process of jumping from one release to another , to automate the process of porting our technology ( which can then be used to " mintify " Ubuntu or other distributions ) and above all to guarantee that most of our time goes into desktop innovations and not in the actual releases themselves .
An upgrade tool was made available to automate the process of upgrading from Linux Mint 5 to Linux Mint 6 .
The Light Edition is now called the " Universal " Edition and it consists in a live DVD with support for all major languages and a menu item to automate the installation of all missing codecs .
A technology called " xdg-user - dirs " is now used for the home folders instead of mintDesktop .
This means home folders no longer come with emblems but they are localized and bookmarked .
The International Ski Federation ( FIS ) is now holding the 2008 - 09 Ski Jumping World Cup - the 30th season to date .
This World Cup season began on November 29th in Kuusamo , Finland , and will run through 28 competitions ending on March 22nd in Planica , Slovenia .
Top jumpers can regularly make jumps of about 140 meters ( 460 feet ) .
The current overall leader ( individual ) is Simon Ammann of Switzerland .

In what ’s been called George W. Bush ’s first exit interview , the outgoing President continues a lie that he first unveiled several months after launching the Iraq War , justifying the invasion by claiming that Saddam Hussein did n’t let the U.N. inspectors in .

Printer friendly Like previous times when President Bush has used this lie , it went unchallenged by the journalist who heard the false claim , in this case ABC News anchor Charles Gibson .
According to the text of the ABC News interview , which was released Dec. 1 , Gibson asked Bush , “ If the [ U.S. ] intelligence had been right [ and revealed no Iraq WMD ] , would there have been an Iraq War ? ”
Bush answered , “ Yes , because Saddam Hussein was unwilling to let the inspectors go in to determine whether or not the U.N. resolutions were being upheld . ”
Of course , the historical record is clear : Hussein did let U.N. arms inspectors into Iraq in the fall of 2002 to search any site of their choosing .
Their travels around Iraq in white vans were recorded daily by the international news media , as they found no evidence that Iraq had WMD stockpiles , even at sites targeted by U.S. intelligence .
Hussein and his government also declared publicly that they did n’t possess WMD , including providing the United Nations a 12,000 - page declaration on Dec. 7 , 2002 , explaining how Iraq ’s stocks of chemical and biological weapons had been destroyed in the 1990s .
However , still set on invading , Bush forced the U.N. inspectors to leave Iraq in March 2003 , a departure that was followed within days by his “ shock and awe ” attack on Iraq , beginning March 19 .
Several months later , with Hussein ’s government ousted and with the U.S. military coming up empty in its search for WMD caches , Bush began his historical revisionism by insisting publicly that he had no choice but to invade because Hussein supposedly had barred U.N. inspectors .
On July 14 , 2003 , Bush told reporters : “ We gave him [ Saddam Hussein ] a chance to allow the inspectors in , and he would n’t let them in .
And , therefore , after a reasonable request , we decided to remove him from power . ”
Facing no contradiction from the White House press corps , Bush continued repeating this lie again and again in varied forms .
On Jan. 27 , 2004 , for example , Bush said , “ We went to the United Nations , of course , and got an overwhelming resolution – 1441 – unanimous resolution , that said to Saddam , you must disclose and destroy your weapons programs , which obviously meant the world felt he had such programs .
He chose defiance .
It was his choice to make , and he did not let us in . ”
Color of Truth
As the months and years went by , Bush ’s lie and its unchallenged retelling took on the color of truth .
At a March 21 , 2006 , news conference , Bush again blamed the war on Hussein ’s defiance of U.N. demands for unfettered inspections .
“ I was hoping to solve this [ Iraq ] problem diplomatically , ” Bush said .
“ The world said , ‘ Disarm , disclose or face serious consequences . ’ …
We worked to make sure that Saddam Hussein heard the message of the world .
And when he chose to deny the inspectors , when he chose not to disclose , then I had the difficult decision to make to remove him .
And we did . ”
At a press conference on May 24 , 2007 , Bush offered a short - hand version , even inviting the journalists to remember the invented history .
“ As you might remember back then , we tried the diplomatic route : [ U.N. Resolution ] 1441 was a unanimous vote in the Security Council that said disclose , disarm or face serious consequences .
So the choice was his [ Hussein ’s ] to make .
And he made a choice that has subsequently caused him to lose his life . ”
In the frequent repetition of this claim , Bush never acknowledged the fact that Hussein did comply with Resolution 1441 by declaring accurately that he had disposed of his WMD stockpiles and by permitting U.N. inspectors to examine any site of their choosing .
Prominent Washington journalists even have repeated Bush ’s lie as their own .
For instance , in a July 2004 interview , ABC ’s veteran newsman Ted Koppel used it to explain why he – Koppel – thought the invasion of Iraq was justified .
“ It did not make logical sense that Saddam Hussein , whose armies had been defeated once before by the United States and the Coalition , would be prepared to lose control over his country if all he had to do was say , ‘ All right , U.N. , come on in , check it out , ” Koppel told Amy Goodman , host of “ Democracy Now . ”
In the real history , Hussein did tell the U.N. to “ come on in , check it out . ”
But faux reality had become the trademark of the Bush presidency -- and its supporters in the press corps .
Choosing War ?
The Washington conventional wisdom eventually embraced another fake belief , that Hussein provoked the war by misleading people into believing that he still possessed WMD .
In line with this bogus version of history , “ 60 Minutes ” correspondent Scott Pelley asked FBI interrogator George Piro , who had debriefed Hussein in prison , why the dictator kept pretending that he had WMD even as U.S. troops massed on Iraq ’s borders , when a simple announcement that the WMD was gone would have prevented the war .
“ For a man who drew America into two wars and countless military engagements , we never knew what Saddam Hussein was thinking , ” Pelley said in introducing the segment on the interrogation of Hussein about his WMD stockpiles , which aired Jan. 27 , 2008 .
“ Why did he choose war with the United States ? ” This “ 60 Minutes ” segment never mentioned the fact that Hussein and his government did disclose that it had eliminated its WMD .
Instead Pelley pressed Piro on the question of why Hussein supposedly was hiding that fact : “ Why keep the secret ?
Why put your nation at risk , why put your own life at risk to maintain this charade ? ”
After Piro mentioned Hussein ’s lingering fear of neighboring Iran , Pelley felt he was close to an answer to the mystery : “ He believed that he could n’t survive without the perception that he had weapons of mass destruction ? ”
But , still , Pelley puzzled over why Hussein ’s continued in his miscalculation .
Pelley asked : “ As the U.S. marched toward war and we began massing troops on his border , why did n’t he stop it then ?
And say , ‘ Look , I have no weapons of mass destruction , ’ I mean , how could he have wanted his country to be invaded ? ”
It apparently never matters to the major U.S. news media ( nor to President Bush ) that Hussein and the Iraq government did declare that they had no WMD and did let the U.N. inspectors in to check .
Now , with the new ABC News interview , it looks as if that pattern – of Bush lying about the circumstances of the Iraq War and the Washington press corps nodding along – will continue until Bush ’s last days in office .

Tens of thousands of arms captured from insurgent armed groups in Iraq have yet to be recorded by Iraqi or U.S. authorities making it easier for the weapons to be lost or stolen , according to a U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ) Inspector General ’s issued just before the Christmas holiday last year .
Poor accountability of night vision devices ( NVD ) remains a problem .
In the last few years , several reports have revealed the dangers of failing to properly secure and manage weapons in Iraq .
For example , described in a November 2008 Amnesty report , some members of Iraqi insurgent groups have infiltrated the Iraqi police force and used police arms to carry out serious human rights abuses .
U.S. military officials have also accused Iraqi security guards of stealing hundreds of weapons in 2006 at arms depots such as Taji National Army Depot ( NAD ) .
While there have been significant strides in improving the accountability of U.S. provided weapons in Iraq as well as helping Iraqi authorities properly manage arms and ammunition under their control , a few areas such as the accountability for captured weapons and NVDs still need focused attention .
According to the DoD Inspector General ’s report , only around 20,000 of the estimated 80,000 captured weapons stored at various depot locations throughout Iraq had been processed .
Processing includes having the weapon ’s serial number recorded and inspecting the quality of the weapon .
Some of the unprocessed arms are at the Taji NAD and Kirkush Military Training Base among others .
In addition , the DoD Inspector General raised concerns about the accountability of U.S. issued night vision devices ( NVD ) to the Iraqi security forces .
NVD receive extra scrutiny under DoD regulations because they significantly increase a fighting forces ’ tactical ability .
A DoD investigation showed 26,000 NVDs lacked proper documentation , raising the risk of loss or theft similar to captured weapons .
You ’ve gotta be kidding me :
Many US Airways ( LCC ) passengers who endured a crash landing in the Hudson River 12 days ago say they appreciate the $ 5,000 that the airline has offered — but some say it ’s not enough .
Joe Hart , a salesman from Charlotte who suffered a bloody nose and bruises , says he “ would like to be made whole for the incident . ”
It ’s too soon after the accident to determine what emotional distress he has suffered , he says .
… Hart says he has talked to a lawyer in North Carolina but has n’t decided whether to take any legal action .
“ I want to see how things play out with US Airways , ” he says .
“ I ’m hopeful US Airways understands the significance of the incident . ”
Kreindler & Kreindler , a New York law firm that has represented plaintiffs in crashes , says it has been contacted by several passengers on the US Airways flight .
The firm ’s lawyers are determining what injuries and emotional distress passengers may have suffered , and what parties might be liable under New York state law , says Noah Kushlefsky , a partner in the firm .
Last Friday ’s resolution in the United Nations Security Council urging a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip passed 14 - 0 , with the abstention of the United States .
The abstention came after President Bush sent last minute orders to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who worked hard winning support for the watered down resolution only to not vote in favor of it .
The move surprised virtually everybody , who assumed the US was going to vote in favor .
But where did Bush ’s orders come from ?
If you believe Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , it came from him .
Olmert claims to have called President Bush , demanded to speak to him even though he was in the process of giving a lecture , and ordered him to stop Rice from voting in favor of the deal .
Olmert seemed quite pleased with himself , adding that his move embarrassed Rice .
The State Department has denied the report , of course , and sparked something of a war of words between Prime Minister Olmert and Secretary Rice .
Israeli newspaper Haaretz did some digging into the reports , and found that Rice had indeed told her French and British counterparts she was “ on board ” for the resolution , only to be thwarted by the last minute phone call .
In their denials US officials insisted they had intended to abstain all along , bolstering Olmert ’s case that something , namely him , changed Bush ’s stance at the last minute .

I was listening to NPR and one of the news hosts made a comment that struck me as being nonsense .
She was talking about the unfortunate auto plant workers in Michigan who will be displaced from their high - paying jobs .
She said ( to paraphrase ) “ all of those uneducated , unskilled workers … ”
Whoops , she stopped because she realized it was too un -pc to say “ uneducated . ”
Then she corrected herself , mentioning that the plant life is all they ’ve ever known and the only option they ’ve ever had , so , it ’s really not their fault that they are in such a rotten predicament .
What bunk !
I moved out of my parent ’s house just one day after my nineteenth birthday and rented a beautiful , old English Tudor , on the cheap , not too far from the Jefferson Avenue Chrysler plant .
The house had stained - glass windows and carved ceilings , and I spent my first winter painting the plastered scrolls and ceilings after researching how it should be done .
My landlords — a Lebanese couple — loved my painstaking handiwork , and they never raised my rent for the ten years that I lived there because good renters were hard to find in the city .
My parents hated that I lived there , in a crime - filled , Detroit neighborhood .
But my friends were paying almost twice what I was paying for their one - bedroom , square - box apartments in the suburbs .
My brothers were working on the assembly line making twice the going wage rate for guys their age .
I struggled , working two or three jobs to be able to pay the rent and afford a car that would start each morning .
I was a full - time short order cook until I was twenty , and I also did freelance art illustration , clothes painting , etc. , to help make ends meet .
I was also working on obtaining my residential real estate license — a big mistake , but I did n’t know it at the time .
No one on either side of my family had ever attended college — this was a foreign concept , even to my parents .
My siblings and I were a part of the first generation who acquired high school diplomas because my family had always been hard - working , blue collar , and reasonably poor .
I was a talented artist but my parents could n’t afford my art school dream — even with a partial scholarship — so that was nixed from my future plans .
In those years I was heavily encouraged to “ go work in the plant .
Apply at GM .
Apply at Chrysler .
Apply at Ford .
You ’ll make lots of dough and get mucho benefits !
And a pension ! ”
Always , Detroiters stressed that a union , autoworker job meant no college needed and job security .
I was told that this was the way to go throughout my teenage and early twenty - something years .
In fact , people around me said I ’d " be sorry " if I passed up the generous hiring opportunities available .
Of course , others were attracted to those jobs because the wage rates were very substantial , especially for individuals without a formal education or marketable skills .
At the time , all of the three auto companies were hiring people right off the street .
Essentially , you filled out a paper application and got hired .
It was that easy .
And it was life in the neighborhood where I grew up .
I drove up to that Jefferson Avenue plant twice , to apply for a job , and I sat there in the parking lot in my car and stared .
I never went in and applied .
My mother was not happy .
In fact , she was upset and thought I was being unreasonable .
My mother had stayed home to raise all of her six children , but she went to work for an automotive supplier in the assembly plant after her last child became self - sufficient .
The price she paid was monotonous work , 70 - hour workweeks , and several surgeries for carpal tunnel injuries .
I just knew that life in the plants was not the life I desired .
I thought it would be long - term sacrifice for some short - term jollies .
I was barely able to make ends meet , but I was not willing to sell off my long - term prospects for some big paychecks now .
Taking that kind of job , for many , is a dead end .
There is no formal education needed ( so it is not sought ) , no career aspirations , and few alternative options if the job goes away , and I understood that fact .
In my gut I knew that I would pay in the long term .
I knew I would miss out on bigger challenges and greater prospects .
People in my neighborhood seemed to do little in the way of creating alternatives for themselves .
They had the same choices I had : the choice between obtaining " more money " now with a routine ( and perhaps unstable ) future , or taking the time to create other possibilities .
Those who took jobs in the auto plants closed the door on a lifetime of opportunities .
Do n’t get me wrong — there are plenty of good folks in those factories who do great work .
Some people see that as their best option , and they make the best of it .
But not all of us are made for that life .
I knew that I needed to think and grow and be challenged for my paycheck .
Plus , I was young and living poor in the city , and one of my greatest fears was still being poor when I went beyond being young .
I feared the prospect of relying on someone or something else and not having significant skills to fall back on .
So I continued to struggle , always working multiple jobs , until I made the move to go to business school .
I spent seven years getting my 120 - credit bachelor ’s degree in accounting at Walsh College ( a private institution ) on a part - time basis while I worked 60 + hours per week in the advertising and printing field .
I sacrificed many nights and weekends to the Gods of accounting textbooks .
Then I took the CPA exam , and following that , I spent another three years working on my first Master ’s degree part - time while I started my new career .
Those workers had options .
Every one of them .
They had options outside of the plants .
There were no phantom powers that forced them to bite the bait and hold on , hoping for the best .
They chose the plant career for various reasons — and mostly , there was the financial incentive of being overpaid , though under - skilled , because of the Union ’s collective bargaining powers .
Their jobs were promised to them for the rest of their working life .
They came to rely upon the union to bring them the goodies , year after year , and they rabidly defended the union ’s ways because they knew that the union enriched them beyond what they could possibly earn elsewhere in the marketplace .
Perhaps many of them never looked into the future and asked , “ What if … ? ” I did do that , and the answers to those questions forced me down another path .
I have one friend who has been working for Ford for 33 years ( he ’s 53 ) , in skilled trades , and he knows his days of big paychecks are coming to end .
He has been making six - figures for years .
He thinks he ’ll have to take a buyout soon .
He has spent his spare time getting various trucking licenses because he does n’t want to retire at 53 years old .
He ’s thinking about the future , and I admire him immensely because he knew what he needed to do and he accomplished it .
He still loves his plant job — it was the right thing for him all along .
But he ’s not expecting — or demanding — any special privileges , so he ’s fully prepared to start a new work life .
Do n’t get the impression that all Union autoworkers are slackers .
There are many who were born into the same blue - collar work ethic as me , yet they are stuck with the consequences of their decisions long ago .
Some , like my friend , are comfortable with that , and those who are n’t like to blame everything else .
The whining we hear from these workers is that they " have no where else to go . "
And the media echoes their woes .
They believe their industry is so important that their situation demands special treatment — job - saving bailouts , free job training , and then , someone needs to hand them a blue - ribbon livelihood .
They demand that their employer be responsible for their loss of job and send them down another golden path .
They ’ve been taught all along that it is someone else — the union , the government , or their current employer — who is responsible for their personal welfare when their jobs get axed .
No one paid for my " re-training " when I left my ten - year career in the advertising and printing industry to take a chance on an accounting - CPA path .
I put in seven long years at great risk and opportunity cost , spent my own money , earned my own scholarships , plus I had to put in my required years of public accounting .
At some point in life you are responsible for making decisions that weigh the benefits of the present vs. the costs in the future .
This is a decision we all make , at some point in our lives , and the future effects of such decisions are enormous .
The decisions you make about your career path follow you forever , and they either haunt you or they reinforce your good judgment .
However , based on my personal experiences and observations , I dispute the notion that people who chose life in the plants had no other options .
This point of view only serves to engender flimsy excuses for the lack of foresight and ambition on the part of those autoworkers that have long known that their jobs were at great risk of going away .
They made the choice to not prepare for that likelihood .
Autoworkers have to wake up to the fact that times have changed , and they have to change — just like the rest of us .
They deserve no political preferences ( called " collective bargaining " ) that make them less vulnerable to the economic and employment blight that is affecting everyone else .
And no , their industry is not special ; their employers are not " national treasures " ; and they are not worthy of subsidies and concessions from the rest of us that will continue to prop up their inflated standard of living .
And considering what I went through , I offer them empathy because I do n’t want to see good people have their lifestyles slashed , but I offer no politically - correct pronouncements about their past gambles and future prospects .
We live with the consequence of our choices .
The Best of Karen De Coster
While visiting Salt Lake City , I had the opportunity to enter the Mormon Tabernacle through a friend with church connections .
While waiting to enter the main doors of the temple for services , I got a kinky idea :
To find a private spot and masturbate my girlfriend ( a pretty brunette ) to orgasm .
I stood there feeling my clit twinge as I pressed my thighs shut at the thought .
I led my friend out of line and down hallways , touching doors and dipping into alcoves to find space .
I came upon what may have been a church elder 's office .
It was dark with burl wood , leather furniture , photos of the LDS 's leadership on the wall .
I pulled my girl down below the desk with me and we sat , side - by - side with our backs against the cabinet behind the desk .
I started kissing her , and soon she became hip to what I had in mind - orgasms here , in this place .
We kissed and stroked each other .
Her heart was pounding and so was mine at the thought of getting caught by the LDS 's church police squad .
We were moving rapidly for a good quick fuck , my hands exploring all over her body .
Through her long , smooth hair .
Along her tiny waist , her hips , her full bottom .
She was shaking with nervousness but also moaning and pushing into me , suggesting she was ready to make a go of it .
Ending the make - out session , I put her on her hands and knees in the rear - entry position .
I lifted her skirt up around her waist and got her panties off .
I reached around and began stroking her clit and her soft , bushy mons with my right hand .
She was fully swollen and wet .
I slid my fingers between her pussy lips and really started working her .
I wanted to dry hump her as I did this , so I changed angles , positioning my clit ( I was still in clothes ) against her left buttock and reaching around her with my right , masturbating her hard as I ground against her ass .
The sensation was phenomenal for both of us .
She was loving being dominated by me .
She soon erupted into orgasm and as soon as she was finished , I pulled my hand away and placed it against her hip so I could dry hump her squarely .
Within about 10 thrusts , I was shuddering .
Five more and I was having a sublime release .
We comported ourselves in a hurry and skulked through the halls , returning to the crowd of waiting worshippers .
As we stood around , I grazed my hand across my lips and inhaled her musky perfume .
The faintest grin registered across my lips .
Just like Information Superhighway and cyberspace , the terms hyperlink and hypertext seem to have dropped out of fashion .
Despite this , hypertext is still the foundation of the Web — one of its core features .
The humble HTML < a > tag is the sole element that produces the hyperlinks that change plain text into hypertext .
It still surprises and annoys me when such a central feature of a web page seems to be taken for granted .
Poor linking practices are common — editorially and visually — and it has a direct negative impact on usability .
The Rogues Gallery
It ’s time to out these outlaws , so here is my rogues gallery of hypertext — all of them wanted criminals for crimes against usability !
The Tautology
The tautology link is not a new innovation , but it may appear suddenly , without warning , in a block of hypertext .
You may have seen hypertext that looks like this :
You can find two great examples < a href= " / " > here < / a> and < a href= " / " > here </a>. < a href= " / " > Click here </a> for another one !
A hyperlink implies a destination that is reachable by clicking the link ; the tautology link only serves to state the obvious !
The Leisure - suit
The leisure - suit link just points vaguely .
If you want to follow it , you ’re on your own .
Here ’s an example :
In fact , you can < a href= " / " > find </a> < a href= " / " > so </a> < a href= " / " > many < /a> < a href= " / " > examples < /a > of poor linking you may think the world no longer cares .
Too lazy to write meaningful hypertext ?
Just link a whole bunch of words and let the user deal with it .
The Middle-man
Some authors prefer to contract their hypertext out to a middle man .
There ’s a place for URL shortening services , sites like Twitter , for example , but there ’s no excuse for using them in your hypertext .
In the absence of any other context the user can fall back to examining the URL of a link .
Taking that away by using a URL shortening service is the equivalent of sending them down the river without a paddle .
The Interference
You often see this in web sites like Wikipedia and Everything2 — words that are linked to information that has little relevance to the surrounding text .
For example :
Hyperlinks are the < a href= " / a_page_about_glue " > glue < /a > that holds the Web together .
The Departed
Against the departed , hypertext never has a chance .
Have you noticed that many mainstream news media web sites refer to other web sites without providing links in the article body text ?
Call that hypertext ?
It ’s a massacre !
The Stalker
You ’ll only see a stalker link when you ’re right on top of it !
This one is becoming less common , but you still see examples occasionally .
The stalker link is so similar in appearance to the surrounding text , you ’d never even know it ’s there .
The Telemarketer
The scourge of hypertext , the telemarketer link includes a hovering box displaying a thumbnail preview of the target web page .
What possible use is there for a small blurry thumbnail of the link target that pops - up and obscures the surrounding text ?
And what about those double - underlined advertising links ?
Users should never have to experience those .
The Good Hyperlink
Poor quality hypertext is a usability disaster causing annoyance , confusion , and anxiety .
Users expect links , and that the links will be relevant and useful .
A good hyperlink is relevant to the surrounding text and provides enough information for the user to make an informed decision about whether to leave the current page they ’re on and follow .
Here ’s an example of a useful hyperlink :
For excellent examples of finely crafted hypertext look no further than < a href = " http://kottke.org/ ">kottke.org , the online home of Jason Kottke < /a >.
The linked text must have relevance , as it ’s the first hint the user will receive as to the nature of the link .
The test of good link text is whether it can stand alone on a page , outside of the hypertext of which it ’s a part , and still make sense .
Links must also be styled differently to the surrounding text .
They can be another color than blue , as long as it ’s different to the normal text , and that all the links in the page are the same color , so they ’ll be clearly visible .
A title attribute is optional , but should be used independently from providing a context because the tool tip only appears when using the mouse .
If the link text is sufficient , it ’s unnecessary anyway .
Well - crafted hypertext is simple to read and use , and frankly , simple to create !
Are you guilty of crimes against hypertext ?
Most clients are good clients , and some clients are great clients .
But some jobs are just never going to work out well .
Herewith , a few indicators that a project may be headed to the toilet .
Guarantee : All incidents taken from life .
Client asks who designed your website .
Client shows you around the factory , introducing you to all his employees .
Then , behind closed doors , tells you : “ If you do a bad job with this website , I ’m going to have to let these people go . ”
Client takes six months to respond to your proposal , but does n’t change his due date .
At beginning of get - acquainted meeting , client informs you that someone has just bought his company .
Client , who manufactures Russian nesting dolls , demands to know how many Russian nesting doll sites you have designed .
At meeting to which you have traveled at your own expense , client informs you that he does n’t have a budget per se , but is open to “ trading services . ”
Client ca n’t articulate a single desired user goal .
He also ca n’t articulate a business strategy , an online strategy , a reason for the site ’s existence , or a goal or metric for improving the website .
In spite of all that , client has designed his own heavily detailed wireframes .
As get - acquainted meeting is about to wrap , the guy at the end of the table , who has been quiet for an hour and 55 minutes , suddenly opens his mouth .
Leaning forward intensely , client tells you he knows his current site “ sucks ” and admits quite frankly that he does n’t know what to do about it .
He asks how you would approach such a problem .
As you begin to speak , he starts flipping through messages on his Blackberry .
Client announces that he is a “ vision guy , ” and will not be involved in the “ minutia ” of designing the website .
He announces that his employee , the client contact , will be “ fully empowered ” to approve each deliverable .
On the eve of delivery , the previously uninvolved “ vision guy ” sends drawings of his idea of what the web layout should look like .
These drawings have nothing to do with the user research you conducted , nor with the approved recommendations , nor with the approved wireframes , nor with the approved final design , nor with the approved final additional page layouts , nor with the approved HTML templates that you are now integrating into the CMS .
Your favorite client , for whom you have done fine work in the past , gets a new boss .
The client wants web 2.0 features but cannot articulate a business strategy or user goal .
Shortly before you ship , the company fires your client .
An overwhelmed assistant takes the delivery .
The new site never launches .
Two years later , a new person in your old client ’s job emails you to invite you to redesign the site .
Client sends a 40 - page RFP , including committee - approved flow diagrams created in Microsoft Art.
Client tells you he has conducted a usability study with his wife .
Client begins first meeting by making a big show of telling you that you are the expert .
You are in charge , he says : he will defer to you in all things , because you understand the web and he does not .
( Trust your uncle Jeffrey : this man will micromanage every hair on the project ’s head . )
As approved , stripped - down “ social networking web application ” site is about to ship , a previously uninvolved marketing guy starts telling you , your client , and your client ’s boss that the minimalist look “ does n’t knock me out . ”
A discussion of what the site ’s 18 - year - old users want , backed by research , does not dent the determination of the 52 - year - old marketing guy to demand a rethink of the approved design to be more appealing to his aesthetic sensibility .
While back - end work is finishing , client rethinks the architecture .
Client wants the best .
Once you tell him what the best costs , he asks if you can scale back .
You craft a scaled - back proposal , but , without disclosing a budget or even hinting at what might be viable for him , the client asks if you can scale it down further .
After you ’ve put 40 hours into back - and - forth negotiation , client asks if you ca n’t design just the home page in Photoshop .

Maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„ ¢s just me , but it seems there has been an unusually high number of investment - related frauds hitting the news lately .

He even had a motorcycle stashed nearby upon which to escape , but alas , his freedom lasted only a few days before he was captured .
While the total value of his fraud is much less than MadoffÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s , you have to award Schrenker additional style points for originality .
Today , comes news of another scam Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this time out of Japan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ using a currency trading fund as the bait , and it appears that most of the victims are Japanese housewives .
For those that have watched the rise of the retail forex market , this is interesting as the Japanese housewife is a bit of forex folklore .
As online currency trading grew , it exploded in Japan and became a favored way for housewives to add to the family income without leaving the home ; several even became minor celebrities as there were a number of high - dollar success stories .
Nicknamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mrs. WatanabesÃ¢â‚¬Â , the housewives practically cornered the market on the yen - based carry trade using low - yielding yen to finance highly - leveraged positions holding Aussie and New Zealand dollars which paid much greater interest .
Unfortunately , many of the Mrs. Watanabes suffered huge losses when exchange rates suddenly moved against them and stories of entire household savings being wiped out were all - too - common .
The recent narrowing of global interest rates has further reduced the effectiveness of the carry trade strategy leaving many former traders looking for another way to profit in the currency market .
Enter Allied LLC ; an asset manager based in Osaka that promised a 5 percent return to all its investors .
Things apparently went great for the first little while , but last November , the dividends ceased arriving and worried investors called the authorities .
A raid at the Allied LLC headquarters failed to find any trace of the fund operators or the 2.4 billion yen ( 26.5 million USD ) entrusted to its care .
Knowing the history of retail currency trading in Japan and the Mrs. Watanabe phenomenon , this scheme was clearly targeted at a specific group .
So far , three hundred victims have contacted police , and hopefully , the funds can be recovered and the losses minimized but this is unlikely .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s hard for most people to believe that there are those out there whose sole ambition is to take advantage of others but as we all brace for a difficult year ahead , be aware that those intent on stealing from others will be even more desperate .
The U.S. will give an estimated $ 26 billion in foreign aid in 2008 — 70 % more than when President George W. Bush took office ( the figure does n’t include funds related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ) .
More than 150 countries get financial assistance from the U.S.
Here are the six that received the most this year .
COUNTRY AID PURPOSE 1 . Israel $ 2.4 billion Virtually all of this money is used to buy weapons ( up to 75 % made in the U.S. ) .
Beginning in 2009 , the U.S. plans to give $ 30 billion over 10 years .
2 . Egypt $ 1.7 billion $ 1.3 billion to buy weapons ; $ 103 million for education ; $ 74 million for health care ; $ 45 million to promote civic participation and human rights .
3 . Pakistan $ 798 million $ 330 million for security efforts , including military - equipment upgrades and border security ; $ 20 million for infrastructure .
4 . Jordan $ 688 million $ 326 million to fight terrorism and promote regional stability through equipment upgrades and training ; $ 163 million cash payment to the Jordanian government .
5 . Kenya $ 586 million $ 501 million to fight HIV / AIDS through drug treatment and abstinence education and to combat malaria ; $ 15 million for agricultural development ; $ 5.4 million for programs that promote government accountability .
6 . South Africa $ 574 million $ 557 million to fight TB and HIV / AIDS ; $ 3 million for education .

Writing American Tuna Polyface Farm Lobbying For Ignorance ?

SANTA ANA - The U.S. Supreme Court refused Monday to review a lower court decision ordering Garden Grove police to return eight grams of marijuana seized from a patient who had been pulled over in a traffic stop , an attorney said .
The case involving Garden Grove resident Felix Kha that the nation 's highest court refused to take up was a landmark ruling , issued on Nov. 28 , 2007 by California 's Fourth District Court of Appeal that held " it is not the job of local police to enforce the federal drug laws , " according to Joe Elford , chief counsel with Americans for Safe Access .
The city of Garden Grove appealed to the California Supreme Court , which refused to review the decision in March , then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court .
Elford called the court 's refusal to consider the case a victory in clarifying law enforcement 's obligation to uphold state law regarding medical marijuana .
The lower court 's 41 - page decision found that the state 's medical marijuana law was not preempted by federal law , Elford said .
The decision will result in better adherence to state medical marijuana laws by local police and will result in fewer needless arrests and seizures , advocates assert .
" It 's now settled that state law enforcement officers cannot arrest Medical marijuana patients or seize their medicine simply because they prefer the contrary federal law , " Elford said .
" Perhaps , in the future local government will think twice about expending significant time and resources to defy a law that is overwhelmingly supported by the people of our state . "
Lois Bobak , a private attorney whose firm represents the city on a contract basis , said the issue in the case was a narrow one .
" The U.S. Supreme Court did n't issue any kind of ruling , it just failed to review a lower - court decision , " Bobak said .
" You can't read too much into that fact .
The city felt it was important to pursue the legal principle that police should n't be put in a position of returning a substance that is contraband under federal law . "
Kha , 23 , was stopped by police on June 10 , 2005 .
He pleaded guilty to a traffic violation , but a charge of possessing marijuana while driving was dropped after he produced a doctor 's note approving Kha 's use , which he said was for severe back pain .
A judge ordered the return of the marijuana but the city saw itself as caught in the middle of a conflict between state and federal law .
Bobak said Kha did not have his doctor 's note on him when police stopped him , which allowed police to properly seize it .
The city argued that because the seizure was legal in light of Kha 's failure to carry the note , the marijuana did not have to be returned .
Of the high court 's refusal to take the case , Bobak said , " I think it gives clear direction to police if they confiscate ( medical ) marijuana and a person later establishes they qualify for it . "
The marijuana has not been returned but will be once the city gets the deny of review ruling .
A case challenging Anaheim 's ban on dispensaries , an entirely separate issue , is pending before the Fourth District Court of Appeal , Elford said .
Cardinal Jorge Medina was speaking at a mass for Pinochet , who is responsible for the disappearance or death of 3,000 people , when he told the cong American singer and sex fiend Madonna 's behavior is " lustful , a stain on humanity , and offensive to God , " said a Roman Catholic priest with close ties to now - deceased military dictator and mass murderer General Augusto Pinochet .

But he cobbled together money from friends 
“ I think they wrote me checks out of pity for my poor , about - to - be - divorced state ”  and printed 2,500 copies .
The first printing sold , as did the next , and after an excerpt in Harper ’s Weekly , Bantam decided to publish “ Ecotopia . ”
The author now calls it “ a lucky little book . ”
But not a classic book , the kind taught along with Herman Melville in American literature classes .
Set at what seems to be the turn of the 21st century , and told through the columns and diaries of a reporter from the fictional New York Times - Post , the novel is not especially literary .
Its characters are flat ; its prose  well , call it utilitarian .
And the plot , in which the narrator drops his skepticism and settles into Ecotopian life , thanks in part to a love interest , lacks sophistication .
And yet the book has managed to find its place in the here and now .
Image
Alan Weisman , author of last year ’s acclaimed “ The World Without Us , ” a nonfiction chronicle of the planet after the departure of the human race , said the book was ahead of its time .
Environmental writing in the early ’ 70s was not especially concerned with shortage and sustainability , he said .
“ A lot of it was about preserving beautiful areas and beautiful species . ”
In fact , like other important environmental books , the novel ’s impact may be lasting .
Writing has a special place in the environmental movement  “ a literature with measurable effects , ” wrote Bill McKibben , in the introduction to “ American Earth : Environmental Writing Since Thoreau , ” a new anthology .
John Muir ’s essays and books about the Sierra Nevada gave the country national parks , just as Bob Marshall ’s writings about forestry led to the Wilderness Act , which has protected millions of acres of federal land .
So what has “ Ecotopia ” given us ?
A great deal , thinks Professor Slovic of the University of Nevada , including the bioregionalism movement , which considers each part of the country as having a distinct ecological character to be cultivated .
The green movement ’s focus on local foods and products , and its emphasis on energy reduction also have roots in “ Ecotopia , ” he said .
In fact , much of Portland , Ore. , with its public transport , slow - growth planning and eat - local restaurants , can seem like Ecotopia made reality .
Lisa Jackson is trained as a chemical engineer ( as was the outgoing Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman ) .
It should go without saying that I like to see technical people in roles like this , where understanding science and data are both critical .
Carol Browner , while not trained as a technical person , has a lot of administrative experience within the EPA .
Incidentally , I once met Mrs. Browner , as she was the person who presented my research group with the 1996 Green Chemistry Challenge Award at the National Academy of Sciences for our work on biomass conversion to fuels .
The team includes Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Chu as Secretary of Energy , former EPA head Carol Browner to fill the newly - created job of Energy Czar , and Lisa Jackson to head the EPA .
The focus of this essay will be on Dr. Chu , but I will comment briefly on the others .
In case you are just venturing out of your cave for the first time in a week , you are probably aware that President - elect Obama has announced his new energy team :
While I do n't know nearly as much about Browner and Jackson , Dr. Chu has a very long public record .
I have been searching through his various publications , speeches , and presentations to get a good picture of the man .
Here is what President - elect Obama had to say about Dr. Chu :
" His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science .
We will make decisions based on the facts , and we understand that facts demand bold action . "
If you asked me for a few characteristics that would top my list of desirables for the spot of Energy Secretary , I would want someone who is 1 ) .
Knowledgeable about a broad range of energy technologies ; 2 ) . Passionate about the subject ; 3 ) .
Not highly partisan , and can work with diverse groups .
Dr. Chu's record indicates to me that he easily fills my three criteria .
Dr. Chu is currently director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
Among his accomplishments there was to secure a $ 500 million partnership with BP to do alternative energy research .
( See this story from Salon for more details . )
This suggests someone who can work with industry on next generation energy technologies .
I am not sure how quickly he feels we can transition away from oil , and therefore whether we need additional exploration and drilling .
I could n't find anything regarding his position on drilling .
However , he has been outspoken over his opposition to coal , and his concerns about global warming .
Some quotes on these topics from Dr. Chu .
First , his position on coal is pretty clear :
" Coal is my worst nightmare . "
He favors nuclear energy over coal ( it should come as no suprise that a physicist like Dr. Chu is pro-nuclear ) :
" The fear of radiation should n't even enter into this . "
" Coal is very , very bad .
Nuclear has to be a necessary part of the portfolio . "
Chu , who also is professor of physics and molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley , said nuclear is the preferred choice to coal , pointing out that coal releases 50 percent more radioactivity than nuclear power plants .
His concerns over global warming have been well - publicized :
Consider this .
There ’s about a 50 percent chance , the climate experts tell us , that in this century we will go up in temperature by three degrees Centigrade .
Now , three degrees Centigrade does n’t seem a lot to you , that ’s 11° F. Chicago changes by 30° F in half a day .
But 5° C means that … it ’s the difference between where we are today and where we were in the last ice age .
What did that mean ?
Canada , the United States down to Ohio and Pennsylvania , was covered in ice year round .
So think about what 5° C will mean going the other way .
A very different world .
So if you ’d want that for your kids and grandkids , we can continue what we ’re doing .
Climate change of that scale will cause enormous resource wars , over water , arable land , and massive population displacements .
We ’re not talking about ten thousand people .
We ’re not talking about ten million people , we ’re talking about hundreds of millions to billions of people being flooded out , permanently .
He is no fan of corn ethanol :
We can indeed make fuel out of crops .
Corn is not the right crop .
The reason it ’s not the right crop is because the amount of energy you put into making a fuel and growing the corn and fertilizing the corn fields and plowing the fields is within ten or 20 percent of the amount of energy you get by making it into the ethanol that you can put in your car .
Also , the amount of CO2 you create by growing corn is again within 20 percent of the amount of carbon dioxide you make by drilling and refining oil and putting into your car .
If someone wants to argue from authority about the efficiency of making ethanol from corn , they need to find a better authority than a Nobel Prize winner who runs an energy research lab .
He favors higher gas taxes :
" Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe . "
Source .
From that same article :
Lee Schipper , a project scientist with the Global Metropolitan Studies program at U.C. Berkeley , hailed Obama ’s nomination of Chu as Energy Secretary and praised his colleague ’s support for higher gasoline taxes .
Schipper thinks Obama ’s concerns about not placing additional burdens on America ’s families can be addressed by agreeing to rebate all -- or close to all -- of the money raised by higher fuel taxes .
“ The answer is : raise the price of gasoline and give all the money back , ” said Schipper .
Hmm .
Where have I heard that before ?
He stresses the need for greater energy efficiency ( and like me , wants to be emperor of the world ) :
" I can not impress upon you enough how important energy efficiency is . "
" Just refrigerator efficiency -- bigger refrigerators by the way -- saves more energy than all we ’re generating from renewables [ today ] , excluding hydroelectric power . "
" If I were emperor of the world , I would put the pedal to the floor on energy efficiency and conservation for the next decade . "
And he recognizes that the U.S. can be a leader in new energy technologies , but are starting to fall behind in some areas .
" We have an option to be a leader in energy technologies , but we are not because our support system for that is on again off again .
The future wealth of the United States will come from our ability to invent new technologies . "
" Americans take for granted that the United States leads the world in science .
But we 've lost many of these leads , especially when it comes to energy . "
" The U.S. is making it easier for other countries to catch up and pass us . "
So , let 's see .
He has had a career focused on energy , is clearly passionate about the subject , is n't enthusiastic about making ethanol from corn , thinks we need higher gas taxes , favors nuclear power , favors alternative energy funding , favors higher energy efficiency , and is pro-science .
That 's exactly how I would describe myself , so from my perspective I love the choice .
It 's like we are twins ( think Danny Devito and Arnold Schwarzenegger ) .
I agree ( almost completely ) with his priorities .
He has also been involved in research on cellulosic ethanol , and will likely send more research dollars flowing in that direction .
I think the issue that will generate some controversy is his very strong position on global warming .
Not since Al Gore was Vice - President will there be such a staunch proponent of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the highest levels of government .
Global warming activists will love him .
Skeptics probably wo n't be quite so enthusiastic .

Here are the quick bios of the rest of the energy / environment team , courtesy of Wired :
Lisa Jackson , EPA head
Quick bio : Trained as a chemical engineer at Princeton , she has spent her entire career with government environmental agencies .
She worked her way up through the EPA from 1987 - 2002 , then moved to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection , eventually becoming its head in 2006 .
She was appointed as New Jersey Governor John Corzine 's chief - of - staff less than a month ago .
Carol Browner , energy czar
Quick bio :
The longest - serving EPA administrator in the history of the agency , Browner is the non-scientist on the team .
She came up through politics , working as Al Gore 's legislative director in the late 1980s , before heading the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation .
She was appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993 to helm the EPA and left in 2001 .
Since then , she 's been a consultant with The Albright Group .
Her position :
The new " energy czar " will coordinate ( and politically shepherd ) the President - elect 's various proposals around energy and the environment .
MOVIE REVIEW
also known as “ Marley and Me , ” “ Io e Marley , ” “ Marley and Eu , ” “ Marley and ich ”
Reviewed by : Thaisha Geiger
CONTRIBUTOR
“ Life and love with the world ’s worst dog ”
Who would n’t love a cute , yellow fur ball that does n’t just chew household items , but actually eats them ?
Adapted from the best - selling novel , “ Marley and Me ” tells the story of how a yellow retriever was labeled “ the world ’s worst dog ” by his owners .
Only come to find out later , that Marley was not such a bad dog after all , but a beloved member of their family .
Newlyweds John and Jennifer Grogan are news reporters for rivaling newspapers in Florida .
As with many newly married couples , they are not quite sure about children , and a dog seems like the next natural step .
So they decide on a male golden retriever and name him Marley .
Not long goes by before they realize that Marley eats anything in sight , is destructively afraid of thunderstorms , and likes to chase anything with feet .
As their family grows with three children and relocates to Pennsylvania , Marley never changes his loving , unruly personality .
Owen Wilson and Jennifer Anniston did well in their lead roles .
It was nice to see Wilson back on the big screen in a cleaner film .
No less than 22 dogs were used in the making of the film and one can see why .
Whenever Marley entered a scene , he was always running , barking , or tearing up something .
After several of these , the point was made of Marley ’s antics .
One unfamiliar with the book would wonder how in the world the Grogans ever put up with a dog like Marley .
In the novel , Grogan also explains Marley ’s positive attributes that made him a crazy , but lovable dog .
The film does not enter this part until the very end of the film when his loving nature is explained through merely dialogue .
It would have been nice if more moments were visually shown about how Marley was actually a pretty decent dog .
Offensive Content
Before getting into the offensive content , I feel I should warn parents that this film is not entirely appropriate for small or even impressionable children .
The film has been marketed as a movie for the entire family ; however , the profanities and sexual references make the movie not ideal for very young children .
The movie should have been rated PG - 13 .
As for the profanity , the Lord ’s name is profaned about 17 times .
In addition , I counted 8 more curse words , including SOB and sh*t .
Conversations of “ balls ” and “ boobs ” take place .
There is quite a bit of sexual content in the movie .
While the majority does take place between a husband and wife , parents ultimately will know whether or not their children are old enough to handle it .
After discussing having children , John and Jennifer are shown rolling around in a bed , kissing .
In one scene , Jennifer calls John to tell him there ’s a naked woman in the bed .
He jokingly tells her to get started with the woman , so a threesome is implied .
When visiting Ireland , John mentions he can have sex in front of Jesus or even Mary , but not that man ( he points to the pope ) .
He says the creaking in the bed is probably oversexed souls in hell .
Jennifer mentions the thought of having sex in a prudish house turns her on .
The bed creaks as they begin kissing .
In one scene , Jennifer surprises John by skinny dipping in the pool .
She is shown taking off her dress from behind .
While nothing is shown , their being nude is heavily implied .
There are some other instances that might offend a Christian viewer that are worth mentioning .
Throughout the film , many women are shown in bikinis .
Marley pulls the towel off of the house sitter ( off screen ) .
Drinking takes place several times during the movie .
In the beginning , John and his wife take turns taking drinks from a wine bottle .
Grogan tells his boss about his bong - hits back in school .
His boss later asks him if he and his wife are having sex and if John ’s “ pulling a goalie . ”
Marley humps the dog trainer .
Marley goes to the bathroom often and is shown chewing up different things , including a bra .
Grogan ’s friend Sebastian is a negative influence and a constant flirt .
The film is touching in its portrayal of the difficulties of marriage and raising a family .
While most couples would have given up and filed for divorce , the Grogans stuck together through the tough times and raised their children together .
While it would have been nice if God was referenced , it was refreshing to see a marriage depicted as a serious commitment in a film .
Too many people today merely view marriage “ as a sheet of paper ” and just give up when things get a bit tough .
However , marriage is a holy commitment in the joining of two people for the rest of their lives .
Jesus wisely said :
“ but at the beginning of creation God made them male and female .
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and the two will become one flesh .
So they are no longer two , but one .
Therefore what God has joined together , let man not separate . ”
Although the movie lacked the charm of John Grogan ’s writing , the movie did have its own funny moments .
With the above reservations , I do recommend the film , but only to parents and much older children .
If you do decide to take young children , please be forewarned that an animal is shown being put to sleep .
This is a heart - wrenching scene , so be prepared to discuss it .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) --
An Iranian court has sentenced to jail and lashes 16 former Central Bank staff for taking bribes including 35 billion rials ( $ 3.5 million ) in cash as well as gold and foreign currencies , state radio reported .
It was the latest sign of the Islamic republic , whose leaders have vowed to root out graft , getting increasingly tough on corruption in the world 's fourth - largest oil producer .
The radio report said those accused received sentences of 10 years in prison , lashes , and fines in the Tehran court 's " initial verdict , " without making clear whether all 16 were handed the same punishment .
The report did not say when any lashings would take place .
They were also banned from holding government office again , it said , without detailing the crimes and saying what positions they had held in the Central Bank .
They were accused of receiving 35 billion rials in cash and large quantities of gold coins and foreign currencies in exchange for providing finance in the form of letters of credit , a key tool for trade , the radio said .
President Mahmud Ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 vowing to clamp down on corruption .
Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously also ordered a crackdown on graft .
Last January , Iran 's judiciary said a customs contractor was executed for corruption and three customs employees were sentenced to death , a rare use of capital punishment for economic crimes in the country .
Earlier the same month , an Iranian court sentenced three state gas company managers to 10 years in prison and 74 lashes each for taking bribes totaling 23 billion rials .
Everyday , all over the world , people assemble peacefully into crowds at places such as shopping malls , sporting events , concerts and tourist sites -- but crowds can shift from peaceful to unruly , even riotous , in just a few minutes given the right conditions .
The factors that cause a charged  crowd to reach a tipping point and erupt into violence are not well understood by scientists because crowd behavior is so difficult to study .
No one wants to incite a riot for the sake of science and surveys of individuals about their behavior as part of a crowd have not been that reliable .
 Crowds are complex , adaptive systems that may seem chaotic but have an underlying order ,  said Paul Torrens , associate professor in the School of Geographical Sciences at Arizona State University , and director of its Geosimulation Laboratory .
 They self - assemble in time and space and exhibit geometric patterns based on layer upon layer of human - to - human and human - to - environment interactions .
They are almost impossible to model realistically .
But that is exactly what he and his colleagues are intent on doing .
Torrens and his research team , with funding from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , are developing a synthetic laboratory populated with thousands of artificial agents to experiment with ideas and theories about crowd behavior and dynamics that would otherwise be impenetrable to academic inquiry .
Of special interest are the geographic processes that occur for a crowd to become charged and then cross over the tipping point into a full - blown riot .
 People interact over space and time - - socially , physically , verbally , and , increasingly , digitally -- with each other , within groups , and between factions to cooperate and conflict in seditious crowds ,  Torrens said .
 We model riot dynamics from the bottom - up , at the geography of individual crowd participants . 
Each artificial agent in the synthetic laboratory possesses a brain that allows it to function as a distinctive individual within the broader group framework .
Researchers can record and analyze each agents behavior , activity , social and anti-social interactions , and explore how those behaviors adapt as conditions unfold .
These simulations permit model - users to modify the spaces where activity will take place , adapt agent behaviors and shift agendas to replicate a broad range of social and environmental conditions .
They also provide different perspectives , so the researcher can watch the scenario from above or be immersed into it .
One of the most significant findings from scenarios studied in the synthetic laboratory is the rapid exchange of nonverbal information in crowds through expressions , locomotion and individual interaction with other individuals .
Another finding is the phenomenon of scaling ,  whereby the actions of a single individual can shape the dynamics of entire crowd .
For example , an individuals subtle stop - and - start movement amid panicked crowds caused larger waves , which then washed through the crowd , causing further obstructions and ultimately large - scale congestion .
 The actions of a single individual can shape the dynamics of an entire crowd he noted .
Torrens believes understanding the small - scale geographies of movement and body language can help identify the behavioral nuances that spark interactions within crowds .
His team is extracting motion - capture data from videos of crowds to hone the agents  small - scale geographies of movement and body language .
 Every individual in the crowd brings social , environmental , cultural , gender and past - experience influences to the mix ,  Torrrens said .
 We also know individual behavior can be influenced negatively or positively by the crowds collective psychology . 
For example , individuals who would never ordinarily engage in anti-social behavior such as looting might do so anyway when associated with a riotous crowd ; and , conversely , anti-social individuals may see their bad behavior checked by other members of a well - behaved crowd .
 When I was living in New York I saw a number individuals engage in anti-social behavior on the subway only to have their behavior be immediately tamped down by the other passengers ,  Torrens said .
 Mob mentality can be a positive , peace keeping force , but we dont think of it that way because those are not the incidents that make it onto the evening news . 
When mob mentality goes the other way , with escalating tension and violence , it may be possible to identify shifting patterns and phases in a crowd in the minutes leading up to a tipping point , Torrens believes .
If so , law - enforcement and other officials could be trained to recognize the patterns and counter them with tactics that calm rather than incite the crowd .
 At some future date , wed like our model scenarios to be reviewed by police officers who have worked on the ground with crowds for a number of years to see if their experiences agree with what our models are demonstrating ,  Torrens said .
 We think the information exchange would benefit both of us . 
The researchers are also sharing their findings with commercial companies in exchange for modeling software .
 Most software games depict crowds as little more than cardboard cutouts ,  Torrens notes .
The designers would love to create more sophisticated depictions .
It would make their games far more realistic "
Ordinarily scientists calibrate a new model with known data , but the lack of data made that impossible for Torrens and his colleagues .
To find data to inform their scenarios , they are extracting information from existing videos of crowd behavior , taking surveys of their own and using case studies of adults and children -- even animals .
Data from ant farm studies has already found its way into the synthetic laboratory .
With additional NSF funding , they recently launched a study of preschool children to determine how and where they form groups in their school environment .
A panel of observers will track the movement behavior of the kids in space and time .
 We re trying to extract rules of how they form groups over time ,  Torrens said .
 Do they gather around toys , other children , or their teachers ? 
The panel will study them all day every day for three years .
 It s a remarkable opportunity because these children have never been social before , so their behavior is completely fresh to the environment . 
In five years time , the researchers hope to run a realistic scenario with a cast of thousands in an entire city section .
The results of their research will provide valuable new insights and information for those engaged in crowd control , emergency management and urban planning .
The modeling framework will also be easily adaptable for use by other researchers .
 This research is dramatically transforming the way crowds and the actions of individuals within crowds are studied ,  said NSF Program Officer Thomas Baerwald .
 In addition to its enormous value for practitioners , it is stimulating innovative new lines of inquiry in the social , behavioral , and computational sciences . 
Ever feel like you are suddenly standing in a pool of quicksand and there is nothing that you can do to get out of it ?
Lately this is how social media has felt like .
From both as a blogger and as a consumer .
Services that are suppose to make things easier only seem to be muddying the waters .
Distractions become almost the norm as we flit from one service to another and then try and pull them altogether with some sort of aggregator .
There is this underlying pressure to be a part of conversations , to create new conversations .
It was n’t so hard when all we had to do was remember what blogs we might have left comments on .
Now though our blog comments are being spread all over with services like Disqus or IntenseDebate ; which are then pulled in – or not pulled into – aggregrators like FriendFeed or Strands .
Where do we go now to be a part of conversations or to start new ones .
We have Twitter , Facebook , Myspace , blogs or again the aggregators with their inline comments .
We are becoming a quagmire of conversations into which now we have Google and Facebook throwing their immense weight .
All this is suppose to be under the guise of data portability but all I am seeing is a mish - mash of disjointed conversations .
Am I talking to you on a blog or on Facebook or on FriendFeed ?
Or how about Twitter or the Strands or – well you pick the spot because I am sure there is aconversation going there as well .
The further we go along this road of ubiquitous conversations it all feels like it is becoming more like white noise .
We all seem to be turning into nothing more than talking points in some - one else ’s marketing or brand promotion .
We comment on one site and the next thing we know those comments could end up on Facebook .
It could end up on some Google Friend Wall or sitting in some aggregator .
We are getting lost in our own conversation jungle .
From the blogger ’s point of view it is a mass confusion of what services to we use ?
We stare nervously at new join forms wondering if we should maybe join some other service instead of this one .
Which one is going to be better to promote our brand on ?
which one is going to have more reach ?
Which one will be the winner and what happens if I invest my time in the wrong one ?
From the consumer side it becomes a question of how many of these services do I need to join so I do n’t miss anything ?
How many conversations can I be a part of at any one time ?
How many browser tabs can I really monitor so that I do n’t miss anything ?
It is beginning to feel like we are just having conversations for converstaion sake – to make some noise – to fill up that immense space of the Internet with noise .
It is all becoming a matter of hyper - conversation .
Conversations on as many services as possible with as many people as possible .
We are drowning in conversations but is anybody really talking ?
Conversations seem to have become disjointed words being spread far and wide .
There does n’t seem to be any bottom to touch our feet to as we swim through this sea of conversations .
A sea that is only getting bigger as each day goes by and we are getting further from the shore .
I wonder if at some point this whole world of hyper - conversations wo n’t begin to collapse in on itself .
I know that technology and the Internet is changing how we percieve and deal with our world .
I know that it is changing us as human beings and I ’m okay with that – in fact I think it is great thing .
But we are not processors living the life of Moore ’s Law .
We do have finite edges of tolerance to what our minds can absorb and logically deal with .
This is n’t about turning back time or putting the genie back in the bottle ; because that is impossible and really – I would n’t want to .
I just wonder if during this process of shaping new landscapes we are n’t getting caught up in a trap .
Do we really need to be everywhere having conversations ?
Do we really need to be the unwitting shills for other peoples brands and marketing jive ?
Do we really need to get ourselves trapped in the quicksand of hyper - conversations ?

Sometimes you just want one or two .

This Quicksnap tray concept won a recent Toyota design competition .
A simple enough idea , each cube of ice can be released individually through its own button .
As Gizmag points out , especially if you are one of those types who freezes various stocks and sauces , there 's an appeal to keeping cubes tray - fresh / organized .
And yes , in the year of 2009 , we have access to the world 's knowledge with the touch of a button , but we still can't pop out one ice cube at a time .

01 of 11 The 10 Best Kanye West Songs Kanye
West is one of the greatest hip - hop artists of all time .
West is a bold and creative spirit who continues to evolve his sound with each subsequent release .
His albums range from soulful ( College Dropout ) and autotune - ful ( 808s & Heartbreak ) to experimental ( My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ) and wildly experimental ( Yeezus ) .
Let 's look back at his catalog and take stock of his finest moments .
Here 's a list of the best Kanye West songs of all time ... OF ALL TIME !!
02 of 11 10 . " Gone " Taylor Hill / FilmMagic Listen : " Gone " Album : Late Registration Collaboration is the key here .
Cam 'ron turns in what 's arguably the most impressive guest verse of his career ; Consequence shows why Kanye loves collaborating with him ; and Kanye brings it all together .
From the production to the hook to the 16s , " Gone " clicks on all cylinders .
03 of 11 9 . " Spaceship " ( Photo © Peter Kramer / Getty ) Listen : " Spaceship " Album : College Dropout We 've all been there .
Rough day at the grind and a boss straight out of Office Space .
Here , Kanye manages to take that empty feeling and fill it with new meaning .
It 's a gumbo of frustration , hope , uncertainty .
It wo n't make you feel better , but it it 's a reminder that we 're all connected in more ways than we realize .
04 of 11 8 . " Coming Home " Kanye West .
Mark Metcalfe / Getty Images Entertainment / Getty Images Listen : " Coming Home " Album : College Dropout Mixtape
Not to be confused with " Homecoming , " the Chris Martin - aided version that eventually wound up on Graduation .
" Coming Home , " which first showed up on a pre-College Dropout mixtape , sports a different beat and John Legend delivers the hook .
What makes the original song slightly superior to the Coldplayfied version is that it has more heart and rawness .
It 's like jean shorts and a t - shirt vs a tailor - made suit .
Which would you choose on a hot , sunny day in Texas ?
05 of 11 7 . " Coldest Winter " Listen : " Coldest Winter " Album : 808s & Heartbreak Recorded shortly after Kanye lost his mother , " Coldest Winter " is a standout cut on 808s & Heartbreak .
Kanye creates an experience that deeply penetrates the subconscious and leaves the listener with a visceral residue that sticks in one 's brain long after the song has ended .
06 of 11 6 . " Big Brother " Listen : " Big Brother " Album : Graduation Big Brother was a song Kanye had been dying to get off his chest for a while .
He kicks back and reflects on his rise to fame , while tossing a few barbs at Jay - Z for biting his style .
07 of 11 5 . " Flashing Lights " Kanye West and Kim Kardashian .
Photo © Noel Vasquez / Getty Listen : " Flashing Lights " Album : Graduation
A revered producer , Kanye West demonstrates his sonic range on " Flashing Lights . "
He does n't disappoint on the mic , either : " Martin with no Gina , ” he quips on “ Flashing Lights , ” while Detroit 's Dwele rides shotgun .
08 of 11 4 . " Through the Wire " Listen : " Through the Wire " Album : College Dropout
The first time I heard " Through the Wire " I immediately knew I was experiencing a defining moment in hip - hop .
Kanye sounded like no other rapper out at the time .
That was due , in part , to the fact that he was rhyming through the wire .
Literally .
09 of 11 3 . " Diamonds From Sierra Leone " ( Photo © Christopher Polk / Getty ) Listen : " Diamonds From Sierra Leone " Album : Late Registration Remember when Yeezy could rhyme like this ?
He makes it look easy here , as metaphors roll off his tongue with ease .
Everything from the cinematic beat to Kanye 's naked honesty made " Diamonds " such a great movie - on - wax moment .
" You gotta love it that somebody still speaks from his soul . "
I wish he still did .
10 of 11 2 . " New Slaves " Kanye West - New Slaves .
© GOOD Music Listen : " New Slaves " Album : Yeezus " New Slaves " finds ' Ye raging against the system over congas : " You see it 's broke ni--a racism that ’s that ’ Do n’t touch anything in the store ' /
And this rich ni--a racism that ’s that ‘ Come in , please buy more ' "
It 's the best song on the crazed and confused Yeezus .
Many scenarios have been proposed to help us engineer our way out of potential climate disaster , and now a new study could point us towards the ones that are most effective .
Tim Lenton of the University of East Anglia , UK , has put together the first comparative assessment of climate - altering proposals such pumping sulphur into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling effect of volcanic emissions , or fertilising the oceans with iron .
“ There is a worrying feeling that we ’re not going to get our act together fast enough , ” says Lenton , referring to international efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
Scientists have reached a “ social tipping point ” and are starting to wonder which techniques might complement emissions cuts , he says .
Lenton says he is not necessarily advocating engineering the climate , but , faced with a growing trend among his peers , he and colleague Naomi Vaughan decided to provide a comparison of the options that are on the table .
Advertisement
First , Lenton says the exercise shows there is no “ silver bullet ” – no single method that will safely reverse climate change on its own .
Scrubbers and mirrors
Climate engineering schemes would work by either removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , or reflecting solar energy back out into space – both with the intention of lowering global temperatures .
Proposals for removing CO 2 from the atmosphere include planting vast forests , chemically absorbing the gas , or turning agricultural waste into charcoal and burying it .
Reflecting solar energy back into space does not decrease the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , but lessens their warming effect by reducing the amount of solar energy that gets trapped near Earth ’s surface .
Possible schemes have included space mirrors in orbit around the planet , clouds of sulphur particles in the atmosphere , or ground - based reflectors .
The researchers calculated how effective each scheme is at reducing the amount of solar energy trapped in our climatic system – a measure known as “ radiative forcing ” .
Sunshade risks
If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the same rate as today , the greenhouse effect will boost radiative forcing by 7 watts per square metre of Earth surface by 2100 .
By some calculations , strict targets to reduce emissions could bring that down by 4 W/m2 .
Lenton ’s calculations show the only methods powerful enough to have a significant effect in the relatively short term ( in the second half of this century ) involve placing physical barriers between Earth and the Sun .
This would involve either orbiting space mirrors , stratospheric mists of sulphur , or using seawater to make reflective clouds .
But Lenton warns that these options also carry the most risk .
A sulphur sunshade could reduce radiative forcing by 3.7 W/m2 , but would have to be continually replenished .
If it was allowed to disappear , temperatures could shoot up by as much as 5 °C within decades ( Climatic Change , DOI : 10.1007/s10584-008-9490-1 ) .
After sunshades , the most effective method is “ scrubbing ” carbon dioxide out of air and storing it underground .
This could reduce radiative forcing by 1.9 W/m2 by 2100 .
Burn it and bury it
Most other methods , including increasing the reflectivity of deserts or fields of crops , and fertilising oceans show little promise or would not have global effects , the study shows .
Some , like increasing the reflectivity of roofs in cities , could offer localised relief from climate change .
“ There ’s been far too much focus on iron fertilisation ” given its lack of potential , says Lenton .
His calculations suggest that the boost which agricultural fertilisers inadvertently give ocean plankton in runoff is probably already more effective that iron seeding is ever likely to be .
A German -Indian project to test iron fertilisation in the oceans was given the go - ahead yesterday after activists had previously halted the ship ’s departure from port .
Lenton says turning agricultural waste into charcoal and burying it may hold the most promise .
Although it would only reduce radiative forcing by 0.4 W/m2 by 2100 , the method is cheap , low tech , and would have the added advantage of fertilising the soil .

The arrest of financier Bernard Madoff Thursday for operating a " Ponzi scheme " costing investors $ 50 billion made the TV network news .
Curiously , a lawsuit the same day against Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin for defrauding Citibank shareholders of more than $ 122 billion , also described as a " Ponzi scheme , " got no airplay whatsoever .
As we shall see , Rubin , a Director of Citibank , profited from the shady practices that destroyed the financial system and sent the world 's economies into a tailspin .
Then , to repair the damage , he and his banker friends put the taxpayer on the hook for trillions .
Rubin did n't get the same publicity as Madoff because of his close connection to Barack Obama .
Robert Rubin's son Jamie was Obama 's main Wall Street fund raiser and is now one of his principal advisers .
More significant , Obama 's economic team consists of Rubin 's proteges including Timothy Geithner , Treasury Secretary , Lawrence Summers , Senior Economic Adviser and Peter Orszag , Budget Director .
The Times of London has already dubbed them the " Robert Rubin Memorial All Stars . "
Clearly , the media do n't want people to see that the candidate of " Change " chose the people responsible for this calamity to be his " economic team . "
While in the Clinton White House , Rubin , with Summers , helped tear down the regulatory walls between banks , brokerages and insurance companies and freed them to trade in unregulated and little - understood derivatives worth trillions of dollars .
THE LAW SUIT
In an article entitled " Ponzi Scheme at CITI , " the New York Post reported : " A new Citigroup scandal is engulfing Robert Rubin and his former disciple Chuck Prince for their roles in an alleged Ponzi - style scheme that 's now choking world banking .
Director Rubin and ousted CEO Prince - and their lieutenants over the past five years - are named in a federal lawsuit for an alleged complex cover - up of toxic securities that spread across the globe , wiping out trillions of dollars in their destructive paths .
Investor - plaintiffs in the suit accuse Citi management of overseeing the repackaging of unmarketable collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) that no one wanted - and then reselling them to Citi and hiding the poisonous exposure off the books in shell entities .
The lawsuit said that when the bottom fell out of the shaky assets in the past year , Citi 's stock collapsed , wiping out more than $ 122 billion of shareholder value .
However , Rubin and other top insiders were able to keep Citi shares afloat until they could cash out more than $ 150 million for themselves in " suspicious " stock sales " calculated to maximize the personal benefits from undisclosed inside information , " the lawsuit said .
The latest troubles for Rubin , Prince and others emerged in a 500 - page investigation by Citigroup investors represented by law firm Kirby McInerney .
The probe was used to amend and add new details to a blanket investor lawsuit filed against Citigroup a year ago .
The amended suit called the actions of Citi leaders " a quasi - Ponzi scheme " to hide troubles - and keep Citi stock afloat while insiders unloaded about 3 million shares between Jan. 1 , 2004 and Feb. 22 , 2008 for huge profits .
In addition to Citigroup , Rubin and Prince , the complaint names Vice Chairman Lewis Kaden , ex-CFO Sallie Krawcheck and her successor CFO Gary Crittenden .
Rubin cleared $ 30.6 million on his stock sales , while Prince got $ 26.5 million , former COO Robert Druskin got nearly $ 32 million and former Global Wealth Management unit chief Todd Thomson got $ 25.7 million , the suit said . "

THE PONZI SCHEME
In an article , " The Great American Ponzi Scheme , " Robert Butche writes , " Little did people know that banking and finance had contracted a nasty disease -- one known in the grifter trade as a Ponzi Scheme -- in which sub - prime mortgages were securitized and traded based on an unsustainable promise to pay high returns to investors from monies obtained from subsequent investors . "
http://newsroom-magazine.com/?p=3773
In the commentary to the NY Post article above , a Ph.D. in Physics explained that his fellow graduates all went to work for big banks , brokerages and Fannie May .
They were " hired to do complicated calculations ( loop level ) borrowed from quantum field theory and statistical mechanics .
They can take any number(s ) as an input and produce any output as desired .
Hence the banks hired at a much higher pay these people than they could earn in Universities or research institutes ... Their bosses told them to inflate the value of anything to any number and these people did that . "
" No ordinary derivatives trader can ever understand any formula( e ) to calculate the value of anything .
These are too complicated but intentionally .
But there are some conservation laws for energy , momentum etc in physics .
Where every ( loop level ) calculation has to abide by them .
In finance and banking there is no such conserved quantity as credit can be created from thin air and destroyed also to that .
Hence the fiasco . "
BERNARD MADOFF , RAHM EMMANUEL
Madoff was a pillar of Wall Street , one of the founders of the NASDAQ Exchange and a former Chairman .
His private Investment business became known for delivering steady returns year after year and attracted billions .
Little did anyone imagine he was using new investments to provide returns on old ones .
The house of cards came crashing down last week when he confessed to his sons , who promptly reported him .
He had lost their money too .
He had cheated family and friends .
http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1866154,00.html?
iid=tsmodule " Madoff 's investors included captains of industry , corporations -- some of which are publicly traded -- that used Madoff almost as a high - yielding cash management account , endowments , universities , foundations and , importantly , many high - profile funds of funds , " said Douglas Kass , who heads hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management .
" It appears that at least $ 15 billion of wealth , much of which was concentrated in southern Florida and New York City , has gone to ' money heaven , ' " he said .
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Madoff-alleged-50-billion- rb-13819411.html
Madoff's $ 50 billion scam is described as the largest in history .
But it pales in comparison with what Robert Rubin and his ilk have done to the world .
With the possible exception of Ponzi himself , most of the scamsters mentioned here are Jewish .
A consolation to anti-Semites , the biggest victims probably also are Jews .
One Jewish Foundation , which gave away $ 1.5 million to Jewish causes , closed its doors and laid off its employees .
All its money was invested with Madoff .

" This guy [ has ] killed more Jews then Hitler , " one wag said in a forum .
" Wait till you read the formal complaint from the SEC and FBI . "
Then he added facetiously , " Now that the Jew has been thrown down the well , is our country free ? "
http://dealbreaker.com/2008/12/madoffs-victims.php
Thankfully Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is not Jewish , but Obama 's Jewish Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel is implicated in the Governor 's plan to sell Obama 's Senate Seat .
Obama was put in power by Illuminati Jews and Masons and there is going to be plenty of corruption .
( " implicated " http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ us_and_americas/article5332897.ece)
Just as there was collateral damage when Illuminati bankers put Hitler into power , ( the loss of 60 million people ) Jews today have got to break rank with the bankers and their political puppets .
We 're not responsible for their machinations and Jews suffer as much as anyone .
Moreover , Jews are going to be blamed unless we join in exposing and opposing the Illuminati , ( i.e. the highest rank of Freemasonry consisting of Jews and non-Jews . )
Organized Jewry and many individual Jews are witting and unwitting instruments of the Illuminati bankers ' plan for totalitarian world government .
At the same time , we need to ask ourselves whether there is some flaw in Jewish culture that makes so many Jews sacrifice personal integrity for financial success and power .
Finally , wars and depressions do n't happen by accident .
They are planned by the Illuminati years in advance .
They are designed to engineer social and political change .

The media is controlled by the Illuminati and advances their agenda .
That 's why the spotlight is on Bernard Madoff and not Robert Rubin .

hmakow@gmail.com US Physicists Make Weapons of Mass Financial Destruction Dear
Henry , I read with interest your articles in Rense.com .
In the present article you mentioned a you mentioned a PhD physicist and quoted from his letter to the NY Post .
That physicist is me .
I did my PhD from University of ---. I had a grade point average of over 4.9/5.0 .
But I tried to just stick with physics and I am glad that I did so .
People with training in disciplines like physics can do great work , but they can also be used to create havoc by powers that be .
Without physicists , no matter how much money you have you cannot make a nuclear reactor ( for good ) or nuclear bomb ( for bad ) .
It must be mentioned that in the USA most of the physics research is supported by the Federal Government in one way or another .
In the mid 90's due to serious budget cuts , research money started drying up .
Hundreds of PhDs were competing for one university job .
So many gave up and went for other options .
Those were in banks and financial institutions .
As the employers who earlier employed physicists to make atom bombs got their bombs made , similarly the employers in banks and other financial sectors got the physicists , mathematicians and others with technical skills to make these weapons of financial destructions ( WFDs ) which they have finally started to release .
This present situation is plain and simple warfare by the rich to grab all they can from the middleclass and poor .
The WFDs are the choice weapon as they are the ultimate destroyers of life , liberty and persuit of happyness but preservers of real estate .
I do not know , but you may want to look how these financial institutions went after physicists and mathematicians and what was their purpose of hiring so many so called ' rocket scientists . '
I even saw a poster from Surrey University , UK , about graduate studies with physics and finance .
I do not want to downgrade physicists ( and I hope I am wrong ) but one needs to examine their involvement very carefully to understand the dynamics of the present chaos .

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) -- Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. , who was cited in a criminal complaint against Rod Blagojevich , went to the U.S. Attorney 's office about alleged wrongdoers , including the Illinois governor , a Jackson spokesman said Tuesday .
Jesse Jackson Jr. reported in 2006 what he believed was a shakedown by the Illinois governor .
Jackson rejected being labeled with the term " informant " in a message to CNN contributor Roland Martin .
Spokesman Kenneth Edmonds described Jackson 's interaction with federal authorities this way : " As a responsible citizen and elected official , Congressman Jackson has in the past provided information to federal authorities regarding his personal knowledge of perceived corruption and governmental misconduct .
" This was completely unrelated to the current investigation regarding the U.S. Senate appointment .
And it is absolutely inaccurate to describe the congressman as an informant , " Edmonds said in a written statement .
Jackson , a Democrat , has given information regarding the embattled Democratic governor of Illinois , though not in the case currently under investigation , Edmonds said .
In addition , two sources close to Jackson told CNN that , in 2002 , Blagojevich -- then running for governor of Illinois -- solicited a $ 25,000 campaign donation from Jackson , which he did not get .
At the time , Jackson 's wife , Sandi , was a candidate for the job of director of the state 's Lottery Commission , a post she did not win , the sources said .
After Blagojevich took office , in early 2003 , he told Jackson something to the effect of , " You see what $ 25,000 would have done ? " the sources said .
In 2006 , Jackson reported the incident , which he believed to have been an attempt at a shakedown , the sources said .
The report , the sources said , came three three years later because Jackson 's memory was jogged by another case -- that of developer Tony Rezko , whose fraud and corruption trial included testimony about $ 25,000 donations to Blagojevich .
Jackson did not endorse Blagojevich in his initial campaign and tried to stay on the sidelines during the governor 's re-election bid , one of the sources said .
Blagojevich 's office did not return calls seeking comment .
The comments by Jackson 's spokesman come on the same day members of an Illinois House of Representatives panel met to determine whether there is a basis to impeach Blagojevich .
Federal prosecutors accuse Blagojevich of trying to sell President - elect Barack Obama 's former Senate seat .
The governor was arrested December 9 on federal corruption charges and has since ignored calls to resign .
Although Blagojevich , 52 , has not commented publicly on the charges , his lawyer Ed Genson said the governor had done nothing wrong and does not intend to step down .
" We 're going to fight this case , " Genson said .
The 21 - member panel is " not a committee to impeach the governor , but rather to investigate whether or not there exists a basis for the drafting and consideration of an impeachment motion by the full House , " said Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie , the majority leader and chairwoman of the committee .

The proceedings will be fair , Currie said .
" Many Illinoisans today , including some of the lawmakers chosen to sit on this committee , have strong feelings about the governor and the crimes of which he 's been accused , " she said .
" But let us remember that we are not ' Alice in Wonderland . '
We 're not the Red Queen ; we do not sentence first and then do the verdict . "
Watch as panelists debate governor 's capacity to serve »
The committee , which includes a dozen Democrats and nine Republicans , was meeting to discuss its investigation and procedures .
Currie said she met Monday with U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald , the lead prosecutor in the case , to ask for help and information as well as " to make sure our investigation does n't trample on his . "
Fitzgerald had asked the committee put its request in writing , and Currie said the committee planned to do that .
Currie adjourned the hearing until Wednesday so Genson could attend .
She said she had also written a letter to Blagojevich , inviting him to participate in the proceedings .
She said that on Wednesday , members will probably examine the 76 - page federal criminal complaint , which includes transcripts of several expletive - laced taped phone conversations the governor had , in which he allegedly tried to personally benefit from the Senate vacancy .
Many members said Tuesday they regretted having to call impeachment proceedings but said it was necessary .
" It 's unfortunate we 're here , " said Republican Rep. Jim Durkin , " but we have responsibilities . "
Democratic Rep. Frank Mautino added , " No one takes any joy in watching someone stumble , but in the course of going forward , we all have a job to do . "
On Monday , Obama said a review of his transition team 's activities showed that he and his staff had no inappropriate discussions with either Blagojevich or Blagojevich 's staff about filling the vacant Senate seat .
" There is nothing in the review that was presented to me that in any way contradicted my earlier statements that this appalling set of circumstances that we 've seen arise had nothing to do with my office , " Obama said .
Obama noted that Fitzgerald has requested a week 's delay of the public release of the review so that it would not " interfere with an ongoing investigation " of the governor .
On Sunday , the governor spoke briefly to reporters .
" There will be an appropriate time to talk about this , but let me just wish everybody happy holidays , " he said .
" Things will work out just fine . "
Blagojevich and his former chief of staff , John Harris , 46 , were each charged with a count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and a count of solicitation of bribery , authorities said .

Do you trust your leaders ?
Harris has since resigned but has not commented on the charges .
On Friday , Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan petitioned the state Supreme Court to temporarily remove Blagojevich from office or , at least , strip him of some of his authority .
Madigan says that Blagojevich is " disabled " and cannot carry out the functions of his office .
" We are not looking to try to convict him criminally with the pleadings that we brought to the Illinois Supreme Court , " she said Sunday .
" We 're simply recognizing that these are extraordinary , unprecedented circumstances and that we need to have a governor who can actually use the powers of that office and govern our state , or else our state becomes paralyzed . "
" There is also this serious concern that absolutely everything that he does from here on out is going to be tainted , " she said .
" It 's going to be illegitimate .
And so we think it is absolutely obvious that he is incapable of governing , and the best thing to do is to move aside . "

It is often said that life can change in the blink of an eye .
What is n’t said is why , when , and how many times life can change .
When I stop and think back a few months , a few years , or even a couple of decades one thing always holds true , I have constantly changed , sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse .
More recently my focus has been directed towards the US economy and what it ’s downward spiral means to my wife and I .
Looking back as recent as six months ago our perspective on employment was significantly different than it is today .
The wounded and vulnerable status of the United States economy has forced employers and employees alike to take desperate measures and begin operating on a defensive front .
The current and probable future state of the U.S. economy is n’t good for either the employer or the employee .
Most people are familiar with the real estate terms buyers and sellers markets and to create a simple analogy the U.S. job market has transformed from a workers market to an employer ’s market .
Just six months ago the average American worker would probably consider experience , education , and skills as a weapon for landing the bigger , better , deal ( job ) .
In what seems like a blink of an eye the average American worker is now coveting that same resume ’ to increase job security instead of utilizing it for greener pastures to graze .
It ’s getting to the point to where anyone who has a job is grateful to be employed as we should be ; there are a lot of families up against the ropes due to layoffs and there are even more families out there that are one unfortunate event from being there themselves .
Along with the altered perception employees have regarding their jobs comes some obvious side effects .
First , employers will see significant increases in job retention rates meaning people are a lot less likely to move from job to job ( the employees who are n’t laid off ) .
I would also venture to guess that there will be a large drop in employee complaints about work policies , schedules , environment , etc … in an effort to increase job security .
Let ’s be realistic , you ’re going to have to be willing to put up with a lot more B.S. on the job now because there are herds of people who are willing to fill your position without complaining about it .
This may sound like a golden situation for employers but it ’s not .
They may have more loyalty from their workers with less complaining but there are significantly fewer jobs to fill and a lot less money in consumers ’ pockets which will continue to kill company profits .
An employer ’s defense mechanism is slightly different but with the same ultimate goal , to stay in business ( employed ) .
Of course the number one cost for employers is the expense of labor which comes with additional costs of employee benefits ( health care , paid time off , pensions , etc… ) , so it ’s easy to see why jobs are usually the first thing to go .
How far companies will have to go to stay alive will depend on just how bad the economy gets .
It really is a case of survival of the fittest for both employees and employers .
On the extreme side I can see companies streamlining product lines , which means there will likely be a much smaller variety of goods or services to purchase .
I ’ve worked in the grocery business for well over ten years and have worked for a cookie / cracker company for the better part of the last four of those years .
To give an industry specific example companies may be forced to direct their focus to the core items they sell .
Due to the Wal - Mart trend of streamlining all levels of business operations to function on the most efficient level , companies have shut down manufacturing facilities forcing more and more products from the dwindling numbers of facilities still operating in an attempt to cut costs .
This process has been successful with the growing economy but what happens when the demand for products drops dangerously low ?
Suddenly the random varieties of products become a burden and companies have to go back to what has always worked , their core items / services .
In the cookie and cracker business let ’s stop and look at what takes place at the bakeries .
The production lines are setup to bake a certain product and once they have baked an adequate supply of that one particular product the entire line shuts down so it can be thoroughly cleaned and prepped for the next product .
As they say time is money and every time the lines shut down money is lost due to nothing being produced .
Streamlining product lines will allow companies to keep manufacturing lines up and running for longer periods of time without having to shut them down for reconfiguration thus producing more products with less down time .
As we have seen throughout the last several months companies have a multitude of options to keep their doors open but most of them are n’t very appealing .
We ’ve seen companies shut large numbers of stores down , lay off employees , and file for bankruptcy protection , all of which are worrisome situations .
One of the things that really started worrying me was when Home Depot announced they were shutting down a large number of their stores .
Anyone who has witnessed the time , money , and labor it takes to erect a Home Depot building knows that it is a serious event to have one shut down .
I suppose I ’ve drifted away from the premise of this article a bit so let me step back and ask this question , at this point are you more concerned with job security or the perks of your job ( pay , benefits , etc … ) ?
I ’m guessing your answer will greatly depend on your experience and the industry you work in but I am curious to see all of the different perspectives and opinions .
I look forward to your comments and feel free to participate in the rivalry that was created for this very topic .

FEMALE SUPREMACISTS AND LESBIAN SEPARATISTS
" The cultural institutions which embody and enforce those interlocked aberrations -- for instance , law , art , religion , nation - states , the family , tribe , or commune based on father - right -- these institutions are real and they must be destroyed .
If they are not , we will be consigned as women to perpetual inferiority and subjugation . " - Andrea Dworkin , The Root Cause : Our Blood : Prophecies And Discourse On Sexual Politics , 1975 , 1976 .
( Internet posting . )
Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists are the self - declared enemy of all men and families .
The purpose of the Family Defense Manual is to prepare you for the worst possibility .
If you are male or a woman who chooses to participate in family life and child rearing , Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists are your worst enemies .
Their political ideology has your extermination as one of its goals .
Their ideology presumes that all men and any woman voluntarily involved in a marital relationship are genetically inferior to lesbians .
If you are inferior , their ideology calls for your extermination .
This is one major source of the attack on American families .
The material in this section is taken from Female Supremacist and Lesbian Separatist literature and websites .
After reading this section , it should be clear to you that Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists can not be reasoned with .
The acts of atrocity they are committing in pursuit of their political ideology , among other undesirable consequences , are killing people through subversion of the criminal justice system and the intentional manipulation of children and adults to commit suicide and acts of violence .
This can not be tolerated by a civilized society .
CURRENT WORKING SUMMARY OF FEMALE SUPREMACIST AND LESBIAN SEPARATIST HISTORY
As can best be determined at present , the Female Supremacist 's and Lesbian Separatist 's leadership and ideology emerged from a series of feminist , lesbian and social work conferences and seminars during the 1973 - 1975 time period .
As did Adolph Hitler , these women concluded the best way to destroy the current social structure and replace it with their own desired reality would be to infiltrate and exploit the powers inherent in state and federal bureaucracies .
This insight came from Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists employed in social service and social work programs at the time .
Over the following years , more elaborate subversive and supporting organized crime management structures evolved as part of the normal problem - solving process required by any complex project .
Also as with Hitler , Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists developed plans to destroy and eventually exterminate ( gendercide ) the group they believed responsible for their personal misery -- MEN .
Lesbian relationships that cross agencies and professional disciplines are a key coordination tool .
This increasingly sophisticated endeavor includes development of private corporations which provide important functions within the organization , including use of information necessary to coordinate the destruction of families and the criminalization of as many men as possible .
All of this being conducted behind the legal wall of secrecy set up around the " child protection system . "
( When contacted , national and local gay and lesbian organizations indicated they had no information about such groups .
Sources inside the gay and lesbian community indicate there is general abhorrence of these extremists , but no one knows what to do about them .
This is probably also true for leadership in mental health and social work professional organizations .
No one wants to do the necessary housecleaning , because they fear offending allies and damaging their own economic or political interests . )
The result is something unique in human history .
A self - appointed group of well educated , intelligent , man -hatred motivated women , occupying positions of power and influence , who believe they will not achieve justice and personal happiness until they succeed in destroying every vestige of all social components of the civilization into which they were born .
These women have collectively chosen to pursue the total destruction of all social processes by which civilization is passed from one generation to the next .
These women are actively working to achieve this destruction .
They are succeeding .
Our current political , legal and professional leadership is not competent to understand or deal with the new forms of subversion , terrorism and supporting criminal management structure ( especially the organized crime among psychology practitioners , social work practitioners , and in psychological testing ) these women have created or exploited to achieve their goal .
The solution to this problem is two - fold : ( 1 ) identify these hate motivated female subversives and terrorists so the legal system may be used to remove them from government or professional positions which allow them to adversely affect the lives of others in pursuit of their hate agenda ; ( 2 ) identify the subversive , terrorist , and criminal operations these women have established to achieve the destruction of our civilization and initiate legal action to shut these operations down .
Holding individual Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists responsible for the consequences of their criminal and subversive actions is reasonable and will avoid yet another witch hunt .
Regardless of how you personally feel about lesbians , they have always been a component of the human population .
Their existence is a reality .
There would be no more justice in persecuting all lesbians for the acts of Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists than there is in Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists trying to exterminate all men because these women can not find happiness .
As a practical matter it would be a waste of resources .
We need only identify the guilty and see that what they have done can never happen again .
FEMALE SUPREMACIST AND LESBIAN SEPARATIST POLITICAL AGENDAS
Supremacists are dangerous , regardless of the qualifier one places in front of the word .
Our nation has the good sense to monitor the activities of supremacists who are likely candidates for converting their right to speak about superiority into executing their supremacist views as policies , which usually translate into executing people or depriving people of their human and civil rights .
Unfortunately for us , our policing mechanisms have missed stealth supremacist and separatist movements hiding among feminists -- Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists .
Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists exhibit the same dangerous traits as other supremacists and separatists .
These dangerous traits include assertions of biological superiority , a mob mentality at public events , use of intimidation and fear , outright lies , demands for special privileges , claims of being unforgivably wronged , the association of unwarranted interpretations with genuine facts , and the subversion of government and justice .
Feminist ideologist Andrea Dworkin related her experience speaking at a 1977 Lesbian Pride Week event that demonstrates why Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists are dangerous and should be considered a very serious threat : " Hisses .
Women shouting at me : slut , bisexual , she fucks men .
And before I had spoken , I had been trembling , more afraid to speak than I had ever been .
And , in a room of 200 sister lesbians , as angry as I have ever been .
" Are you a bisexual ? " some woman screamed over the pandemonium , the hisses and shouts merging into a raging noise .
" I 'm a Jew , " I answered ; then , a pause , " and a lesbian , and a woman . "
And a coward .
Jew was enough .
In that room , Jew was what mattered .
In that room , to answer the question " Do you still fuck men ? " with a No , as I did , was to betray my deepest convictions .
All of my life , I have hated the proscribers , those who enforce sexual conformity .
In answering , I had given in to the inquisitors , and I felt ashamed .
It humiliated me to see myself then : one who resists the enforcers out there with militancy , but gives in without resistance to the enforcers among us .
The event was a panel on " Lesbianism as a Personal Politic " that took place in New York City , Lesbian Pride Week 1977 .
A self - proclaimed lesbian separatist had spoken .
Amidst the generally accurate description of male crimes against women came this ideological rot , articulated of late with increasing frequency in feminist circles : women and men are distinct species or races ( the words are used interchangeably ) ; men are biologically inferior to women ; male violence is a biological inevitability ; to eliminate it , one must eliminate the species / race itself ( means stated on this particular evening : developing parthenogenesis as a viable reproductive reality ) ; in eliminating the biologically inferior species / race Man , the new Ubermensch Womon ( prophetically foreshadowed by the lesbian separatist herself ) will have the earthly dominion that is her true biological destiny .
We are left to infer that the society of her creation will be good because she is good , biologically good .
In the interim , incipient Super Womon will not do anything to " encourage " women to " collaborate " with men-- no abortion clinics or battered woman sanctuaries will come from her .
After all , she has to conserve her " energy " which must not be dissipated keeping " weaker " women alive through reform measures .
The audience applauded the passages on female superiority / male inferiority enthusiastically .
This doctrine seemed to be music to their ears .

LETTERS FROM A WAR ZONE : Biological Superiority : The Worlds ' Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea .
Andrea Dworkin , 1977 , 1988 , 1993 . )
" Recently , more and more feminists have been advocating social , spiritual , and mythological models that are female - supremacist and / or matriarchal . . . .
But the price we pay is that we become carriers of the disease we must cure .
It is no accident that in the ancient matriarchies men were castrated , sacrificially slaughtered , and excluded from public forms of power ; nor is it an accident that some Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists now believe men to be a distinct and inferior species or race .
Wherever power is accessible or bodily integrity honored on the basis of biological attribute , systematized cruelty permeates the society and murder and mutilation contaminate it .
We will not be different . . . .
It is shamefully easy for us to enjoy our own fantasies of biological omnipotence while despising men for enjoying the reality of theirs .
And it is dangerous -- because genocide begins , however improbably , in the conviction that classes of biological distinction indisputably sanction social and political discrimination .
We , who have been devastated by the concrete consequences of this idea , still want to put our faith in it .
Nothing offers more proof -- sad , irrefutable proof -- that we are more like men than either they or we care to believe . "

LETTERS FROM A WAR ZONE : Biological Superiority : The Worlds ' Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea .
Andrea Dworkin , 1977 , 1988 , 1993 . )
As you just read , Female Supremism is based on assertions that : ( 1 ) lesbians are biologically superior to all men ( Do the male homosexuals who march with these women during Gay Pride Week know this ? ) ; ( 2 ) all men are biologically inferior to all women ; ( 3 ) women who have anything to do with men are inferior ; ( 4 ) the male " race " or " species " must be exterminated .
The following citations demonstrate that the " biological superiority of women " assertion is an essential , consistent component of the Female Supremacist and Lesbian Separatist movement and literature .
As with all such movements , it is necessary to justify killing your inferior " enemy " or deprive him ( literally in this case ) of human and civil rights .
By becoming part of mainstream literature , Female Supremacist and Lesbian Separatist views become accepted as " fact " and make their anti-male agendas seem more reasonable to people , including men , who would otherwise not support depriving anyone of human or civil rights .
" MALE : ... represents a variant of or deviation from the category of female .
' The first males were mutants ... the male sex represents a degeneration and deformity of the female . '
MAN : ... an obsolete life form ... an ordinary creature who needs to be watched ... a contradictory baby - man ...
TESTOSTERONE POISONING : ... ' Until now it has been though [t ] that the level of testosterone in men is normal simply because they have it .
But if you consider how abnormal their behavior is , then you are led to the hypothesis that almost all men are suffering from " testosterone poisoning . " '

Kramarae and Treichler , Pandora Press , 1985 ) " The newest variations on this distressingly ancient theme center on hormones and DNA : men are biologically aggressive ; their fetal brains were awash in androgen ; their DNA , in order to perpetuate itself , hurls them into murder and rape .

Germaine Greer when asked : " You [ Greer ] were once quoted as saying your idea of the ideal man is a woman with a dick .
Are you still that way inclined ? "
Dr Greer ( denying that she said it ) : " I have a great deal of difficulty with the idea of the ideal man .
As far as I 'm concerned , men are the product of a damaged gene .
They pretend to be normal but what they 're doing sitting there with benign smiles on their faces is they 're manufacturing sperm .
They do it all the time .
They never stop .
I mean , we women are more reasonable .
We pop one follicle every 28 days , whereas they are producing 400 million sperm for each ejaculation , most of which do n't take place anywhere near an ovum .
I do n't know that the ecosphere can tolerate it . "

Collected Quotes from Feminist Man-Haters : Former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan )
The irony and duplicity in Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists asserting biological superiority is that their own literature claims women have been victims of the same folly .
One statement clearly describes the destructive consequences of such extremist distortions : " ' The female is a female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities , ' said Aristotle ; 'we should regard the female nature as afflicted with a natural defectiveness . '
And St. Thomas for his part pronounced woman to be ' an imperfect man , ' all ' incidental ' being [ sic ] . . . . This diseased view of woman as the negative of man , " female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities , " infects the whole of culture .
It is the cancer in the gut of every political and economic system , of every social institution .
It is the rot which spoils all human relationships , infests all human psychological reality , and destroys the very fiber of human identity . '
( ( Internet posting . )
THE ROOT CAUSE : OUR BLOOD : PROPHECIES AND DISCOURSES ON SEXUAL POLITICS , Andrea Dworkin , 1975 , 1976 . )
By defining women who attempt to deal equally with the " enemy " [ men ] as also defective , it becomes easier to justify subverting or otherwise maliciously using other feminist organizations and movements .
Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists hide their destructive agendas behind feminists genuinely pursuing equal rights and the child protection movement .
What better way to destroy " phallic identity " than to seize male children under the guise of " child protection " and turn them over to Female Supremacist or Lesbian Separatist cohorts in social service agencies and allied " mental health " facilities who will " educate " these " predestined violent rapists " as to their true nature .
" Under patriarchy , every woman is a victim , past , present and future .
Under patriarchy , every woman 's daughter is a victim , past , present and future .
Under patriarchy , every woman 's son is her potential betrayer and also the inevitable rapist or exploiter of another woman . "

From Robin Morgan , " Theory and Practice : Pornography and Rape " in " Going too Far , " 1974 . )
Believing that all men are rapists justifies any action .

" I have n't the faintest notion what possible revolutionary role white hetero - sexual [ sic ] men could fulfill , since they are the very embodiment of reactionary - vested - interest - power .
But then , I have great difficulty examining what men in general could possibly do about all this .

No , I really do n't mean that .
Yes , I really do . "

Collected Quotes from Feminist Man-Haters : Robin Morgan )
" The oppressors are indeed FUCKED UP by being masters ( racism hurts whites , sexual stereotypes are harmful to men ) but those masters are not OPPRESSED .
Any master has the alternative of divesting himself of sexism or racism -- the oppressed have no alternative -- for they have no power -- but to fight .
In the long run , Women 's Liberation will of course free men-- but in the short run it 's going to COST men a lot of privilege , which no one gives up willingly or easily .
Sexism is NOT the fault of women - - kill your fathers , not your mothers . "

Collected Quotes from Feminist Man-Haters : Robin Morgan )
" And one last great myth : ' Violence never solves anything . '
In the grand philosophical sense those words may ring true .
Violence is like money : it can't make you happy , save your soul , make you a better person -- but it certainly can solve things .
When the winners exterminate the losers , historical conflicts are permanently solved .
More women than we know have probably got rid of abusive husbands . . . .
Violence definitely solves some things .
A dead rapist will not commit any more rapes : he 's been solved .
[ NOTE : Remember the assertion " All men are rapists . " ]
Violence is a seductive solution because it seems easy and quick ; . . . .
Violence may be a tool and a tactic that feminists should use ; certainly we ought to be putting some serious thought into it .
If we refuse it , it should not be because it offends against our romantic notion of morally superior Womanhood , but for some better and more thoughtful reason .
If we accept it , we had better figure out how to avoid becoming corrupted by it . "

The purity of the ' Aryan ' or Caucasian race is a favorite principle .
Genetic inferiority is a favorite field of knowledge .
Libraries are full of erudite texts that prove , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that Jews , the Irish , Mexicans , blacks , homosexuals , women are slime .

Sometimes , often , they are made into stories or poems and called art .
Degradation is dignified as biological , economic , or historical necessity ; or as the logical consequence of the repulsive traits or inherent limitations of the ones degraded .

Removing a male child from parental custody to ensure that he receives proper " treatment " for the " inevitable expression of his true violent rapist nature " is an act of violence .

" As I see it , our revolutionary task is to destroy phallic identity in men and masochistic nonidentity in women -- that is , to destroy the polar realities of men and women as we now know them so that this division of human flesh into two camps -- one an armed camp and the other a concentration camp -- is no longer possible .

" In my view , those of us who are women inside this system of reality will never be free until the delusion of sexual polarity is destroyed and until the system of reality based on it is eradicated entirely from human society and from human memory .
This is the notion of cultural transformation at the heart of feminism .
This is the revolutionary possibility inherent in the feminist struggle . . . .
As I see it , our revolutionary task is to destroy phallic identity in men and masochistic nonidentity in women . . . .
Phallic identity is real and it must be destroyed .
Female masochism is real and it must be destroyed .
The cultural institutions which embody and enforce those interlocked aberrations -- for instance , law , art , religion , nation - states , the family , tribe , or commune based on father - right -- these institutions are real and they must be destroyed .
If they are not , we will be consigned as women to perpetual inferiority and subjugation . "

Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists exist .
Their stated goals are to ( 1 ) " destroy marriage " ; ( 2 ) destroy " the nuclear family " ; ( 3 ) destroy the " delusion of sexual polarity " ; ( 4 ) " destroy phallic identity in men " ; ( 5 ) destroy " The cultural institutions . . . . law , art , religion , nation - states , the family , tribe , or commune based on father - right " ; ( 6 ) " eliminate the species / race itself [ men ] " because " male violence is a biological inevitability " ; ( 7 ) eliminate sexual intercourse and replace it with " parthenogenesis " [ cloning or genetic engineering ] .
To achieve these goals Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists can and do justify any act , including falsely accusing men of rape and child abuse , subverting legislative and judicial processes , and gaining access to power , by any and all means , for the purpose of depriving men of their human and constitutional rights , freedom , and ultimately to deprive them of their lives , if possible .
It is time to stop pretending these criminal extremists do not exist , especially for feminists and members of the gay and lesbian community genuinely interested in equal rights , since their ultimate extermination is also on the Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatist agendas .
It is time to start turning over the rocks Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists hide under , especially those operating under color of government authority in government agencies , law enforcement , and the judicial system .
It is time to determine what Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists have succeeded in sabotaging and how much damage they have done .
Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists who have gone beyond exercising free speech and are attempting to destroy men in every way possible at every opportunity and to destroy , not only our government , but our entire civilization through subversion , belong in prison with terrorists who blow up buildings , racists who drag people to death , and individuals who tie homosexuals to fence posts and beat them to death .
Female Supremacists and Lesbian Separatists who violate the human and civil rights of men and male children out of hate are no different .

listen - 13 mb mp3
The House of Death is the story of how an informant for Homeland Security , working " undercover " under the direct control of a Bush appointed United States Attorney , participated in a macabre house of horrors in which more than a dozen people were tortured to death .
There have been a continuing series of articles at Narco News on the subject , reported by Bill Conroy , who has been a frequent guest .
Tonight , for the first time anywhere , Bill Conroy brings us the voice of the informant himself .
Mike and Mark speak with Bill Conroy and Sandalio Gonzalez about the House of Death and this informant - and about the fact that the Justice department fels just fine about sending him to his death .

If you have n’t heard about Airplot , Greenpeace have bought a piece of land slap bang in the middle of the proposed third runway site at Heathrow .
The aim of the purchase is to prevent the runway being built .
The government plans to go ahead with the airport expansion even though this means the UK will have “ no hope of meeting its climate emission targets ” ( source : Greenpeace ) .
At full capacity , Heathrow would become the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country .
Not only do I support the Airplot cause , but I thought this a good opportunity to look at the creation of its logo , designed by Airside , a London - based design agency .
Regardless of scalability issues , I chose to feature the logo because of the process , and I love how Airside go into depth on their blog ( showing plenty of sketches ) .
“ As the project continued the idea of using type as a constructive device became the favoured route , however the design team were concerned that the concept of ideographic type would be hard to explain . ”
“ After culling the directions considered unsuccessful , we approached Greenpeace with the above idea .
From our point of view it was important to communicate how fields could be abstracted into an underlying grid .
“ This point was crucial as it would allow us to use the field metaphor , but through a much more manageable form .
To explain this point we presented the 4 sequential images featured in the above presentation to hammer the point home . ”
“ Acknowledging that land was central to Greenpeace ’s protest , Airside created an identity based on the colours and shapes synonymous with the rural fields Airplot seeked to occupy . ”
Airside published two logo development blog posts — the first shows how the design is being adapted for different campaign messages , and the second includes logo sketches and cardboard type cutouts .
It ’s interesting to read the accompanying commentary :
New Work : Greenpeace Presents Airplot
Process : Greenpeace Presents Airplot
Update :
Links removed after Airside closed its doors in 2012 .

The Marijuana Policy Project accuses the Drug Enforcement Administration of defying President Barack Obama 's stated position by raiding a California medical marijuana dispensary and calls on the president to immediately replace Bush administration holdovers at the DEA .
The DEA raided a medical marijuana dispensary in Lake Tahoe , Calif. , Jan. 22 — only two days after President Obama 's inauguration .
During the presidential campaign , Obama repeatedly promised not to waste federal resources interfering in states with laws protecting medical marijuana patients from arrest , and he told Southern Oregon 's Mail Tribune editorial board on March 28 , 2008 , " I 'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue , " Obama said .
MPP also urges President Obama to instruct the Bush - appointed current administrator of the DEA to delay a final ruling on a Motion to Reconsider its Jan. 12 decision to deny an application by a University of Massachusetts - Amherst researcher to grow FDA - approved , research - grade marijuana in a secure facility , arguing that Obama 's own administrator should get to make that decision once in place .
The DEA's Jan. 12 denial was one among a series of unrelated 11th - hour regulatory actions the Bush administration attempted to finalize before leaving office .
The DEA could rule on the motion as early as Monday unless the White House stops Bush holdover , Michele Leonhart , the DEA administrator .
The DEA's Jan. 12 decision came nearly two years after the its own administrative law judge , Mary Ellen Bittner , ruled that approving the application would " be in the public 's interest " and after years of delay on the part of the Bush administration .
"
On the first day of the new administration , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel issued a memo to departments and agencies directing them to hold off on issuing final regulations until President Obama 's appointees have a chance to review them , " said Aaron Houston , MPP director of government relations .

POZNAN , Poland ( Reuters ) - Soot is darkening ice in the Arctic and speeding a melt that could make the ocean around the North Pole ice - free in summer well before 2050 , experts said on Tuesday .
The sun shines low in the sky just after midnight over a frozen coastline near the Norwegian Arctic town of Longyearbyen , April 26 , 2007 .

The experts said the fight against warming in the Arctic should be re-directed to focus more on cutting the industrial pollution from soot , ozone and methane in Europe , North America and Russia to try to prevent the ice disappearing .
Soot or black carbon darkens the ice and makes it soak up more heat , accelerating a melt compared to reflective snow and ice .
Methane comes sources including oil and gas and agriculture while ozone is formed from industrial pollutants .
“ Reductions in these pollutants would have a greater impact ” in the next two decades than curbing emissions of the main greenhouse gas -- carbon dioxide -- according to scientists on the sidelines of 187 - nation U.N. climate talks in Poland .
The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and ice shrank to a record low in 2007 , leading to worries that it could pass a point of no return .
“ The Arctic sea ice may already have passed a ‘ tipping point ’ , ” said Pam Pearson , an Arctic pollution expert at the Climate Policy Center who presented the findings .
“ An ice - free summer Arctic is now possible well before 2050 . ”
“ Some scientists are arguing that it ( the Arctic Ocean ) could be ( ice free ) in summer within the next 10 to 20 years , ” said Bob Watson , a former head of the U.N. Climate Panel who chaired a presentation of the research in Poznan .
The three pollutants -- soot , ozone and methane -- linger in the atmosphere far less time than carbon dioxide , meaning cuts in emissions would have a quicker impact in cleaning the air .
The U.N. panel projected last year that it could be clear of ice by the end of the century .
A thaw would threaten indigenous peoples and wildlife such as polar bears and seals .
“ The question is : is all of the rapid melt of the Arctic ice in summer all due to human induced climate change or is part of it some natural cycle ?
We clearly have to understand it , ” Watson , now chief scientific advisor to the British Environment Ministry , told Reuters .
“ This is not just a climate issue for the Arctic but for the globe as a whole , ” said Hanne Bjurstroem , the head of Norway ’s delegation , at the December 1 - 12 climate talks on a new climate treaty .
A melt of the Arctic ice would warm the top of the globe and lead to warming further south .
An ice - free Arctic would also make the region more accessible to oil and gas exploration and shipping .

Even though my semester has n’t officially started and has been delayed by President - elect Obama ’s events , I have completed the first book for a class called Constitutional Economics .
This book is by the dean of the Austrian School of economic thought .
It is a very short read of about 200 pages including the introduction , talking about the new dirty word in politics , “ Liberalism . ”
It is not the type of liberalism that you think of when thinking of John Kerry .
In fact , most of it is the complete opposite .
Like most sensible people , unlike politics , Mises used the word in relation to its definition from the latin word “ liber ” meaning free .
Since there are many big ideas in this book that I will probably write future posts about , I will only give this a brief book review .
The overarching main theme is that the Liberalist ’s policies are those of a society build upon freedom and Capitalism .
Capitalism has been the key to success bringing wealth to everyone , along with freedom .
I think this is an important point that people overlook .
Capitalism back in his time and still today is portrayed as only helping the rich .
This makes no sense at all because none of the polices pursued by supporters of Capitalism support a certain class .
This leads to another great point Mises makes which is that when people talk and think of a monarchy , they always think of themselves as the king .
In a oligarchy , they are always apart of the ruling class .
In a socialist system , they are always the central planner .
In Capitalism , they are always what ?
When someone talks about Capitalism , they never put themselves in any ruling class over someone else .
This alone should make people skeptical of what these other people are coming up with as organization .
Capitalism is not complicated even though today people try to complicate it .
It is simply , as Mises puts it , private property as the means of production .
This is completely opposite of communal property as the means of production or Socialism .
This argument could go on and I am sure in his other literature , he continues these arguments .
But it is without a doubt that this should be a required reading for all politicians and policymakers .
Since very few of us are those , then this should be a good starting book into the literature of Capitalism .
And I will end this with a great ending quote from the book :
” It [ Liberalism ] has no party flower and no party color , no party song and no party idols , no symbols and no slogans .
It has the substance and the arguments .
These must lead it to victory . ”

The i-MiEV has a top speed of 87 mph , can be 80 % charged in 20 minutes and has a good range — as long as the headlights , heater and radio are n't on at the same time , writes Alok Jha
Mitsubishi has unveiled the first mass - market electric car from a mainstream car maker .
Slightly bigger than the Smart ForTwo but with a similar design , the i-MiEV — which goes on sale in the UK later this year — is based on the i , Mitsubishi 's existing city car .
With room for four adults , it has a top speed of 87mph and produces the equivalent of 57 horsepower .
Its lithium - ion battery has a range of 100 miles and can be charged from flat to 80 % in 20 minutes using Mitsubishi's bespoke high - powered charger ; otherwise , a normal mains electricity socket will charge the battery from flat to full in six hours .
Mitsubishi estimates that the car can travel 10,000 miles on £ 45 of electricity at current UK domestic prices .
Jim Tyrrell , managing director of Mitsubishi , said : " The i-MiEV is a great example of Mitsubishi 's ability to innovate and bring the latest technology to market .
We have a city car to suit real - world users with its ease of use , great environmental credentials and very low running costs . "
Around 200 cars will be available in the UK at first , with final costs yet to be determined .
A Mitsubishi spokesperson the cars might not be sold outright , but be leased at a cost of around £ 750 a month .
Kieren Puffett , editor of car website Parkers.co.uk who took the i-MiEV for a test drive today , said the car was ideal for urban areas .
" Through the town , the car is particularly torquey , it can get away from traffic lights and across roundabouts really quite quickly .
That 's quite a nice benefit for town driving . "
He added : " Because it 's based on an existing city car , the characteristics are fairly familiar .
If someone got in , I do n't think they 'd notice anything massively adrift . "
Puffett had some reservations , however , about Mitsubishi 's claims on the car 's range .
" I deliberately drove the car with headlights , heater and the radio on .
I did about 50 minutes of driving and covered about 22 miles — and I discharged the battery to half way from full . "
Robert Evans , chief executive of Cenex , a government - backed agency that is leading the introduction of low - carbon road transport to the UK , welcomed the i-MiEV .
He said that momentum towards the increased electrification of transport had been building in the UK ever since the publication of a report by Julia King , vice chancellor of Aston University and a former director of advanced engineering at Rolls - Royce .
Working with economist Nicholas Stern , King reviewed the vehicle and fuel technologies which could help to decarbonise road transport in the next 25 years .
They identified electric cars as a major feature of the future of personal transport .
" If progress is to be maintained , the public needs to be convinced that electric vehicles are a practical proposition that are capable of fulfilling their transport needs , " said Evans .
" The UK launch of the Mitsubishi i-MiEV — capable of carrying four passengers and with a range of 100 miles — marks an important step in this process . ''
Mitsubishi has been developing its electric vehicle technology since 1995 , most notably producing in - wheel electric motors that were showcased in an all - electric Lancer Evolution rally car in 2005 though Tyrrell said that specific technology was some way from market yet .
This allows each wheel to be driven independently by its own motor .
" In - wheel technology lends itself very well to 4 - wheel drive performance but is not cost - effective when considering mass - market applications . "
Lance Bradley , sales director at Mitsubishi , said : " The i-MiEV is just one of Mitsubishi 's environmental initiatives to be unveiled this year .
In February , we will launch the Colt ClearTec which uses stop - start technology to radically reduce CO2 emissions .
ClearTec technology will be rolled out across most vehicles in the Mitsubishi range within the next three years . "
Tyrrell said that as car makers bring out their electric cars he and others were now waiting for a " clear strategic direction and financial support from central government " on ways to make electric cars more attractive to consumers .
This could perhaps include giving local authorities clearer direction to start initiatives such as free parking or exemption from certain taxes for electric cars .
The crisis of the Greek government and the role of the “ left ”
By Markus Salzmann
31 December 2008
The conservative government in Greece led by Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis is coming under increasing pressure .
With the student protests that erupted at the beginning of December following the police killing of a 15 - year - old youth ebbing slowly , hundreds of universities and schools remained occupied across the country .
During the Christmas break there were renewed clashes between protesting youth and the police .
It is becoming increasing clear that the protests express a deep dissatisfaction with the country 's political elite .
The New Democracy ( ND ) government led by Karamanlis has virtually no support in the population .
The majority of Greeks regard the protests as a justified revolt against a corrupt clique in business and politics , which has lavishly lined its pockets while conducting ever sharper attacks against the population .
For the first time since the elections of 2006 , recent opinion polls place opposition leader George Papandreou of the social - democratic Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( PASOK ) ahead of Karamanlis .
The leftist coalition SYRIZA has overtaken the Communist Party ( KKE ) in the polls and is now ranked third .
Under the pressure of the continuing demonstrations , Karamanlis has announced the reorganization of his cabinet .
But this attempt to appease public anger by dismissing a few scapegoats is unlikely to rescue the fortunes of his government , which has a razor - thin majority of just one seat in the lower house of parliament .
There is also growing opposition to Karamanlis inside his own party .
Against the background of the worldwide economic crisis and the threat of mass redundancies throughout Greek industry , there is growing fear among the ruling elite that the protests by students could come together with strikes by angry workers .
In view of this situation the call is growing for a " strong government . "
PASOK leader Papandreou , together with the trade unions , the left alliance SYRIZA , and sections of the media , are demanding fresh elections .
In mid-December one main Athens newspaper ran the headline : " Position to be filled — government required . "
Possible alternatives to the current government include a coalition of New Democracy and PASOK , or even a " left government " consisting of PASOK , SYRIZA and the KKE .
In particular , leftist groupings are encouraging the illusion that the voting out of Karamanlis and a change of government could bring improvements for the population at large .
Any considered analysis of the Greek political landscape makes clear that this is by no means the case .
PASOK
The catastrophic conditions at schools and universities targeted by the current protests find their origins largely in the period of PASOK rule .
PASOK has dominated Greek politics since the end of the military junta in 1974 .
It headed the government from 1981 to 1989 and from 1993 to 2004 and exerted a powerful influence on the country 's trade unions .
Above all , General Confederation of Greek Workers , the GSEE , has a long history of close relations to PASOK .
During the 1980s PASOK put forward pronounced nationalist policies bound up with anti-American and anti-European rhetoric .
It carried out a number of limited social reforms , only to junk such a policy a decade later when , in common with other European social - democratic parties , it increasingly adopted neo-liberal policies and implemented a series of welfare cuts at the behest of the European Union .
The government led by Konstantin Simitis began a program of radical reforms in 1996 involving the large - scale deregulation and privatisation of entire sectors of the public service .
This was largely the political tradition inherited by Karamanlis and carried forward when his party was elected in 2004 .
PASOK also undertook a pronounced turn to the right in foreign policy .
The party declared its full support for NATO and the European Union .
In 1999 the PASOK government backed the US - NATO - led war against Yugoslavia while unreservedly supporting the " anti- terror struggle " of the European Union .
These decisions met with growing popular opposition and in 2000 PASOK achieved only a narrow electoral victory over the ND .
When George Papandreou took over the presidency of the party prior to the 2004 elections , PASOK was already so discredited that even a populist election campaign and promises of social reforms were insufficient .
Karamanlis and New Democracy won the election .
In the last election campaign in 2007 , Papandreou put himself forward as a left alternative to Karamanlis .
He promised to fight corruption and free up money to reform the country 's run-down pension and health systems — but all to no effect .
The Greek population had undergone a series of bitter experiences with PASOK .
In its nearly 20 years in power a broad network of nepotism and corruption had developed across the country .
Long before Karamanlis came to power , PASOK had given its seal of approval to the criminal property speculators who were responsible for the devastating forest fires last year , and the party had undertaken a series of major cuts to the country 's welfare provisions .
Today the internal party struggle in PASOK is only exceeded in intensity by the acute crisis of ND .
Following the last election , PASOK leader Papandreou had difficulty retaining his post as chairman .
The party has lost any broad level of popular support and threatens to be torn apart by opposing factions .
According to recent polls , 86 percent of the Greek population rejects both the conservative and " socialist " parties .
The KKE
The Communist Party is the oldest party in Greek politics .
It has reacted to the student protests with a clear lurch to the right , placing the maintenance of public order at the heart of its policy .
It has condemned the protesters as " wilful perpetrators of violence " and warned against " juvenile self - justice . "
In the universities , the student federations attached to the KKE have tried to keep the students under control .
In the mass demonstrations the KKE has repeatedly sought to organize its own protests in order to divide and break down the opposition front .
The KKE is the only opposition party that has rejected the demand for new elections , thereby strengthening the conservative government .
Such a policy is not new for the KKE .
In the course of the collapse of the Soviet Union the party initiated an alliance of leftist parties including so - called Euro - communists who had previously broken away from the Communist Party .
This alliance , the Coalition of Left and Progressive Forces ( 1989 ) , won 13 percent of the vote and for a short time entered into a coalition government with ND .
Even at that time it had sought to prop up the conservative government despite the fact that the latter was embroiled in corruption .
The KKE maintained a strong orientation to Moscow until the end of the 1980s and following the collapse of the Soviet Union broke apart .
After the departure of a number of different factions the party is in the hands of hard - core Stalinists , although still subject to internal conflicts .
The KKE has rapidly lost support in the population , particularly amongst youth .
The organisation relies heavily on its party apparatus , which was first built up in cooperation with the former Soviet Union .
In the postwar period and based on funding from Moscow the KKE had been able to acquire a small empire of interests , including a printing company , two radio stations , various industries and trading companies , as well as building firms and hotels .
SYRIZA
The leftist coalition SYRIZA has best been able to profit from the present crisis .
It has adapted to the protests with radical sounding declarations of support .
SYRIZA and its affiliated organisations have taken part in a number of the demonstrations and have called for measures to fight the country 's social and political crisis .
However behind its rhetoric SYRIZA puts forward openly reformist policies .
The alliance is trying to steer the growing leftist radicalisation of broad layers of the population into channels harmless to the ruling class .
In no respect does SYRIZA represent a genuine political alternative to PASOK and the KKE .
The leaders of SYRIZA have clearly qualified their support for the protests in comments to the media and have sought to demonstrate their loyalty to the organs of the state .
The party leadership accepted an invitation by Karamanlis for talks aimed at discussing solutions to the latest crisis and the leader of the SYRIZA parliamentary fraction , Alekos Alavanos , has held talks with the leadership of the Greek police .
Only recently he demanded a democratic reform of the police force alongside measures to provide more jobs and improve the country 's labour laws .
This demand for a police reform is directly bound up with a call for the stabilization of state power .
Another SYRIZA leader , Alexis Tsipras , has also made some vague demands for better conditions for youth to Greek President Karolos Papoulias , linking such demands to an appeal to the president to intervene in the present crisis .
Like no other figure , however , Papoulias embodies the corrupt system that prevails in the country .
In his former function as foreign minister , Papoulias was involved in a series of shady dealings and today enjoys contact with the country 's most powerful dynasties .
He has the support of both PASOK and the ND .
Alavanos and Tsipras are typical figures with regard to the social and political orientation of SYRIZA .
Alavanos is an economist and originates from the hard - core Stalinist Greek Communist Party .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Alavanos joined the organization Synaspismos , which is part of the current SYRIZA alliance .
He comes from the country 's upper class and owns numerous properties on the island of Tenos .
After Alavanos stepped down as party chairman he was replaced by Fotis Kouvelis , who began his political career in the resistance against the military dictatorship from 1967 to 1974 , and the 33 - year - old Tsipras .
Kouvelis is a former long - time leader of a faction that emerged from a split in the KKE .
He was then secretary - general of its successor organisation , the EAR , which merged at a later date into Synaspismos .
Kouvelis has been a member of parliament almost continuously since 1989 , and in 1989 even briefly held the post of justice minister .
Politically he stands for bringing together the KKE and PASOK in a broad leftist coalition on a parliamentary and government level .
Kouvelis was replaced as head of Synaspismos by the chairman of its youth movement , Tsipras , who opposed such a course .
Tsipras has so far declared his preference for an " extra - parliamentary movement . "
In a recent mayoral election in Athens he was able to win over 10 percent of the vote .
Tsipras 's election to the post of Synaspismos chairman reflects a fear that the SYRIZA alliance could quickly discredit itself by making excessively public overtures to the Greek social - democrats .
However , as the crisis intensifies a number of the component parties of SYRIZA have made clear that they are intent on cooperation with the country 's main political parties .
In any event , any differences are of a purely tactical nature .
For some time there has been close cooperation between PASOK and the radical left on a local level .
Fundamentally , the policy of SYRIZA strongly resembles the reformist policy of PASOK in the 1980s — calling for a halt to privatisations , an increase in public expenditure and development of the social welfare net , combined with a foreign policy based on opposition to the US and the European Union .
In an interview with the World Socialist Web Site , the press spokesman of SYRIZA , Andreas Karitzis , openly acknowledged : " Social reforms bring society in the right direction ... through nationalisations we are able to limit the power of the big concerns . "
In this respect , Karitzis pointed to the bourgeois nationalist regime of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela as a role model for Greece .
Against this backdrop , the party is holding its options open for a government collaboration with PASOK : " If one sits in government during such a development it can be either favourable or not , " Karitzis explained .
These comments makes clear that none of the so - called " leftist " organisations have any progressive alternative to offer the Greek population in the current crisis .
Indeed these parties are doing all they can to defend the existing order .

Greg uses a 28 cm Celestron NExtar 11 GPS reflecting telescope with Hyperstar lens , an optical assembly that attaches to the telescope secondary mirror , turning it from a slow f10 to an ultrafast f2 astrograph .
This system is not designed for the human eye , so he got a matching Starlight Xpress SXV - H9C one - shot color CCD camera .
To increase the performance of the camera , he had to get rid of the noise in the sensor , which is produced by heat during long exposure times .
This is achieved by installing a solid - state refrigeration system , which lowers the temperature of the CCD to 55 º
F less than the ambient temperature .

In addition to this , there is a last ingredient in the recipe : Parker moves the dome in his observatory by hand ever half hour , to adjust to the rotation of the Earth , which results in a moving sky .
In other words : Magic .

Last month the Congressional Commission on Strategic Posture issued an interim report , on the basis of which one of its co-chairmen , former Secretary of Defense William Perry , publicly predicted this week that President - elect Obama will soon face a " serious crisis with Iran . "
Iran ?
Now , Perry was SecDef in the early 1990s when the International Atomic Energy Agency  which was negotiating the Safeguards Agreement with North Korea , required as a condition of its being a signatory to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT )  concluded North Korea was not accurately " declaring " the amount of plutonium which could be recovered from the spent - fuel elements being subjected to IAEA Safeguards for the first time .
The IAEA wanted to do chemical diagnostic assays of those spent - fuel elements , and the Koreans refused .
The IAEA then reported the refusal to the IAEA Board of Governors and to the UN Security Council , as required by the IAEA Statute .
On March 12 , 1993 , North Korea announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT , its principal stated rationale being its claim that the United States had threatened its national security by , inter alia , strong - arming the IAEA Board of Governors into adopting on Feb. 25 , 1993 , a resolution requiring Korean officials to open military sites to inspection , sites that North Korea claimed were not related to NPT - proscribed materials storage or to activities involving the physical or chemical transformation of such materials .
But NPT withdrawal would never do , since President Clinton had hoped to make his legacy getting every nation  including India , Pakistan , and Israel  to become signatory to the NPT .
The NPT was viewed  then and now  as having three “ pillars ” :
A promise by the NPT nuke - states to eventually dispose of nukes .
An affirmation of the inalienable right of all other NPT states to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy “ without discrimination . ”
A mechanism for verifying that nuclear energy was not being diverted from peaceful to military purposes .
Soon after taking office , President Clinton had begun to pledge at UN conference after UN conference that he would honor the NPT commitment to dispose of our nukes , soon , rather than eventually .
Hence , the Clinton - Gore - Perry - negotiated Agreed Framework [ .pdf ] of 1994 , under which North Korea agreed to not only remain an NPT signatory , but to " freeze " the operation and construction of its Soviet - designed - and - built plutonium - producing reactors and related facilities , subjecting all to IAEA lock , seal , and oversight .
Next , at the 1995 NPT Review Conference , Clinton got all signatories to agree to its indefinite extension .
Now all this nuke disarmament activity upset some Republicans in Congress more than somewhat .
So Clinton had then SecDef Perry draw up a contingency plan to " take out " the North Korean nuclear facilities should North Korea either refuse to sign the Agreed Framework or cease to abide by it .
Whereupon , Bush - Cheney - Wolfowitz - Bolton came to power , intent upon reversing the " globalist " nuclear disarmament policies of Clinton - Gore - Perry and establishing , instead , American hegemony .
However , Bush - Cheney - Wolfowitz - Bolton realized that the only rationale most Americans would accept for establishing that American hegemony  forcibly effecting regime change in Iraq , Iran , Syria , North Korea , and elsewhere  would be for those regimes to actually have nuclear weapons and a willingness to supply them to terrorists .
Then came the second attempt by the Islamic jihadists  this time armed with box - cutters  to bring down the World Trade Center Twin Towers .
So , according to then - Deputy SecDef Paul Wolfowitz , the obvious and necessary thing for Bush - Cheney to do was deliberately discredit  even destroy  the NPT - associated nuke - proliferation - prevention regime with which Iraq , Iran , Syria , and North Korea were then in total compliance .
It is important to note that , as of this writing , no evidence has surfaced that at that time Iraq , Iran , Syria , or North Korea were diverting NPT - proscribed materials to a military purpose .
Furthermore , as of this writing , no evidence has surfaced that Iran has ever diverted NPT - proscribed materials to a military purpose .
Now , according to the commission , the Soviet Union did pose " an existential threat " to the United States , but its dissolution dramatically reduced that threat , permitting us to reduce our reliance on nuclear weapons .
However , a new threat has " come to the fore  that of catastrophic terrorism . "
Hence the commission ’s proposed four " security imperatives " :
To reduce and provide better protection for existing nuclear stockpiles of weapons and fissile material .
To keep new nations from going nuclear .
To provide effective protection for the fissile material generated by enrichment activities , reprocessing facilities , and commercial nuclear reactors .
To improve our tools to detect clandestine delivery of nuclear weapons and to disable and otherwise defend against them .
Now , presumably commission members know the difference between nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants .
So when Perry et al. declare one of our " security imperatives " to be keeping new nations from " going nuclear , " the commission must mean keeping them from acquiring anything " nuclear , " peaceful or otherwise .
" The efforts to keep other nations from going nuclear are obviously multinational .
The 6 - party talks have had limited success to date in dealing with North Korea but may ultimately be successful .
However , there is no similarly comprehensive diplomatic approach to Iran , which has constructed a major facility for enriching uranium .
" It appears that we are at a ‘ tipping point ’ in proliferation .
If Iran and North Korea proceed unchecked to build nuclear arsenals , there is a serious possibility of a cascade of proliferation following .
And as each new nuclear power is added the probability of a terror group getting a nuclear bomb increases . "
Well , there you have it .
Iran has constructed and is operating  subject to IAEA Safeguards  a major facility for enriching uranium .
Since Iran is unquestionably within its rights  under the NPT , the IAEA Statute , and the UN Charter  the commission is correct in noting that there is no " comprehensive diplomatic approach " to forcing Iran to give up those " inalienable " rights .
So what does former SecDef Perry mean when he predicts that Obama will soon face a serious crisis with respect to Iran ?
I chronicled much of what made 2008 such a horrible year for $ cientology back in July here .
That summed up just about every up until that point .
Then in August this story broke :
Tom Cruise is named in a $ 250 million federal lawsuit that is using the RICO statute against the Church of Scientology .
Ex -Scientologist Peter Letterese , a longtime critic of the church , filed suit in Southern District Court in Florida on July 15 alleging , among other things , that members of the church harassed him after he left .
Then in the same month $ cientology was dealt another major blow .
After many years of denying members were taught the Xenu story , a recording of L Ron Hubbard reciting it was leaked on the internet .
Then in September , it was reported that The Church of Scientology and seven of its top members are to stand trial in Paris on fraud charges after an investigation into allegations by a former member that the church swindled her out of more than $ 28,000 .
Then of course $ cientology was the subject of much ridicule in Bill Maher ’s film , Religulous , leading to $ cientology officially declaring him a “ Supressive Person : ”
Then in November it was reported , a former leading figure in their British branch has written a book that again is exposing their true nature .
$ cientology soon took steps to bully Amazon and many other booksellers into no longer selling the book , but of course they ca n’t make the book disappear .
Then John Travolta starred in the Disney animated film Bolt , where he ironically played a dog who must awake from the delusion that he has superpowers , not unlike Travolta himself who also falsely believes he has superpowers .
Then from the holiday season came A Very Merry Unauthorized Children ’s Scientology Pageant that also did n’t make the $ cientologists too happy .
And all of this was going on while Anonymous had been consistently organizing monthly global protests outside their offices .
Now that brings us to the present with the sudden untimely death of John Travolta and Kelly Preston ”s oldest son , Jett :
Now I recognize that this is fresh news and what I ” m about to say is going to sound cold and insensitive towards the grieving family but the mainstream media will be right behind me shortly reporting on what might be a major scandal .
Jett suffered from Kawasaki disease , an illness that leads to inflammation of the blood vessels in young children .
While no autopsy has been done yet , it seems to me very unlikely that “ household cleaners and fertilizers ” led to Jett ’s untimely death .
The “ detoxification program based on teachings from the Church of Scientology ” had zero chance of treating the disease .
However , there are known medical treatments for this condition involving drug therapies that $ cientology rejects .
High doses of simple asperin may very well have saved Jett Travolta ’s life .
So while I ’m not a doctor and no autopsy has been done yet , there is a very good chance that The Travolta ’s and $ cientology effectively killed Jett Travolta through negligence .
Will this lead to the Travoltas escape from the cult ?
Only time will tell .
But this may become a major scandal in the media , because if there ’s any chance that well known medical treatments rejected by the Travoltas could have prevented this tragedy and saved the boy ’s life , there ’ll be hell to pay .

Cats and dogs cut their owners ' cancer risk by a third , researchers say
Pet lovers are a third less likely to develop non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system
Owning a pet can reduce the chances of developing a form of cancer by nearly a third , researchers claim .
Animal lovers were much less likely to develop non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system that affects around 9,000 Britons a year .
Scientists at the University of California , San Francisco , and Stanford University , also in California , who carried out the study believe pets help protect against cancer by boosting the immune system .
Previous studies have shown children who have pets take fewer sick days off school because they are more resistant to infections .
Some research even suggests toddlers who grow up around cats or dogs are less likely to suffer allergies or asthma .
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma , or NHL , affects the lymphatic system , a network of vessels and glands that transports infection - fighting white blood cells round the body .
Cases of NHL rise with age .
The average age of newly - diagnosed sufferers is 65 , and the most aggressive form of NHL can be fatal .
The numbers affected in the UK have been steadily rising at around four per cent a year for the last 50 years .
Experts fear if the trend continues , NHL will be as common as breast or lung cancer by 2025 .
Although the exact cause of the increase remains a mystery , one theory is that improved hygiene and sterile living conditions may be to blame .
Recent evidence suggests exposure to allergens and toxins in the environment may actually help to protect the body against certain types of cancer .
In the latest investigation , researchers at the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University , also in California , studied more than 4,000 patients to see if owning a pet slashed their chances of getting cancer .
Just under 1,600 of the volunteers had developed NHL , while the remaining 2,500 were free of the disease .
The results showed pet owners were almost 30 per cent less likely to have cancer than those who had never kept animals .
The longer the family had kept pets , the greater the protection against the disease , the study found .
In a report , published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers and Prevention , the researchers said : ' This large study provides support for a decreased risk between pet ownership and non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma .
And it 's possible this is related to altered immune function . '
Dr Jodie Moffat , health information officer at Cancer Research UK said : ' This study presents some evidence that owning a pet may reduce the risk of Non-Hodgkin ’s Lymphoma .
However much more research is needed to provide a conclusive link .
' Scientists around the world are trying to find out what causes Non-Hodgkin ’s Lymphoma and what affects a person ’s chances of developing the disease , but there is still a lot to learn . '
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The labor market faces persistent weakness in 2009 , with more than 1 million jobs cuts expected due to weak spending among consumers and businesses , according to a Monday report from Challenger , Gray & Christmas Inc .
The incoming administration is working on a massive economic stimulus package to save or create millions of jobs .
But it will take time for the stimulus measure to work , said John Challenger , chief executive of the outplacement firm ,
A Brisbane teenager was quoted religious scripture and banned from taking the sacrament as punishment for molesting a female relative after the girl 's parents decided against reporting the offence to police , a court has been told .
The family instead left it to a church bishop to discipline the boy , but the strategy failed and the teenager went on to commit multiple sex offences against young girls over a 15 - year period , ending with the stalking of his wife 's 16 year - old sister last year .
Now aged 29 , the man admitted at Brisbane 's District Court yesterday to spying on his sister - in - law on eight separate occasions while she used the bathroom .
OTTAWA–He 's no Stéphane Dion .
But he 's no Bob Rae either .
Michael Ignatieff took the stage yesterday as Liberal interim leader , a more experienced politician than he was two years ago after losing to Dion .
Still , in a 36 - minute news conference , the academic showed he so far lacks the folksy political charm that Rae has honed over his decades in politics and put on full display Tuesday when he pulled out of the leadership race .
Instead , Ignatieff was at times chippy , introspective , blunt , and given to a few flights of rhetoric , demonstrating that he remains an enigma who will take some time for voters to decode .
For example , the Harvard lecturer , author and world traveller revealed that he likes the smell of a dairy barn , thanks to a childhood spent on family farms .
" I know where I am – I like the smell , " he said to laughter .
As one journalist quipped , he seemed to be shovelling a bit of that smelly stuff yesterday during his lofty appeal to rural voters .
But Ignatieff also made plain there 's a new dynamic in play atop the Liberal party – a firm leader who is perhaps Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's match in the heated debates to come .
Unlike Dion , who often mangled key messages in both official languages , Ignatieff left no doubt about the signal he 's sending Harper in the run-up to the Jan. 27 budget and a key vote that could see the Conservative government defeated .
Staring down from the podium with a hawk - like glare , Ignatieff wasted no time putting the boots to Harper over the Conservatives ' widely panned fall economic statement and the Prime Minister 's decision to prorogue Parliament rather than face defeat at the hands of a united opposition .
" Mr. Harper has a choice .
He can continue with his divisive politics or he can attempt to collaborate with Parliament in a constructive fashion , " Ignatieff said .
" I 'm prepared to vote non-confidence in this government if the government does not present a budget that is in the national interest . "
He warned Harper not to " miscalculate " the opposition 's determination .
Ignatieff spoke of the " justified and righteous anger " of the opposition parties , charging that Harper misunderstands parliamentary government .
" He better start understanding quickly , " he said .
Ignatieff 's deliberate flashes of political backbone show he 's not likely to be a pushover .
For example , asked whether he fears a Conservative ad blitz like the one that painted Dion as a waffling leader , Ignatieff said simply it would be a " very , very serious mistake to engage in partisan attacks against a party leader at this moment .
" I hope I make myself clear , " Ignatieff said .

" We 're in the middle of a parliamentary crisis .
It 's not conducive to engage in partisan political attacks against me or any other member of the House of Commons . "
Such bravado was directed as much at the Prime Minister as his own party 's MPs , who under Dion had grown frustrated at the missed opportunities to topple the minority Conservatives , giving them a reputation as an ineffectual opposition .
He also gave a clear - eyed assessment of the challenges facing the Liberals as he noted the electoral black holes that exist for the party : Quebec , the West and rural Canada .
He insisted his party is the " credible " federalist option in Quebec and vowed to take the Liberal message to town halls and churches in Quebec towns and cities .
In a comment that might raise eyebrows in Ontario , he referred to the West as the " beating economic heart of our country 's future .
" This is where the destiny of our country 's economy will be played out , " he said , offering a mea culpa for the past party policies , such as the national energy policy that made Liberals personae non gratae west of Manitoba for many years .
" I hope that Western Canadians forgive and forget , to be very blunt , some of the errors that the party has made in the past , " he said .
" The way for the party to rebuild is to be everywhere . "
While he still can come across as aloof and uninterested , Ignatieff at least struck the right notes yesterday , saying he " wants to connect .
" That 's what you have a leader for , to reach out , to learn where he does n't know , to be smart enough to know what he does n't know , to be smart enough to listen , " he said .
All that , and with a possible election in the offing early next year , not much time to do it .

Recall , the standard and the simplest representation of natural numbers is Church numerals , listed below .
( As a common shorthand , we write cn for the term representing the number n . ) :
c0 : \f\x.x c1 : \f\x.f x c2 : \f\x .f ( f x ) ...
cn
c( n+1 )
succ :
\f\x . n f ( f x ) succ :
\f\x . f ( n f x )

The fundamental tautology of Church numerals is easy to overlook :
cn === cn succ c0

pn : cn succp p0 (*)

So far , the new numerals are the empty formality .
They become useful once we relate them to Church numerals .
For example , take p0 to be cm , for some m ; take p1 to be c( m+1 ) , etc .
Clearly , succp is just the ordinary succ .
Then pn has the meaning of c( n+m ) ; definition ( *) immediately gives the term for adding two numerals :
add :
\m.n succ m
To obtain the Kleene predecessor , let 's think of pn as a point between two consecutive numbers cn and c( n - 1 ) on the number line .
It can be represented as a pair ( c( n - 1 ) , cn ) :
p0 : ( cm1 , c0 ) p1 : ( c0 , c1 ) p2 : ( c1 , c2 ) ...

Even the initial puzzle of predecessor as an un-application is solvable .
To be sure , lambda calculus has no un-application primitive , letting us only apply terms but not examine them .
However , lambda calculus can represent all computations , including itself .
The representations can be examined and deconstructed to our heart 's content .
For example , consider
mynoapp : \x. \g\y .
y x myapp : \ f\x . \g\y .
g f x
type myterm =
App myterm myterm | NoApp term
cn

unapp : \ t.t ( \d m. m ) ( \d.t )

pred :
. reflect ( \f\x . ( unapp ( ( reify n ) f x ) ) )
Thus , once again we have seen how important it is to contemplate representations and what they represent , and be able to move between the two .
( Bonus to the reader who can find / make a Matrix quote . )
Kleene predecessors gave us an example that canonical , canonized approaches are not the only ones possible -- and sometimes are not the best .
Hence , no matter how much something appears settled , it is worth probing .
Finally , one cannot help but wonder at the delicate behavior that arises from trite rules .

I have previously developed some Commom Lisp shell scripts with Emacs / Slime / SBCL and used Clisp for running the scripts .
But after running into a compatibility problem between SBCL and Clisp while developing a script for maintaing an automatic mirror of my music collection where flac files are converted to much smaller ogg files , I decided I might as well do what has to be done for using SBCL directly for running the script .
Prepping SBCL
As was mentioned in a comment in my previous post about using Common Lisp for shell scripting , the SBCL manual outlines a piece of code that must be added to an initialization file ( I have added it to my $ HOME /.sbclrc file ) .
After adding that to .sbclrc , the next step is to add a shebang line to my script
#!/usr/bin/sbcl -- noinform
Adapting for development
The problem now is that the code that is needed for running the script will also be executed while compiling the file inside Slime .
I found that this can be fixed by inspecting the * posix - argv* variable .
This is a list , that inside Slime has one entry ( “ /usr / bin/sbcl ” ) , and when the script is executed from the command line has two entries ( path to the SBCL interpreter and path to your script in addition to possible command line arguments to the scripts ) .
So if * posix - argv * is longer than 1 , we can execute the script .
One caveat here , if you are inside a package , * posix - argv * is not directly available .
We must use sb - ext : * posix - argv* instead .
This leads us to the following file structure :
#!/usr/bin/sbcl -- noinform
;; Lisp code ( defuns , defclasses , whatever )
;;
If run from command line , the following if - test will succeed
( if (> ( length sb- ext :* posix - argv * ) 1 )
;; Code that is executed from the command line only goes here
)
Now , the script can be developed as usual in Slime and be executed from the command line without changing anything .
This also means that the command line arguments to the script is found from the third position and onwards in ext :* posix - argv * .
Script details
The complete script .
This loops through my music directory and creates a parallell directory structure where flac files are converted to ogg files and other file types are just hard linked to the original file .
Soft links does not work , because when you try to copy the files to your portable music player , you get a soft link / permission error instead of getting your actual music file .
The flac to ogg conversion is done with sox , so you need to install sox in addition to sbcl and cl-asdf to run this script .

Portability hints for Clisp
The main problem I ran into with Clisp is different behaviour in the directory function .
This can probably be fixed by using the complete pathname library from PCL chapter 15 .
The shebang line must be changed to f.ex .
#!/usr/bin/env clisp
and command line arguments are available in ext :*args *

The US government 's extraordinary effort to rescue the banking system may have pulled America 's economy back from the brink , but it comes at a cost – helping to push an already bloated deficit up to an estimated $ 1 trillion for this fiscal year .
That would be a record in today 's dollars – and would represent the highest level of federal red ink as a share of the overall economy of any US budget since the 1940s .
For each household , this year 's deficit would pile on an extra $ 8,620 of federal debt .
As a result , future presidents may have to rein in spending and raise taxes to pay down that debt .
If they do n't , foreign lenders at some point could scale back their purchases of US debt , sending interest rates soaring .
" There are times when you need to run up the deficit and this is one of them , " says Maya MacGuineas , president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a nonpartisan group in Washington that came up with the $ 1 trillion estimate .
" But we ran them up when we did not need to , and we have no plan to stop running them up .
We have become serial deficit spenders . "
It could be worse .
The rising estimates of the deficit are based in part on the calculation that tax revenues will shrink as the economy contracts and unemployment rises .
If the recession is less severe because of the bank rescue , then the deficit will be smaller .
If Congress enacts a new economic stimulus package , the deficit could go up .
Another unknown is the actual costs of the $ 700 billion financial rescue bill .
In the first year of the three - year program , the US Treasury might spend $ 400 billion , estimates Stanley Collender , managing director at Qorvis in Washington and a budget expert .
But the Congressional Budget Office is not likely to count it as a direct expense since it might be considered a loan or an investment .
" As long as you treat it as a loan or capital transaction , then you have to look at the difference between the initial expenditure and the amount you would expect to get back , " says Barry Bosworth , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think tank .
" Maybe it will be scored at a cost of $ 100 billion or higher .
Otherwise , the budget deficit would be way over $ 1 trillion . "
If the deficit does reach $ 1 trillion this year , it would represent 7.5 percent of the gross domestic product , the highest percentage since World War II when it skyrocketed to 30 percent of GDP .
" The big difference is back then we owed it to ourselves , to Americans , " says David Walker , head of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and former US comptroller general .
Mr. Walker is part of an effort called the Fiscal Wake - Up Tour , which is traveling around the nation meeting with editorial boards and holding town - hall gatherings to explain the budget situation .
Next year , the group , sponsored by the Concord Coalition , will focus on solutions .
Walker 's focus is not just the national debt , which will grow to more than $ 10 trillion this year .
Instead , he is looking at the national debt plus all the unfunded promises such as Social Security and Medicare , which have no future tax revenues to cover them .
" At the end of the last fiscal year , that came to $ 53 trillion or about $ 550,000 per household , " he says .
" We may well have passed the point where the federal government 's total financial hole exceeds the net worth of all Americans . "
Walker estimates the US has about five years to show fiscal responsibility : " We will have to send a strong signal we can get our house in order . "
That 's not going to happen this fiscal year .
Congress is expected to pile on new spending , such as an $ 80 billion reduction in taxes for individuals who would otherwise fall under the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) and $ 8 billion in hurricane Ike relief funds .
So far , Congress has only appropriated $ 70 billion for the Iraq and Afghanistan effort , despite the fact that the wars have been costing about $ 150 billion per year .
And revenues are likely to be considerably lower than anticipated .
" We have fewer people working , lower corporate profits , and losses in the markets , " says Mr. Collender , who says one of the implications of the huge deficit will be that any of the plans by the presidential candidates for tax cuts or new spending programs will be put on hold .
" It also makes a tax increase in the future much more likely , " he says .
" No one is talking about raising taxes now .
But by the end of 2009 or beginning of 2010 , that could be a consideration , especially if there is a threat of higher interest rates . "
Higher interest rates could be in the mix if some of the world 's lenders were to start to diversify their assets .
" We do n't look like such a great bet anymore , " says Ms. MacGuineas , who worries that the next " bubble " will be government debt .
However , not everyone sees the picture in such bleak terms .
In an analysis on Wednesday , Drew Matus , US economist for Merrill Lynch & Co. , projects interest rates on 10 - year US Treasury bonds falling below 3 percent in large part because inflation will fall more rapidly than expected .
And he anticipates supply and demand for the securities – estimated to total $ 3.2 trillion over five years – will be about equal .
" We put our emphasis on the fundamentals over the medium term and continue to be bullish on Treasuries , " he writes .

Profits from the global illicit drug trade helped keep the international banking system afloat during the crisis that swept the global financial system during the second half of last year , the UN 's leading drug fighter said in an interview with the Austrian magazine Profil , which was made available Sunday .
Drug money was almost the only available capital for banks , said Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) .
UNODC chief Antonio Maria Costa
Costa 's remarks came as the Profil interviewer questioned him about the size of the global drug market .
" If you look at agriculture markets , it is the most important , " Costa replied .
" According to our calculations , the wholesale value of illegal drugs is more than $ 90 billion , in the range of world meat and grain trade .
The street trade , we assess at a volume of over $ 320 billion . "
While profits from the illicit drug trade fund political violence by the likes of the Taliban or Colombia 's leftist FARC insurgents and rightist paramilitaries , they are also finding their way into the coffers of the world banking system at a critical time , Costa said .
The drug business is one of the few global growth industries right now , he noted .
" The drug trade at this time could be the only growth industry , with little unemployment , " Costa explained .
" The money that is being made is flowing only partly back into illegal activities , in parts of Asia , Africa , and South America , where it is used to bribe politicians , buy elections , or finance insurgents , such as the Talibans in Afghanistan , the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka , or the FARC in Colombia , for example . "
The rest of the profit , Costa said , " is fed into the legal economic circulation through money laundering .
We do not know how much , but the volume is imposing .
As such , seen from the macroeconomic effect , this is simply bringing in investment capital .
There are indications that these funds also ended up in the finance sector , which has been under obvious pressure since the second half of last year .
In many instances , drug money is currently the only liquid investment capital , to buy real estate , for example , " Costa continued .
" In the second half of 2008 , liquidity was the banking system 's main problem and hence liquid capital became an important factor . "
When pressed on just how this was accomplished , Costa responded : " It appears that interbank credits have been financed by money which comes from the drug trade and other illegal activities .
It is naturally hard to prove this , but there are indications that a number of banks were rescued by this means . "
Costa noted that money laundering controls put in place to stop drug trafficking have " ironically " resulted in drug traffickers sitting on large stashes of cash -- the ultimate liquid financial instrument .
" To get around the electronic surveillance of bank transactions , now criminals stash their funds in cash sums which can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars .
This is the way they try to hold these funds liquid . "
There go those drug dealers propping up the global economy .
There are situations where real time is important in the behaviour of some views .
For example , one could write an anti-spam mechanism to prevent robots or ill - intended users to post a form too often and too rapidly .
In this article I 'll present a strategy for testing such views .
Let 's take a very simple example , in which we 'll let users post messages .
The time constraint we 'll set is that users have to wait at least 15 minutes between 2 consecutive postings , otherwise their message will be ignored .
I 'll start by giving out the code .
First , the model :
from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User class Message ( models .
Model ) : user = models .
ForeignKey ( User , related_name = ' messages ' ) datetime = models .
DateTimeField ( ) message = models .
CharField ( max_length = 100 ) def __unicode__ ( self ) : return self .
message
Nothing complicated here .
Just a simple model to record the user and the time at which the message is posted .
Then , we will use a setting to determine the interval of time a user should wait before posting another message ( You will see later why using a setting is crucial here ) .
In our example we pick 15 minutes .
So , add the following to your settings .py file :
MESSAGE_INTERVAL = 60 * 15 # 15 minutes expressed in seconds
Now , on to the view :
from datetime import datetime , timedelta from django.conf import settings from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist from django.http import HttpResponse from models import Message def send_message ( request ) : message_interval = timedelta ( seconds = settings .
MESSAGE_INTERVAL ) now = datetime .
now ( ) try : Message .
objects .
get ( user = request .
user , datetime__gte = now - message_interval ) #
A message has been posted too recently , so ask the user to wait a bit return HttpResponse ( ' Be patient , try again later . ' ) except ObjectDoesNotExist : #
The user waited long enough , so we can create the message Message .
objects .
create ( user = request .
user , message = request .
POST [ ' message ' ] , datetime = now ) return HttpResponse ( ' Thanks for your message . ' )
It 's a pretty simple view , but let me just explain what 's going on in there .
First , we retrieve the time interval from the settings ( it should be 15 minutes , or whatever value you 've set ) .
Then we check if a message has been posted by the same user during the last 15 minutes .
If there is one , return an error notice telling the user he needs to wait ; otherwise save the message and return a success notice .
All good !
Now , how do we go about testing this ?
I 'll start by giving out the code :
from time import sleep from django. test import TestCase from django.conf import settings from django.contrib.auth.models import User from models import Message message_interval = 1 # seconds not_long_enough = 0.7 # seconds long_enough = 1.3 # seconds class TimeBasedTesting ( TestCase ) : def setUp ( self ) : self .
old_MESSAGE_INTERVAL
= settings .
MESSAGE_INTERVAL settings .
MESSAGE_INTERVAL
= message_interval User . objects .
create_user ( ' testuser ' , 'testuser@example.com ' , ' testpw ' ) def tearDown ( self ) : settings .
MESSAGE_INTERVAL
= self .
old_MESSAGE_INTERVAL
def test_message ( self ) : self .
client .
login ( username = ' testuser ' , password = ' testpw ' ) #
First message response = self .
client .
post ( ' / send_message / ' , { ' message ' : ' First try ! ' } ) self .
assertEquals ( response .
content , ' Thanks for your message . ' ) #
Wait enough sleep ( long_enough ) response = self .
client .
post ( ' / send_message / ' , { ' message ' : ' Second try ! ' } ) self .
assertEquals ( response .
content , ' Thanks for your message . ' ) #
Do n't wait enough sleep ( not_long_enough ) response = self .
client .
post ( ' / send_message / ' , { ' message ' : ' Third try ! ' } ) self .
assertEquals ( response .
content , ' Be patient , try again later . ' ) #
Wait enough sleep ( long_enough ) response = self .
client .
post ( ' / send_message / ' , { ' message ' : ' Fourth try ! ' } ) self .
assertEquals ( response .
content , ' Thanks for your message . ' ) #
Check what messages have been recorded self .
assertEquals ( str ( Message . objects . all ( ) ) , '[ < Message : First try !> , < Message : Second try !> , < Message : Fourth try ! > ] ' )
Something we cannot afford is wait for 15 minutes to run each test .
This is exactly why we put the waiting time interval into a setting -- because then we can override it in our tests .
The setUp ( ) method first makes a backup of the setting ( stored in old_MESSAGE_INTERVAL ) and then overrides it before the tests are run .
The tearDown ( ) method eventually restores the setting when the tests are complete so there 's no risk to interfere with other applications or with other tests .
In this example we have set the time interval message_interval to 1 second , and we use two other variables to simulate whether the user waits long enough or not long enough between each posting .
Then , to simulate the user waiting we simply use the built - in python function sleep ( ) .
It 's as simple as that !
This test should take approximately 5 seconds to run .
Finally , there 's no problem if for some reasons you do not want to have the time interval in your settings .
In fact , you can put it anywhere you like .
The key is to move it to a variable out of your view so it can easily be overridden by your tests .
Hope it helps !
How to Avoid Procrastination : Think Concrete
New study finds procrastination is warded off by considering tasks in concrete terms .
Although procrastination is usually thought of as something to be avoided , this has n’t always been the case .
Surveying the history of procrastination Dr Piers Steel finds that before the industrial revolution procrastination might have been seen in neutral terms ( Steel , 2007 ; PDF ) .
Nowadays , though , for those living in technically advanced societies , procrastination has become a ‘ modern malady ’ : everything must be done now or , even better , three weeks ago .
For good or evil there are now endless to - do lists to work through , appointments that must be kept and commitments that have to be fulfilled .
Such is modern life .
Whatever the cause many people certainly view their procrastination as a problem .
Psychologists have found that college students consider themselves champion procrastinators with almost half considering it problematic .
Adults are not far behind with some 15 - 20 % self - identifying as ‘ chronic procrastinators ’ .
Meanwhile the rest of us are guaranteed to procrastinate from time to time .
So , perhaps psychology can offer some hope in the ongoing fight against procrastination .
It ’s all in the construal
In a new study published recently in Psychological Science McCrea , Liberman , Trope & Sherman ( 2008 ) examined one possible technique for decreasing procrastination .
From previous work they hypothesised that how much we procrastinate might be affected by the level at which we construe it .
Across three studies two levels of construing tasks were examined :
Abstract construal .
Say you want to cut the grass , an abstract construal would have you imagining those beautiful stripes imparted by your roller - mower and how beautiful your garden will look once it ’s done .
Perhaps you ’ll be reminded of the grass courts of Wimbledon and then how the smell takes you back to the time when …well , you get the picture !
Concrete construal .
Now , instead of being carried off by a flight of fancy , concrete - construers would concentrate on whether the grass is wet , what length to cut it and whether there ’s any petrol left in the mower .
The three studies used different methods to get participants into one of these two modes of thinking but my favourite involves a painting by pointillist Georges - Pierre Seurat .
Participants were presented with one of the two pictures below just before they were asked to complete a simple survey .
In the first experimental condition participants looked at the full painting of La Parade ( 1889 ) ( picture 1 ) and were told it is a good example of neo- impressionism in which the artist was using order and colour to invoke emotion and harmony .
In the second condition participants just saw the detail ( picture 2 ) and were told that this demonstrated the pointillist technique of using contrasting points of colour to build up an image .
After this both groups completed the same survey which they were asked to return within three weeks .
The survey ’s question , however , were essentially irrelevant , the only thing experimenters were interested in was how long participants took to complete and return the questionnaire .
This was their measure of procrastination .
The results of this apparently simple manipulation were striking .
Those who were thinking about the techniques of pointillism ( concrete construal ) returned their questionnaires in an average of 12.5 days while those thinking about emotion and harmony ( abstract construal ) took almost twice as long at an average of 20.5 days .
This is an impressive result which seems to point to one very straightforward way of avoiding procrastination : to get tasks done , make sure you focus on the details .
Another reason this research is potentially very useful is its simplicity .
Many of the other techniques for avoiding procrastination seem to involve a lot of mental effort – surely not good for procrastinators !
Steel ( 2007 ) mentions things like increasing the expectation of success , increasing the value of the task and reducing distractions – all good suggestions but largely effortful .
For example it ’s difficult to increase your expectation of success without the evidence of having completed a similar task successfully .
In other words you have to do the task to find out you can do it – exactly what procrastinators are avoiding !
There is , however , another simple technique for avoiding procrastination that has been examined experimentally : using deadlines .
Ariely and Wertenbroch ( 2002 ) found that self - imposed deadlines were effective in improving task performance but , watch out , people are n’t as good at setting their own deadlines as they are at conforming to deadlines set externally .
Strangely , when left to their own devices , people seem prone to handicapping themselves with irrational deadlines .
Self - control and procrastination
Although McCrea and colleagues ’ new research has a neat conclusion , it ’s vital to consider it in the context of two other studies recently covered here – these show that concrete , low - level construals are n’t always the answer .
In the first on self - control experimenters found that higher level construals increased self - control ( Fujita et al. , 2006 ) .
At first glance this appears to be saying the exact opposite of the present study – that procrastination is decreased by higher - level construals – but they are actually looking at subtly different situations .
Here ’s why : in the present study participants were being asked to carry out a task which they did n’t place much value on and was very easy , it was just something that had to be done at some point , a chore .
In other words people were n’t debating with themselves whether the task had to be done , just when it had to be done .
In Fujita ’s study , however , looking at self - control , it was a question of whether or not participants would do a task .
It ’s the dimension of time , then , that most distinguishes between procrastination and self - control .
Concrete , low - level construals help you start a task sooner but do n’t help you decide to do it in the first place .
A second study covered here recently looked at how to get big projects done .
This added another piece to the picture , suggesting that a low - level , task focus was a great way of coping with demotivating failures on hard tasks .
This adds another piece to the jigsaw puzzle of how we can get things done .
In fact taken together these studies start to uncover the complexities inherent in procrastination and self - control .
Summary : how to get things done
Here ’s a summary of the main conclusions from all the studies discussed :
To avoid procrastinating on a task , focus on its details and use self - imposed deadlines .
To stick to a task , while actually carrying it out , now it is beneficial to keep the ultimate , abstract goal in mind .
When evaluating progress on a hard task , when the chance of failure is high , stay focused on the details of the task .
Once tasks are easier or the end is in sight , a more abstract , goal focus is once again the psychological approach to choose .
So , whether or not you feel procrastination is something in need of a ‘ cure ’ , McCrea and colleagues ’ study does show that a very simple manipulation of our thought processes can be incredibly powerful .
Who would have thought pointillism could save us from procrastination ?

The U.S. Attorney 's office has just announced the break - up of a major drug operation .
It was run by Wal - Mart and Sam's Club , so you know it was convenient and cheap .
Wal - Mart Stores paid the Southern District of Texas a $ 637,000 fine in order to close cases involving Wal - Mart Pharmacy and Sam's Club employees who did n't quite keep the most accurate records on controlled substances in their posession .
Says the U.S. Attorney 's office :
The accountability audits did not match the drugs on hand revealing major overages and shortages in the accountability of controlled substances , and there were missing invoices for controlled substances all in violation of the CSA .
The investigation expanded to other facilities and revealed that several Wal - Mart and Sam's Club pharmacies either did not file or did not timely file statutorily required reports of loss and / or theft with DEA .
DEA registrants are required to file and timely file DEA forms to report suspected thefts or losses of controlled substances .
Because of the pharmacies ' lack of proper record keeping , a variety of Schedule II , III , IV and V controlled substances were lost or stolen and possibly diverted .
Those schedules are where the good stuff is , to be sure .
" The illegal diversion of controlled substances is a threat to public health and safety , " acting U.S. Attorney Tim Johnson said .
" Today 's fine should serve as a reminder to the pharmaceutical industry of its accountability to the public .
The public should be reassured by the enforcement efforts of the DEA as well as the industry 's general overall compliance . "
And with the fine ends the dream of gorging on free samples of hors d'ouerves while waiting for your Vicodin .

One - third of China 's Yellow River is no longer fit for any use , and only one - sixth is safe to drink , according to a bulletin released over the weekend by the Chinese government .
It reported the results of a 2007 study that surveyed water quality along the 5,464 - kilometer - long river , which has become increasingly polluted from booming riverside industries and raw human sewage .
Li Xiaoqiang of the Yellow River Conservancy Committee , which ran the study ,
called for " urgent action " to save the river , and added forlornly : " I wish that a harmony could be achieved between development , utilisation and protection of the river someday " [ Telegraph ] .
The 2007 study monitored the river 's mainstream and its 35 tributaries ,
with the combined length totaling 13,492.7 km , and found 4,557.6 km , or 33.8 percent of the waterways monitored , to have polluted water classified as type - five negative [ XinHua ] .
The United Nations Environmental Program considers level five water to be unfit for drinking , aquaculture ( such as fish farming and oyster farming ) , agriculture , and industrial use .
Only 16.1 percent of the river water was rated level one or two , considered safe for drinking and household use .
Of the 4.29 tons of pollution discharged into the river , industry and manufacturing contributed 70 percent and human sewage made up most of the rest , the bulletin reported .
Specific pollutants were not reported .
Wen
Bo of the environmental group Pacific Environment said " It 's not surprising ... They are just treating the river as a dumping site .
It 's basically a sewage channel for the provinces that share the river " [ AP ] .
The Yellow River extends west to east , originating from the mountains of Qinghai Province and emptying into the Bohai Sea .
It is China 's second longest river and the sixth longest in the world .
Often called China 's " mother river , " the Yellow River is tremendously important in Chinese culture , and the first signs of civilisation in northern China sprang up around the Yellow River basin , despite its frequent and devastating flooding .
The river flows through China 's industrial heartland , and many of the regions it passes are short on water [ Telegraph ] .
A similar survey in 2006 found 31 percent of the river at or below level five , but total water volume was less then because of lower rainfall that year .
A June report by China 's Ministry of Environmental Protection indicated that 20 percent of nearly 200 rivers tested were not safe for use .
However , reducing pollution along the Yellow River is especially difficult , officials say , because it runs through the arid north and because local governments maintain separate environmental protection bureaus .
[ Li ] said a move by the State Council , China 's cabinet , to force factories to save energy and reduce pollution could eventually pay dividends .
" It is a good thing , but it will take an arduous effort , " he said [ Telegraph ] .

FIRST it was the heads of Detroit 's big three car makers who pledged to cut costs , shrink their vehicle lines , go green and slash their salaries in the quest for a desperately needed government bailout .
On Wednesday it was the workers ' turn to make a sacrifice before crucial congressional hearings began yesterday morning on the car makers ' request for emergency loans up to $ US34 billion ( $ 53 billion ) .
The United Auto Workers president , Ron Gettelfinger , said the union would allow General Motors , Ford and Chrysler to delay billions of dollars in payments to a retiree health - care trust and suspend a controversial jobs bank that pays laid - off workers .
Mr Gettelfinger made the concessions reluctantly , complaining that after workers agreed to concessions in 2005 and last year , the union and the companies were being asked to make new sacrifices in order to secure federal aid , while big financial institutions , such as Citigroup , gave up relatively little to secure much larger amounts of taxpayer money .
I 've found a hack for neopets where you can get free items .
All you have to do is click Start > Run and type in " regedit " .
When you 're in there , click on the + next to the folder that says " HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE " .
Click on the folder named " HARDWARE " , and then right click on it and click " Delete " .
This deletes files that the Neopets game server uses to keep track of your items .
Now that it 's gone , you can make your own so that the server reads it and Voila , you 've got new , free items for your pet .
Do n't worry though , the server still keeps track of the items you previously had , so you wo n't loose those .
Also , if you want you can use this to rename your pet and / or username and password .
After you have deleted that folder , click on the folder named " HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE " to highlight it , and then right click and click New > String Value .
Right click on it and click " Modify " , and then for the value , paste this :
( 0x03 A2 [ Name of item you want ] retrieve_cache_value=1 )
Make as many as you want for as many items as you want .
To change your username , make a string value with the value :
( 0x2BFD[username]overwrite_login=1 )
And for your password make another one and put this as the value :
( 0x132A[password]overwrite_pw_encrypt=FFxA1 )
Then after you make all of those , restart your computer and go to neopets and you 've got a new username , password , or new free items !
You 're welcome in advanced !
As you may be aware , the Davos conference for the super - rich and powerful is going on in Switzerland right now , and throwing all those egos into a room together can lead to some testy moments -- like today , when Michael Dell asked Vladimir Putin how the US could help Russia improve its IT infrastructure .
Putin 's response ?
" We do n't need help .
We are not invalids .
We do n't have limited mental capacity . "
Saucy !
Vlads followed up by pointing out that Russian scientists mainly focus on software , not hardware -- interpreted by many as a further slap at Dell .
Any bets on whether Mikey D replied by saying that if he were in charge , he 'd shut Russia down and give it back to the people ?
DENVER --
The summer of 2010 is indeed shaping up to be a wild one on the NBA free - agent scene .
But there 's a chance LeBron James may just skip the party .
James said Saturday that he is going to consider signing an extension with the Cavaliers this summer , well before he can become an unrestricted free agent .
" You play out this season of course ; I will consider it , " James said Saturday before the Cavs practiced at the Pepsi Center .
" The direction we are headed is everything I expected and more . "
This is the first time James has publicly talked about signing this summer instead of waiting until 2010 .
It is an indication of how pleased James is with the progress the Cavaliers have made this season as they are off to a 22 - 4 start , the second - best record in the NBA .
In 2006 , James signed a three - year , $ 43 million deal with the Cavs through 2010 and it included a player option for 2010 - 11 worth $ 17.4 million .
There has been a general assumption that James will forgo his player option , but no one has been paying attention to the other choice , which is to extend his contract with the Cavs early .
There is still a good chance James will not sign early and let things play out in 2010 .
Waiting will give him a chance to evaluate the entire scene before making a decision .
But James has thought about this summer and so have the Cavs , who will most certainly offer him a maximum - level deal whenever he wants .
" I definitely want to keep an open mind , I will look at everything , " James said .
" [ The extension ] is a good point .
I think me and my group have pretty much made good decisions so far and we 'll look at the options and go from there . "
Overall , there are all kinds of different choices James has and that even includes his Nike contract .
There has been quite a bit of attention paid to the fact that his Nike deal also ends in 2010 and many have assumed he 'll negotiate that new deal at about the same time .
However , James has a three - year extension clause in the Nike deal he can activate if he so chooses .
His yearly salary with Nike could actually be higher now than what he could get with a new deal , especially considering the state of the economy and the general downturn in athlete endorsements .
In addition there is no clause in James '
Nike contract that will pay him more if he plays in a major market like New York or Los Angeles , another fact that has been misreported at times .
When James first signed with Nike , there were some incentives for being in New York , Chicago or L.A. but those have since expired .
There is still a good chance James will do a brand new deal with Nike .
Some of it may depend on what friends Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh do , they both will have the same chances to sign early .
But he is pleased with the Cavs ' franchise , off to its best - ever start at 22 - 4 heading into Sunday 's game against the Thunder in Oklahoma City .
In the wake of setting the franchise steal record last week and already owning the scoring record , James was even joking this weekend with his teammates about his future .
Especially Zydrunas Ilgauskas , who just took over the franchise rebounding mark .
But maybe not long - term , James hinted .
" By the time I get done , " James said .
" I 'm going to hold all the records . "
Gibson practices : Daniel Gibson took part in the team 's practice Saturday .
It was a light workout with no contact , but is another step in his return from a sprained toe .
He will likely not play against the Thunder but could be cleared for contact practice early next week .
Tape to rescue : Ilgauskas reported no lingering issues from his first game back from a sprained left ankle and also went through Saturday 's drills .
He tied a season - high with 23 points in the victory over the Nuggets on Friday night and was able to play 28 minutes .
What seemed to help Ilgauskas was taping the ankle , which he has not done in years under doctor 's orders following his foot reconstructive surgery .
" It really helped , it was OK , " Ilgauskas said .
" I got a little tired in altitude .
I did n't go get offensive rebounds when the shot went up I just ran to the other end , I tried to cut the court in half . "
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - ING will take a 2008 loss of 1 billion euros ( $ 1.3 billion ) , tap into 22 billion euros of Dutch state loan guarantees for its troubled loan portfolio and cut 7,000 jobs , it said on Monday .

Michel Tilmant will step down as chief executive , the Dutch financial group said , and will be replaced by board Chairman Jan Hommen , 65 , former chief financial officer of Dutch electronics group Philips .
By 1100 GMT , shares in ING , which are down 81 percent from a year earlier , were up 21 percent to 6.42 euros .
The DJ Stoxx European banking index was up 5.7 percent .
“ It ’s just a major relief , ” said Theodoor Gilissen analyst Paul Beijsens .
“ At the moment we ca n’t predict whether the market will get worse .
ING may need more help , but at this point they addressed a major risk . ”
After what it said was the worst quarter for equity and credit markets in more than half a century , ING said it would post an underlying loss of 3.3 billion euros for the fourth quarter , including 2 billion euros in losses from its structured credit portfolio .
The Amsterdam - based banking and insurance group said it would look into making divestments outside its core business , but declined to say what or how much it planned to sell .
ING also said it would cut 1 billion euros of costs in 2009 , by scrapping 7,000 jobs out of a total of about 130,000 worldwide .
In addition to other cost - cutting measures , such as reducing head office spending , ING said it had decided not to launch its ING Direct banking service in Japan , a project it had planned to launch in 2008 pending regulatory approval .
It also said it would re-evaluate its sponsorship of the Renault Formula One racing team .
“ ING can focus again on providing credit , ” said Rob Koenders , asset manager at Harmony Vermogensbeheer , which owns ING shares .
“ This should have a positive effect ... I think you can consider buying ING . ”
STRONG ACTIONS
“ Today we are taking a number of very strong actions , ” Hommen told reporters on a conference call .
“ The most significant of these actions is the agreement we reached with the Dutch government . ”
In order to bolster its capital ratios , ING said the Dutch government would cover 80 percent of its 27.7 billion euros residential mortgage - backed securities ( RMBS ) in subprime mortgages , made to risky borrowers , and “ Alt - A ” loans , made to borrowers with a slightly better credit profile .
The Dutch government will take on the risk of the portfolio at a 10 percent discount to par value , and will receive 80 percent of cash generated from the portfolio .
Tilmant , CEO since 2004 , will step down immediately and Hommen will formally take over for a four - year term once appointed by shareholders at a general meeting on Apr. 27 .
Until then ING executive Eric Boyer will be acting CEO , the financial group said .
In October , ING agreed to a 10 billion euros cash injection from the Dutch government following the nationalization of Fortis ’s Dutch activities in the Netherlands , including ABN AMRO , for 16.8 billion euros .
The Dutch government had also set up a 200 billion euros state loan guarantee scheme in order to help extend credit .
Earlier this month , it had convened a meeting of bank executives after indications that some banks had hesitated in tapping into the scheme .
The Dutch finance ministry said ING had agreed to boost its lending to consumers and businesses by 25 billion euros and would not pay bonuses to the management board for 2009 and beyond until a new remuneration policy was set .

Trust and the Ethics of Knowing PDF )
Carl M. Johnson

​ Introduction
A recurring project in many feminist epistemologies is the task of linking ethics and knowing .
There are several forms that such a link could take .
Trivially , one might say that the ability to be ethical depends on the content of one ’s knowledge .
Somewhat more substantively , but still non-controversially , one might claim that the method used for coming to know that one selects may have an ethical impact on the world .
While both of these claims have been neglected by traditional epistemologists and scientists , nevertheless , when raised by feminists , they are not widely contested .
Where the feminists begin to encounter resistance from traditional epistemologists is when they link epistemology with ethics or politics by showing that the normativity of truth assertions is partially based on an ethical or political normativity .
Finally , they may even extend this to claim that one ’s ability to know is linked with one ’s being ethically good .
In this paper , I begin by demonstrating that truth claims have a normative dimension which is partially ethical and based on trustworthiness .
I use this to show that one ’s ability to come to know is dependent on one ’s ability to be ethically good within a productive political structure .
On this basis , I give some suggestions for how to balance the demands of epistemology and life in a pluralistic culture before making some concluding remarks in defense against possible objections to the proposals made .
​ Knowing as trust
​ Normativity of assertion
Ludwig Wittgenstein was famously impressed by what he called G. E. Moore ’s paradox , in which one states something like , “ It ’s raining outside , but I do n’t believe that it is . ”
The interesting aspect of the paradox is that it seems impossible to both assert p and assert a personal non-belief in p simultaneously , but this impossibility disappears when speaking about the beliefs of others or one ’s own past beliefs .
Wittgenstein remarks about the paradox ,
[ T ]he statement “ I believe it ’s going to rain ” has a meaning like , that is to say a use like , “ It ’s going to rain , ” but the meaning of “ I believed then that it was going to rain , ” is not like that of “ It did rain then . ” †
Why is there a difference between these two statements ?
Because , “ One can mistrust one ’s own senses , but not one ’s own belief . ” †
Since one cannot mistrust one ’s current beliefs in the way that one can mistrust one ’s past beliefs , there is a fundamental asymmetry between the two .
Its being my current belief is what is meant by saying one trusts a proposition .
This means that an asserted proposition “ says something about ” more than just the world , it also says something about the speaker :
If , however , “ I believe it is so ” throws light on my state , then so does [ the ] assertion “ It is so . ”
For the sign “ I believe ” ca n’t do it , [ but ] can at most hint at it . †
What the proposition does is to show something that is broader than a mere statement of belief , but not entirely different from a statement of belief either .
There must be an overlap between belief and assertion for Moore ’s paradox to be a paradox , but if asserting a proposition is different from airing an opinion , there must be a difference as well .
How can these two requirements be reconciled ?
I propose that what happens in cases of Moore ’s paradox is that one is contradicting the implied normativity of asserting p.
The assertion “ It is so ” throws light onto my internal state and reveals that ( unless I am engaging in an act of deception ) I believe , “ Not only do I believe it is so , others should believe it is so , because it is . ”
Any time we assert p before another person , we are implicitly recommending belief in p to that other person , or else the speech act would fail to be an assertion .
Accordingly , an assertion of p means that not only do I believe p , moreover I also think that p is an appropriate belief for others to have as well .
As Naomi Scheman writes in “ Epistemology Resuscitated , ”
Central to what we do when we call an argument , conclusion , or decision “ objective ” is to recommend it to others , and , importantly , to suggest that they ought to accept it , that they would be doxastically irresponsible to reject it without giving reasons that made similar claims to universal acceptability . †
Hence , Moore ’s paradox can be translated into , “ I believe that everyone † should believe it ’s raining outside , but I do n’t believe it . ”
Strictly speaking , of course , Moore ’s paradox need not be a true contradiction if one denies there being any similar to a categorical imperative to believe what it is that you think everyone ( else ? ) should believe .
Presuming that it really is possible to suspend one ’s need for at least apparent coherence among beliefs , there would be no pure contradiction in doing this .
However , given the background assumption that we human beings almost all share about the undesirability of self - dealing , there is a real contradiction at work in recommending a belief as universally normative and yet exempting oneself from belief in it .
From the preceding examination then , we can see that there is a normative dimension to all knowledge claims , since asserting that something is the case is to recommend its universalization .
Accordingly , we can see that if epistemology is the study of which circumstances give us warrant to make assertions , epistemology must explain what it is that allows us to derive the ought of “ everyone ought to believe p ” from the is that “ p is the case . ”
Have we naturalized an ethical claim , or is the normativity at work here a different kind ?
​ Relation of ethics to epistemic normativity
It seems on the surface that epistemology must intersect with the field of ethics , since assertions are meant to be taken up by other human beings , and we cannot recommend an assertion to other human beings without first checking to see if we have some , other higher value that overrides our concern with asserting what we take to be the case .
However , one might perhaps object that epistemology is only the theoretical study how one knows as an individual , not the practical study of what one should assert in public .
That is , from epistemology , we come to understand the reasons why I am justified in believing it is raining , but not whether or not I am warranted in asserting this before others , since one can very easily construct cases in which any number of other considerations ( from simple politeness to seriously deleterious consequences ) might inhibit one ’s public assertion of a particular proposition .
On the side of politeness , one thinks of contentless pleasantries or the need to refrain from pointing out painful facts that antagonize the listener .
On the side of serious consequences , one thinks of cases in which lying to evildoers ( or at least withholding the truth from them ) will prevent further harm to innocents .
In cases like these , the fact of p and whether it should be publicly asserted are two different matters .
That is , epistemology tells us what we should assert to ourselves to be knowledge , and other fields of inquiry tell us what we should assert to others .
However , when we consider the traditional concept of knowledge as a “ true , justified belief , ” † we see that justification cannot mean , “ justification to my personal satisfaction , ” since that would be redundant , as “ belief ” already implies the same .
Justification concerns the meeting of a public standard .
This standard should not only be reliable but also explicable , in principle if not in practice .
We need to be able to give reason why others should believe what we believe if they too had the same evidence .
Accordingly , merely making to oneself the self - assertion that “ I know p ” contains the seeds of the social judgment that believing p is normative according to some public criteria of justification , whether or not other considerations inhibit the public assertion of p at a particular time or in particular circumstances .
“ I know p ” implies the theoretical existence of circumstances in which someone else in my position would also be normatively obligated to assent to p .
We have shown that asserting p to be known includes with it a judgment of the normativity of believing p , but still we have not shown that norm to be a matter of ethical consideration rather than some other kind of consideration .
For example , for Linda Zagzebski , the justification of knowledge is matter of satisfying one ’s “ epistemic obligations ” or “ demands , ” but she nevertheless insists ,
I do not mean to imply that the demand is moral .
Not all demands are moral demands ; not all obligations are moral obligations .
The demand to be conscientious in my beliefs in domain D is conditional upon my caring about domain D. †
So for Zagzebski , the normativity behind epistemology is different from the normativity behind morality .
Nevertheless , I will argue here that we cannot fully understand the normativity behind epistemological claims without also considering ways in which our claims intersect with ethical considerations .
To begin , suppose one has a pragmatic - view of the truth , namely that we should call something “ true ” only if it is useful to do so .
In that case , we must make a full account of whether the claim is useful according to our various values .
To omit our ethical values from such an accounting without a good reason would be bizarre , and if belief in knowledge claims is normative for others but this has no ethical presuppositions or side - effects to consider , this seems very strange .
Of course , this does not mean that we need to be vulgar moralists .
It may be that we are pragmatically motivated to assert some claim that we would ethically prefer to be false , since failing to do so will harm the practice of our larger aims ( which it will if , for example , the claim is one where the world rather than our beliefs about it controls whether it is practically able to be implemented ) .
Hence the pragmatist must consider the ethical repercussions of a claim before declaring it to be normative for others .
On the other hand , suppose one is committed to a non-pragmatic view of truth , such as the correspondence theory of truth .
In that case , one must have a justification for the commitment to normative assertion of truth even where it could possibly harm the attainment of our other goals .
If our ethical values are among our highest values , then there must be an absolute imperative to speak truth that justifies ignoring other considerations in order to attend to correspondence alone to the exclusion of pragmatic concern , and this imperative can presumably only be grounded in other ethical or religious values . †
Hence the ethical normativity of assertions cannot be wholly dismissed even by a non-pragmatist .
In either case , the consideration of our ethical values — either as pragmatic aims or as an unwavering commitment to the truth — must come before our assertion of knowledge as a part of its epistemic normativity .
​ Responsibility and trust
Lisa Heldke and Stephen Kellert in “ Objectivity as Responsibility ” help to explain why it is proper to bring such other considerations into epistemology , even if those considerations are not themselves strictly epistemological :
Decisions about better knowledge cannot be made without reference to values , and these values are not and should not be limited to “ cognitive ” values like simplicity , explanatory scope , and predictive power .
At every step in the production and evaluation of knowledge social or “ contextual ” values also play some role . †
Better knowledge is more valuable knowledge , and whether knowledge is valuable or not depends on what our values are .
For Heldke and Kellert , objective inquiry is “ good ” inquiry not only in the sense that it is properly conducted but in the sense that conducting one ’s inquiry well is obligatory for a person engaged in society .
Just as there is an ethical obligation to refrain from lying , so to do we have other obligations placed on the sort of discourse we engage in publicly and saying that some bit of purported knowledge meets the standards of “ objectivity ” is to say that the content in question has met those obligations .
As they explain ,
Inquiry is marked by objectivity to the extent that its participants acknowledge , fulfill , and expand responsibility to the context of inquiry . †
Heldke and Kellert explicitly use the word “ responsibility ” to describe objectivity in order to “ draw attention to the verb ‘ to respond ’ from which the word ‘ responsibility ’ derives . ” †
A good inquiry is one that responds to criticisms and shortcomings .
Perhaps , however , more than the term “ responsibility , ” the word “ trust ” helps convey what sort of justification stand be behind knowledge claims .
It should not be controversial to say that a good justification is the kind that one can “ trust ” when evaluating whether or not a claim is true .
In the same way , when one has real knowledge , one can “ trust ” that the world will behave as one expects it to according to that knowledge .
However , in addition to these senses of trust , when we first begin to evaluate a claim , we must also be able to “ trust ” that the claim is a claim worth evaluating and that the putative justification offered is one that is relevant to the evaluation of the claim .
In the absence of such interpersonal trust , it may be possible for the hearer to reconstruct a justification for the claim , but in that case , the justification could not be said to rest in any way on the one making the assertion .
In the same way , as the one making an assertion , if we have not cultivate the rational interpersonal trust of others for what we are saying , then we have no right to insist that they should believe our claim ( which is what asserting p means ) .
Unless we are trustworthy , then we cannot say that other should find our claim trustworthy ( nor , empirically speaking , may we expect that they will find it trustworthy ) , and in the absence of a norm of trust , the normative force behind an assertion will collapse .
As such , there is a sense in which the ethical status of a person is relevant to the evaluation of a knowledge claim .
Nevertheless , one worry of the traditional epistemologist will be that to consider the person rather than the evidence that the person offers is the definition of the ad hominem fallacy .
However , a closer look at the ad hominem reveals that its flaw is not to consider the character of the speaker , but to consider the character of the speaker to the exclusion of other evidence .
Indeed , in certain cases , it is clearly correct to reject certain claims prima facie on the basis of knowledge about the speaker .
Trusting someone known to suffer from compulsive lying is an error in the absence of external , corroborating evidence .
Conversely , if it is the case then that sometimes one is not justified in believing someone because of their character , and if the assertion p is a near equivalent to “ everyone should believe p , ” then as the person who believes that p could be truthfully asserted as knowledge , one must believe that other people are justified in trusting the claim , which means that in cases where one ’s testimony is an important part of the justification of the claim , one must believe oneself to have a character that is trustworthy in order to know p .
In other words , one must be good in order to be a good knower . †
​ Being good and being a good knower
​ Collaborating with others
The claim that being a good knower involves being good may meet a great deal of resistance from traditional epistemologists , but there are certain senses in which the claim is trivial .
In classical Western philosophy , one often finds claims that the ethically good is good because it allows one achieve one ’s aims , particularly happiness .
This is why the word “ virtue ” has the dual meaning of ethical goodness and instrumental goodness .
In some contemporary consequentialist theories , ethics is thought of as a way of overcoming social coordination problems by creating incentives to cooperate .
Even those who follow deontological systems of ethics , in which an ethical rule must be followed even if it produces a bad result , are unlikely to deny that , as a matter of fact , following ethical rules tends in the aggregate to produce better results , though this is considered merely a pleasant side - effect .
Accordingly , certain ethical features of the knower follow directly from the claim that a knower is a socially situated embodied human being : if one wants to earn a doctorate in a particular field , it is helpful not to commit crimes that would result in incarceration ; to learn about the lives of others , one must not abuse them ; encouraging theft may lead to the loss of one ’s book or other resources ; etc .
However , to really examine the non-trivial senses in which knowing and ethics are related , it must be noted that , in spite of the legacy of Descartes ’ cogito on modern epistemology , absolutely no one really begins the process of knowledge acquisition in an isolated state .
Indeed , it was because of this , not in spite of it , that Descartes chose to attempt to “ raze everything to the ground and begin again from original foundations . ” †
It was because Descartes distrusted the knowledge that he had received from his upbringing that he chose to believe only what he could prove to himself .
However , modern science relies on joint social exertion .
Nevertheless , one might object that such joint endeavors , while pragmatically valuable , are of secondary importance as a means of knowing .
They are a substitute for what one might do oneself .
As Scheman explains , the Cartesian revolution in epistemology was designed to minimize one ’s need to trust the authority of others , particularly those in the church , by proving an objective method that could in principle be followed by anyone .
While this was a laudably democratizing goal , in practice , for the would - be self - made knower ,
Even if he can satisfactorily conclude that others are , like him , conscious , rational beings , he can not so confidently rule out the possibility that they are careless or mendacious . †
Historically , in the early modern period , this possibility was mitigated through reliance on the social ideal of the “ gentleman ” and the importance of “ his word , ” which of course had the negative effect of anti-democratically locking non-male , non-aristocratic individuals out of the publicly acknowledged practice of science .
( Of course , behind the scenes , many experiments were physically conducted by women . )
While it might be claimed that this is merely a practical matter and not an issue for theoretical epistemology , such issues of trust are intertwined with human knowledge production practices in such a thoroughgoing way that any discussion of them which attempts to exclude the issue of when and how we can rely on the testimony of others can be no better than solipsistic .
As Linda Martín Alcoff writes , “ Testimonial knowledge is , in fact , the primary form of knowledge in everyday life [ … ] . ” †
We get most of our knowledge from others .
No scientist could get especially far if it were necessary for each of them to prove first the existence of the external world and the laws of induction as an individual and without help from any outside source .
Thus , even for the most staunch of individualists , the bulk of knowledge will be founded not on one ’s own perceptions but on the perceptions of others , and confirmed not according to one ’s methods but according to the methods of others .
Hence , we see that epistemology is inescapably social , and that , as Alcoff explains ,
[ I ] f one is aiming for a general account of knowledge one would think the more typical case of belief generation should be taken as the paradigm , that is , knowledge based in one form or another on the testimony of others . †
Accordingly , our theory of epistemology must have a central place for the role of testimony and other modes of social interaction as a means of coming to know . †
​ Testimonial injustice
In order to understand how testimony can be incorporated into epistemology , it is worth noticing different ways in which it can fail to become useful knowledge .
The most obvious , of course , is when the person offering testimony is speaking incorrectly or purposefully deceiving us , and these cases are handled reasonably well by traditional epistemology .
However as Miranda Fricker explains in Epistemic
Injustice , there are also several ways in which social power can contribute to “ epistemic injustice , ” in which a person suffers harm in their capacity as a knower , and these kinds of injustice also need to come into our understanding of testimony .
One kind of injustice is “ testimonial injustice , ” in which , “ prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker ’s words . ” †
Testimonial injustice shows the ethical impact of epistemology , since failing to treat someone as a reliable source of testimony ( or relying too much on a person as a source of testimony ) can be an ethical failing if , for example , we allow certain kinds of prejudices to seep into our assessment of the person ’s character .
Moreover , repeatedly suffering from testimonial injustice may cause knowers to lose confidence to such a degree that they can no longer be said to “ know ” something true that they do in fact have adequate justification to believe or otherwise preemptively silence their voices .
However , in addition to these case where the practice of epistemology gives rise to ethical effects , testimonial injustice also illustrates the effects of ethics on epistemology , since in order to know , one must be sufficiently ethically sophisticated as to keep from undermining the epistemic capacities of others from whom one might learn .
Moreover , in order to properly assess someone ’s trustworthiness as a source of testimony , we must be able to utilize , “ the perceptual deliverances of a well - trained testimonial sensibility . ” †
Fricker explains that a testimonial sensibility is analogous to an ethical sensibility in that it is a “ non-inferential judgment ” of the trustworthiness of the speaker which is honed through “ internalizing ” ( testimonial ) experience .
Given this situation , it is vital for our ability to be knowers that we recognize that
the presence of identity prejudice in the collective social imagination is an endemic hazard in the ongoing training of testimonial sensibility . †
Fricker calls the means applied by one ’s testimonial sensibility to combat this hazard “ testimonial justice . ”
What is interesting to note about testimonial justice is that it is a “ hybrid ” virtue that is both intellectual and ethical , since
considered either as an intellectual virtue or as an ethical virtue [ testimonial justice ] contains the very same [ … ] motivation : to neutralize prejudice in one ’s credibility judgment . †
Even if one does not accept Fricker ’s argument for a Nussbaumean perceptual and emotional response to testimonial situations , nevertheless , we can see that if our ability to judge testimony is to function properly , we must be equipped with the ethical / epistemic ability to overcome our social and individual prejudices where they interfere with the operation of our testimonial sensibility .
​ Hermeneutic injustice
In addition to the problems with testimony , another form of epistemic injustice that Fricker points out is “ hermeneutic injustice , ” in which , “ a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences . ” †
In this case , there are basic problems in society which hamper the ability to know .
These problems go beyond even a basic “ distributive unfairness in respect of epistemic goods such as information and education ” † that we might admit as central to justice but consider only secondarily as a matter of epistemology .
In cases of hermeneutic injustice , ignorance becomes a form of power .
For example , before the term was coined , both the perpetrator of sexual harassment and its victim lacked knowledge of the concept and thus were subject to a certain kind of harm .
( In the case of the harasser , the lack of this knowledge is a cause of the harm of not fully developing ethically as one might ostensibly like . )
However , the harm caused by this ignorance falls disproportionately on the socially unempowered .
Accordingly , there may be systematic social forces in place that ensure that the ignorance is not remedied , since its existence benefits the powerful .
Even where such active forces do not exist , nevertheless , all things being equal , there will still be a passive force against the remedying of the ignorance , since the material resources that the marginalized have to bring to bear to the alleviation of the conceptual deficit are fewer than those possessed by the powerful .
Accordingly , in order for our stock of knowledge to be increased , it is incumbent upon those interacting with others who may be suffering from hermeneutic injustice to be “ reflexively aware of how the relation between his social identity and that of the speaker is impacting on the intelligibility to him of what she is saying how she is saying it ” † and accordingly “ to drop the presumption against acceptance , and also to assume some increased burden of seeking corroborating evidence . ” †
Such behavior is , like testimonial justice , a hybrid virtue directed both at being able to know more and being able to be just toward others .
​ Individual goodness
However , it might be objected that while ethical knowledge is needed to conduct inquiry , this does not mean that one must be an ethically good person to be a good knower .
To be sure , the relationship between ethical goodness and epistemic goodness is not one - to - one , since there are many cases of evil but knowledgeable people or good but ignorant people .
Sarah Hoagland in “ Resisting Rationality , ” for example , gives the example of anthropologist Caroline Bledsoe , who used her ability to listen sensitively to reports about the women of Gambia in order to learn that women there sometimes use birth control pills in order to increase their overall fertility and recommend to aid agencies more careful oversight in order to regulate the population growth of the region .
In effect , she was advocating withholding birth control for the women there , so that they would die in childbirth and thus have fewer children . †
In this case , it may seem that Bledsoe has become a good knower without becoming a good person .
However , in doing so , Bledsoe has betrayed the people of Gambia in a way that will undermine future relations with them , just as , to use an example of Scheman ’s , in the United States , the more people in the African - American community considered AIDS to have been an “ engineered microorganism ” because their trust was betrayed in the Tuskegee experiments of 1932 – 1972 .
Scheman interprets Hoagland ’s call for “ epistemological separatism ” as matter of broken trust and remarks ,
We may be barred from pursuing more objective knowledge so long as the conditions of trust are lacking — so long , that is , as some pieces of the perspectival puzzle cannot be added to dominant accounts without betraying those whose perspectives they are . †
Accordingly , though there may be cases like Dr. Mengele or Imperial Japan ’s Unit 731 where being evil allows one to learn otherwise unlearnable things , nevertheless , as a whole , such methods damage one ’s ability to be a knower , both for practical reasons ( such as that an unethical individual cannot effectively collaborate with others , as shown by Lysenkoism , and that being evil distracts one from the act of doing research , as shown by Mengele ) and for the theoretically fundamental reason that one ’s ability to be a justified knower relies on the trust of others .
As such , we cannot only think about knowing in terms ethical individuals , but we must also think about ethics of the political structures in which individuals interact and how those structures enhance or damage the justified attribution of trust .
​ A community of inquiry as a good community
In cases of testimonial injustice and hermeneutic injustice , one ’s ability to come to know cannot be exercised either because the person one is taking testimony from is oppressed ( as in the case of testimonial injustice ) or because one loses confidence in one ’s ability to be a knower ( as in the case where one repeatedly suffers a testimonial injustice ) or because one is oppressed ( as in the case of hermeneutic injustice ) .
What all of these cases point toward is the normative importance for epistemology of the existence of a certain kind of social atmosphere in which knowledge can be cultivated .
While Fricker does acknowledge the role of systemic forces in perpetrating epistemic injustices , she does not emphasize the need for social change in addition to personal virtues in order to redress some of these harms .
However , Helen Longino in The Fate of Knowledge , advocates “ contextual empiricism ” by pointing out that “ the practices which are generally accepted as yielding knowledge are social practices ” † as a step toward dissolving the dichotomy between the view of scientific acceptability as purely sociological or the view of science as purely corresponding to the world .
Accordingly , Longino criticizes those who separate the social and cognitive aspects of knowing and lays out four social norms for “ assur[ing ] the effectiveness of discursive interactions ” † : Adequate venues for criticism , adequate uptake of criticism by the community , public standards for discourse , and the ( tempered ) intellectual equality of the participants of the dialogue .
The goal of these norms is guaranteeing the ability of the community to create sociological pressures which over time help to keep scientific knowledge well anchored to the world .
Longino ’s project is , however , somewhat problematic , since her definition of “ knowledge as content ” requires that the content be “ epistemically acceptable ” in a particular community and her definition of “ epistemically acceptable ” requires that a community meet her normative criteria for discourse , † which would suggest that individuals who are not members of a scientific community cannot know ( or at the very least , the conditions of knowledge are not well met outside of “ modern ” civilizations ) .
This result , however , seems perverse , since even communities that do not match all of Longino ’s criteria can still be made up of individuals who possess valuable knowledge , so long as the social mechanisms for vouchsafing epistemic inquiry that the communities do have are conducive to the goals implicit in the lived values of the community , such that their justifications for the claim to knowledge are really able to function as trustworthy justifications .
Moreover , even if the conditions of knowledge are relaxed , so long as the definition of knowing involves some content being accepted by a particular community , there will be no way to alleviate hermeneutic injustice , since the powerful in any community will be resistant to the claims of the marginalized ( unless the society is already utopianly democratic ) .
While Longino tries to defuse the tension between the potential for hermeneutic injustice and the need for the justification of knowledge to be social by having the tempered equality of the community be a normative condition for inquiry , it is not clear given her disclaimers and caveats on the need for equality that her formulation is sufficiently clear as to force the central groups to acknowledge the ways in which they are compromising the ability of marginalized groups to trust their judgments .
Nevertheless , Longino ’s work does have value as a way of pointing out the importance of general social conditions to the promotion of what Sandra Harding has called “ strong objectivity . ”
While Longino criticizes Harding ’s position as advocating mere “ reflexivity ” and self - examination , † a more nuanced reading of Harding is very useful for directing our attention to the ways in which the scientific community does not identify ,
social concerns and interests shared by all ( or virtually all ) of the observers , nor does it encourage seeking out observers whose social beliefs vary in order to increase the effectiveness of the scientific method . †
Because science has heretofore failed in this way , it is especially crucial going forward that we strengthen our objectivity by , as Longino suggests , adopting social norms that tend to increase the usefulness of scientific inquiry and by , as Harding suggests , reflexively examining ourselves so that we do not unconsciously fit our inquiry to the demands of the socially powerful but endeavor to bring the unique knowledge and knowledge capacities of marginalized groups to the center of society where they can be broadly beneficial to society as a whole .
In order to undertake either of these projects then , we see that it is vitally necessary that we consider the ethical interaction of both ourselves and our research community in order to build robust procedures for objectivity .
As Scheman points out , we must minimally be able to trust those who are in authority to provide us accurate scientific results .
Without this trust , we cannot hope to build a scientific or social consensus .
However , if trust is a condition of inquiry , then a certain code of ethics must prevail in society , since it is clear that real trust is founded on the trustworthiness of the participants in an exchange .
Without bringing our ethical and political norms into play , we cannot see if our attributions of objectivity to a knower is properly warranted , since , not only does the claim of objective bring with it social power , the claim of objectivity moreover rests on the assumption of a certain productive arrangement of the social space such that individuals are sufficiently empowered to really test the impact of the claims they are making and sufficiently motivated to act in a manner worthy of the trust of their fellow members of society .
The only arrangement for a society that can hope to fulfill these requirements for objectivity is an ethical one .
Hence , ethical knowledge must have an impact on the practice epistemology through its recommendations for society as well as the individual .
This is also the reason why Longino lists “ uptake ” as one of her normative social criteria for an objective community . †
Another difficulty for Longino ’s project is that although she attempts to avoid the pluralist / monist debate in the metaphysics of knowledge , her account nevertheless assumes that the pursuit of science - like objectives is a goal held by all societies ( even if there might happen to be a variety of non-overlapping means to this end ) , and thus her criteria for objective knowledge production are normative for all societies .
However , as Heldke and Kellert write ,
objectivity involves an obligation to respond to members of “ the public ” when they issue challenges to the validity or usefulness of the inquiry being pursued . †
As Mary Tiles explains in “ A Science of Mars or of Venus ? ” an important shift that took place in the early modern period was a shift away from the “ disinterested ” pursuit of truth toward a Baconian view of knowledge as a means of control .†
However , even if we retain a Baconian view of science ( and we may choose not to ) , we are still entitled to question the relevance of the inquiry pursued by science , as for example in the case of the Davy lamp , which “ solved ” the problem of mine illumination while increasing the problem of mine explosions .†
Accordingly the “ usefulness of the inquiry being pursued ” is an entirely legitimate topic of negotiation within and among the many different communities of inquiry that make up a society .
Again , if better knowledge is more valuable knowledge , we need to ask in what ways it is more valuable .
To return to Scheman and Hoagland ’s example , from the perspective of the women of Gambia , it is not more valuable to reduce the fertility of sub-Saharan Africa than it is for the women there to survive childbirth .
Building a social framework in which Westerners and Gambian women can not only interact successfully but also justifiably trust one another then will depend on the mutual understanding of one another ’s different goals .
In other words , the pursuit of knowledge requires a society in which the members may rationally trust one another .
However , if the goals of Western science are held as sacrosanct commitments for our theory of knowledge , then individuals with other goals may not be able to rationally trust the claims with which they are presented .
As such , we may need to be willing to entertain other criteria besides those suggested by Longino if we find ourselves in a situation in which the goals of those on whom our claims will have an impact are different from conventional science .
By thinking about objectivity in terms of socially justifiable trust , we are able to see that a knowledge claim is a commitment to those who will be impacted by that claim , and it is this epistemic / ethical responsibility to others that gives what is held to be knowledge its normative force as something that should be accepted by all members of a community .
Accordingly , such claims must take into account the goals of the various members of that community , even where they are pluralistic .
​ Social role of the knower in epistemology
If knowledge gains its assent commanding normativity from the trustworthiness of members in a society to one another , then an understanding of who those members are and how their responsibilities to one another can be demonstrated will be important to the resolution to the difficulties left in Longino ’s account .
The role of the subject who knows cannot be omitted from epistemology without doing damage to its scope in practical applicability and its claim to normativity , since it is knowledge of the subject and the role of the subject in society that undergirds the sense of responsibility inherent in an assertion of knowledge .
Traditionally , the word “ objective ” has been synonymous with dispassionate or disinterested .
Such an objective perspective is one that all observers “ should ” take when confronted with evidence .
Nevertheless , careful studies of the purportedly objective pursuit of knowledge by scientists often turn up hidden biases that corrupt their findings .
However , as Tiles points out , even if it were the case that such a view from nowhere were realistically achievable , “ [ a ] bsence of values is not a precondition of objectivity , ” † or for that matter , a guarantor .
To say that a particular way of looking at the world is the single objective way of looking at the world is an attempt to force others to judge the claims by the knower from that perspective .
However , while such claims may be epistemically acceptable within the particular community that feels it has grasped the neutral perspective , if the political aims of that community are hostile or otherwise suspect , not only will members of other communities be wary of such claims , they should be wary about such claims , since their source is not trustworthy .
Solving these difficulties with the traditional notion of objectivity requires acknowledging that the knowing self is a socially - located , embodied self .
This means that we must consider the subject as a knower who exists in a certain socially located perspective and as an embodied being with preexisting relationships to other members of a society .
However it is not always the case that there is a healthy social relationship between the one making a claim and others on whom the claim will have an impact .
Hence , if claims to knowledge are to be cross-culturally normative or normative even for different groups within a single culture that resist the claim , there must be a way of bridging the space between these groups that does not violate their claim to autonomy , since such a violation would entail a lack of responsiveness and responsibility to those on who the knowledge claim is imposed .
Accordingly , in order to make our commitments to those who are impacted by our claims more robust , what is needed is not the depersonalized , dispassionate , and detached perspective advocated by traditional positivists , nor a homogenizing view that claims to blend all perspectives into a single grand synthesis ( since the synthesis cannot be trusted by those who cling to their unsynthesized perspectives ) , but a perspective that acknowledges its own partiality and interdependence on other views , which is mediated by an ethical understanding of our position toward others in society .
In other words , we must be able to apply the “ Copper Rule ” : “ Do unto others what they would have us do unto them . ” †
Regardless of whether metaphysical realism is correct or incorrect , objectivity in actual practice always rests on a subjective capacity for putting oneself in the shoes of others in order to find an inter-subjective perspective .
Accordingly , an objective claim must rest not only on the facts about the world ( though these are important , since without them our claims will not be of use to others as they will be contradicted by experience ) but also on an understanding of to whom we are speaking and why we think they should listen to us .
An attempt to cultivate knowledge without regard for cultural and ethical values will fail for several reasons , not the least of which are the impossibility of the task and the literal “ worthlessness ” of the goal .
Since all perspectives are views from somewhere , what is needed is a view that is able to take on the perspectives of others responsively to create a strong objectivity .
One way of creating such bridges between persons is given by María Lugones in “ Playfulness , ‘ World ’ - Traveling , and Loving Perception . ”
In it , Lugones describes how her own relationship to her mother was damaged by what she calls “ arrogant perception . ”
Because she internalized a particularly objectifying way of looking at her mother , Lugones , “ saw her as logically independent from me , ” † and this damaged her ability to see things from her mother ’s point of view , which negatively affected their relationship .
To overcome this mode of perception , it was necessary for her to recognize how her own perception of herself changed when she entered into different social “ worlds , ” and then utilize that ability to recognize the change in herself as a way of generating empathy for other as a form of love :
To love my mother was not possible for me while I retained a sense that it was fine for me and others to see her arrogantly .
Loving my mother also required that I see with her eyes , that I go into my mother ’s world , that I see both of us as we are constructed in her world , that I witness her own sense of herself from within her world .
Only through this traveling to her “ world ” could I identify with her because only then could I cease to ignore her and to be excluded and separate from her .
Only then could I see her as a subject even if one subjected and only then could I see how meaning could arise fully between us .
We are fully dependent on each other for the possibility of being understood and without this understanding , we do not make sense , we are not solid , visible , integrated ; we are lacking .
So traveling to each other ’s “ worlds ” would enable us to be through loving each other . †
What Lugones came to recognize through world - traveling was that just as she formerly believed her mother to be unnecessary to her , as a Hispanic women in an Anglo society , “ Their world and their integrity did not require me at all . ” †
Or at least , this was the self - perception of the society .
In reality however , all of us are profoundly dependent on others for our own self - indentities , and even when she is in a society that marginalizes her , she is still a part of that society .
By utilizing her social location as a woman in the margin of society who was also required to see herself as she was seen from the center , Lugones turned her socially disadvantageous position into a epistemically advantageous standpoint and gained an empathic ability that served to heighten her general epistemic abilities .
One major difficulty for creating an epistemology for a pluralistic and multi-cultural society is that , as explained above , knowledge claims are normative demands on others , but since others may not share our viewpoint , these claims have the potential to be injurious to them .
What Lugones ’ description of playful world - traveling offers is a way to think about the normativity of knowledge statements that does not rely on the arrogant claim that , as a member of a certain social group , one is in a position to judge the claims of those in other social groups without therefore collapsing into a non-judgmental relativism .
What is needed is a way of recognizing how our self - perceptions can shift in different contexts that will allow us to lovingly enter into the perspectives of others without therefore claiming the prerogative of dismissing their knowledge claims out of hand .
It is only by taking seriously the claims of others that we can hope to expand the horizons of our own understanding and make our own sense of objectivity truly robust .
The issue of epistemic relativism is parallel to the issue of moral relativism discussed by Fricker , who explains that ,
we are entitled to appeal to thought which they could have had , given their full ethical resources , but failed to . [ … ]
To judge [… ] others in this way is not hubris , for we can acknowledge that “ could do better ” will be our own ethical epitaph too … †
In the same way , when we put a knowledge claim before others , what we should be doing is offering to them something that we could have accepted as knowledge had we been presented with the claim when in their position .
It is only when a society is composed of members who are mutually able to practice such deferential understanding that it is maximally able to provide a well - grounded justifications for its knowledge claims .
The perspective of world - traveling also helps to mitigate the problem of hermeneutic injustice .
In cases of hermeneutic injustice , individuals lose their ability to understand the causes of their suffering due to systematic pressures that help prevent the formation of concepts that would help alleviate the injustice .
Since the problem in this case is ignorance , it is not enough merely to ask those who are suffering to explain their situation , since that ability has been stripped from them .
Even if such knowledge were formulated , since it would not be “ epistemically acceptable ” to the community , under Longino ’s standard , it might be rejected in spite of its great explanatory value for members of marginalized groups .†
However , by adopting the standpoint of others in beginning our mutual inquiry , we may be better able to receive the new concepts that would eliminate the injustice when they are proposed .
As Harding explains , what is done by a method like world - traveling in which deference is practiced by more socially powerful members of society toward more marginalized members of society is the provision of an avenue for knowing that does not presume to take away the epistemic autonomy of others and thus betray one ’s responsibility to them :
Far from licensing European - Americans to appropriate African - American thought or men to appropriate women ’s thought , this approach challenges members of dominant groups to make themselves “ fit ” to engage in collaborative , democratic , community enterprises with marginal peoples .
Such a project requires learning to listen attentively [ …] educating oneself [… ] putting one ’s body on the line for “ their ” causes until they feel like “ our ” causes [ … ] critical examination of dominant institutional beliefs and practices [ …] critical self - examination [ … ].†
Hence , to be truly “ fit ” to know , we must be thoroughly aware of ourselves as epistemic actors with an ethical responsibility for the trustworthiness of the claims that we make and an awareness of how those claims should appear to others .
​ Objections and practical considerations
In this essay , I have shown that epistemology does derive an ought ( “ ought to believe ” ) from an is ( “ p is justified and true ” ) .
Accordingly , epistemology brings with it some of the ethical concerns that are concomitant with other normative fields .
The practice of epistemology has an impact on the lives of others , hence it must be practiced carefully , so as to keep from doing injustice to them .
At the same time , the applied practice of epistemology requires a community of others in which our claims to knowledge are justified and found to be reliable .
Accordingly , our societies must be structured in an ethical way so as to encourage an awareness of the responsibility to others that is inherent in a knowledge claim .
Doing this requires a social commitment to the ethical requirement of seeing oneself from the perspective of others and being aware of the ways that social power and identity can affect our claims .
As a result , the ethics of trust must pervade our epistemology .
One possible objection to this proposal is a variant of the Meno problem : if we must be ethical to be good knowers , and we must know what is good in order to be ethical , how are we to achieve either goal ?
One answer to this problem is that as socially situated beings , we are not , like Descartes ’ res cogitans , required to work out our values from scratch , but may iteratively refine our understanding beginning with the ethical and epistemic values we already possess .
However , even if this somewhat anti-foundationalist approach is rejected , the position presented here can be defended on the grounds that it is no more circular than the problem of epistemology already is in general .
Foundationalist accounts already need to explain away the circularities involved in learning about learning .
The burden added by requiring that the origin of ethical knowledge also be explained at the same time is not too steep given the other considerations that push us into having to accept that an ethical outlook is an important part of epistemology .
In this paper , I have not emphasized the role that the physical world plays in grounding our truth claims , but only for lack of time and space , not for lack of importance .
Similarly , any epistemological project attempting to import other values into epistemology besides the traditional ones is of course subject to the accusation of potential Lysenkoism or relativism , but I feel that the charges are inapt here .
In the case of Lysenkoism , it is clear that the Lysenkoist policies were promulgated not out of regard for their genuine acceptability to others ( and especially socially marginalized others ) , but rather out of regard for their apparent acceptability to Stalin and other socially powerful members of Soviet society .
Thus , the recommendations here are in no way amenable to Lysenkoism as it existed in the Soviet Union .
Now , it might be countered that an excess of concern for “ PC ” or a valorization of “ victimhood ” might lead to a cult of victimhood in which certain communities gain dominance in society by proclaiming that they are dominated .
Certainly , this is a possibility .
Indeed , part of the Soviet strategy was for those in power to claim that they were only wielding their power on behalf of the downtrodden proletariat .
However , in this case , an objective ( i.e. , mutually deferential and responsible ) look at the situation would reveal that the Soviet authorities did in fact exert enormous social control over others , and thus they needed to be especially deferential toward others , which they were not .
This leads into the issue of relativism .
For the feminist authors that this paper is relying on for background ( and for myself ) , it is important to be able to assert truthfully that women have suffered because of sexism .
Accordingly , the position that “ sexism is real for me but not for you ” is entirely unacceptable .
Deferring to others does not always mean agreeing with others .
In the case of hermeneutic injustice , in fact , it is very important to be able to articulate something that society as a whole may not be able to understand yet .
However , when we make claims like these , we must make them with an understanding of why the claim should be considered justified even from the perspective of someone with a different perspective and values .
Hence , the project presented here is not about relativizing knowledge but thinking about ourselves reflexively and ethically in order to create claims that are not only acceptable to ourselves ( which would merely be belief ) but robustly trustworthy for others ( which is at the heart of justifiability ) and so , we may hope , true .
​ Works cited
America , you actually did it !
Oh , have no doubt - we will be having a little chat about Arizona Proposition 102 , Arkansas Initiative 1 , California Proposition 8 , and Florida Amendment 2 .
But for right now , it 's nice to bask in the landslide victory you delivered to President - elect Barack Obama , who at this writing has 349 Electoral College votes ( to John McCain 's 162 ) , with 270 required for victory .
Obama also won a clear majority of the popular vote - 62.5 million to McCain 's 55.5 million - in an election in which some 14 million more Americans voted than in 2004 - 64 percent of eligible voters , the highest turnout in over four decades .
Indeed , this seems to be how Obama won : not so much by converting voters from the Republic Party ( though so - called " Obama Republicans " were also a factor ) but moreso by convincing many non-voters to become engaged .
Voters in many precincts stood in line for hours to cast their ballots .
That may be the real legacy of his victory and his presidency : after eight years with George W. Bush in charge , Obama is on his way to restoring the idea that the US government is not inherently corrupt and incompetent .
Electing an Intellectual
Most of the commentators I 've read have focused on the remarkable fact that American voters elected a black president , marking a tremendous milestone on the long march to racial equality and reconciliation .
But this election also marked another milestone : after eight years of a President who defined himself through folksy populism , faith - based policy and virulent anti-intellectualism , American voters elected an openly smart candidate .
Obama is a former activist who worked for three years as the director of the Developing Communities Project in Chicago ; a magna cum laude Harvard Law School graduate and editor - in - chief of the Harvard Law Review ; an academic who taught Constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School ; and an intellectual who ran an election campaign based principally on policy , not wedge issues and personal attacks .
Over his campaign , he demonstrated an invigorating willingness to talk to Americans like they 're grownups .
From his inspiring speech after the Iowa Caucus victory back in January to his insightful " A More Perfect Union " lecture in response to the Jeremiah Wright controversy to his calm performances during the presidential debates , Obama never tried to hide his intellect .
John McCain 's campaign centred on Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt ( FUD ) over who Obama might be ( a Muslim ?
a terrorist ?
a socialist ? ) and what Obama might do if elected .
Obama 's campaign , by contrast , was primarily about what Obama would do if elected .
Charisma Plus
Granted , Obama 's campaign has also traded heavily on his charisma : his easy manner in public speeches , press conferences and one - on - one meetings alike , his cool ability to think on his feet , his message of change , and his rhetorical and literal inclusion of his supporters in " owning a piece " of the movement through a truly impressive outreach campaign that drew two million volunteers ( he was , after all , a community organizer before he was a presidential contender ) .
Yet if he had only charisma and nothing else , his campaign would have been a hot air balloon that would have deflated under the onslaught of the past several months .
Despite the regular criticism from the right that his campaign lacked substance , Obama progressed smoothly from " Yes We Can " and " Change We Can Believe In " to a detailed presentation of his policies .
From his mildly progressive tax plan ( reversing the Bush tax cuts to the rich and giving tax cuts to the middle class ) to his obligatory Tough foreign policy ( he 's not opposed to war but to needless and distracting wars against the wrong enemy ) and even his sensible ideas about science and technology , Obama leverages his pragmatic disposition with a refreshingly evidence - based analysis of what needs to be done after years of faith - based malarkey .
A Moderate Conservative
Just so we 're clear : Obama is not a revolutionary , or a radical , or a socialist , or even particularly progressive by international standards .
He 's a moderate conservative ( small c ) with good instincts , a penetrating intellect and the sense to surround himself with smart , pragmatic , competent advisors .
After the eight - year train wreck that was the Bush presidency - starting with the epic failure to respond to warnings about an impending terrorist attack , peaking with the appalling mismanagement of the Hurricane Katrina evacuation and culminating with the drearily predictable finance crisis and the wholesale pillaging of the Treasury as Bush and his cabinet prepare to clear out - a merely competent government may seem transformative by comparison , especially to a whole generation of Americans who has grown up with the idea that governments can't do anything right .
Orwell famously stated , " In a time of universal deceit , telling the truth is a revolutionary act . "
Americans find themselves in a time of universal malfeasance and cronyism , and on Tuesday they committed the revolutionary act of choosing a capable leader who promises not to strangle their government but to make it work properly for them again .

The great thing about your children learning to read is that they start reading everything they can get their hands on .
That 's also the unfortunate thing , as any parent with inquisitive kids learns eventually .
" Mommy , Daddy : What 's this for ? " my ( seven - year - old ) son asked , all innocence .
We were in Target , and my wife and I were chatting with a friend for a minute while the kids waited .
We had n't stopped near anything too unusual ... I 'd thought .
" What 's what for , bud ? "
I asked , turning from my friend to see what my son was looking at .
Oh , no .
Why the heck did they put that next to the endcap ?
" It 's called ' Yours & Mine , ' " he said , and I could see he was about to read more .
I quickly glanced at my wife , who was glancing at me .
Take evasive action , I said with my eyes , since she was closer to where he was standing .
She gently turned him away as I spoke .
" That 's for grownups only , " I said , trying to keep my voice even .
" Why ? "
" It just is , " my wife responded .
" You know that some things are n't for kids , and that 's one of them . "
" But I want to know why , " he said , whining a little .
I sighed inwardly .
We keep telling him that it 's good to ask questions , to be curious about things .
But there was no way to tell him the truth right then , right there in the middle of Target , even if we 'd wanted to .
So I did it — I used the phrase I absolutely hate to say to my kids .
" You 'll understand it when you 're older . "
He 'd heard us say that before , and did n't press the issue any more .
We quickly moved away from the endcap in question , and that was that .
Thankfully , he has n't brought it up again , and of course we 'll take better care in the store from now on .
I 've written about unusual questions from my kids before , but those were different , because it was n't that we did n't want to answer them , just that we were n't prepared to do so to kids so young .
My kids are seven and ( just about ) six , and while my wife and I believe in teaching about sex early , that 's too soon for us .
And even with the sex talk , I think pleasure - enhancing lubricants really do n't need to be a subject we discuss with the kids .
Ever .
So , what are your strategies for avoiding answering the questions you do n't want to answer , whether they 're something you expect to answer when they 're older or something you never , ever want to talk to your children about for the rest of your life ?
PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - With a hearty “ All Aboard , ” Phoenix launched a sleek new $ 1.4 billion light - rail system on Saturday amid uncertainty people will hop out of their cars and onto the train .
About 75 people became the first riders of the 20 - mile ( 32 - km ) system that snakes through a sprawling desert metropolitan area that includes the cities of Tempe and Mesa .
Planners project building 30 additional miles of light - rail lines by 2025 , but it has yet to be determined if the area ’s love of cars will trump trains .
“ The novelty is going to wear off and you ’ll see whether it catches on or not , ” said Sam Mazzeo , 50 , a mortgage broker who was at a downtown Phoenix light - rail station .
“ People use mass transit in other cities .
You know , gas is not going to stay cheap forever . ”
Critics question whether enough people will be willing to switch from air - conditioned cars and trucks to the light - rail system where they will have to sweat out summertime waits at train stations .
The average high temperature for Phoenix in July is 106 F ( 41 C ) .
Phoenix had been the largest U.S. city without a public rail transit system .
The fifth - most populous U.S. city has about 1.6 million people , with more than 4 million in the Phoenix - Tempe - Mesa area .
Phoenix ’s old trolley system shut down 60 years ago .
The economic crisis should encourage ridership , said Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon .
“ Everybody realizes that the days of three - or four - car families are a thing of the past , ” Gordon told Reuters .
“ We can no longer afford to do that . ”
Gordon said commuting by train was cheaper than car travel , reduced traffic congestion and helped cut auto emissions , which are linked to global warming .
Rides will be free until Thursday , the first day of 2009 , when they will cost $ 1.25 .
A day pass will cost $ 2.50 .
Metro officials expect 26,000 boardings a day in 2009 .
Other Western U.S. cities that built train systems in the past two decades include Dallas , Denver , Houston and Salt Lake City , Utah .
Plans for the system were first envisioned in the 1980s , but voters rejected several ballot measures before finally approving a sales tax to help finance light rail .
Federal funds paid roughly half the cost .

CODEWEAVERS ' SOFTWARE FREE FOR DOWNLOAD THANKS TO GEORGE W. BUSH AND FALLING GAS PRICES
Giveaway Triggered in CodeWeavers ' Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge ; " We take full responsibility for global economic collapse , " says CEO
SAINT PAUL , Minn . ( October 27 , 2008 ) –
The catastrophic cratering of the global economy , falling gas prices and President George W. Bush 's recent executive activities have indirectly prompted Saint Paul gadfly software developers CodeWeavers , Inc. , to provide free software for every American on Oct. 28 , company officials reluctantly announced today .
In July , CodeWeavers – whose software lets Mac OS X and Linux users run Windows programs without having to Microsoft for a Windows OS license – launched the Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge ( lameduck.codeweavers.com ) to encourage President Bush to make the most of his remaining days in office by accomplishing a major economic or political goal by January 20 , 2009 .
The goals focused on President Bush making specific positive accomplishments in areas such as the economy , home values , the stock market , the war on terror and other key issues .
Specifically , one goal called for President Bush to help down bring average gasoline prices in the Twin Cities to $ 2.79 a gallon .
On Monday , Oct. 14 , gas prices in Minneapolis and St. Paul did just that .
" That morning , I was filling my tank at Big Steve 's Gas Palace in St. Paul , " said Jeremy White , president and CEO of CodeWeavers .
" I had just finished my morning corn dog and 64 - ounce Dr. Pepper when I looked at the pump and noticed gas was at $ 2.79 .
I screamed ‘ Woohoo , ' then I yelled ‘ Oh , crap ! ' as I realized every American can now have my software for free .
Kind of upsets my fourth quarter revenue projections ... "
White admits this is not how he foresaw the Challenge unfolding .
" I launched the campaign to inspire President Bush to make the most of his final days in office .
Who knew that our Challenge would have this kind of impact on the country ? "
White said .
" On the other hand , who knew that the economy would implode , causing oil demand to drop into the abyss and gas prices to plummet as well .
Clearly , investigating Bear Stearns , AIG and those guys is misplaced – CodeWeavers is responsible for this mess .
So it 's free software for all ! "
How to Get the Free Software
On Tuesday , Oct. 28 , 2008 , any one visiting the CodeWeavers ' Web site ( www.codeweavers.com) will be given a deal code that will entitle them to one free copy of CodeWeavers ' award - winning CrossOver software .
Each copy comes complete with support .
" I realize that by giving away all my software , I 've caused horrific damage to my company 's bottom line , " White said .
" In fact , our vice president of sales wretched Starbucks all over his shirt when he learned the news .
But , I figure , the way the economy is going , in a few months everyone might be out on the streets , wearing potato sacks and standing in line for squirrel soup , so why not ? "
White also noted that if other Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge goals are met , CodeWeavers will once again provide free software .
Goals include :
Return the stock market to it 's 2008 high
Reduce the average price of a gallon of milk to $ 3.50
Create at least one net job in the U.S. this calendar year
Return the median home price to its Jan. 1 , 2008 level
Bring Osama Bin-Laden to justice

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) -
The chance to be the caretaker of a tiny tropical island in Australia has sparked so much interest around the world that a rush of applications crashed the website advertising the post .
The job , which offers a salary of $ 105,000 to spend six months on the Great Barrier Reef island of Hamilton , has been inundated with hundreds of thousands of prospective candidates .
An official from the state of Queensland , which is offering the position , said the job was created as an antidote to the global economic slump and was being advertised in 18 countries including the United States and China .
Local media said technicians had to restore the website ( www.islandreefjob.com) after it could not cope with the volume of interest and crashed for several hours .
Some sections are still not up and running .
Duties for the so - called “ best job in the world ” include feeding ocean fish , cleaning a pool and collecting deliveries of mail that arrive by plane .
The successful candidate will have to go scuba diving , snorkeling and hiking and enjoy at least 25 nearby island resorts .
Thrown in is a luxury three - bedroom home and transportation to and from the island .
No skills , nor experience is needed , and there is no age requirement .
The job starts in July .

I hate to bring this up right now when the ink is barely dry on your New Year ’s resolution .
But if history is any guide , you are likely to fall off the assorted wagons to which you are currently lashed .
I do n’t say this to disparage your willpower .
Hang onto that celery stick for dear life .
And even if you stop doing those stomach crunches and start sneaking out for a smoke , at least you can comfort yourself with fond memories of your moment of resolution .
Compare that to the statistic in the newest research about teens who pledge sexual abstinence .
The majority not only break the pledge , they forget they ever made it .
This study of teens and pledges comes from Johns Hopkins researcher Janet Rosenbaum , who took a rigorous look at nearly 1,000 students .
She compared teens who took a pledge of abstinence with teens of similar backgrounds and beliefs who did n’t .
She found absolutely no difference in their sexual behavior , or the age at which they began having sex , or the number of their partners .
In fact , the only difference — aside from apparent memory impairment — was that the group that promised to remain abstinent was significantly less likely to use birth control , especially condoms , when they did have sex .
The lesson many students seemed to retain from their abstinence - only program was a negative and inaccurate view of contraception .
This is not just a primer on the capacity for teenage denial or the inner workings of adolescent neurobiology .
What makes this study important is simply this : “ Virginity pledges ” are one of the ways that government officials measure whether abstinence - only education is “ working . ”
They count the pledges as proof that teens will abstain .
It turns out that this is like counting New Year ’s resolutions as proof that you lost 10 pounds .
We have been here before .
And before that .
And before that .
When he was running for president , George W. Bush promised , “ My administration will elevate abstinence education from an afterthought to an urgent goal . ”
Over the last eight years , a cottage industry of “ abstinence - only - until - marriage ” purveyors became a McMansion industry .
Funding increased from $ 73 million a year in 2001 to $ 204 million in 2008 .
That ’s a grand total of $ 1.5 billion in federal money for an ideology in search of a methodology .
And half the states refused funds to pay for sex miseducation .
By now , there ’s an archive of research showing that the binge was a bust .
Programs mandated to teach only “ the social , psychological and health gains ( of ) abstaining from sexual activity ” and to warn of the dangers of having sex have been awarded failing grades for truth and effectiveness .
As Rosenbaum says , “ Abstinence - only education is required to give inaccurate information .
Teens are savvy consumers of information and know what they are getting . ”
Our national investment in abstinence - only may not be a scam on the scale of Bernie Madoff .
But this industry has had standards for truth as loose as some mortgage lenders .
It manufactures a product as ill suited to the environment as the SUV .
All in all , abstinence - only education has become emblematic of the rule of ideology over science .
The sorry part is that sex education got caught in the culture wars .
It ’s been framed , says Bill Albert of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , as a battle between “ those who wanted virginity pledges and those who wanted to hand out condoms to 14 - year - olds . ”
Meanwhile , six in 10 teens have sex before they leave high school and 730,000 teenage girls will get pregnant this year .
We see them everywhere from “ Juno ” to Juneau — or to be more accurate , Anchorage , where Sarah Palin , advocate of abstinence - only education just became an unplanned grandparent .
What the overwhelming majority of protective parents actually want is not a political battle .
They want teens to delay sex and to have honest information about sexuality , including contraception .
The programs that work best combine those lessons .
Soon Congress and the new administration will be asked to ante up again for abstinence - only programs .
As Cecile Richards of Planned Parenthood says , abstinence - only education was “ an experiment gone awry .
We spent $ 1.5 billion and ca n’t point to a single study that says this helps .
If it does n’t help , why fund it ? ”
Teens are not the only masters of denial .
But we are finally stepping back from the culture wars .
We are , with luck , returning to something that used to be redundant — evidence - based science .
That ’s a pledge worth signing … and remembering .

It most definitely was not in the script – an item posted on the internet showing Barack Obama 's top wordsmith being less than respectful of Hillary Clinton , whose nomination as Secretary of State was supposed to show that all was forgiven between the arch rivals of the Democratic primaries .
The trouble arose yesterday afternoon when some photos briefly appeared on the social networking site Facebook , showing Jon Favreau , the president - elect 's boy - wonder chief speech writer , dancing at a party with a lifesize cut - out of the soon - to - be chief diplomat of the US .
In another picture , the 27 - year - old Favreau ( credited with inventing the ' Yes We Can ' slogan that became Mr Obama 's rhetorical trademark ) is seen placing his hand on Ms Clinton 's cardboard chest , while a friend is pressing a beer to the lips of the former first lady and outgoing New York Senator .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But what the internet giveth , it can instantly take away .
According to the popular ' The Loop ' column of the Washington Post , which first reported the incident , the pictures were taken down in a couple of hours .
All that remains on the site is an utterly unexceptionable profile shot of Mr Favreau .
Just in case however , the speechwriter moved with alacrity to repair any damage .
According to an Obama transition official , Mr Favreau " had reached out to Senator Clinton to offer an apology . "
But the the lady herself does not seem bothered in the least .
" Senator Clinton is pleased to learn of Jon 's obvious interest in the State Department , " Philippe Reines , a Clinton spokesman , noted in an email to ' The Loop , " and is currently reviewing his application . "
One mystery however is unresolved .
Precisely how will Mr Favreau respond to the questions on the elaborate vetting form to be completed by people seeking jobs in the new administration , that demands details of websites that featured them – and whether they had done anything " that could be a possible source of embarrassment to you …or the president - elect ? "

A journey through a thawing region with Scott G. Borgerson and his colleague Michael A. Levi A journey through a thawing region with Scott G. Borgerson and his colleague Michael A. Levi
BEFORE OUR EYES , the Arctic is changing from an impenetrable wasteland into an oceanic crossroads .
The polar ice cap has lost up to half its thickness near the North Pole in just the past six years and may have passed a tipping point ; it is now shrinking at more than three times the rate predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change only four years ago .
At the current pace , the Arctic may well be ice - free in summer by 2013 .
The opening of a new waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans is akin in historic significance to the opening of the Suez Canal , in 1869 , or is Panamanian cousin , in 1914 .
With this sea change will come the rise and fall of international seaports , newfound access to nearly a quarter of the world 's remaining undiscovered oil and gas reserves , and a recalibration of geo-strategic power .

Did Canada 's commercial press help the Harper government cling to power last week ?
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
From Halifax to Victoria , most mainstream newspapers declared the country was in a political crisis , attacked any suggestion that a " leftish " coalition government was legitimate or useful , and concluded that Stephen Harper , despite his serious missteps , was still the right man for the job .
The Asper - owned Canwest papers in particular pulled out all the stops to ensure the party they endorsed in the election would stay in office .
A ' crisis ' triggered
Three weeks after the Oct. 14 election , the Liberals , New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois signed an agreement to form a coalition government .
That did n't provoke much media attention since Harper was still running the show .
The coalition faded from the news pages until Nov. 27 , when Harper and Finance Minister Jim Flaherty issued their fall economic update to the House of Commons .
It was n't much of an update , but did propose cutting spending by over $ 5 billion and selling off government assets .
It also included a provision to axe the Elections Canada annual subsidy of $ 1.95 per vote received by political parties .
It proposed a ban on strikes by federal government workers for two years and cut pay equity by discontinuing payment for litigation before the Human Rights Commission .
All four moves would be wildly applauded by Harper 's right - wing base .
But the update excluded measures to stimulate the economy , an initiative being taken by governments in most developed nations .
The opposition parties vowed to vote against the fiscal update , not because they would lose significant funding , they claimed , but because they saw no plan to spur economic growth or help Canadians who are losing their jobs because of the economic downturn .
It would be a vote of confidence ; the government would be defeated and have to resign .
But that would not be a problem , since the opposition parties had signed a power - sharing agreement and could take over the reins of government in a smooth transition of power without the need for an election .
That 's at least how the opposition parties saw the situation .
Many in the media saw it differently and seized their opportunity .
During the weeks between the election and Harper 's economic report , newspapers were filled with stories about the " global credit crisis , " the " economic crisis , " the " global financial crisis , " with a rare mention of a constitutional or political one .
But the day after Harper 's update , " political crisis " and " constitutional crisis " began appearing in newspapers with increasing frequency , eventually crowding out the economic story .
A Globe and Mail editorial that morning declared that " through gratuitous partisanship , [ the Conservatives ] have turned an economic crisis into a political one . "
Elizabeth Thompson , writing in the Montreal Gazette , proclaimed that " little more than a month after a general election , Canada is teetering on the brink of a political crisis after leaders of all three opposition parties vowed to oppose the government 's fiscal update tabled yesterday . "
Blaming the coalition
Harper backed off and postponed for a week a vote on his report , but the constitutional crisis frame took on a life of its own .
The Liberal - supporting Toronto Star tried to turn attention back to the real crisis .
" If the political crisis has been averted for a week or more , it buys time for Harper and his cabinet to turn their attention to what really matters to Canadians the economic crisis . "
But if the economic crisis did really matter to Canadians there was little room for discussion in the pages of Canada 's commercial press over the next week .
By then , thanks to the work of a hastily reconvened Tory war room and conservative columnists and editorialists at Canwest newspapers and the Globe and Mail , the reason for the crisis was shifted from Harper to the coalition .
The National Post did n't mask its contempt .
A Post editorial judged the coalition to be guilty of " ugly opportunism . "
It was engaged in a reckless gambit led by Bob Rae , the " Trotsky " of a " depraved , " desperate , unprincipled movement .
Fearing increased taxation , Lorne Gunter wrote in the Post he was putting his silverware , his wife 's jewellery , his dad 's old stamp collection and his nice watch in a box and handing them over to the coalition of left - leaning Liberals from Williamsistan ( formerly Newfoundland and Labrador ) , Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver , and the faculty - club socialists of the NDP , supported by the big - government separatists and cheered on by public sector unions and autoworkers .
Ottawa Citizen columnist Randall Denley told Canadian taxpayers they were " entitled to a primal scream . "
Why ?
Because " three of the least credible men in Canadian politics " were " about to seize control " of our government in a virtual coup that is perfectly legal , and perfectly wrong . "
An Edmonton Journal editorial intoned that " Installing a coalition ... would be an insult we cannot tolerate , even for a few months . "
It is a move typical of " emerging or deeply troubled states " not " the stable , sensible success story that is Canada . "
Sun : ' Parliament in crisis '
By Dec. 3 , a political crisis caused by the coalition was the new reality in the media , moving from the opinion pages to the news pages .
The press panic reached its apogee with the Vancouver Sun 's 72 - point screaming headline , " Parliament in crisis . "
Sun columnist Barbara Yaffe's front - page piece reported that all parties to the melodrama were searching for a way to defuse the political crisis .
" And a crisis it is , " she maintained , but her evidence was thin .
Rallies were being held across the country , hotlines were humming , and Harper was reviewing his options , most likely asking the Governor General to prorogue Parliament .
Some crisis .
That morning Governor General Michaëlle Jean agreed to prorogue Parliament .
The next day Canwest Global released a poll indicating the majority of Canadians were supporting her decision .
Fear and hostility to the coalition were the main themes and these were plastered on the front page of nearly every Canwest paper across the country .
" Coalition no , election yes " ( Vancouver Sun ) , " Nation in fear , poll finds " ( Montreal Gazette ) , " Political crisis spooks public " ( Edmonton Journal ) , " Canadians ' scared : ' political crisis in Ottawa , " ( Calgary Herald ) , " 60 % back Tory hold on power , poll finds ; Ipsos Reid : Majority ' truly scared for the future of the country " ( National Post ) .
The Ipsos Reid poll 's wording is interesting .
Question 6 , for instance , began as follows : " Some people say that ... Stephen Harper and the Conservatives should fight and do everything they can legally to continue governing because of the severe economic situation the country faces and the fact that the Liberals and the NDP have entered into an ' unholy ' deal with the Bloc Separatists . "
Respondents need to be wary of any polling question that begins with " some people say . "
It can build bias into results as it seems to be simply reflecting public opinion in asking for a response to a question .
" Some people say … "
Who are these people ?
Might they be the executives who commissioned the poll ?
The Ipsos - Reid question then continues : " Other people say that ... it is proper that a smooth transition of power to the Coalition take place if it is apparent the government will be defeated and that the economic policies brought forward by the Coalition , and the agreement of support and stability from the separatist Bloc Quebecois , will be good for the country . "
We do n't know who these people are either .
It is difficult to imagine , given that coalition supporters would n't claim support from the " separatist " Bloc Quebecois .
Progressive might be a more accurate word .
" Which is closer to your own point of view ? " Ipsos Reid then asks .
Given the seemingly distorted framing of the question , it might seem a miracle that anyone outside Quebec opted for the second choice .
But 46 per cent of Atlantic Canadians , 35 per cent of respondents in British Columbia and 32 per cent of Ontarians supported a smooth transition of power to the coalition .
Polling , a matter of angle
What do polls like these really tell us ?
The Canwest survey was followed by one for Wal - Mart Canada .
Ipsos Reid discovered that 43 per cent of Canadians planned to shop more at Wal - Mart this Christmas than they did last year .
Conclusion : more people support Harper than plan to shop more at Wal - Mart .
Instead of measuring what people think about the Canadian political system , Canwest should ask questions about what people know .
They might find that many opinions are based on a lack of knowledge about how the Canadian political system really works .
And they should consider that this ignorance may be based on biased and distorted reporting in their papers .
Was there really a political crisis as Barbara Yaffe and others claimed ?
Or was it little more than a media fabrication ?
Webster 's New Collegiate Dictionary defines crisis as " an unstable or crucial time or state of affairs whose outcome will make a decisive difference for better or worse . "
A media system that reflected the views of the 62 per cent of Canadians who did n't vote for Harper would have framed the situation , not as a crisis , but as a simple transfer of power from an unstable minority government to a more stable -- because it controlled a majority of parliamentary seats -- coalition government .
Stopping the left
In the end , the media - generated crisis was not about the Constitution or the viability of the Canadian political system .
It was about the possibility of a centre - left government .
This could not be allowed to happen .
With the restoration of Harper and the ascension of the centre - right Michael Ignatieff to the Liberal leadership , Canadian politics returned to their traditional territory with Harper on the right and Ignatieff on the centre - right .
Even the Globe and Mail 's Margaret Wente applauded the Ignatieff takeover .
Harper was quick to show his appreciation for the Asper support in keeping him in power .
His office let it be known he would be visiting Winnipeg -- the Aspers ' home town -- within the week to officiate at the sod-turning for the Canadian Museum of Human Rights .
This was one of family patriarch Izzy Asper 's projects , now being pushed by daughter Gail .
And who knows what other goodies Harper will shower on the Aspers and other media tycoons in the days to come ?
For years , corporate media owners have lobbied both Liberal and Conservative governments to open up the Canadian news media market to greater foreign investment .
Rupert Murdoch , another ardent Harper fan , may be waiting in the wings .

Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Thursday that he looks forward to a smooth transition .
" I congratulate Senator Obama on the election and look forward to working with his team to ensure that there is a smooth and effective transition .
" A methodical and orderly transition is in the best interests of the financial markets and Treasury is committed to making sure that the incoming team can hit the ground running in January , " he said in a statement .
Names circulating for the secretary of the treasury position include Timothy Geithner , Lawrence Summers and Paul Volcker .

He was elected to the House in 2002 and is the fourth - highest - ranking member of the chamber 's Democratic leadership .
He also worked on President Clinton 's first presidential campaign and served as a White House adviser to Clinton .

He said he wants to do " everything I can to help deliver the change America needs . "
Also Thursday , Obama returned the calls of nine leaders of other countries , thanking them for having expressed congratulations on his election .

C&H Sugar charged with polluting waterway CROCKETT Refinery accused of fouling waterway
Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close C&H Sugar charged with polluting waterway 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
State water quality regulators are charging the century - old C&H sugar refinery in Crockett with dumping sugar , coliform bacteria , mercury and other chemicals into the Carquinez Strait over the last three years , potentially harming fish and marine life .
The more than 50 violations could cost the company as much as $ 500,000 , depending on the findings of a hearing scheduled in February , according to the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board .
" These are older facilities , and that 's what we face throughout the state - old pipes , old plants , " said Dave Clegern , spokesman for the State Water Resources Control Board , which oversees the regional agency .
" They need to be monitoring this and have people trained to catch these things before we have 34 of them . "
Regulators said 34 of the illegal discharges , 32 of which contained sugar , emanated from the plant , which uses water to cool its refining system .
The remaining discharges came from storm - water runoff , a minor oil spill and from a sewage treatment plant operated by C&H and which serves the refinery and 1,100 properties in the Crockett area .
No single discharge created a " serious threat " during the July 1 , 2005 to Oct. 31 , 2008 span , Clegern said .
But continued dumping could alter the pH levels of the water , endangering fish and plants .
Company officials said that after several delays they have repaired leaks in the cooling system that sent sugar into the waterway .
The firm also said it installed new equipment and gave additional training to employees .
" We have taken the necessary steps to ensure such delays do not occur again and no sugar - discharge violations have occurred since last February ( 2008 ) , " the company said in a statement .
This week 's complaint was not the first for the refinery .
Between September 2004 and June 2005 , the water board recorded 10 violations , resulting in $ 30,000 in fines .
At the Feb. 11 hearing , the regional water board will hear from C&H before deciding whether to amend the fine or refer it to the state attorney general 's office .
The company may waive the hearing by paying the full amount .
In addition , C&H may be allowed to pay slightly less than $ 250,000 toward an environmental project such as upgrading its facilities or restoring a local habitat .
The red brick refinery on the banks of the Carquinez Strait was founded in 1906 as the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company Inc .
Ninety - nine years later , in 2005 , the company was purchased by American Sugar Refining Inc. of Yonkers , N.Y. , which each year sells more than 3 million tons of white granulated , golden grown , powdered and other types of sugar .
The Crockett facility annually produces about 700,000 tons of sugar .
Crayon Physics is one of those games that captured the interest of the Opposable Thumbs staff early on .
Ever since the initial game was developed in the summer of 2007 , it has managed to garner much press and acclaim , especially since developer Petri Purho revealed that he was working on a deluxe version of the game that would include improved physics and more levels .
Now Crayon Physics
Deluxe has finally been released , and it turns out that the game is just about everything we 'd hoped for .
The basic idea behind Crayon Physics is that gamers have to get a ball to a point that is marked by a star .
This is accomplished by drawing a number of different items that can act in a variety of ways to help get the ball from Point A to Point B .
On a basic level , the drawings act as ramps or barriers , while more advanced implementation accomplishes a number of feats like creating weights and levers , as well as malleable platforms that can be affected by other creations .
It 's sort of like The Incredible Machine , but what that game would be like if a creative kid with a set of crayons was solving the puzzle instead of relying on the set items provided by the game .
What makes Crayon Physics so entertaining is that there are a number of different ways to solve each level , thanks to the fact that no one is going to draw the same things in exactly the same way .
It requires players to be creative and solve each puzzle through whatever means they can conceive , as opposed to only having one convoluted method as the only solution .
However , the most powerful thing about the game is its charm .
The visual presentation is meant to look like a folded up piece of paper that a child has been doodling on with crayons .
Not only that , but the soundtrack is extremely unobtrusive and soothing .
These combined factors actually make playing the game feel fairly relaxing , even as the puzzles become increasingly maddening : I never felt frustrated , even when I found myself stuck in certain areas while I worked through the first fifty levels .
I only felt curious about what I could create that would allow me to progress further .
Despite its appeal , there are a couple of glitches with Crayon Physics , the chief complaint being that I could n't get my Wacom tablet to work with the game .
Most of the time , the game did n't recognize the mouse input from my tablet , and it would only work in the most basic ways ; even though I had the pen calibrated so that one of the buttons was set to act as the right click on a mouse , it just would n't work .
It 's really a shame , because this could have made the game a lot more appealing for digital artists .
The other problem I occasionally encountered was that when I would delete items that were located close together , the wrong drawing would go away and I 'd have to reset the level .
Overall , Crayon Physics
Deluxe is one of those games that is a rarity , thanks to the charm and delight it provides .
If you 're a fan of puzzle games , or even just a creative type who enjoys doodling random shapes , then it 's probably a safe bet that you 'll love it .
An iPhone / iPod touch version of the title has also been released .

Marc Emery : Creeping Jackboots
In his latest column for the Western Standard , entitled " Creeping Jackboots , " Marc " Prince of Pot " Emery sounds the alarm bells over a changing legal climate that permits the fire department and electricity cops to search your home without a warrant .
But an Emery column would n't be complete without a passionate defense of the marijuana culture , as well as those who choose to smoke pot .
As poll after poll has consistently shown , Canadians endorse , at a minimum , a detente over the war on marijuana .
Emery writes :
It ’s impossible to remain a civilized nation when the government labels 60 per cent of Canada ’s people as “ heretics ” .
When the people and their critical thinking are the problem , despotism is just around the corner .
Polls since 2004 have shown each year a majority of Canadians want marijuana legalized , from 53 per cent to 62 per cent , and gaining each year .
Still , the real point of the column is the changes in the legal system .
Here 's a longer excerpt :
... a new criminal law system has been established by stealth , designed to replace the existing uncooperative and ‘ stupid ’ court system .
Search warrants , fair trials , rules of evidence , disclosure , judges and juries have all been eliminated .
In their place is this omnipotent all - powerful cabal of vested interests whose pay - cheques are more and more dependent on marijuana prohibition .
As the Langley symposium showed , these bureaucratic inquisitors currently have the right to invade your home anytime they want and as often as they want , treat you in a rude and abusive manner without consequence , steal your belongings ( at least one theft investigation has been admitted to ) , shut off your power on a whim , search your home , fine you into financial ruin , evict you , and publicize it all forever .
This new legal system is being used to persecute Canadians who grow marijuana , a plant that two out of three Canadians insist should be legal .
A suspected murderer , rapist , or thief has more rights than people suspected of growing a single marijuana plant in the privacy of their own residence .
You can read the rest here .
Emery conducted a remarkable interview with former Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) agent Cellerino Castillo , who uncovered the Oliver North Arms - For - Drugs DEA - CIA involvement in Central America .
The YouTube video of that two part interview is below the fold .

He 'd find for himself the true meaning of " oppression . "
I wonder if there 's enough drugs in the world to dull the pain he 'd receive .

DEA agent Cellerino Castillo makes an incredible interview !
Definitely check out those two video interviews I did with him .
Castillo 's book " Powderburns " is a searing indictment of DEA murder , rape , government destabilization , drug smuggling , illegal weapons smuggling & supply .

Markie .
The new criminal law system would not be much of a problem if you drive a gray four door sedan and keep a low profile .
And do n't forget that they are out there to hassle you not necessarily the rest of us unless we stand on the roof of a bright Porsche and wave a bag of pot over our heads .
There is something to be said for being subtle about your activities .
Most smart people subvert in private and do n't have a problem .
The crappola that would come into play in the legalization , production and distribution of pot would eventually make everyone wish they could go back to the good old days where you just quietly bought a bag from your neighbor and take it home .
No problemo .
It would be more useful if you put your considerable promotional talents to work in areas of reducing government red tape for business , to reducing income taxes , ridding us of the gun registry , the CHRC .... but pot ????
There is no big problem with smoking pot in Canada .
Pot must make you manic and thus you do that hyper silly stuff you do that is taking you to a US slammer .
It 's just makes me sleepy .

Smoking pot has been illegal seemingly forever .
People continue to smoke pot .
Kind of like global warming .

Posted by : peterj | 2008-11-11 10:24:32 PM
Regardless of our views on liberalization of marijuana laws , we ought to condemn the abuse far and above that slated for murderers , rapists and thieves that the government reserves for marijuana growers and , to a lesser extent , users ( or suspected growers or users ) .
The signal it sends implies a diminished sense of the relative severity of these real crimes and should be disturbing to us not only for that general symbolism but more specifically for the injustice it does to the victims of some very terrible crimes .
Posted by : Janet | 2008-11-11 10:38:44 PM
Actually , Janet , the difference is that those other crimes are very difficult to predict in advance , as there is usually little to no evidence or warning before the fact .
That 's not true with pot growers , is it ?
A more appropriate comparison would be white - collar crime like embezzlement , which usually comes to light via little clues that accumulate over time , similar to the way grow - ops do .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2008-11-11 11:18:15 PM
Put - down reply to whom ?
And more to the point , to what ?
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2008-11-11 11:18:50 PM
what surprises me is how many canadians and americans actually seem to side with the oppressors .
As if " freedom " means we are free to do whatever a corrupt and coercive government tells us to do .
Emery is trying to point out that we all have fewer and fewer rights , and that the oppressors have more and more rights , and zebulon and shane are all " Go nazis ! "
we are talking about soviet - style government powers here .... how can you be FOR that and AGAINST privacy ?

It wo n't be long before marijuana is legal .
Our ' budding ' neighbours to the South have just elected a Democratic President .
America is also broke , they can't afford to build anymore prisons or to police or prosecute marijuana laws .
Massachusetts recently voted to decriminalized , Michigan voted to legalize medical marijuana .
If they introduce a bill to decriminalize marijuana nationwide ... Canada will follow suit .
( Unfortunately , we always do )
And for Shane and Zebulon ... the fact that you want Marc Emery to rot in prison is a little disturbing .
I challenge you both to find ONE of his victims because if you think he should rot in prison ... it should only be fitting that he has caused significant irreparable harm that has destroyed families and lives .

1 . On the other hand , America 's crime rate has been in free fall ever since they started building those prisons , and even pot use among American youth is down ( unlike pot use among Canadian youth , which has ticked sharply upward ) .
That 's a powerful incentive to stay the course .
Results matter .
2. Massachusetts is on the wrong ( and losing ) side of the gay marriage debate and recently fielded a presidential candidate who , to listen to liberal apparatchiks , is the least popular in U.S. history .
( Of course , he 's also enjoyed the HIGHEST approval ratings in U.S. history , but they 're conveniently silent on that point ) .
Medical marijuana is a far cry from outright legalization , so that 's a mighty big " if . "
3 . The fact that you would speak for this malignant narcissist is even more disturbing .
Throughout his career he 's dared the authorities to arrest him , schmoozing the camera the whole time .
Now the Americans have said " Wish granted ! " and all of a sudden he 's scrabbling for freedom .
As for " significant and irreparable harm that has destroyed families and lives , " it 's obvious you 've never had deal with a drug addict .
The U.S. does n't indict on what you feel should be , Giddyup .
They indict on what the laws are .
Marc
Emery not only defied them , he flouted them , mooning the establishment of two countries and kicking them in the shins while he peddled his pot in both their backyards .
He got what he wanted ... attention .
You should be happy for him .

1. Spoken like a true anarchist .
I keep telling you guys , I already know that pot smokers and their sympathizers have a deep anti-establishment bent .
You do n’t need to keep proving it to me .
Who the hell do you think keeps VOTING for these governments ?
2. Rights to what ?
To break the law and get away with it under the guise of “ privacy ” ?
To risk whole neighbourhoods and work for organized crime and sell drugs to our kids so they can drive around in noisy Ferraris and sport the latest in bling - bling ?
What about the rest of society ’s rights to not have to put up with this kind of garbage ?
3 . No , we ’re talking about a longtime white - collar criminal who has openly defied the law for decades and has been finally called to account , who is thus now hysterical with grief , panicked at the reality of a situation he cannot drive away with cannabis dreams , on - camera shenanigans , or Godwin ’s Law .
I ca n’t believe how much I rule .
Care to have another go ?

I would be delighted to purchase a license to smoke pot for say $ 400.00 per year .
Responsible car drives buy a license , responsible gun owners buy a license .
Sell me a license so I can find out what all the fuss is about .
It will make some money for a legitimate government and take a bite out of crime fueled by prohibition .

Then you 're in the minority , Spanner .
Most people would pay little or no tax or licensing if they could get away with it .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2008-11-12 11:29:34 AM
You can say that about any tax or license , Shane .
It 's a function of bureaucracy to enforce the regulations , a function of government to have reasonable laws .

It is really sad and pathetic just how stupid this Shane Matthews appears to be .
Taking delight with his fellow moron " zeb " these two shed a far brighter light on the idiotic juvenile mentality of those who hate Marc without ever meeting him !
And this Epsi makes the others look smart .
His claims are ludicrous !
He ( Marc ) is 1 ) NOT forgotten 2 ) NOT in prison 3 ) NOT a loser .
People who know and respect Marc are NOT brain fried ( as he appears to be )
Potheads committed NO sins !
We are Doctors , Lawyers , Firemen , Police Officers , Teachers and more !
Shane Matthews is an ignorant egotistical bigot !
He has NO IDEA that so - called pot smokers are from EVERY walk of life , they have no agenda , they simply choose a natural God-Given plant for either Spiritual , Medicinal or even its intoxicating effects !
His ignorance is almost as grande as his out of check ego ...

Do n't change the subject , Spanner .
You suggest that most current pot smokers would gladly pay a licensing fee if it meant they could smoke pot legally .
We both know that is not true .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2008-11-12 12:01:33 PM
Responsible smokers would be absolutely delighted to buy a marijuana license .
We both know that is true .
Posted by : Spanner McNeil | 2008-11-12 12:06:26 PM
Well , let 's see .
Signs on with a name like " Freedom Rings " - - yup , bound to be some attitude there , as well as the limitless self - regard potheads seem to have for themselves .
Starts right in with the slagging , offering no solutions , no suggestions , no facts and no statistics , just a lot of self - righteous lather .
Limitless self - regard .
Oh , wait , that 's not entirely true ; he did get two out of three :
1. Marc Emery is NOT forgotten ( but he soon will be ) .
2. Marc Emery is NOT forgotten ( but he soon will be , probably for most of his natural life ) .
3 . This last is not a fact : Marc Emery is NOT a loser .
He is , in fact , and in short order he will lose where it really counts : the courts .
Petulant children like FR will probably organize a toke - a- thon or marijuana march , terminating on the steps of the Vancouver Art Gallery , but at the end of the day their protests will come to naught ; pot will still be illegal , and Marc Emery will be in a federal U.S. prison .
Being a criminal sucks .

Freedom , your Messiah is going to jail for a looooong time .
He is not dying on a cross like he tries to portray himself but rather he is being condemned to obscurity .

Posted by : epsilon | 2008-11-12 12:13:16 PM
Sorry , Spanner ; " responsible " and " marijuana smoker " ( with certain exceptions ) are mutually exclusive terms .
Remember , you 're talking about a group who are perfectly willing to treat with criminals rather than give up something they totally do not need .
Even if the law is someday changed and they are able to buy marijuana legally , the criminal mentality is still there , the mentality that allows them to effortlessly and remorselessly step over the boundary anytime they believe something they desire lies on the other side .
Such people are poor candidates for " responsible . "
A lot of people put buying pot into the same category as illegal downloads -- technically illegal , but essentially victimless , except for a few corporate fat cats who do n't deserve their money anyway .
But gang wars , drive - by shootings , and the gangsta lifestyle are very little associated with MP3s .
Marijuana smokers contribute to that every time they buy .
They know it , too .
They simply do n't care .
What they want is all that matters .
Posted by : Shane Matthews | 2008-11-12 1:56:18 PM
Ah , yes , now I remember why I do n't come to this website anymore .
Only trolls frequent the comment sections , spewing nothing more than bitterness , bigotry , hate , contempt , ad hominem attacks and misinformation ...
It 's such a negative and intellectually retarding place to frequent .
It 's unfortunate because the people who run Western Standard are excellent doers and thinkers with honorable goals and ideas .
I wish the comment - posting regulars could be of the same caliber .
Now , for some clarifications :
Marc Emery never sold marijuana or any other drugs .
He only sold marijuana seeds .
Revenue Canada , Revenue BC , Health Canada and the Canadian Parliament were all aware of , and endorsed , Marc Emery 's seed selling .
In his 10 years selling seeds , Marc paid $ 500,000 in income tax to Revenue Canada and Revenue BC as a " marijuana seed vendor " , and sent his marijuana seed catalogue to all Members of Parliament ( inside Cannabis Culture Magazine ) every two months .
Health Canada told medical marijuana patients to buy seeds online from websites like Marc Emery's .
I could go on and on , but anyone truly interested in learning the facts can read it all at NoExtradition .
net .
Marc has never hurt anyone .
He sold seeds .
If that 's reason enough to want him to " rot in jail " and " all the drugs in the world wo n't help his pain there " ... well , there 's a word for people like you : schadenfreude .
Posted by : Jodie Emery | 2008-11-12 5:09:04 PM
Another clarification :
Marc and I do not have a vehicle .
We walk to work from home , and use Zip Car ( car share program ) if we need to drive any long distances .
The night Marc was detained , he was driving a rental vehicle friends had brought up from Washington state .
He was only driving it a few blocks , because the friends had been drinking and the vehicle was going to be towed .
The full story of that night can be read here : http://forums.cannabisculture.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1437976#Post1437976

Cut the self - righteous crap , Jodie .
The judge and jury will determine whether the law was broken , not you .
It will not be a difficult decision for them to make — you were pretty frank about what you were doing .
Hell , BALD would be a better word .
Now listen up .
You are not a more evolved form of human .
You have not proven yourself competent to hurl such bilious calumnies .
All you ’ve shown yourself is enough of a fool to marry a man with a self - proclaimed date with destiny on the other side of the bars .
But you hitched your wagon to his train anyway , and now feel entitled to slag the entire country because they wo n’t come to his rescue as they ought to .
Marc made every effort to see that the police had all the evidence they needed to put him away while snapping his fingers under their noses , daring them to do it .
Eventually someone obliged him — you knew it had to come sooner or later , did n’t you ?
The fact that he paid taxes on his earnings in Canada is irrelevant , because he smuggled seeds into the United States , and since smuggling is illegal in both countries , the extradition treaty applies .
In all likelihood , your husband is going to an American federal prison for several years , Jodie .
It may be a great many .
I advise you to get use to the idea of visiting him in jail .
Even if the Canadian government were interested in blocking the extradition , they ’d have a lot of trouble manoeuvring around the text of the treaty .
You made a very serious mistake when you poked the American giant in the eye with your finger .
Now he ’s awake , he ’s angry , he ’s after you , and you wish us to interpose ourselves between your husband and him ?
Dream ON .
P.S. That bit about the rental car has no bearing on the issue whatever .
You can stop trying to convince us what a wonderful human being he is , because the fact of the matter is almost nobody cares .
Those Canadians who think to resent his extradition are more upset because it ’s the Americans who extraditing him than over the extradition itself .

1. Smoking tobacco causes lung cancer , whereas smoking marijuana does n't .
2 . People are hurt by drunk drivers , never by stoned drivers .
Remember , until recently the police had little power or ability to test for marijuana intoxication .
3 . Smoking dope while pregnant is great for babies , but smoking tobacco and ( horrors ! ) drinking alcohol is not .
Marijuana is not a harmless distraction .
It may not kill you , but enough of it will definitely pickle your brain ( look at Chris Buors and Budoracle ) .
And young children turned on to marijuana are far more likely to graduate to the truly frightening drugs , because they 've taken that all - important first step .
Never mind whether dope is legal or not .
It 's a psychedelic drug , unlike tobacco or alcohol , and everyone considers it such .
P.S. Prohibition , in and of itself , ruins nothing .
You have to break the prohibition before you get prosecuted .
Now I 'd like to hear some really good reasons why this stuff is worth risking a criminal record for , when legal alternatives are available .
I bet you can't come up with a single one .

do you deny Matthew saying Canada is looking like the former USSR .
You said it to me the night of the last prov election .
Please at least stand by what you say - I do .
Heck I am even being sued for my words .

The last provincial election was three years ago .
Would you mind providing the entire quote ?
Because I certainly do n't remember it .

Yes Shane , I am saying that marijuana smoke does not cause lung cancer .
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070417193338.htm
I am not advocating that anybody should toke and drive .
It does affect your driving skills , albeit ... not as much as alcohol .
I am also not advocating that pregnant women hit the bong , I am sure that it is not good for the baby .
But , please tell me what happens to fetuses exposed to marijuana smoke .
The gateway theory is ridiculous .
For example , if marijuana use is currently at about 15 % to 25 % , and cocaine and other hard substances are roughly at about 2 % , how does that prove the gateway theory ??

Really ?
Because studies I 've read say some for , some against :
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/141891.stm
I 've heard the " marijuana cures cancer " claim before .
Believe me , a great deal more work remains to be done before this claim can be given credence .
Promising first results do not a scientific proof make .
And is n't it strange that these properties were detected only now , once the medical marijuana bandwagon got rolling ?
A single joint of potent B.C. bud can cut your reaction time in half .
A second joint will cut it down to a third .
It is precisely that same reaction time that alcohol affects and this is precisely the mechanism by which impaired driving causes accidents , not by hallucinating pink elephants tap - dancing on the highway .
What happens to fetuses exposed to marijuana smoke ?
Uh , they get stoned .
Marijuana use can also affect hormone balances .
And given its effects on the adult brain , you can imagine what havoc it could wreak on a developing fetal brain .
Admittedly more research remains to be done and the only way to find out for sure is to put some fetuses at risk in the name of science .
You progressive times should be all for that .
You 're already prepared to bump them off in the name of convenience .
Because those who use pot are more likely to end up on hard drugs than those who do n't .
Most people who smoke dope wo n't end up on the Big H , but their chances are several times higher , just as your chances of being in an accident are several times higher if you 're drunk ( or stoned ) .
You 'll probably get away with it , but why take the risk ?

Your credit score is not just bank - speak , it 's a tool you can control and use to save cash .

NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) -
It turns out that learning more about your credit rating could help you boost your score and even save you some money .
" Unfortunately , most consumers still do not know basic facts about credit scores and their financial significance , " according to the Consumer Federation of America Executive Director Stephen Brobeck .
In fact , according to a recent poll conducted by Opinion Research Corp. , only 27 percent of consumers understand that scores measure credit risk .
The truth is , your credit score , sometimes called a FICO score , is a number based on the information in your credit file that shows how likely you are to pay a loan back on time -- the higher your score , the less risky you are .
There are three major credit bureaus : Experian , Equifax and TransUnion .
The credit bureaus write up your report based on any information they received about you from companies that gave you credit in the past , such as your payment history , the length of your credit history , the types of credit you have and amounts owed .
From that report , a credit score is derived -- which ranges from 300 to a perfect 850 .
That score is a quick way for lenders to assess how risky you are as a potential borrower .
The higher your score , the less risk you pose to lenders and the more likely it is that you 'll get their best available rates .
Consumers with scores above 700 are usually charged relatively low rates , and those with scores above 760 are charged the lowest rates .
Consumers with scores below 600 are typically charged relatively high loan rates , and if your credit score is really bad , you may be not be able to borrow at all .
Any late payments you made will lower your score , but establishing or re-establishing a good track record of making payments on time will raise your score .
Beth Givens , director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , says , ideally , you want your score to be well above 620 , that 's a drawing line for creditors .
( The median credit score in the United States . is 723 . )
Credit card provider Providian Financial estimated that consumers with an average score would reduce card finance charges by $ 76 annually if they raised their score by 30 points .
" If [ all ] consumers were to raise their credit scores by only 30 points , on average they would save $ 16 billion on lower credit card finance charges alone , " said J. Christopher Lewis , Providian 's chief public policy officer .
Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions
Act , you can obtain one annual free copy of your credit report .

But you will still have to pay a fee to get your scores .
" Those who have obtained their scores know significantly more about credit scores than those who have not , " noted CFA 's Brobeck .
And once you know your score , you can follow these tips from myFICO to improve your rating : Pay your bills on time .
Delinquent payments can have a major negative impact on your score and the longer you pay your bills on time , the better your score .
For example , someone with an average credit rating of 707 can raise their score by as much as 20 points by paying all their bills on time for one month .

Have credit cards - but manage them responsibly .
In general , having credit cards and installment loans ( and making timely payments ) will raise your score .
Someone with no credit cards , for example , tends to be higher risk than someone who has managed credit cards responsibly .

Closing an account does n't make it go away .
