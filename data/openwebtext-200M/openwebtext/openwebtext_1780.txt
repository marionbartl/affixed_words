Installing fiber into my home [ link ]
I now have the Verizon FIOS fiber - optic - based Internet service in my home .
I 've written up how this all works ( what goes in your neighborhood on the poles , how it goes into your house , what they do , what you get inside , etc. ) in an essay with lots of pictures .

" Professional " journalists are amateurs sometimes with podcasting [ link ]
An observation : From when I first previewed my copyright training video at Demo earlier this year , I 've had professional audio people ( years in radio , TV , or public address sound ) giving me pointers to help me with the sound on my video and podcasts .
( I have produced at least three public series , Software Licensing , Open Cellphone , and Open Source SIG , and I 've been interviewed on many more . )
I 've been relying on Doug Kaye of ITConversations more than you can imagine .
I 've watched a friend spend months and years learning the craft as he moved from being a print journalist to covering a similar beat for NPR .
I constantly compare my work to what I hear on the airwaves , in movies and videos , and in other podcasts .
I 've even spent lots of my own money trying to make as pleasing sound as possible .
I 'm learning to hear the differences between different microphones , to understand why so much equipment is often used ( de-essers , compressors , limiters , filters , etc. ) .
I feel that sound is like layout , typography , writing , punctuation , print resolution , etc. -- it can get in the way when we do n't take advantage of what has been learned over the years and when done well it helps get information across better .
I 'm getting sensitive to levels , clipping , and so much more .
( Hopefully some of this is reflected in better podcasts from me , but I 'm not always as successful as I 'd like .
Maybe if I buy just one more piece of equipment ... )
With the rush to podcasting by just about every " content " provider , we 're now seeing " journalists " who are " professionals " in one medium ( usually print reporters or bloggers ) trying to publish in another ( audio ) and they often sound like total newbies .
I like the new outlet for information that podcasting provides .
I like it that newspaper and other " text - based " reporters are now filing stories in audio form with actual interviews where you can hear the interviewee squirming .
But , as I hear the sometimes poor audio quality and blog - like " I 'm doing it myself " character of these podcasts I 'm reminded of how " professional " journalists just a little while ago were deriding us bloggers as something of poor quality .
As I hear them learning - by - doing in the audio sphere , just as we bloggers - turned - podcasters are , I hope they are getting a greater understanding of us and how the rough quality of our blog writing may not reflect on the quality of our thoughts and messages .
I am enjoying some of these " big media " podcasts , such as the Boston Globe Bizcasts with DC Denison , Scott Kirsner , and others .
You can hear how rough the sound engineering is .
( Scott did a wonderful podcast with me that was posted in early August but recorded last February -- you can hear the echoes in the room and the computer fans blowing and it was n't just a bit during an intro for effect like the ambient sound NPR edits in .
I talk a lot about innovation and inventing and VisiCalc . )
Other newspapers are jumping into the fray , such as the San Francisco Chronicle with their " Chronicle Podcasts " ( their recording quality varies , too ) .
David Berlind and Dan Farber of ZDNet have the " Between the Lines " podcast series .
David and I are frequently comparing notes about equipment and podcasting techniques and he posts what he 's learning on his blog .
Steve Gillmor 's sound quality is all over the map as he experiments on the new Gillmor Gang .
The original recordings , produced by Doug Kaye at ITConversations , were quite good and were the eye opener that got many of us sold on this medium .
Some of these people are very good interviewers and it really shows in the podcasts .
Scott has done the MITX Fireside Chat series of live interviews that I frequently write about here on my blog ( such as with Malcolm Gladwell and Clayton Christensen ) .
Podcasting lets him use that talent for more of us .
David Berlind often asks tough , knowledgeable follow up questions as he interviews vendors on his podcasts -- you can almost see the horror on the faces of the PR people in the room with the interviewee on speaker phone .
Larry Magid has been a print columnist for many years , but he 's also been doing radio shorts for NPR and then CBS for a long time .
His interviews for ITConversations have been really interesting ( like the ones with Gordon Moore and Buzz Aldrin ) , but he 's been doing daily radio for years .
Larry 's style brings up an interesting question .
He 's been trained to do the " 2 minute spot " style of recording with a zesty tone of voice .
When you do long discussions with someone , what is the most appropriate tone ?
What about 10 minute podcasts ?
Should we edit and add additional laughs like Car Talk sometimes does according to On The Media 's " Pulling Back the Curtain " ?
( By the way , I 've always loved NPR 's " On The Media " and now that it 's available as a podcast I get to listen to it much more -- that 's spoiling me to expect all NPR shows to be like that . )
Larry and I have been discussing this whole tone thing .
As we all experiment with podcasting , what lengths are natural for what type of listening ?
What style of affect should we use when ?
Over the years Larry 's done live radio , 15 - 30 second spots , 2 minute segments , and 20 minute longer stuff - what are some of the " right " ( most pleasing or helpful to the listener ) styles for each genre ?
Larry reminds me this moving of many written reporters to audio and video is like the switch from silent films to talkies .
Not all great motion and expression actors could sound the way that worked with audiences .
New popular players emerged .
Being a " multi " media person now might be a valuable thing .
This switch to audio will be tough for some people trained only in writing .
With writing you needed to know how to type ( a skill ) and manipulate a word processor and email and maybe part of a content management system .
Nothing that hard for regular people , and most stuff is taught in grade school now .
So , the main unusual skills are writing ability and " journalism " training .
With audio , most of the reporters who are doing new podcasts need to have and be proficient with lots of expensive fussy equipment , do a new type of editing they do n't teach in most schools ( for making editorial changes as well as sound changes , compression changes , etc. , etc. ) , speak fluently and clearly ( or know how to fit it with editing , just as they often do with print ) , and more -- lots of geeky skills and a bit of how to " act naturally " on top of it .
On the flip side , reporters are finding whole new ways to do their craft of " reporting " .
They may need additional skills but they have more outlets for their work .
Of course for the techies at heart , it gives you a great excuse to learn about a whole new area and get lots of new toys .
It 's nice to all learn something new together .
We are creating a new medium together , pros and " amateurs " alike .
Video may have killed the radio star , but with the Internet the radio engineers are now finding that more people want to learn from or use their skills .

Podcast with Donna Dubinsky about Palm and more [ link ]
We 've just posted another podcast in the DiamondCluster Wavelengths series .
This one is an interview with Donna Dubinsky .
Donna was the CEO of Palm in the early days when it came out with the Palm Pilot .
She then co-founded Handspring and was very involved with the Visor and the Treo .
Handspring was acquired by Palm in 2003 .
She 's still on the board of Palm but not actively involved in day - to - day management .
John Sviokla and I asked her questions related to her experiences with an eye to learning from history about creating an open platform .
Not only do we talk about the " open cell phone " as we do on the other Wavelengths podcasts , but Donna talks about some of the history of developing the Palm as an open platform , how they learned about doing wireless devices at Handspring , what the wireless carriers ' mindsets are , and more .
This podcast should be of interest to a wide range of people , including people interested in modern computer history , the Palm platform , open systems , handhelds , the Treo , cellular carriers , and more capable cell phones .
If you 've never heard Donna speak it 's worthwhile to listen to this to hear the voice of a real business pioneer who helped blaze new classes of uses of computing .
One interesting observation related to the " Long Tail " discussion : Palm found out that most people used some of the core applications shipped with the device but that customers would also find one other application that was compelling for them and that was a " make it or break it thing " ( listen at about 3:00 in the podcast ) .
" There was always some additional compelling application for the Palm owner , " she claims .
A dedicated device without general programmability would do the core applications ( like calendar ) but not that one needed application ( like connecting to a corporate database or tracking the stars ) .
This is a step - function that relates to the Long Tail -- it 's not that a large number of long tail apps added up to lots of " extra " money but rather they drove consideration of a product at all .
This is a key aspect of understanding open systems and the Long Tail .
The interview has additional important observations based on history , too .
See " Show # 4 : Donna Dubinsky , ex-CEO of Palm and Handspring " for information on how to download this 41 minute podcast .

What if VisiCalc had been patented ? [ link ]
My name has been brought up a few times in the last few weeks with regards to software patents .
I publicly questioned a Microsoft representative in Zaragoza who was saying that software patents were good , asking him how patents played a role in Microsoft 's early success ( since they held very few patents until the early 1990's ) .
You can read Jackie Danicki's write - up of the exchange ( search for " bricklin " on the page ) and you can listen to it at minute 24:25 of the MP3 of Simon Brown 's session from the conference on the page that Jackie points to .
I was a source for Randall Stross ' article in the July 31 , 2005 , Sunday New York Times which has been picked up in a variety of places .
( I also helped him find out how to get the information for the chart there that shows Microsoft had only a single issued patent by 1987 with company revenue of $ 350 million , 5 by 1990 with revenue of $ 1.2 billion , etc . )
I pointed out that the software industry has used copyright and trademark for IP protection very well ( both are keystones of the proprietary and the Open Source software worlds ) .
The main quote : " Is n't Microsoft the poster child of success without software patents ? "
The issue comes up again in a recent piece in ZDNet / CNet " Open - source allies go on patent offensive " where my name is mentioned on the second page in discussing what the effect would have been of patenting VisiCalc .
( See my old essay " Patenting VisiCalc " to understand why we did n't . )
This morning a Newsgator custom keyword search feed found my name mentioned on Russ Krojec 's blog entry " What if VisiCalc was Patented ? " Russ argues that since VisiCalc was n't patented competitors found it " ... safer to copy the currently winning formula and avoid having to innovate .
In this case , the lack of patents brought innovation to a standstill and we are all running spreadsheet programs that still operate like 25 year old software . "
I beg to differ with him .
He seems to assume that people have n't tried really hard to find something better .
I posted a comment to his blog ( as of this writing it 's awaiting anti-spam / troll verification ) :
There actually were many different " non-VisiCalc - like " calculating systems developed over those years .
We even tried one at Software Arts with TK !
Solver , and Lotus tried Improv .
Then there was T - Maker , Javelin , etc. , etc .
Many of us tried to find new metaphors .
They did n't catch on ( there are reasons why , I believe , but it is n't for lack of trying ) .
On the other hand , innovation in VisiCalc - like spreadsheets continued , with Lotus doing things we would n't , and then Microsoft moving things further ahead with Excel going in areas Lotus neglected .
When Mitch Kapor did 1 - 2 - 3 , he copied the features of VisiCalc he thought were worthwhile and did n't ( or changed ) features he did n't think were appropriate .
Microsoft added features ( and Windows support ) that Lotus held back on .
Innovation sure did n't " stand still " .
There was no " avoiding " of innovation .
I 'm not against patents in general ( they are good for some industries , I guess ) , but I do have real problems with how they are affecting the software industry which has other means of protection and incentive that have proven successful to society .
Of course , as I 've written , they are the current law of the land and I still apply for them at times .
In fact just today I received one of those " It is my great pleasure to congratulate you on the granting of your patent !... Celebrate ... by ordering a patent plaque or frame today " letters as another patent from the Trellix days finally came through this week ( we applied in 1996 ) .
( I do n't own the patent -- Interland does . )
The topic seems hot , so I figured I should post this , but I 've been talking about software and patents for over 15 years so I am a bit burnt out about it .
In my copyright video I even have a very short clip showing me testifying ( along with Mitch Kapor ) in front of a Congressional subcommittee in 1990 on the topic ( which I 'll get onto the Internet one of these days -- the complete tape of the hearing is hours long ) .

New podcast - friendly version of ListGarden is released [ link ]
I 've just released the new ListGarden RSS feed generator Version 1.3.1 .
This is a major upgrade with lots of new features .
It makes it very easy to create podcast RSS feeds , including automatically generating an HTML page with a " List of Shows " and links to the audio files like the one I use for my Software Licensing podcast .
( There is a step - by - step tutorial on how to do this -- see " Setting Up an RSS Feed for Podcasting Using ListGarden " .)
The product is still free Open Source released under the GPL and runs on Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux , client - side or server - side .
I understand that many people create their podcasts pretty much by hand , uploading the audio files by FTP ( easy ) and then manually editing the RSS XML ( tedious and error - prone ) .
Some use external services to turn a blog feed into a clean podcast feed .
The new version of ListGarden is a way to maintain the RSS feed more automatically yourself -- you just browse to a list of uploaded files and click on " Select " to fill in the enclosure information .
The new features include support for enclosures , support for extra XML such as that used by iTunes , and automatic backup to a local file and / or the server .
One special new feature , not in the beta version , is a way to download option settings from a web page .
ListGarden has lots of option settings and some fields need HTML and other templates .
This feature let me put sample settings on a web page and have you add those settings by just entering the URL .
This made the tutorial much less tedious .
It also lets anybody create such templates , much like templates for blogs .
Since ListGarden can create HTML files ( like the companion List of Shows file ) this will make it easier for VARS and others to provide support .
See " Version 1.3 " for a detailed list of the new features and where to download .

Podcast with Tim O'Reilly [ link ]
The fifth show in my Software Licensing podcast series is now available .
I talked with Tim O'Reilly , founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media .
The reason I first asked him to do a podcast was to discuss O'Reilly 's policy for copying sample code from their computer books .
They publish something like 500 books with a total of about 2 million lines of sample code and most programmers I know refer to at least some of those books periodically .
Most of the books I checked do n't tell you what the copying policy is .
In 2001 Tim posted an informal description of their policy on the O'Reilly website which I assume most people have not read or do n't find easily .
I felt that it was of value to my listeners ( which include corporate attorneys who like to know these things ) to understand what the policy is and the philosophy behind it .
While " fair use " law cover this , the ethical thing is to know the copyright holder 's intent , too , in figuring out how to apply that law .
The discussion of the policy takes up the first 10 minutes or so of the podcast .
The rest has discussions of O'Reilly Media 's experience with copyable and online books and the effects of piracy , Tim 's thoughts about the value of openness and the " architecture of participation " , where there 's value in the Open Source ecosystem ( who will be the " Dell " of Open Source ) , the balance between what you own and what you give away , and more .
If you 've heard Tim speak recently some of this will be familiar , but the difference here is that it is a conversation ( literally ) so he probably goes into more depth on some things and covers a wider area of topics in response to my questions .
If you are interested in Open Source or business models and have n't heard Tim speak , it 's definitely worth the time .
He 's runs a for - profit business that is heavily involved in the Open Source world and has real data on what works and what does n't .
See " Interview with Tim O'Reilly , O'Reilly Media " for the details of downloading the podcast or subscribing to it .
I 've been really pleased with the reaction to my Software Licensing podcast series .
People especially comment about the interviews with Marten Mickos of MySQL and Linda Hamel of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ITD .
I love how podcasting works where I just upload the MP3 file and update the RSS feed ( using the hopefully final code I finished this morning of my podcast - friendly ListGarden upgrade , of course ) and , voila ! , dozens of people download it in the minutes before I can even let you know about it on this blog ( thanks to podcatchers iTunes , iPodder , iPodderX , etc. ) .
I love how I can see that listeners appreciate what I 'm doing well enough to subscribe .
A " page read " is one thing as positive feedback , but a " subscribe " is even better .

Beta of a new podcast - friendly upgrade to ListGarden [ link ]
It 's been almost a year since I last upgraded my ListGarden RSS creation tool .
ListGarden has gotten great reviews , has been downloaded thousands of times ( the rate has not dropped off ) , and is apparently being used by many people .
ListGarden is pretty specialized because most people who create something that uses RSS ( a blog or a database - driven site ) have the RSS creation built into their system .
The program been most helpful to people like me who use non-blogging tools to create their blog ( like Trellix Web or Notepad ) .
Being released under the GPL has helped it stand out ( and help me learn about the GPL firsthand in a more meaningful way ) .
I 've just added some features that may make it helpful to a new set of users .
When it came time for me to post my first podcast I realized that ListGarden could n't help me create the type of RSS feed I needed to be a real , " podcatchable " podcast .
It did n't support the < enclosure > element .
Editing XML by hand is tedious and error - prone , so most people like using an automated tool .
Phil Windley created a patch to make ListGarden work for him ( that 's what you can do with Open Source ... ) but I wanted a different UI and , anyway , there were other features and bug fixes I wanted to add , too .
It was time to upgrade ListGarden .
Before I started my podcast series I did some programming and added support for enclosures and a way to browse a directory on a server to choose the file and automatically fill in the file name and size ( I assume that you can use a normal FTP program to upload the file ) .
Since May
I 've been using that version for all the podcasts I 've done but I did n't finish the coding so that I could release it to the public .
( I did find and fix some bugs during that time , though . )
Today I finally released the upgrade , including a variety of other features I 've added in the past weeks .
It is a beta version and there is barely any documentation for the new features , though for people who know podcasting RSS already that should n't be much of a problem .
Over the next few days I 'll upgrade the existing documentation and add new documentation about podcasting so you wo n't need to know any of that .
The special podcasting - friendly features include : Support for enclosures , the ability to use namespaces and add additional sub-elements to both the channel and the item elements ( which lets you , for example , set the new values that iTunes takes advantage of ) , and the ability to maintain an HTML - format list of shows on the website along with the XML - format RSS feed ( for listeners who do n't use podcatching software or when you want to link to an entry on a webpage for a single show ) .
Other features :
The ability to automatically save backups of all the data both locally and / or on the server , and a simple non-HTML way to markup the descriptions ( this lets you podcast with formatted entries without needing to create a companion blog or know HTML ) .
For more information on this beta version , see the ListGarden News page on the Software Garden website .
I 'd appreciate any feedback .

Where is Don Bulens ? [ link ]
Regular readers of this blog have heard me refer many times to Don Bulens who was CEO of Trellix for many years .
After I left Interland / Trellix last year I have n't mentioned him .
Periodically , though , people ask me where he is ( he has lots of friends in the industry ) .
I 've kept up with Don at least every few months since I stopped working with him and here 's the info :
Soon after I left , Interland scaled back the Massachusetts office where I had worked ( I guess independent of me leaving ) .
It 's still there ( at a slightly new location a block from the old one ) and the complete service
Don led that uses our website creation system is alive and well and contributing to their bottom line ( as I read their latest PR about their relationship with Dex ) .
Don left a while after I did and then did some work with various VCs and considered a variety of jobs ( and finally stopped spending 60 % of his time in Atlanta and being away from his dear family ) .
In March of this year Don joined EqualLogic , Inc. as president and CEO .
EqualLogic makes intelligent , all - inclusive iSCSI storage area network ( SAN ) solutions .
That may sound quite different than doing website development software , but Don has always been a whiz at OEM and VAR relationships -- he got the Lotus Notes VAR channel going , for example , and got the old Trellix Web Windows client onto millions of OEM products and the server - based tool used by many well known brands .
He likes being a CEO building a company and its sales channels .
He also likes it that the company makes products that try to simplify things in a complex area , just like Trellix did .
As I see it , EqualLogic is also in a much more family - friendly location , just over the border in Nashua , New Hampshire ( Don lives north of Boston ) , so it 's a win all around .
So , for those of you who have been asking , now you know where to find him .
Good luck , Don !

Podcast with David Isenberg [ link ]
The third " Wavelengths " Open Cellphone podcast is now available .
This time John Sviokla and I talk with David Isenberg about his " Rise of the Stupid Network " essay that he wrote while at AT&T , the democratic principle of the " Freedom to Connect " , cities putting in their own connectivity infrastructure , the turnover in buying new cellphones , and more .

Open Cellphone podcast with Tom Evslin [ link ]
We 've just posted the second show in the " Wavelengths " Open Cellphone podcast series .
DiamondCluster 's John Sviokla and I talk with Tom Evslin about getting a big company to do new things , what he learned at AT&T starting WorldNet and at a successful Voice Over IP company , about the problems of vertical integration , and much more .
John really like a metaphor that Tom mentioned about why parts of a vertically integrated company often have a hard time competing with those parts as used by ( and sold to ) a non-vertically integrated company :
It 's about " surface area " , meaning how exposed the managers are to customers and markets .
As Tom wrote on his blog last February in " AT&T : Lesson From the Crypt # 3 : Vertical Integration Does n't Work Anymore " :
Vertically integrated companies can't compete !
The oxymoron of internal customers  is poison to a competitive culture .
That is the lesson of the computer industry and it is a lesson the telecommunications industry apparently has not learned yet ...
A horizontal company has a high surface to volume ratio .
It sells all of its outputs in a competitive market .
It is free to buy all its inputs in a competitive market .
Its managers are not isolated from the markets they compete in .
A vertical company spends most of its time and energy dealing with itself rather than the external market .
Meetings are dominated by esoterica like transfer pricing between divisions because this is what determines internal success .
The real marketplace is distant from most of the managers trapped inside the vertical structure .
Buy vs. build and capital allocation decisions inside a vertical company are made by office politics in a vain attempt to optimize across the whole vertical organization .
Horizontal competitors optimize only for the layer they are competing in and so end up being superior to the vertically integrated company layer by layer .

Podcast with MySQL's Marten Mickos [ link ]
I 've posted a new podcast in the Software Licensing series .
This one is an interview with Marten Mickos , CEO of MySQL AB .
MySQL is a very popular database released under the GPL license that is also available under a " dual license " with a more traditional proprietary license that does n't have the GPL " redistribute derivative works under GPL , too " requirements .
I ask people about pronunciation before I start recording .
In the USA , Marten will accept most reasonable pronunciations for his name -- like the " Mahr ' - ten Mee ' - kohs " I think I used -- and the original pronunciation for MySQL is to spell it out -- My - Ess - Que - Elle -- but the customer is always right , so " My - See ' - quill " is OK , too , if that 's what you want .
The interview starts with about 15 minutes of talking about the dual licensing they have and the question of how to tell when you can't use the GPL license and need the commercial one .
I hope this is helpful to the lawyers in my audience since the company does not like to say much about this .
We then talked for the rest of the almost 40 minutes about business models , his feelings about Open Source , ensuring ownership of copyrights ( in an Open Source project and in general ) , software patents , the fact that about 40 % of MySQL 's active installations are on Windows computers , various segmentations of their market with respect to different licenses , and whether an Open Source - based ISV can make a reasonable amount of money in the eyes of investors .

An interactive conference and thoughts on new media [ link ]
The response to Friday 's conference has been phenomenal .
There was real energy in the room .
When asked , at least half of the people in the room said they 'd written code in the last 6 months .
Almost everybody reads Groklaw .
Dozens of people participated .
It was this participatory , interactive nature that keeps coming up in descriptions .
Pamela Jones of Groklaw , who did a long write - up of the meeting after listening to the 4 hours of recordings , mentions that multiple times .
I tried hard ( with the help of the other organizers ) to make the conference work this way .
I had gone to other events where there was little time left for the audience , and even that was for " questions " for the " esteemed panel " to answer .
I 've also gone to two of Dave Winer 's BloggerCons which are mainly audience give and take .
Dave 's been pushing that format very strongly recently ( thank you , Dave !
Yet again you help the rest of us and make a big mark on the world ) , and I decided to get some flavor of that here , while trying to respect the fact that some of the invited panelists came great distances and should get a reasonable amount of time to put in their comments and that we only had 1 hour for each part .
We posted in advance that " It is expected that all attendees will actively engage in collaborative discussions with panel members . "
We also told the panel members to encourage participation and only gave the big panel ( with 5 speakers ) a few minutes each to do an introduction , not the normal 10 or 15 that would have taken up all the time .
Attendees paid attention to this and constantly had things to say .
I 'd run over with a handheld mike ( which kept things under control so basically only one person was talking at a time ) which made it obvious to whoever was speaking that it was time for someone else .
Body language of a moderator can help communicate without needing to break in while someone 's speaking , and keeping the mike in the moderator 's hand let 's you fade one person out and fade in another .
The other thing about this meeting , I think , is that the attendees were mainly all used to the Open Source world which has a lot of participatory activity .
Also , the area is so broad that for almost any question a different person was the local " expert " .
So the style fit the topic of the SIG .
In today 's world , the fact that everybody can participate is now a given .
I view myself as a toolmaker and look to tools .
The tools of the old world were for " broadcasters " where one small group ( but not too small -- it needed " production " people , expensive equipment , and capital ) tries to provide something that the general population " shares " by listening .
Think : newspaper , radio , TV , books , magazines .
The tools of today are for individual expression where anybody can decide what they want to communicate or listen to and there is no requirement to try to make it " broad " and interaction has a much lower threshold .
The tools are designed for individuals with almost no money , but often scale to large groups .
Think : the web , blogs , email , IM , podcasting , cellphones , search , wikis .
Google searches are all " long - tail " .
Cellphone calls are all long - tail , not like top - 40 radio .
Even listening on music players and the Internet is long - tail :
In an interview with Larry Magid on ITConversations , RealNetwork 's Rob Glaser said [ at minute 2:45 ] that in a given month over 90 % of Rhapsody 's one million songs are played at least once and the top 100 songs make up only 1 % of the listens .
I wonder how identical people 's music libraries are if you look at their high - capacity music player .
Probably many quite different mixes and that personal part is what makes an iPod so popular and better than radio .
The " media " of yesterday were producers of broad content .
The " media " of today are really tools for individuals to communicate with few or many people -- the tools scale and the thresholds are very low .
The tools assume a long tail and are not area - specific for " broad interest content " .
So Google ( and others ) with search ( a " newspaper " or " book " with very narrow grained material that has more or less whatever you want to read , not just what someone decided you want to read today ) , email , and blogging ( a newspaper that 's as easy to maintain as sending email to one person so it 's worth it for one or ten or a thousand readers ) is a new " media " company in that media means a way to read or hear what we want from others .
Wikis are " books " that are easy for a group to write , either very small or large .
Back to Open Source , Doug Heintzman of IBM said [ at minute 43:45 of the " Business Models " session and on BetaNews ] that they 're spreading the collaborative , " bottoms up " development process , culture , and tools to their other development projects because it works better than the siloed ways of the past .
On my trip to Europe , I was reminded how many cultures and subcultures there are and how rich each is .
I saw people interacting with others in so many ways .
Nobody was listening to a radio -- they were all talking to others , texting , immersed in their personal worlds composed of so many diverse parts .
Broadcast , one - way tools and thinking do n't work there .
Personal expression tools do and , like at IBM , they will change the world for the better to be more from us and , hopefully , of what 's best in us .

More recordings and creating a wiki to point to them [ link ]
I 've finished processing the three morning sessions of the Mass Software Council Open Source SIG meeting and posted them online .
They are really good and the reviews so far have been quite positive .
The main recording left to do is the lunch keynote , but I 'm not sure yet if that one will be posted .
To see the full list of what we have , go to the " Kickoff Meeting " page .
To follow additions , check out the blog .
The constant addition of recordings , associated slide files , links to reports in blogs , etc. , fit in well with the blog I set up to notify those that are following along .
A blog is n't , though , a good fit for people who come in later .
It would be much better to have an organized webpage with everything neatly formatted .
This is a volunteer - run organization with many contributors , so a centrally - controlled website would put the burden on the webmaster ( who at present is me ) .
At the meeting , a common refrain was the move to using wikis for organizing stuff for a group .
The combination of blog and wiki looks really good .
Until now I 've never created a wiki of my own , but I really had no choice but to use one here .
I searched a bit on the web and found good reviews of UseModWiki .
It 's written in Perl , is released under the GPL ( good for an Open Source SIG ) and is easy to install on a web server ( no need to connect to databases , it 's basically one Perl file , etc. ) .
I just downloaded the zip file ( which assumes you will be on a Windows server , which is not what I was going to do ) , edited the first line of the program to point to Perl , edited the line with the location of the data file , uploaded it to the server ( using " ASCII " mode ! ) which is a normal inexpensive shared - hosting account , set a few permissions and created a data directory using an FTP program , and Voila ! , a wiki .
I then edited the sample config file to change the wiki name , added some passwords , and turned on calculating file differences , and then uploaded that to the data directory .
Finally , I started creating the actual pages , a home page and one for the Kickoff Meeting , using my browser .
Pretty easy .
Of course now I 'm itching to make a custom CSS file for the site , but I 'm resisting the best I can .
Quick and dirty direct edit web authoring is a major win for collaboration .
Successful examples are blogs and wikis .
In the Business Models session of the event , Doug Heintzman from IBM told us how IBM has been learning from the Open Source development model and that they 're implementing it for other projects , even those that are n't with an Open Source license .
The Novell people told how they 've moved to wikis for project coordination .
If you are interested in Open Source , I think listening to the recordings is very worthwhile .
They can be listened to in any order .
If you are wondering how an Open Source project is really organized , or what it 's like to turn a proprietary software project into an Open Source one , at least listen to the third session .
I found it fascinating .
I am an avid reader of Joel Spolsky and Paul Graham .
Both of them are an inspiration to people considering a startup .
They have several articles which motivates people to do stuff they love and make money in the process .
But there are differences in their approaches .
Below , I try list 10 of them .
Starting up PG :
Get seed funding worth 3 months living expenses and start up !
JS : Do n't have enough to support you for 2 years ?
Come join my company .
It is cool working environment here .
Angels / VCs PG : Take further investment from Angels / VCs as and when required .
JS : Do n't ever think of VCs .
They are morons .
Magic formula PG : Start a startup .
Work ( really ) hard for 4 years .
Sell it to someone .
Solve the money problem .
JS : Build a BIG company little by little .
Microsoft PG : Microsoft is evil .
JS : Microsoft is good .
Basic principle PG : Based on his principle that working with co-founders on a rented apartment is the most productive phase .
ie. , eliminate MBAs .
JS : Based on his principle " built a company that is a great place to work " .
Specs PG : Prototype early .
ie. , Start with something .
Then hack and hack .
No need for a spec . ( LISP foundation ) JS : Spec it before you start implementing .
Process PG : No mention of process .
His approach is get the darn thing released .
JS : Implement the processes early : " 12 Steps to Better Code " .
Planning PG : Great hackers plan themselves when stuff happens .
There is no need to plan stuff .
JS : Plans for everything .
Painless schedules , painless bug tracking to be followed at a very early stage in the company .
Microsoft at Core PG : Start - up company founders building their company with MS tools for core things is doomed .
( Since great hackers hate it / do n't use MS tools voluntarily ) JS : Use MS or any tools if you are comfortable and can pay the $ $ to M$ .
Add your comments and I will put the best one I have missed here .
Personally , my favorite is ( you guessed it ! )
Paul .
But I like Joel 's essays also because of the Software Engineering related stuff .
[ UPDATE : Thanks everybody for adding the comments .
I am afraid I can't pick the best one I from the comments as there are a few good ones .
I think it is best kept in the comments column itself . ]

All Things Pythonic
Python 3000 - Adaptation or Generic Functions ?
by Guido van van Rossum
April 5 , 2006
Summary
We 've started discussing Python 3000 for real .
There 's a new mailing list and a branch .
The first point of order is about process ; a slew of meta - PEPs are being written ( and the goal is to avoid a repeat of Perl 6 :-) .
But I 'm blogging about a feature proposal that evolved dramatically over the past days .
Advertisement
Alex Martelli has been arguing for adaptation since the dawn of time ; and at various times he 's chided me for not seeing the light .
Well am I ever grateful for dragging my feet !
Adaptation
Let me first briefly describe adaptation , reduced to its simplest form .
The motivation comes from a common situation where an object wrapper is required ( aptly named the Adapter Pattern ) .
PEP 246 proposes a built - in function adapt ( X , P ) where X is any object and P a Protocol .
We intentionally do n't define what a protocol is ; all we care about that it can be represented by an object .
The call adapt ( X , P ) returns an object constructed from X that satisfies P , or raises an exception if it can't .
It uses a global registry which maps types and protocols to adapter functions ; we can write this as a dict R = { ( T , P ) : A , ...}. Then , adapt ( X , P ) computes the adapter A = R[ type ( X ) , P ] and then returns A ( X ) .
There is a registration function register ( T , P , A ) which simply sets R[ T , P ] = A. Read Alex 's post for a gentler explanation ( and lots of things I left out ) .
As soon as Alex had posted this version of how adaptation works , several people ( including myself ) independently realized that the global registry ( which has always been a sore point to some ) is a red herring ; the registry could just as well be separated out per protocol !
So now we make adapt ( ) and register ( ) methods on the protocol : instead of adapt ( X , P ) we write P.adapt ( X ) and instead of register ( T , P , A ) we write P.register ( T , A ) .
The signature of A is unchanged .
I call this " second - generation adaptation " .
The nice thing about this is that you no longer have a fixed global implementation of exactly what register ( ) and adapt ( ) do .
Alex mentions a whole slew of issues he 's ignoring but that would need to be addressed for a real - life implementation , such as how to handle adaptation for an object where its type has n't been registered but some base type has been registered ; or the notion of inheritance between protocols ( useful when you equate protocols with interfaces , as in Zope and Twisted ) ; or automatic detection of the where an object already implements a protocol / interface ( again useful in Zope and Twisted ) .
Several of those extensions make lookup performance an issue , and there are different ways to address that .
By having multiple protocol implementations ( each implementing the same adapt ( ) and register ( ) APIs ) each framework can have its own notion of how adaptation works for its own protocols , without having to deal with a fixed global implementation of adaptation that may or may not do the best thing for a particular framework .
Generic Functions
But then Ian Bicking posted a competing idea : instead of adaptation , why do n't we use generic functions ?
In his and Phillip Eby 's view these are more powerful than adapters , yet in some sense equivalent .
Let me briefly describe generic functions to set the stage .
A generic function , G , is a callable that behaves like a function ( taking arguments and returning a value ) but whose implementation is extensible and can be spread across different modules .
TG contains a registry of implementations which is indexed by a tuple of the combined types of the arguments .
Suppose we want G to be callable with two arguments , then the registry would map type pairs to implementation functions .
We 'd write G.register ( ( T1 , T2 ) , F ) to indicate that F ( X1 , X2 ) is a suitable implementation for G ( X1 , X2 ) when type ( X1 ) ==T1 and type ( X2 ) ==T2 .
The simplest implementation would just map the arguments to their types ( or better , classes ) , convert to a tuple , and use that as a key in the registry to find the implementation function .
If that key is not found , a default implementation is invoked ; this is provided when G is first defined and can either provide some fallback action or raise an exception .
A useful implementation of generic functions must also support looking for matches on the base types of the argument types .
This is where things get hairy , at least when you have multiple arguments .
For example , if you have a solution that is an exact match on the first argument and a base type match on the second , and another that is a base type match on the first argument an exact match on the second ; which do you prefer ?
Phillip Eby 's implementation , RuleDispatch ( part of PEAK ) refuses to guess ; if there is n't one dominant solution ( whatever that means ) it raises an exception .
You can always cut the tie by registering a more specific signature .
C++ users will recognize generic functions as a run-time implementation of the strategy used by the C++ compiler to resolve function overloading .
Fortunately we 're not bound by backwards compatibility with C to repeat C++'s mistakes ( which , for example , can cause a float to be preferred over a bool ) .
Lisp or Dylan users ( are there any left ? :-) and PyPy developers will recognize them as multi-methods .
In order to contrast and compare the two ideas , I posted a very simple version of adaptation and generic functions , applied to the idea of reimplementing the built - in iter ( ) function .
I used descriptors for registration , making the signatures slightly different from what I showed above , but the essence is the same .
The Lightbulb Went Off
Now we 're ready for the Aha ! moment ( already implicit in Ian 's and Phillip 's position ) , brought home by an altenative version of the Protocol independently developed by Tim Hochberg : P.adapt ( X ) is just a verbose way of spelling a generic function call G ( X ) !
Interestingly , it took
Alex a little time to like this -- he was thinking of adaptation as more powerful because it can return an object implementing several methods , while doing the same thing with generic functions would required a separate generic function for each method .
But of course we can write a generic factory function , which returns an object with multiple methods , just like adapt ( ) can ; and the generic function approach wins in the ( common ) case where we want to adapt to a " point protocol " -- an interface with just one method , which we immediately call in order to obtain the desired result .
When using adaptation , this would require each adapter to use a helper class with a single method that does the desired operation ; when using a generic function , the generic function can just do the operation .
And we have n't even used generic function dispatch on multiple arguments !
I 'm not sure where this will eventually lead ; but I 've already killed PEP 246 ( adaptation ) and PEP 245 ( interfaces ) in anticipation of a more " generic " proposal .

The Financial Services Authority has launched an inquiry into the effects of Hurricane Katrina on insurers as fears grow that a number face financial collapse .
Industry sources say that underwriters are expecting the biggest hit in history , far exceeding the $ 32 billion cost of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Several insurance syndicates operating in the Lloyd's of London insurance market are understood to have been badly affected , as well as a number of UK - registered groups based in Bermuda .
The FSA has written to insurers and reinsurers - groups which take on underwriting risks from primary insurers - asking for information about their liabilities and about the likely impact of Katrina on their solvency ratios - key measures which determine an insurer 's ability to meet its obligations .
The letters , leaked to The Observer , show the FSA has acted swiftly to ensure there is ' no systemic risk ' to the smooth operation of the industry following the hurricane .
Goshawk Insurance Holdings , a UK - listed reinsurer with Bermudian operations , is exposed to Katrina and is reported to be looking at ways of raising fresh capital .
The insurance group wants to prevent ratings agencies from downgrading its creditworthiness , which could make it harder to attract business .
Another insurer , Alea , has said it may have to put itself up for sale after an agency removed its A rating .
The FSA has also written to the London offices of the big European reinsurance groups as it tries to gauge the financial fall - out .
Germany 's Hanover Re , the world 's fourth - largest reinsurer , has already warned that Katrina will affect its earnings forecasts ; competitors such as Munich Re and Swiss Re have said they may be forced to revise upwards their estimates of how much Katrina has cost them .
But Bermudian reinsurers specialising in natural catastrophes may be the worst hit .
The ultimate insurance tally wo n't be known for some time as the cost of flood damage is picked up by the federal government .
Analysts point out that there are bound to be arguments over what was destroyed as a result of the hurricane and what by flooding .
Forecaster RMS published data last week suggesting that the final insurance bill would be between $ 40bn and $ 60bn .
Insurance companies in the region are to be forced to extend the claims period , to give residents of New Orleans more chance to get their affairs in order .
The order , from the Louisiana state commissioner , means insurers will not be able to withdraw cover if further storms hit the stricken city .
Last week , Lloyd 's insurer Beazley estimated its exposure to the disaster at $ 50 million .
Chief executive Andrew Beazley , said profits could be hit by £ 20 m .
Insurance premiums are set to rise sharply in the wake of the hurricane , say experts .
1 cup of water
1/2 cup of vinegar
1 tablespoon finely chopped red bell pepper
3/4 teaspoon mustard seeds .
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon whole black peppers
1/4 teaspoon sugar
2 gloves of garlic , sliced or chopped .
1 pound of whole mushrooms ( small to medium size )
I love marinated mushrooms !
So much so that when the olive bar where I usually got them decided to change the recipe they were using , I researched the subject , and went on to try 4 diffrerent recipes , and was not satisified with any of them .
So I borrowed from 2 of them , and based on what I knew I liked , and created my own version .
Here ’s the result of my experiment and I ’m quite happy about the result .
Total time : 25 minutes
Ready the next day .
Brush the the mushrooms and wash them .
Cut a 1 /2 of the stem off .
Combine everything but the mushrooms into a pan and bring to a boil .
Add the mushrooms and boil covered for 10 minutes .
Refrigerate overnight .
Serve as an apetizer or as part of an antipasti plate .
To avoid wasting the rest of the red bell pepper , why not make marinated red bell peppers at the same time ?
Looking for an alternative to marinated mushrooms ?
Try Mushrooms a la grecque .
THE RIOTING IN France by primarily Muslim youths and the hotel bombings in Jordan are the latest events to prompt sincere questions that law - abiding Muslims need to answer for Islam ’s sake , as well as for the sake of worried non-Muslims .
Here are five of them :
(1) Why are you so quiet ?
Since the first Israelis were targeted for death by Muslim terrorists blowing themselves up in the name of your religion and Palestinian nationalism , I have been praying to see Muslim demonstrations against these atrocities .
Last week ’s protests in Jordan against the bombings , while welcome , were a rarity .
What I have seen more often is mainstream Muslim spokesmen implicitly defending this terror on the grounds that Israel occupies Palestinian lands .
We see torture and murder in the name of Allah , but we see no anti-torture and anti-murder demonstrations in the name of Allah .

There are a billion Muslims in the world .
How is it possible that essentially none have demonstrated against evils perpetrated by Muslims in the name of Islam ?
This is true even of the millions of Muslims living in free Western societies .
What are non-Muslims of goodwill supposed to conclude ?
When the Israeli government did not stop a Lebanese massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982 , great crowds of Israeli Jews gathered to protest their country ’s moral failing .
Why has there been no comparable public demonstration by Palestinians or other Muslims to morally condemn Palestinian or other Muslim - committed terror ?
(2) Why are none of the Palestinian terrorists Christian ?
If Israeli occupation is the reason for Muslim terror in Israel , why do no Christian Palestinians engage in terror ?
They are just as nationalistic and just as occupied as Muslim Palestinians .
(3) Why is only one of the 47 Muslim - majority countries a free country ?
Advertisement
According to Freedom House , a Washington - based group that promotes democracy , of the world ’s 47 Muslim countries , only Mali is free .
Sixty percent are not free , and 38 % are partly free .
Muslim - majority states account for a majority of the world ’s “ not free ” states .
And of the 10 “ worst of the worst , ” seven are Islamic states .
Why is this ?
(4) Why are so many atrocities committed and threatened by Muslims in the name of Islam ?
Young girls in Indonesia were recently beheaded by Muslim murderers .
Last year , Muslims -- in the name of Islam -- murdered hundreds of schoolchildren in Russia .
While reciting Muslim prayers , Islamic terrorists take foreigners working to make Iraq free and slaughter them .
Muslim daughters are murdered by their own families in the thousands in “ honor killings . ”
And the Muslim government in Iran has publicly called for the extermination of Israel .
(5) Why do countries governed by religious Muslims persecute other religions ?
Advertisement
No church or synagogue is allowed in Saudi Arabia .
The Taliban destroyed some of the greatest sculptures of the ancient world because they were Buddhist .
Sudan ’s Islamic regime has murdered great numbers of Christians .
Instead of confronting these problems , too many of you deny them .
Muslims call my radio show to tell me that even speaking of Muslim or Islamic terrorists is wrong .
After all , they argue , Timothy McVeigh is never labeled a “ Christian terrorist . ”
As if McVeigh committed his terror as a churchgoing Christian and in the name of Christ , and as if there were Christian - based terror groups around the world .
As a member of the media for nearly 25 years , I have a long record of reaching out to Muslims .
Muslim leaders have invited me to speak at major mosques .
In addition , I have studied Arabic and Islam , have visited most Arab and many other Muslim countries and conducted interfaith dialogues with Muslims in the United Arab Emirates as well as in the U.S.
Politically , I have supported creation of a Palestinian state and supported ( mistakenly , I now believe ) the Oslo accords .
Hundreds of millions of non-Muslims want honest answers to these questions , even if the only answer you offer is , “ Yes , we have real problems in Islam . ”
Such an acknowledgment is infinitely better -- for you and for the world -- than dismissing us as anti-Muslim .

We await your response .
PEOPLE who smile a lot and say " have a nice day " are headed to an early grave while the grumpy stay fit .
Researchers at a German university - a land where surliness is an Olympic discipline - say enforced jolliness on the job is much more likely to make people fall ill .
They cite flight attendants , sales personnel , call centre operators , waiters and others in contact with the public for extended periods of time as being at risk of seriously harming their .
Psychologists at Frankfurt University said the fake friendliness led to depression , stress and a lowering of the immune system itself , which in turn can trigger more serious ailments .
" Every time a person is forced to repress his true feelings there are negative consequences for his , " said Professor Dieter Zapf , a researcher into human emotions .
The study tested students working in an imaginary call centre who were subject to abuse from clients .
Some of the participants were allowed to answer back , while others had to be polite and friendly all the time .
Those who stood up to clients had a rapid heartbeat for a brief period , but for those who had to remain friendly their heart was still racing long after the client had hung up .
The conclusion reached by the psychologists was that " being friendly against one 's will causes nothing but stress " .
Flight attendants , shop assistants and carers also took part in the study of emotional behaviour , which involved 4000 people , Professor Zapf said .
" We are all able to rein in our emotions , " he said .
" It becomes difficult when you have to do this over a protracted period as cabin attendants are forced to on long - haul flights .
" These people need space away from the passengers where they can be on their own and let their feelings run free .
We have to get away from the ' customer is king ' attitude and show more respect to those working in the service industries , " Professor Zapf said .
LONDON , Sept. 11 — In his first major foreign policy address , David Cameron , the leader of Britain ’s opposition Conservatives , sought today to distance his party from what he called a “ slavish ” bond between Britain and the United States established by Tony Blair .
As he spoke , Mr. Cameron asked a well - heeled audience of several hundred bankers and policy experts in London ’s financial district to bow their heads in silence at the precise moment when the first hijacked plane slammed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Mr. Cameron is the main opposition contender likely to challenge whoever takes over the ruling Labor Party from Mr. Blair , who has promised to quit within a year .
Mr. Cameron ’s remarks were designed partly to demarcate his foreign policy sharply from that of Mr. Blair , for whom the war in Iraq and the association with President Bush has proved politically damaging .
The speech was also intended to draw a line under previous Conservative policy .
Mr. Cameron himself supported the Iraq invasion in 2003 , but , said a senior Conservative who requested anonymity under party rules , “ we do n’t want to have an endless fight about what happened three or four years ago .
This is about the next 10 years . ”
IN 2003 , towards the end of the dotcom depression , Dale Dougherty and Tim O'Reilly , the founders of O'Reilly Media , a book publisher and conference firm , were brainstorming , and Mr Dougherty dropped the term “ Web 2.0 ” .
It was an allusion to the nomenclature for software upgrades , and Mr Dougherty was applying it to what he hoped would be a second generation of the internet .
“ We think of ourselves as an enzyme , ” says Mr O'Reilly .
“ When we see something coalescing , we give it a name . ”
In marketing terms , it has been a great success .
In 2004 Mr O'Reilly and a partner , John Battelle , started a new annual conference , called Web 2.0 , which has become a big event for Silicon Valley 's aristocracy .
“ Web 3.0 ” is already discussed at Web 2.0 , the conference .
But what is Web 2.0 ?
It began with a specific and useful definition .
In contrast to the static web pages of the 1990s , the second wave of websites would use software ( such as AJAX , or “ asynchronous JavaScript and XML ” ) that makes web pages look like dynamic software applications that traditionally run only on personal computers .
These applications , moreover , would work with one another in so - called “ mash -ups ” .
Google Maps , for instance , is a web page that not only updates itself constantly but can also share data with other websites to yield independent web pages that display , say , crimes committed or houses for rent in an area .
At some point “ Web 2.0 ” took on a life of its own , being applied to online social networks , collective intelligence , blogging and podcasting and “ participation ” in general .
It started being used in sentences that also contained other buzzwords , such as the “ long tail ” , “ folksonomies ” , or the “ semantic web ” .
It is in danger of meeting the fate of “ core ” , “ synergy ” , and “ leverage ” , but , for the time being , Mr O'Reilly is delighted .

OpenSSH を使った簡易 VPN の構 築
back
概要
2006 年 2月に公開された OpenSSH 4.3 ( およびその移植 版 4.3p1 ) から、 標準でトンネリングデバイス ( tun/tap ) を扱う機能がつきました。 これを使うと、手軽に VPN を構築することができます。 現在のところまだ機能はごく限られたものですが、 出先から一時的に ssh 経由で NFS ディレクトリを マウントするなどの目的に使えます。 この文書ではそのための基本的な方法を説明します。
OpenSSH の設定と運用ができ、公開鍵認証の使い方を わかっているシステム管理者を対象としています。
公開鍵認証とは : パスワードのかわりに秘密鍵と公開鍵のペアを使う認証方法です。
通常のパスワードを使った認証では、 たとえ暗号化されているとはいえパスワードがネットワーク上を流れます。
公開鍵認証ではパスワードはまったく ( 暗号化された形ですら ) ネットワーク上に流れないので、
こちらのほうが安全です。もちろん公開鍵認証でもユーザはパスワードに相当するもの
( パスフレーズ ) を入力しますが、パスワード認証と違いこれはローカルマシン上で
秘密鍵を復号するためだけに使われ、ネットワーク上には流れません。
注意 : この機能はまだ実験段階のため 、OpenSSH が動作するすべてのプラットフォームで動作するかどうかは 確認されていません ( この文書では 、Linux と FreeBSD でテストしました ) 。
また、細かい部分が今後変わることもありえます。ご利用は自己責任で。
OpenSSH を使った VPN の利点と欠 点
利点
ほぼ標準の環境で VPN を構築できる 。
OpenSSH と同じ認証方式が使え、お手軽。
欠点
クライアントとサーバの両方で root 権限をもてる人しか使えない ( VPN の確立が双方の root 権限を必要とするため ) 。
VPN の IP アドレスとネットワークインターフェイス を
サーバ/クライアントの両方であらかじめ決めておく必要がある。
TCP 上に実装しているので 、IPSec のような機構と比べると効率が悪い ( 暗号化された IP パケットを TCP で送っている ) 。
トンネリングのしく み
OpenSSH を使った VPN では tun / tap デバイスというものを使います。 tun / tap デバイスはユーザー空間のプログラムが利用できる仮想ネットワークデバイスで、 この tun / tap デバイスをサーバとクライアントの両方で開き、 その間の通信を
OpenSSH が暗号化すると VPN ができあがります。 今のところ Linux や * BSD でサポートされています 。
tun / tap を使ったトンネリングは 2 種類に分けられます。 ひとつは tun デバイスを使う方法で、これは Layer 3 ( Point - to - Point ) を エミュレートし 、IP フレームを転送します。 これは PPP プロトコルを使ってサーバと 1対1 で通信するのと等価です。 VPN が正しく動いていると 、Linux ではこれは次のように見えます :
# ifconfig tun0 tun0 Link encap: UNSPEC HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00 inet addr:192.168.3.1 P-t- P:192.168.3.2 Mask :255.255.255.255 UP
POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns : 0 frame:0 TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen :10 RX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b) TX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b ) # ping 192.168.3.2 PING 192.168.3.2 ( 192.168.3.2 ) from 192.168.3.1 : 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data . 64 bytes from 192.168.3.2 : icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time =16.8 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.3.2 : icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time =16.1 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.3.2 : icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time =18.3 ms ...
もうひとつは tap デバイスを使う方法で、 これは Layer 2 ( Ethernet ) をエミュレートし 、Ethernet フレームを転送します。 VPN が正しく動いていると 、Linux では次のように見えます :
# ifconfig tap0 tap0 Link encap : Ethernet HWaddr 00 : FF:7F:02:53:D7 inet addr:192.168.3.1 Bcast : 192.168.3.255 Mask :255.255.255.0 UP
BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns : 0 frame:0 TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen : 1000 RX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b) TX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b ) # ping 192.168.3.2 PING 192.168.3.2 ( 192.168.3.2 ) from 192.168.3.1 : 56 ( 84 ) bytes of data . 64 bytes from 192.168.3.2 : icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=37.6 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.3.2 : icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time =16.1 ms 64 bytes from 192.168.3.2 : icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time =16.6 ms ...
下準備
OpenSSH で VPN を使うには、以下のものがサーバとクライアントの両方で必要です :
OpenSSH 4.3p1 以上。
tun /tap デバイスの使えるカーネル。( Linux , FreeBSD , OpenBSD など )
OpenSSH は普通にソースまたはパッケージからインストールすれば
OK です。 tun / tap デバイスの準備は 、OS ごとにやり方が異なっています 。
Linuxの場合 :
tun / tap ドライバは、通常、モジュールの形 ( モジュール名 tun ) で提供されます。 最近のほとんど の
Linux ディストリビューションでは、 このモジュールは標準で含まれているので、 ただ /etc/modules.conf に以下のように書いておけば OK です。
alias tap0 tun alias tun0 tun
( ここでは tun / tap デバイスとしてどちらもインターフェイス番号 0 を使うと仮定しています、 これ以外の番号を使う場合は適宜修正してください)
手動でモジュールを作成する場合は、カーネル構築の際に
" Network Device Support " の 項目 " Universal TUN / TAP device driver support " ( CONFIG_TUN ) に チェックを入れる必要があります。 devfs / udev を使っていない場合は以下のようにしてデバイスノード
/ dev / net / tun を作成する必要があります 。
# mkdir / dev/net # mknod / dev/net / tun c 10 200 # chmod 0700 / dev/net/tun
あとは以下のようにしてモジュールをロードします。
# modprobe tun
tun / tap デバイスについての詳細は 、Linux カーネルのソースコード中にある Documentation / networking/tuntap.txt を見てください。
FreeBSDの場合 :
FreeBSD の場合は conf ファイル中でオプション " device tun " を有効にしておきます 。 FreeBSD 6.0 では、必要なデバイスノードは devfs により自動的に作成されます 。
クライアントとサーバを設定する
最初に決めておくこと :
OpenSSH で VPN を使う際に注意しなければならないのは、 「 クライアント側の root プロセスが、サーバに root としてログインする 」 ということです。 これは tun / tap デバイスを扱えるのが通常は双方の root だけであるためです ( 一般ユーザに tun / tap を許可することもやろうと思えばできるかもしれませんが、 試していません。一般的には、これはセキュリティ上問題があるとされています ) 。 そのため、VPN クライアントとサーバの両方で root ユーザの ssh 設定を作成する必要があります 。
また、お手軽であるとはいっても、OpenSSH
を使った VPN では あらかじめクライアントとサーバの間でいくつかの事柄を 決めておく必要があります :
tun ( Layer 3 ) デバイスを使うか tap ( Layer 2 ) デバイスを使うか 。
サーバ側の仮想 IP アドレスと tun / tap デバイスのインターフェイス番号 ( 通常は 0 ) 。
クライアント側の仮想 IP アドレスと tun / tap デバイスのインターフェイス番号 ( 通常は 0 ) 。
( ここでい う 「 ネットワークデバイスのインターフェイス番号」とは、 tun0 などの名前に含まれる数字の部分です。)
まずクライアント側の root 用に RSA 秘密鍵 / 公開鍵ペアをつくります
( SSH2 プロトコル用です - 古い SSH1 プロトコルでは VPN は使えません ) :
client # ssh - keygen
Enter file in which to save the key ( / root/.ssh/id_rsa ) : Enter passphrase ( empty for no passphrase ) : パスフレーズを入 力
Enter same passphrase again : パスフレーズを入 力
Your identification has been saved in /root /.ssh /id_rsa .
Your public key has been saved in /root /.ssh /id_rsa .
The key fingerprint is : 7c:7a:b5:5e:13:80:43:f3:0e:66:1f:9b:0a:d0:10:17 root@client
サーバ側にこの公開鍵 ( id_rsa.pub ) を送り、 サーバの / root/.ssh/authorized_keys ファイルに登録するなどして、 この秘密鍵をもつユーザに root ログインを許可してやります 。
次にサーバ側の sshd 設定ファイル ( 通常は /etc/ssh/sshd_config ) の PermitTunnel 項目を書き換えます。 この項目には以下のような値が指定できます :
point - to - point … Layer 3 のトンネリングのみを許可 ( tunデバイスを使用 )
… Layer 3 のトンネリングのみを許可 ( tunデバイスを使用 ) ethernet … Layer 2 のトンネリングのみを許可 ( tapデバイスを使用 )
… Layer 2 のトンネリングのみを許可 ( tapデバイスを使用 ) yes … 両方のタイプのトンネリングを許可 ( クライアントがトンネリングのタイプを選べる)
… 両方のタイプのトンネリングを許可 ( クライアントがトンネリングのタイプを選べる ) no … トンネリングを許可しな い
PermitTunnel point - to - point
さらに、ふつうリモートからの root ログインを禁止している ( PermitRootLogin no にしている ) ところが多いと思うので、 この部分も変更する必要があります。とりあえず今のところは
PermitRootLogin without - password
このあとサーバ側の sshd を再起動し、設定を反映させてください 。
テストす る
最初に、いちばん単純な最小限の設定でテストをしてみます。
本来 tun / tap デバイスを使って通信するには、 それらのインターフェイスを初期化したあと ifconfig を実行し、 IP アドレスを設定する必要があるのですが、ssh はただ単に tun / tap を初期化して 暗号化トンネルを提供するだけです。つまり、実際のインターフェイスの設定は 外部のコマンドに任されているのです。この部分を自動化することもできますが、 設定が複雑になるので、とりあえず最初はこれらを手動でおこなうことにして、 まずトンネルが確立できるかどうかだけをテストしてみることにします。
VPN を開始するには、クライアント上で以下のコマンドを実行します :
client # ssh - v - w0:0 server Enter passphrase for key ' / root/.ssh/id_rsa ' : ( パスフレーズを入力 )
- w はトンネリングを指定するオプションで、 -w クライアント側のインターフェイス番号 : サーバ側のインターフェイス番号 のように指定します。デフォルトではトンネリング用のデバイスとして tun が使われます。 つまり、 - w0:0 はクライアント・サーバともにインターフェイス番号
0 の tun デバイスを 使って VPN を確立するということを意味しています。 -v はデバッグ用の出力を表示するオプションです。
うまくいけば次のようなメッセージ ( Linux の場合 ) が出て、通常のシェルが開始されます :
... debug1 : Authentication succeeded ( publickey ) .
debug1 : channel 0 : new [ client - session ] debug1 : Entering interactive session .
debug1 : Requesting tun .
debug1 : sys_tun_open : tun0 mode 1 fd 7 debug1 : channel 1 : new [ tun ]
Last login : Mon Feb 13 10:30:42 2006 from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx server #
問題があった場 合
以下のようなメッセージが出てすぐに終了してしまう場合は、 クライアント側での tun/tap デバイスの設定に問題があります:
... debug1 : Authentication succeeded ( publickey ) .
debug1 : channel 0 : new [ client - session ] debug1 : Entering interactive session .
debug1 : Requesting tun .
debug1 : sys_tun_open : failed to open tunnel control interface :
No such device debug1 : client_input_channel_req : channel 0 rtype exit - status reply 0 debug1 : channel 0 : free : client - session , nchannels 1 Connection to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx closed .
debug1 : Transferred : stdin 0 , stdout 0 , stderr 40 bytes in 0.1 seconds debug1 : Bytes per second : stdin 0.0 , stdout 0.0 , stderr 672.2 debug1 : Exit status 0 debug1 : compress outgoing : raw data 347 , compressed 211 , factor 0.61 debug1 : compress incoming : raw data 61 , compressed 47 , factor 0.77
エラーの原因は 赤色の部分 に書かれています。 上の例は、カーネルが tun / tap デバイスを使えるように設定されていないことを示しています。 この部分が " debug1 : sys_tun_open : failed to open tunnel control interface :
No such file or directory " だった場合、対応するデバイスノードが / dev 以下に存在しないことを示しています 。
いっぽう、サーバ側に問題がある場合は次のようになります:
... debug1 : Authentication succeeded ( publickey ) .
debug1 : channel 0 : new [ client - session ] debug1 : Entering interactive session .
debug1 : Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing .
debug1 : Requesting authentication agent forwarding .
debug1 : Requesting tun .
debug1 : sys_tun_open : tun0 mode 1 fd 7 debug1 : channel 1 : new [ tun ] debug1 : Remote : Failed to open the tunnel device .
channel 1 : open failed : administratively prohibited : open failed debug1 : channel 1 : free : tun , nchannels 2
これはサーバ側の ( 権限がない、あるいはデバイスが設定されていないなどの理由で ) tun/tap デバイスが使用できないことを示しています。 あるいは、 " debug1 : Remote : Server has rejected tunnel device forwarding " と出力された場合は、サーバ側でトンネルの使用が許可されていない ( PermitTunnel の値が正しくない ) ことを示しています 。
サーバ側で問題が起きた場合、ssh はトンネリングなしでシェルを起動するか、
あるいは自動的に接続を切ってしまいます。
クライアント側で問題が起きた場合、ssh はすぐに終了するようです。
うまくいった場 合
さて、うまくトンネリングができている場合は、サーバとクライアントの両方で tun デバイスが初期化されているはずです。 これは ifconfig tun0 ( あるいは ifconfig - a ) を実行してみればわかります :
( Linux の場合 ) # ifconfig tun0 tun0 Link encap : UNSPEC HWaddr 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00 POINTOPOINT
NOARP MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns : 0 frame:0 TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen :10 RX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b) TX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b ) ( FreeBSD の場合 ) # ifconfig tun0 tun0 : flags=8011 <UP , POINTOPOINT , MULTICAST > mtu 1500 Opened by PID 24015
トンネリングできていない状態で ifconfig tun0 を実行すると、 Linux ではインターフェイス tun0 そのものが存在せずエラーとなり、 FreeBSD では " Opened by PID XXXX " の部分が表示されません。 上のように表示されている場合はトンネリングが確立しています。
ただし、この状態ではサーバとクライアントの tun デバイス間に通信路が確立されただけで、 まだ IP 層の設定は完了していません。通信を行うためにはサーバとクライアント両方の tun インターフェイス
にIP アドレスを設定してやる必要があります。 ここでは別の端末を使って、クライアントとサーバ上の両方で tun デバイスを設定しま す
( あとあとこれは自動的に行うよう設定しますが、いまは両方とも手動でやってみます ) 。
tun デバイスは IP 層をエミュレートする ( つまり 、IP パケットを直接送受信する ) ので、 Ethernet のインターフェイスとは違って、 相手方の IP アドレスも指定してやる必要があります 。
( Linux の場合 ) # ifconfig tun0 自分 のIPアドレス pointopoint 相手 のIPアドレス ( point to pointではないので注意 ) ( FreeBSD の場合 ) # ifconfig tun0 自分 のIPアドレス 相手 のIPアドレ ス
これをサーバとクライアントの両方で実行します。 たとえばサーバ側の仮想 IP アドレス を 192.168.3.1、 クライアント側の仮想 IP アドレス を 192.168.3.2 に決めたとすると、 以下のようになります :
( サーバ側 - Linux の場合 ) server # ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.1 pointopoint 192.168.3.2 ( クライアント側 - Linux の場合 ) client # ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.2 pointopoint 192.168.3.1
これが成功したら、いまや IP レベルでの 通信ができるようになっているはずですので、 お互いに ping を送って確かめてみましょう 。
( サーバ側 ) server # ping 192.168.3.2 ( サーバからクライアントに ping ) ( クライアント側 ) client # ping 192.168.3.1 ( クライアントからサーバに ping )
あとは通常のプライベートネットワークと同じように利用できます。
NFS を利用するなり 、NAT を設定するなり自由にしてください。 なお 、NFS ディレクトリをマウントするときは 、TCP オプションをつけることを おすすめします ( 速度が違います ) 。
VPN を終了す る
VPN セッションはユーザがログアウトしたあとも続きます。 先ほどのデバッグモードで root のシェルから exit すると、 ssh はシェルから抜けたあとも依然として VPN のセッションを続けます :
server # exit logout debug1 : client_input_channel_req : channel 0 rtype exit - status reply 0 debug1 : channel 0 : free : client - session , nchannels 2 ( ここで Control - C を入力 ) debug1 : channel 1 : free : tun , nchannels 1 Killed by signal 2 .
現在のところ、 VPN セッションを終了するには端末上で Control - C を押すか、 ssh クライアントを kill する以外に方法はないようです 。
tun のかわりに tap を使 う
同様に、今度は tun ではなく tap デバイスを使っ て Ethernet レベルのトンネリングをやってみます。 トンネリングのさいに tun を使うか tap を使うかは、 サーバとクライアント両方の設定に依存しています。 サーバは許可するトンネリングの種類を sshd_config の PermitTunnel 項目で指定し、 クライアントは要求するトンネリングの種類を ~/.ssh / config ( あるいは ssh_config か、 ssh のコマンドラインオプション ) の
Tunnel 項目で指定します。 これらの項目とトンネリングの種類との関係は、以下のようになっています :
PermitTunnel ( サーバ ) と Tunnel ( クライアント ) の値 効果 両方が yes PPP ( tun ) が使われる どちらか一方が yes ( または point - to - point ) で、 もう一方が point - to - point PPP ( tun ) が使われる どちらか一方が yes ( または ethernet ) で、 もう一方が ethernet Ethernet ( tap ) が使われる どちらか一方が point - to - point で、 もう一方が ethernet トンネリングは拒否される どちらか一方が no トンネリングは拒否され る
これらの項目を正しく設定すると、tun のときと同じように以下のコマンドで VPN が開始できます :
client # ssh - v - w0:0 server
あるいは、設定ファイルを書きかえるかわりに、 ssh のコマンドラインオプションから直接指定することもできます。
client # ssh - v - oTunnel=ethernet - w0:0 server
ここで -w オプションに与えている 数値 0 は今度は tun ではなく tap のインターフェイス番号です 。
無事サーバにログインできたら、 ifconfig tap0 してみてください :
( Linux の場合 ) # ifconfig tap0 tap0 Link encap : Ethernet HWaddr 00 : FF:4A:21:8F:3D BROADCAST MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns : 0 frame:0 TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier: 0 collisions:0 txqueuelen : 1000 RX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b) TX bytes:0 ( 0.0 b ) ( FreeBSD の場合 ) # ifconfig tap0 tap0 : flags=8843<UP , BROADCAST , RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST > mtu 1500 ether 00 :bd:73:36:60:c8 Opened by PID 93688
デバイスができているのを確認したら、IP
アドレスを設定してやります。 tap デバイスの場合はエミュレートするのが Ethernet なので、 ここでは通常のネットワークカードにアドレスを指定するのと同じ方法で
OK です。
( サーバ側 ) server # ifconfig tap0 192.168.3.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 ( クライアント側 ) client # ifconfig tap0 192.168.3.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
実際に運用す る
さて、実際に日常的に使うとなると、いちいちサーバとクライアントの両方で
毎回 ifconfig を実行しているわけにはいきません。 またリモートからの root のシェル使用を禁止したい人もいるでしょう。 クライアントとサーバの設定をおこなうことによって、これらの作業をほぼ自動化することができます
( といっても、まだ完璧ではありません。現在の実装では、
IP アドレスとネットワークインターフェイス番号は、 サーバとクライアントの両方で前もって取り決めておかねばならず、
2 台以上のクライアントが同時に VPN を使う場合は少々注意が必要になります。 )
クライアント側で VPN 用の /root/.ssh/ config を書く
最初に、クライアント側の設定を自動化してみましょう。 root のホームディレクトリに、以下のような設定ファイルを置きます :
( Linux の場合 ) client # cat / root /.ssh / config Host server-vpn Hostname server.example.com
Port xxx User root IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_rsa Tunnel point - to - point TunnelDevice 0:0 PermitLocalCommand yes LocalCommand ( sleep 3 ; ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.2 pointopoint 192.168.3.1 ) &
最初の 4 つの設定項目 ( Hostname , Port , User , IdentityFile ) は、 標準的なものです。これらはサーバのホスト名、ポート番号 ( 頻発してい る ssh へのアタックのため、現在では sshd をデフォルト以外の ポートで動かしている人も多いでしょう ) 、ログインするユーザ名、そして秘密鍵ファイルを 指定しています。次 の 4 つの設定項目 ( Tunnel , TunnelDevice , PermitLocalCommand , LocalCommand ) が、 4.3 で VPN を使用するために新たに追加されたオプションです :
Tunnel … トンネリングの種類 ( yes , point - to - point , ethernet あるいは no ) 。
… トンネリングの種類 ( , , あるいは ) 。
TunnelDevice …トンネリングに使うクライアントとサーバのインターフェイス番号
( クライアント側のインターフェイス番号 : サーバ側のインターフェイス番号 のように指定する、これはコマンドラインの -w オプションと同じ形式 ) 。
… トンネリングに使うクライアントとサーバのインターフェイス番号
( のように指定する、これはコマンドラインの オプションと同じ形式 ) 。
PermitLocalCommand … 認証が成功したあと、 クライアントの側で 自動的にコマンド実行するかどうか ( yes あるいは no ) 。
… 認証が成功したあと、 自動的にコマンド実行するかどうか ( あるいは ) 。
LocalCommand … 認証が成功したあと、クライアントの側で自動的に実行するコマンド文字列。
Tunnel についてはすでに説明しました。 TunnelDevice は、基本的にコマンドラインの -w オプションで やっていたことと同じです。違うのは PermitLocalCommand と LocalCommand で、 この 2つを指定するとサーバの認証が成功したあとで、ローカルのクライアント上で 自動的に特定のコマンドを実行させることができます。ここでは、この機能を使って クライアント側の ifconfig を実行させています 。
さて、上の例では LocalCommand がおかしな形になっていますが、 これは現時点 ( 4.3 p2 ) での ssh のアホな仕様のせいです。これを書いている時点の ssh は、 LocalCommand の実行が完了したあとに tun / tap デバイスをオープンするのです。 しかし Linux では tun / tap デバイスが使われていない ( どのプロセスも open していない ) 状態では、 ifconfig で設定することはできません。 したがって LocalCommand を実行する時点では、まだ tun / tap は開かれておらず、 以下のようなエラーが出てしまいます :
SIOCSIFDSTADDR :
No such device tun0 : unknown interface :
No such device
さいわい、 LocalCommand は指定されたコマンド文字列をそのままシェルに渡すので
( つまりこれ は sh -c " ( sleep 3 ; ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.2 pointopoint 192.168.3.1 ) & " と同じです ) 、 いったん LocalCommand のシェルを終了させてから、 バックグラウンドで ifconfig を実行させることができます。 ここで最初に sleep 3 を指定しているのは 、LocalCommand が実行されてから 3 秒後にはおそらく tun0 インターフェイスが使用できる状態になっているであろうと期待しています。 ssh は LocalCommand プロセスの終了を待ちますので、 この行全体を ( ) でくくってバックグラウンドで実行させてやります。 これで一応、認証すると自動的に ifconfig が実行されるようにはなるのですが、 付け焼刃的な感じは否めません。 ( 一応これを修正するパッチを openssh - unix - dev に送ったのですが、いまんとこ無視されてます )
いっぽう FreeBSD の場合は、tun を開く前でも ifconfig が使えるので、 とくに sleep などの技を使わなくても、ふつう に
LocalCommand ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.2 192.168.3.1
なお、ここでやっている ifconfig を直接実行する方法も実はあまりおすすめできません。 RedHat 系の Linux であれ ば
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-tun0 などの 設定ファイルを作っておき、直接 ifconfig を実行するかわりに /sbin/ifup tun0 とするのが正統なやり方でしょう。
うまくいけば、以下のように入力するだけで ( クライアント側の ) VPN は準備完了になるはずです :
client # ssh server - vpn Enter passphrase for key ' / root/.ssh/id_rsa ' : ( パスフレーズを入力 ) Last login : Mon Feb 13 10:30:42 2006 from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx server #
サーバ側の authorized_keys ファイルを変更す る
おつぎはサーバの設定です。これまではテストのため、 sshd 設定ファイルの PermitRootLogin に without - password を指定してサーバに root が直接ログインすることを 許していましたが、本来 root のシェルが必要ないときにシェルを実行させるのは おすすめできません。そこで、本格的に運用する場合はこの制限をもう一段階きつくして、
PermitRootLogin forced - commands - only
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
sh -c
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEApTD2ZRyh0R ...
command= " 強制実行させるコマンド " ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEApTD2ZRyh0R ...
=
PermitRootLogin forced - commands - only
( Linux の場合 ) command = " ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.1 pointopoint 192.168.3.2 " ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEApTD2ZRyh0R ... ( FreeBSD の場合 ) command = " ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.1 192.168.3.2 " ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEApTD2ZRyh0R ...
一般的には、強制コマンド実行は指定されたコマンドが終了すると自動的にログアウトしてしまいますが、 トンネリングを使っている場合は、コマンドが終了したあともサーバは実行を続けます。 なお、 sshd の場合はこのコマンドを実行する前に tun / tap デバイスを開くので、 クライアント側で紹介したような sleep のトリックは必要ありません 。
さらに、ここにはサーバ側が割り当てる tun または tap のインターフェイス番号も 強制的に指定することができます :
( Linux の場合 ) tunnel= " 0 " , command= " ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.1 pointopoint 192.168.3.2 " ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEApTD2ZRyh0R... ( FreeBSD の場合 ) tunnel= " 0 " , command= " ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.1 192.168.3.2 " ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEApTD2ZRyh0R ...
( 注意 : カンマの前後にスペースが入ってはいけません)
こうすると、クライアントからこの鍵を使ってログインしたときは必ず
サーバ側の tun0 デバイスが開かれ ifconfig が自動的に実行される ( しかも、対話的シェルは実行されない ) ことになります。 以下のように入力して何も出てこなかったら成功です :
client # ssh server - vpn Enter passphrase for key ' / root/.ssh/id_rsa ' : ( パスフレーズを入力 )
複数のクライアントから同一のサーバに接続する
これまではクライアントとサーバが 1対1 の状況を想定してきましたが、 複数のクライアントに VPN を使わせたい場合は以下のようにします。 クライアン ト A と B が同一のサーバに接続すると仮定して、 それぞれ以下のような設定ファイルを作成します :
クライアン ト A の /root /.ssh / config :
client - a# cat /root/.ssh/config Host server-vpn Hostname server.example.com
Port xxx User root IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_rsa Tunnel point - to - point TunnelDevice 0 PermitLocalCommand yes LocalCommand ( sleep 3 ; ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.2 pointopoint 192.168.3.1 ) &
クライアン ト B の /root /.ssh / config :
client - b# cat / root /.ssh/config Host server-vpn Hostname server.example.com
Port xxx User root IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_rsa Tunnel point - to - point TunnelDevice 0 PermitLocalCommand yes LocalCommand ( sleep 3 ; ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.3 pointopoint 192.168.3.1 ) &
この 2 つのファイルは一番最後の LocalCommand 以外はすべて共通の項目です。 ただし、前回と違って TunnelDevice には 0:0 ではなく 0 と指定しておきます。今まではクライアントがサーバ側の tun インターフェイス番号も 指定してきましたが 、
:0 を省略するとローカルなインターフェイス番号だけを指定でき、
サーバ側の番号の割り当てはサーバ側に任せることができます
( この形式はコマンドラインの -w オプションでも使えます ) 。 ただしこの場合は、必ずサーバ側の authorized_keys ファイルで tunnel オプションを使ってサーバ側のインターフェイス番号を決めておく必要があります。 さもないと予想外のインターフェイスが割り当てられることがあるためです ( たとえば FreeBSD では tun100 などが割り当てられる ) 。
また、クライアン ト A とクライアント B はそれぞれ別々の秘密鍵・公開鍵を使うことに 注意してください。こうすることでサーバは相手が使ってきた鍵によってクライアントを識別し、 インターフェイス番号 と IP アドレスをふり分けることができます :
server # cat / root/.ssh/authorized_keys tunnel= " 0 " , command= " ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.1 pointopoint 192.168.3.2 " ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEApTD2
Z... ( クライアン ト A の公開鍵 ) tunnel= " 1 " , command= " ifconfig tun0 192.168.3.1 pointopoint 192.168.3.3 " ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAyDXuQ... ( クライアン ト B の公開鍵 )
本当は クライアント側もサーバ側もインターフェイス番号や
IP アドレスをまったく指定せずに その場で DHCP のようなことができたらいいのですが、そのためには サーバ側の ( command で強制実行される ) プロセスが 割り当てられたインターフェイス番号を知る必要があります。 しかし、現在のところサーバがどの番号のインターフェイスを割り当てたのか 外部から知るすべはありません ( 環境変数にも現れません ) 。
性能と安定性につい て

The drug works on nerve cells in the brain
Zolpidem is usually used to treat insomnia .
South African researchers , writing in the NeuroRehabilitation , looked at the effects on three patients of using the drug for up to six years .
But one expert in neurological rehabilitation said it was possible the patients had a different condition .
This drug could be unmasking a condition from which people are able to wake up temporarily
Professor Mike Barnes , Hunters Moor Rehabilitation Centre
A person in a vegetative state will appear to be awake and may have their eyes open , but will show no awareness of their surroundings .
They will not be able to interact with other people , and will show no responses to sounds or things that happen around them .
But they will show signs of movement , and cycles of sleep and may be able to breathe on their own .
Response
Each of the three patients studied was given the drug every morning .
An improvement was seen within 20 minutes of taking the drug and wore off after four hours , when the patients restored to their permanent vegetative state .
Patient L had been in a vegetative state for three years , showing no response to touch and no reaction to his family .
After he was given Zolpidem , he was able to talk to them , answering simple questions .
Patient G was also able to answer simple questions and catch a basketball .
Patient N had been " constantly screaming " , but stopped after being given the drug when he started watching TV and responding to his family .
Dr Ralf Clauss , now in the nuclear medicine department at the Royal Surrey Hospital was one of the researchers who carried out the study .
He told the BBC : " For every damaged area of the brain , there is a dormant area , which seems to be a sort of protective mechanism .
" The damaged tissue is dead , there 's nothing you can do .
" But it 's the dormant areas which ' wake up ' . "
Activity trigger
He said drugs like Zolpidem activate receptors for a chemical called GABA in nerve cells in the brain .
When brain damage occurs , these receptors appear to change shape , so they can not behave as normal .
He said the drug appeared to cause the receptors in these dormant areas to change back to their normal shape , triggering nerve cell activity .
Dr Clauss added : " We are carrying out further research .
The next step is to get rid of the sleepiness effect of the drug . "
Mike Barnes , professor of neurological rehabilitation at the Hunters Moor centre in Newcastle , said it was possible that the patients had not had " true " PVS .
" A diagnosis of PVS means the patient should not wake up and respond . "
He said a study carried out by specialists 10 years ago had shown that up to 45 % of patients diagnosed with PVS actually had a range of different conditions , from which they could wake up .
Professor Barnes added : " This drug could be unmasking a condition from which people are able to wake up temporarily .
" But if they did have PVS , it would be a remarkable finding , and certainly worth further research . "

Java 's new keyword is central to the language  using it in conjunction with a constructor is how objects are created .
Criticizing new seems as radical and as foolish as criticizing arithmetic or variables .
But criticize it I do .
While I believe that new has its place  indeed , it is unavoidable  much of the time there are better alternatives .
In a nutshell , the problem with new is that it fails to encapsulate object creation .
Before getting to that , let 's review the basics .
The standard way to create objects in Java involves calling a constructor with the keyword new , as in :
Point p = new Point( x , y ) ;</ p>
Memory is allocated on the heap for the new object , its instance variables are initialized , the constructor body is executed , and the newly constructed object is returned .
There are several nice things about this mechanism .
The syntax is clear and comprehensible .
The type of the returned object is apparent .
Since clients are forced to call a constructor if they want to create an object , the class writer can enforce correct initialization :
From the moment clients first have access to the object , it is in a consistent state .
And constructors chain by having a subclass constructor call a superclass constructor , thereby forcing correct initialization of superclasses .
But there are two problems with new :
It allocates memory from the heap .
It is not polymorphic .
For each of these , I 'll discuss the problem first , then offer solutions .
To be clear , it really is new that I 'm railing against , not constructors per se .
Despite their name , constructors just initialize objects ; they do n't allocate them .
( It would be interesting to have a language that decoupled initialization from object creation , allowing you to reinitialize existing objects .
This feature would be useful in conjunction with object pools . )
There are other ways to call constructors that do n't have ( both ) these problems : Calling a constructor via super ( ) does not allocate memory , and calling a constructor with reflection is polymorphic .
Memory Allocation : The Problem
Because memory allocation is new 's primary function , it is hard to see how allocating memory from the heap could be a problem .
But sometimes you want to allocate memory from somewhere other than the heap , and at other times you do n't want to allocate memory at all .
In other words , you may want an object , but you may not want to create one , at least not here , not now .
The best example is an instance - controlled class , where the class writer wishes to restrict the number of instances .
When the maximum number of instances is one , you have the Singleton pattern ( described in Design Patterns by Erich Gamma et al. , Addison - Wesley , 1995 ) .
Singleton is often used when the object corresponds to a unique item in the real world ( such as the keyboard or computer itself ) , or when the object is the sole manager for some resource .
Java 's Runtime class is an example of the latter :
Its single instance manages interactions between the Java virtual machine and native operating system .
Sometimes only a few instances of a class are desired .
Imagine a class representing ASCII characters .
There are only 256 of those .
If the class is immutable and does n't carry any other information , only 256 instances of the class need ever exist -- more would just clutter memory .
For a more dramatic example , consider the Boolean class :
Only two instances are ever necessary , one for True and one for False .
In addition to saving memory , having only one instance per value also allows testing for equality using the " == " operator , instead of the slower " equals " method .
Both of these are examples of the object - oriented enumerated type idiom , in which a fixed set of values are represented by distinct objects , much as enumerated types in languages such as Pascal and C represent a set of values by distinct integers .
This idiom is closely related to the Flyweight pattern ( again , see Design Patterns ) .
The class representing the enumerated type should probably be immutable .
Otherwise , there is a good chance that data modification by one client will inadvertently affect another because they share pointers to the same object .
So far , I 've limited the number of instances because it is logically unnecessary ( and perhaps harmful to performance ) to have more .
Sometimes there is no limit on the number of instances , but the class writer would like the option of handing back an existing instance on occasion .
Swing 's border mechanism uses this idea .
Each border is an object , but sometimes the same object can be reused for many borders .
In particular , the same two instances of BevelBorder are returned whenever users request a raised or lowered bevel .
For a more sophisticated and ( currently ) hypothetical example , consider the Integer class .
There are many possible instances of this class  too many to cache them all  but we might conjecture that some values are more common than others .
Probably Integer objects representing the numbers from - 2 to 100 are more likely to occur than others .
A clever implementation could cache objects for these numbers , saving the time and storage involved in their creation .
This caching scheme absolutely requires immutability , so that the actual identity of an object never matters , only its value .
If cached Integers were mutable , someone could change the cached instance representing 1 to have the value 2 , which would be mighty confusing .
Object pools are another case in which heap allocation is to be avoided .
An object pool is a way to avoid garbage collection overhead .
The garbage collector usually does a pretty good job of reclaiming storage , but in rare cases it may be more efficient to allocate / deallocate objects manually .
Initially , allocation is done normally with new .
But clients manually deallocate objects by calling a method that places the object carcass in a pool , from where it can be reallocated when needed .
Of course , it should be transparent to clients whether a requested object is coming from the pool or the Java heap .
If the same few objects are allocated / deallocated repeatedly , an object pool can turn a churning garbage collector into a quiet one ( see my article " Use Object Pools to Sidestep Garbage Collection , " Java Report , September 2000 ) .
While the caches I have been discussing all cut down on memory usage , sometimes the intent is to avoid other kinds of overhead .
For instance , object data may be stored in files or a database , and frequently accessed objects may be cached for performance .
The general idea in all these examples is that class writers might wish to cache certain instances to avoid repeated object creation or other overhead .
Such caching should be transparent to clients .
But it can not be transparent if clients use new .
In other situations , the idea is not to avoid creating an object , but to create it somewhere other than the heap .
For instance , in a distributed system , you may want to instantiate an object on another machine .
The real - time specification for Java ( see The Real - Time Specification for Java , Greg Bollella et al. , Addison - Wesley 2000 , and http://www.jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/first/jsr001/rtj.pdf) posits memory regions other than the garbage - collected heap , so that garbage collection does not break real - time guarantees .
In such cases , you may not wish to make the origin of the created object transparent to the client , but you still cannot use new , since it always allocates memory on the current machine 's garbage - collected heap .
( Actually , real - time Java gets around this problem by redefining new to mean " allocate from the current memory region , " but redefining new is not a solution available to most of us . )
Of course , you could argue as follows : " You 're blaming new for doing what it 's supposed to doallocate memory .
Obviously , if you do n't want to allocate memory , do n't use new .
So what 's your point ? "
My point is that object creation is an implementation detail .
Often , I would simply like an Integer object whose value is 3 , and I do n't much care how I get it .
For some classes , to be sure , I do care : I do n't want to share someone else 's ArrayList in some other address space 
I want my own fresh , local one .
But often  and always with immutable objects  I do n't care .
Yet the literature spends a lot of time talking about hiding data and methods , and virtually no time talking about hiding creation .
For some classes , hiding object creation can be just as important as hiding object data .
Memory Allocation : The Solutions
The first step in solving any of these memory allocation issues is to declare all constructors private , or at least protected if you wish to support subclasses .
Making the constructors private is safer  you can be sure that no clients of your class can use new to instantiate it  but also makes it impossible to declare subclasses .
There is a tradeoff between allowing inheritance and encapsulating creation .
To provide a few chosen instances to clients , the simplest thing to do is to put them in public final static variables .
For example , Boolean .
TRUE and Boolean .
FALSE are the only instances of Boolean that need ever exist .
( However , the Boolean constructors are public , so clients can create additional instances . )
The problem with using variables is that they expose your policy on object creation just as surely as providing a constructor does , only in the other direction  no new creation , instead of unrestricted creation .
This is not an issue if you 're sure about what you 're doing .
If you 're implementing an enumerated type and you know you want to limit the possible values to what you 've written in your class , then static variables and a private constructor are appropriate .
( This could , and perhaps should , have been Boolean 's design . )
However , if you use a static variable for an object that you intend to be unique ( a Singleton ) , but later decide to allow one instance per thread , you are in trouble : ThreadLocal variables require a method call to retrieve the value , so you 'll have to change your static variable to a static method and break clients .
Using a static method in the first place solves the problem with variables , at the cost of some time and a more cumbersome notation .
A static method that creates ( or may create ) objects is known as a static factory method , and is the most common alternative to constructors .
Static factory methods are used throughout the Java libraries .
For example , Runtime 's static getRuntime method returns the virtual machine 's Singleton Runtime object .
The java .
text formatting classes use them to hide the mapping from locales to formatting objects , and in the java .
security package they typically map strings naming algorithms to objects that implement them .
Most of the wrapper classes have valueOf methods that take a String and return a corresponding instance , though only Boolean 's methods avoid object creation by returning one of the constants Boolean .
TRUE or Boolean .
FALSE .
In fact , static factory methods are common enough to have their own naming conventions :
Most static factory methods are called getInstance or valueOf .
There are three advantages of static factory methods .
They hide the details of object creation , just as accessor methods hide the details of data representation .
The class writer has complete flexibility about how and when to create objects .
They enable changes in the creation policy without breaking clients .
For example , in Java 1.3 , most java .
security static factory methods create a new object each time they are called , but because they are methods and not constructors , their implementors can change that policy at any time without breaking any existing code .
They allow polymorphism .
One problem with static factory methods is that they are inherited .
If Point2D defines a static factory method , say valueOf , that returns instances of Point2D , and Point3D inherits from Point2D and neglects to define its own static valueOf method , then calls to Point3D.valueOf will be legal and will invoke Point2D 's valueOf method .
In all likelihood , this is n't what was intended .
Polymorphism : The Problem
Turning to the second problem : new is famously nonpolymorphic .
When I write new Rectangle ( ) , I always get a Rectangle , never anything else , and in particular never a subclass of Rectangle .
Much of the time this is what I want , but sometimes it is n't ; for example :
A framework where I request an implementation by name or other attribute , and am given an instance of the appropriate class .
Some of the classes in the java .
security package , like Signature , work this way .
Or imagine a data structure wizard that lets a client specify the desired properties of a data structure ( for example , constant average - time access , no duplicates , ordering not required ) and returns an implementation satisfying the criteria ( HashSet , for instance ) .
package , like , work this way .

A drawing program in which users click on a button representing a shape , then drag the mouse across the drawing window .
The program draws the shape and creates an instance of the shape class internally .
To avoid a clumsy if - then - else in the code , you need a way to associate a button with a mechanism for object creation .
in the code , you need a way to associate a button with a mechanism for object creation .
A platform - independent user - interface framework in which each component has a corresponding native " peer . "
This is the design of Java 's AWT .
When you create an AWT Button , the appropriate platform - dependent peer must be created as well .
, the appropriate platform - dependent peer must be created as well .
A general - purpose multithreaded network server class that creates a connection object for each incoming client .
Each connection object runs in a separate thread and handles the interaction with one client .
This is a common design for multithreaded servers in Java .
To be reusable , the server class must create connections polymorphically .
In all of these cases , the best design uses polymorphism to create objects .
The same line of code should be able to return instances of different classes each time it is executed .
This rules out using a constructor with new .
Polymorphism : The Solutions
Static factory methods can provide a solution to some  but not all  polymorphism problems .
Only the first of the aforementioned examples succumbs to a static factory method .
A class that wishes to select from several implementations ( typically subclasses ) can provide a static method returning the appropriate subclass .
For example , Signature and several other classes in java .
security have a getInstance method that takes a String naming an algorithm and returns a subclass mapped to the name .
Another example is the method Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit in the java . awt package .
It takes no arguments but uses a system property to determine which subclass of Toolkit to return .
The problem with static factory methods is that they are static ; strictly speaking , a call to one is not polymorphic .
That is , when you call Signature .
getInstance you are always invoking the same code .
Although its strategy for returning an appropriate subclass may be clever and complex , there is no way to use a different strategy .
The obvious antidote  indeed , the only other possibility  is a nonstatic factory method .
In other words , you call a method on an object , and you get back an object ( possibly a new one ) .
Since instance ( that is , nonstatic ) method calls can be polymorphic , creation can be as well .
There are a variety of ways in which this basic mechanism can be exploited .
In the simplest idea , called the " Factory Method " pattern ( see Design Patterns ) , a factory object is responsible for creation .
The factory class is abstract ( or is an interface ) and declares a method for creating an object .
Subclasses implement these methods to create particular classes of objects ; in these implementations , new is usually used , although of course any of the memory allocation mechanisms just described can be used as well .
The Java libraries are full of factories .
RMI programmers may be familiar with socket factories used to substitute the programmer 's sockets for RMI 's defaults .
RMIClientSocketFactory , in the package java.rmi.server , is an interface with a single method :
Socket createSocket ( String host , int port ) </ p>
You pass an instance implementing the interface to the RMI system , which invokes the createSocket method to obtain a Socket .
RMIServerSocketFactory works the same way .
Here , the arguments to the factory method mimic those of the constructor for the class being created , but you could use factories to implement any mapping from arguments to class .
The java . net package uses objects called " content handlers " to interpret the content of URLs .
The ContentHandlerFactory interface has a single method that takes a String representing a MIME type and returns an instance of ContentHandler .
You could implement the factory as a map from MIME types to content handlers if the handlers are immutable .
Although factory methods are usually used to achieve polymorphism , they can also be used to overcome the first problem we discussed , that of memory allocation .
Recall that object creation in a distributed system can't use new because it creates objects locally .
Enterprise JavaBeans handles this problem by defining a separate " home " interface for each bean .
Methods on the home interface are used to create instances of the bean .
The home interface acts in part as a factory .
The multithreaded server class could use a factory object that creates an instance of a connection thread each time its method is called .
The details resemble those of the RMI socket factories .
The server designer would provide an interface :
interface ConnectionFactory {< br > Connection createConnection ( Socket s ) ;< br> }</p>
If you wish to use the server code , you would write a class implementing Connection Factory and pass it on to the server .
The server would then use the factory object to create a new Connection :
Socket s = serverSocket.accept( ) ;< br > Connection c = connectionFactory.createConnection(s ) ;</ p>
Although a straightforward factory method technique could be used for the drawing problem , Java 's inner classes make it easy to combine the ActionListener interface with object creation .
In this piece of code for creating rectangles , the variable drawing is the current drawing , and the Drawing class has an add method that adds a new shape to the drawing .
rectangleButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener ( ) { < br > public void actionPerformed ( ActionEvent e ) { < br > drawing.add ( new Rectangle ( ) ) ;< br > }} ) ;</ p>
The Abstract Factory design pattern takes this a step further : A single class provides methods for creating more than one kind of object .
Abstract Factory is ideal for the UI framework situation , and indeed both AWT and Swing use it .
The java .
awt .
Toolkit class is an abstract class with methods createButton , createCheckbox , and so on , that return peer implementations of the various AWT components .
The limitation of having a fixed set of methods , and thus components , is overcome in Swing by using a mapping from a generic UI component name ( such as " ButtonUI " ) to the name of an implementing class .
A powerful variant of the factory approach uses an object representing a class to create instances of that class .
Java programmers can do this with reflection , using the Class class .
Class objects provide a newInstance method for calling a no-argument constructor , as well as Constructor objects that can invoke any constructor .
A multithreaded server class could accept a Class instance to use for instantiating connections .
In its simplest form , it could use the newInstance method :
Socket s = serverSocket.accept( ) ;< br > Connection c = ( Connection ) connectionClass.newInstance ( ) ;</ p>
There would have to be some other way to give the Socket to the Connection .
Alternatively , a Constructor object for a constructor with a Socket argument could be obtained from the Class object and then invoked .
The required downcast is one of the unattractive things about class - based creations in Java ; the other is the variety of exceptions that must be handled , all due to the dynamic nature of this mechanism .
For example , an IllegalAccessException is thrown if the class or constructor is not public .
With a normal call to the constructor using new , this problem would be detected at compile time .
A variant of the class - based approach appears in real - time Java .
Again , the real - time Java spec provides for the existence of memory areas other than the garbage - collected heap .
These memory areas are actually objects instances of class MemoryArea or a subclass  which have two methods , newArray and newInstance  that take a Class object as a parameter and create an instance of that class in the appropriate memory area .
You can invoke these methods directly on your Memory Area of choice , or as mentioned , use new with its altered meaning of creating an object in the currently active MemoryArea .
In Smalltalk , where dynamic typing makes downcasting unnecessary and exceptions are not treated as rigorously as Java , class - based creation is convenient , elegant , and polymorphic ( see SmallTalk - 80 : The Language and Its Implementation , by Adele Goldberg and David Robson , Addison - Wesley , 1983 ) .
In fact , it is the usual way to create objects in that language .
Another way to create objects polymorphically is to copy an existing object .
This is the Prototype pattern of Design Patterns .
In Java , the clone method provides for polymorphic object copying .
You do n't see the Prototype pattern much in Java .
It is used only once in the J2SE 1.3 libraries , Swing 's JEditorPane class ( and even there it is employed only as an adjunct to class - based creation with Class.newInstance ) .
A good example of prototypes is a drawing program that provides default properties for each shape , so that when users place a rectangle , it is initially blue with a red border .
Users could configure the default properties by manipulating a shape to their liking , then choosing " Make this the default . "
The easiest way to program that action would be to make a copy of the selected shape , to use as the prototype for future shapes .
Prototypes are also useful when object initialization is expensive , and you anticipate few variations on the initialization parameters .
Then you could keep already - initialized objects in a table , and clone an existing object instead of expensively creating a new one from scratch .
The objects in the table play the role of prototypes .
This is essentially the caching idea described earlier , modified to deal with mutable objects  if the objects were immutable , you could return them directly instead of cloning them .
Cloning is obviously polymorphic since it involves calling a nonstatic method , but it would seem to suffer from the problem that it always allocates memory .
Not so .
For instance , it is perfectly allowable for an immutable class to have return this as the body of its clone method .
The author of Object.clone 's contract no doubt had this and similar cases in mind when writing that , while " the general intent " is that x.clone ( ) != x , this is not an " absolute requirement . "
Prototype is unique among the object creation techniques in that it does n't require a class , only another object .
Objected - oriented languages such as Self and Omega that do away with classes completely rely on prototypes for creating new objects ( see " Self : The Power of Simplicity , " by David Ungar and Randall B. Smith , OOPSLA ' 87 Conference Proceedings , 1987 ; and Object - Oriented Programming with Prototypes , by Gunther Blaschek , Springer - Verlag , 1994 , respectively ) .
If you believe in classes  that is , you believe that it is conceptually clearer to distinguish between classes and objects  then prototypes are a bit unpalatable because they blur that distinction .
For instance , consider the server framework previously described , which creates a new connection object for each client .
This could be implemented by passing in a connection object as a prototype , to be cloned when a client arrives .
But the connection class was written with the intent that each connection object talks to a client .
Perhaps the constructor takes a Socket as a parameter , for example .
It seems odd to coopt one instance of this class for use purely as a breeder of other connections .
The prototype obeys a different set of class invariants than the other instances  it does not require a Socket , for example .
A further problem with using prototypes in Java is the clumsiness of the clone method .
The return type is Object , requiring a downcast , and you may need to deal with CloneNotSupportedException .
Relief will soon arrive for the first of these problems : Java will have covariant return types , meaning , for example , that Point 's clone method can have a return type of Point , even though Object 's has a return type of Object .
Calls to clone on a Point variable will not require a downcast :
Point p1 = new Point ( 2 , 4 ) ;< br> Point p2 = p1.clone ( ) ;</ p>
Beyond Java
How do other programming languages handle object creation ?
C++ is just like Java , as you would expect .
Eiffel lets class writers designate one or more methods of the class as creation methods ; these are called with a special syntax , functionally equivalent to new , and are essentially constructors , except that they do not chain .
The problems with new discussed here apply to both C++ and Eiffel .
Smalltalk uses the class - based approach to creation .
There is an object corresponding to each class , and instances are created by sending a new message to the class object .
This is elegant and polymorphic .
Indeed , it is common in Smalltalk programs to pass around a class object when polymorphic creation is required .
But Smalltalk 's mechanism suffers from a serious drawback : Initialization is not enforced .
new creates objects but does not initialize them .
The convention is to have an initialize method for each class that is called after new , but you can forget to call initialize , leaving the object in an invalid state .
Why not combine creation and initialization by calling initialize from within new ?
Because new is polymorphic , so it must always take the same number of arguments ( namely zero ) , whereas each class may require a different number of arguments for initialization .
Ruby ( see Programming In Ruby , by David Thomas and Andy Hunt , DDJ , January 2001 ) is able to fix this problem because it lets a method be " variadic "  to take any number of arguments .
In Ruby , new does call initialize , passing along all its arguments .
But both Smalltalk and Ruby are dynamically typed .
It does n't seem possible to have a general mechanism for polymorphic creation and initialization that is statically typed , because polymorphism requires that the creation method have the same argument types , but each class has its own requirements for initialization .
A second drawback with both Smalltalk and Ruby is that initialize , being an ordinary method , does not chain :
You must remember to begin your initialize methods with a call to the superclass 's initialize method .
For statically typed languages , it may not be possible to do better than the approach taken by Curl ( see " The Curl Programming Environment , " by Friedger Müffke , DDJ , September 2001 ) .
In addition to constructors , whose semantics are close to those of Java , Curl also has factories .
A factory is essentially a static factory method , but with a calling syntax identical to that for a constructor .
Thus the class writer can choose to provide constructors , factories , or both , and clients cannot tell the difference .
This successfully encapsulates object creation .
Conclusion
There is a difference between requesting an object and creating one .
The first is an abstraction ; it should be designed into a class and should be under the class 's control .
The second is a low - level implementation detail .
Java's new keyword , the standard way to obtain objects , provides only the latter .
Thus , most requests for objects end up being nonpolymorphic heap allocations , whether this is a good idea or not .
In short , new should be considered harmful for the same reason that goto is considered harmful  although it is an indispensable low - level tool , it must be used with care or hidden behind abstractions .

Brennan Center Report on Security of Voting Systems
I have been participating in the Brennan Center ’s Task Force on Voting Security .
Last week we released a report on the security of voting systems .
From the Executive Summary :
In 2005 , the Brennan Center convened a Task Force of internationally renowned government , academic , and private - sector scientists , voting machine experts and security professionals to conduct the nation ’s first systematic analysis of security vulnerabilities in the three most commonly purchased electronic voting systems .
The Task Force spent more than a year conducting its analysis and drafting this report .
During this time , the methodology , analysis , and text were extensively peer reviewed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( “ NIST ” ) . [ … ]
The Task Force examined security threats to the technologies used in Direct Recording Electronic voting systems ( “ DREs ” ) , DREs with a voter verified auditable paper trail ( “ DREs w/ VVPT ” ) and Precinct Count Optical Scan ( “ PCOS ” ) systems .
The analysis assumes that appropriate physical security and accounting procedures are all in place . [… ]
Three fundamental points emerge from the threat analysis in the Security Report :
All three voting systems have significant security and reliability vulnerabilities , which pose a real danger to the integrity of national , state , and local elections .
which pose a real danger to the integrity of national , state , and local elections .
The most troubling vulnerabilities of each system can be substantially remedied if proper countermeasures are implemented at the state and local level .
if proper countermeasures are implemented at the state and local level .
Few jurisdictions have implemented any of the key countermeasures that could make the least difficult attacks against voting systems much more difficult to execute successfully . [… ]
There are a number of steps that jurisdictions can take to address the vulnerabilities identified in the Security Report and make their voting systems significantly more secure .
We recommend adoption of the following security measures : Conduct automatic routine audits comparing voter verified paper records to the electronic record following every election .
A voter verified paper record accompanied by a solid automatic routine audit of those records can go a long way toward making the least difficult attacks much more difficult .
Perform “ parallel testing ” ( selection of voting machines at random and testing them as realistically as possible on Election Day . )
For paperless DREs , in particular , parallel testing will help jurisdictions detect software - based attacks , as well as subtle software bugs that may not be discovered during inspection and other testing .
Ban use of voting machines with wireless components .
All three voting systems are more vulnerable to attack if they have wireless components .
Use a transparent and random selection process for all auditing procedures .
For any auditing to be effective ( and to ensure that the public is confident in
such procedures ) , jurisdictions must develop and implement transparent and random selection procedures .
Ensure decentralized programming and voting system administration .
Where a single entity , such as a vendor or state or national consultant , performs key tasks for multiple jurisdictions , attacks against statewide elections become easier .
Institute clear and effective procedures for addressing evidence of fraud or error .
Both automatic routine audits and parallel testing are of questionable security value without effective procedures for action where evidence of machine malfunction and / or fraud is discovered .
Detection of fraud without an appropriate response will not prevent attacks from succeeding .
The report is long , but I think it ’s worth reading .
If you ’re short on time , though , at least read the Executive Summary .
The report has generated some press .
Unfortunately , the news articles recycle some of the lame points that Diebold continues to make in the face of this kind of analysis :
Voting machine vendors have dismissed many of the concerns , saying they are theoretical and do not reflect the real - life experience of running elections , such as how machines are kept in a secure environment .
“ It just is n’t the piece of equipment , ” said David Bear , a spokesman for Diebold Election Systems , one of the country ’s largest vendors .
“ It ’s all the elements of an election environment that make for a secure election . ”
“ This report is based on speculation rather than an examination of the record .
To date , voting systems have not been successfully attacked in a live election , ” said Bob Cohen , a spokesman for the Election Technology Council , a voting machine vendors ’ trade group .
“ The purported vulnerabilities presented in this study , while interesting in theory , would be extremely difficult to exploit . ”
I wish The Washington Post found someone to point out that there have been many , many irregularities with electronic voting machines over the years , and the lack of convincing evidence of fraud is exactly the problem with their no - audit - possible systems .
Or that the “ it ’s all theoretical ” argument is the same on that software vendors used to use to discredit security vulnerabilities before the full - disclosure movement forced them to admit that their software had problems .

The departing Republican majority in Congress is about to leave the nation a memorial to its own shameful history as the grand enabler of record debt and deficits .
G.O.P. leaders are preparing to walk away from their most basic constitutional responsibility  passing a budget .
Instead of finishing work on government spending bills needed for the next year , they ’re reported to be planning nothing more than a cut - and - paste , short - term continuing resolution .
That will allow them to run out early from their lame - duck session , leaving the mess to the incoming Democrats in January .
Stopgap resolutions create a budget autopilot that does not allow for shifting conditions and costs in education , housing and other major agencies .
Administrators warn that it will cause cuts in school breakfasts and shelter for the poor .
There is no need for this angst except that Republican strategists plotting a comeback clearly want to pour sand into the Democrats ’ agenda even before they take the gavel .
Conservative Republicans who are blocking the spending bills have the gall to portray themselves as principled budget hawks blocking pork - barrel spending “ earmarks ”  this after 12 years of earmarking and rubber - stamping the upper - bracket tax cuts of President Bush that tossed all budget discipline to the four winds .
The Republicans depart leaving the nation in ever deeper hock to China and other potent bankers , with taxpayers stuck with the bill .
The Democratic majority will have more than enough to do in preparing the 2008 budget plan and dealing with an estimated $ 130 billion supplemental bill from the White House to continue the Iraq war .
It does n’t need the distraction of having to sort out some $ 460 billion in left - over spending priorities .

Boeing Pelican
A concept aircraft currently under development at Boeing ’s Phantom Works Research and Development unit might be the largest airplane to ever fly , but it wo n’t set any altitude records .
Its called the Pelican and it would have a normal cruising altitude of only twenty feet because it uses the concept of ground effect to achieve lift .
Performance specifications say this ground effect vehicle ( GEV ) will have a wingspan of 150 meters and be able to carry up to 1,400 tons of cargo .
By comparison the current giant of the skies , the Russian An - 225 , has an 88.4 - meter wingspan and can lift 250 tons .
Because the plane skims the surface during flight , it is only practical over large , smooth bodies of water .
Flying close to the water , the wing ’s downwash angle and tip vortices are suppressed , resulting in a greatly reduced drag which leads to outstanding cruise efficiency .
This would translate into a range of 10,000 nautical miles in trans - oceanic flight .
Operating from paved runways , the plane has thirty - eight fuselage - mounted landing gears with seventy - six tires to distribute the weight .
The Pelican is designed to be a hybrid GEV , allowing it to also fly at higher altitudes up to 20,000 feet .
But the range would be greatly reduced to 6,500 nautical miles when not using the ground effect .
While the Pelican is yet to become a prototype the concept is hardly a new one .
For decades the Russians have experimented with aircraft they called WIG ( Wing In Ground - effect ) planes .
A WIG craft , like the Pelican , sits on a cushion of air created by aerodynamics rather than by an engine .
Orlyonok A90
This means that it can only fly when the WIG craft has sufficient forward speed .
This is called a dynamic air cushion as opposed to the hovercraft ’s static air cushion .
The Soviets had great plans for these planes .
Just like Boeing ’s Pelican they discovered the high efficiency of ground - effect craft .
The only difference from the Russian WIGs and the Pelican is that the Soviet craft did not have the ability to fly higher than 20 feet .
They would be restricted to use over large bodies of water .
Two WIG planes are especially interesting .
The Orlyonok A90 is a large WIG prototype with one huge turboprop mounted high at the tail fin for cruise thrust and two turbofans for takeoff , acceleration , and landing .
Two hydro skis are mounted at the underside of the fuselage , one in the front , and another at the center of gravity .
Designed in 1974 , the original plans were to build 120 Orlyonoks as troop transport and assault vehicles , but only four were built⁠ — one of which has been used for static tests only .
But the WIG craft had a troubled service history ; the first Orlyonok crashed during a VIP demo flight in 1975 .
In October 1979 the Orlyonok entered service in the Soviet Navy , where one was lost in a crash in 1992 .
Unfortunately the crew did n’t survive the accident .
The last flight of the Orlyonok took place in October 1993 , and currently the remains of the last Orlyonoks are rusting and falling apart at their base .
There have been plans to modify one of the surviving Orlyonoks as a transport , carrying up to 150 passengers in a single deck layout or up to 350 passengers in a twin deck layout .
A cargo version of the craft was planned to have a payload of thirty tons .
Lun
The Soviets also started a WIG warship program called the Lun in 1970 , but assembly of the first Lun did not start until 1983 .
In July 1986 it was launched into the Volga River .
During Spring 1987 sea trials commenced on the Caspian Sea .
The first Lun was designed and built as a missile launching strike craft primarily for anti-submarine tasks .
It carried 6 missile tubes for this mission , and had a top speed of 500 kilometers per hour .
The second Lun was under construction during the collapse of the Soviet Union and the project was abandoned .
In 1997 Russian television showed the Lun half sunk in the water at Kaspiisk Naval Air Base .
The Russians built a whole range of WIG aircraft ranging from eight - engine monsters to small pleasure craft .
Today in the United States and Europe there are several homemade ground - effect planes usually seating no more than four passengers .
If Boeing ’s enormous Pelican ever flies , it wo n’t be until the end of the decade at the soonest .
Note : Most , if not all of the scientific studies undertaken to document the effects of porn on society demonstrate various social benefits directly attributable to its availability .
Drastically lower rates of sex crimes is one benefit that has been enjoyed in Sweden , Denmark , and Japan , as the porn studies listed below demonstrate .
Other benefits include those outlined by Pat Califa in her analysis of The Meese Commission Report : " Even given the constraints under which it is currently produced , pornography is valuable .
It sends out messages of comfort and rebellion .
It says : Lust is not evil .
The body is not hateful .
Physical pleasure is a joyful thing and should not be hidden or denied . "
" The Fascist State organizes the nation , but leaves a sufficient margin of liberty to the individual ; the latter is deprived of all useless and possibly harmful freedom , but retains what is essential ; the deciding power in this question cannot be the individual , but the State alone . "
~ Benito Mussolini
Pornography , Rape and Sex Crimes in Japan " The most dramatic decrease in sex crimes was seen when attention was focused on the number and age of rapists and victims among younger groups ( Table 2 ) .
We hypothesized that the increase in pornography , without age restriction and in comics , if it had any detrimental effect , would most negatively influence younger individuals .
Just the opposite occurred .
The number of juvenile offenders dramatically dropped every period reviewed from 1,803 perpetrators in 1972 to a low of 264 in 1995 ; a drop of some 85 % ( Table 1 ) .
The number of victims also decreased particularly among the females younger than 13 ( Table2 ) .
In 1972 , 8.3 % of the victims were younger than 13 .
In 1995 the percentage of victims younger than 13 years of age dropped to 4.0 % .
Studies on the effects of Pornography Although the author claims " This document is devoted to exploring some of the available research data that was used to come to this conclusion , " most of the actual scientific research shows a negative correlation between porn and sex crime .

10 Science stuff you got wrong at School
Published on 3/25/2006
Water IS blue , not just because of the sky Many believe that lakes and oceans are blue " only " because they reflect the blue sky .
Actually water looks blue because water is blue ; the water molecules do absorb some light , and they absorb red frequencies more than blue .
The effect is small , so the blue color only becomes obvious when observing layers of water many meters ( or more ) thick .
( This effect is noticeable to a lesser amount in white - painted swimming pools . )
In salt water or mineral - laden fresh water , the color of dissolved minerals can also be seen .
Sky - reflection does play a role , but only when the water surface is very calm , and only when the water is observed at a glancing angle less than approximately ten degrees .
Electricity does NOT travel at the speed of light Many textbooks claim that Electricity ( electrons ) within wires flows at nearly ( or even exactly at ) the speed of light .
In fact it 's the electrical energy which flows rapidly ( " rapidly " is still slower than the speed of light ) .
Electrons , which have mass , can never travel at the speed of light due to the theory of relativity .
The drift velocity of the charges in an electric current is extremely slow , on the order of centimetres per hour .
Where the electric current is visible , as in electrophoresis , the slow movement of charge carriers can be seen directly .
As a very rough analogy , imagine a line of people at an amusement park .
When the people at the front board the ride , a space opens up , and rapidly spreads to the back of the line .
However , the average velocity of any one person is far slower than the speed at which the space moves .
Seasons are NOT the same length
Due to the earth moving fastest in its orbit when closest to the Sun , the southern summer / northern winter is the shortest season , with northern summer / southern winter being the longest .
However , the difference on earth is only a matter of a few days , while on Mars with its more eccentric orbit the difference is more distinct .
You WON'T get a cold just from low temperature
It is a very widespread misconception that the common cold can be caused by ( or the chance of getting infected by it is increased by ) exposure to cold weather .
In reality , the common cold is caused by viruses and has nothing to do with low temperatures .
Saturn is NOT the only planet with rings Jupiter , Uranus , and Neptune also have rings , though those of Saturn are the most visually striking ( and the only ones easily seen ) .
Meteors are NOT hot when they land on Earth When a meteor lands on Earth , it usually is not hot .
It 's usually warm .
A meteor 's great speed is enough to melt its outside layer , but any molten material will be quickly blown off ( ablated ) , and the interior of the meteor does n't have time to heat up because rocks are poor conductors of heat .
Also , atmospheric drag can slow small meteors to terminal velocity by the time they hit the ground , giving them some time to cool down .
Clouds do NOT form because of the air 's temperature
It is incorrectly believed that clouds form because cold air " holds " less water vapor than warm air .
Air has no capacity to hold water vapor .
It is the temperature of the water itself ( and its surroundings ) that causes humidity , condensation and clouds to form .
People DID know earth was not flat before Columbus Some believe that Christopher Columbus had a hard time receiving support because Europeans believed in a flat Earth .
In fact , sailors and navigators of the time knew that the Earth was spherical , but ( correctly ) disagreed with Columbus 's estimates of the distance to the Indies .
If the Americas did not exist , and Columbus had continued to the Indies ( even putting aside the threat of mutiny he was under ) he would not have survived long enough to reach them .
The Great Wall of China is NOT particularly visible from space
While at a low orbit , the Great Wall of China can certainly be seen from space but it is not unique in that regard .
From a low orbit of the earth , many artificial objects are visible on the earth , not just the Great Wall of China .
Highways , ships in the sea , dams , railroads , cities , fields of crops , and even some individual buildings .
As to the claim that it 's the only man-made object visible from the moon , Apollo astronauts have reported that they could not see any man-made object from the moon , not even the Great Wall .
There is NO " dark side " of the Moon The Moon is in synchronous orbit -- this means , it takes exactly the same time to rotate once around its axis than it does to make one orbit around the Earth -- so it has a far side , because it always keeps the same hemisphere pointed towards Earth .
When the Moon is roughly between the Sun and Earth , it is daytime for the " far side " and night time for the " near side " .
When the Moon gets " behind " the Earth , it is night time for the " far side " and daytime for the " near side " .

This talk was delivered at the Burton S. Blumert Conference on Gold , Freedom , and Peace .
At the 1977 Libertarian Party Convention , mind - expansion advocate and LSD guru Timothy Leary gave a speech that few of us took very seriously .
He spoke of something called the Internet , a network that would connect computers worldwide , allowing participants from around the globe to sign on and retrieve text , photographs , audio and video instantaneously , and to communicate in realtime with anyone in the whole world who also had a computer and a connection .
He said that it would be the new revolution against the current social order and stifling status quo .
He predicted it would be much , much bigger than drugs in its ability to overthrow the establishment .
Whereas tuning in , turning on and dropping out had been of great interest to a somewhat narrow subset of the population , everyone would be able to use the Internet , in his own way , and thus the new revolution against the old order would transcend class , age , nationality and all other demographics .
The bourgeois would have just as much interest and use for it as the so - called counterculture .
And nothing would ever again be the same .
As I said , no one at the time really believed it .
We figured Leary had just done a little too much acid and his imagination had gotten the best of him .
The network of information he described seemed totally impossible — and yet it exists , precisely as he predicted it , right now .
In fact , even Timothy Leary might be surprised to see the newest developments .
Hardly a week goes by without some substantial revolution in cyberspace .
When Leary died in 1996 , data storage , processing and transfer had yet to approach anything anywhere near their current magnificent levels of utility and speed .
And next year will make this year look like nothing .
Already , we think back five years and can hardly comprehend the breathtaking progress over that time .
A lot of people say the Internet is overrated .
They think it ’s just a bunch of vanity sites and ranting and raving kooks — and while they acknowledge it is nice that you can buy products online and have them delivered to your house , they doubt the net will prove as revolutionary of culture and industry as is predicted of it .
Ever since the Dot -Com Boom of the late 1990s and the subsequent bust , many are inclined to dismiss the alleged greatness of the net .
Some see it only as a novelty or fad that will hardly evolve far past its current size and scope .
These people could not be more wrong .
The Internet is not just not overrated — it is vastly underrated .
In the Internet we see our greatest hope for freedom and for the continual progress of humanity .
In the Internet we see the anachronistic and obsolete institutions of society being pushed aside for a new dawn of better things .
In the Internet we see the key to diminishing the power and status of the state and liberating ourselves from its oppression and deception .
Let us first consider an indirect but nevertheless essential reason to have hope for freedom , thanks to the World Wide Web .
The Internet is proof of libertarianism in action .
In this unregulated sector of society , we have seen more progress and changes and improvements than in any other sector in any comparably short period of time .
No other invention went so far so quickly .
And all of it rests on the economic principles of spontaneous order that we have been touting for years , but had to wait until now to see fully realized .
On eBay , we see millions of transactions occurring every day in one of the freest markets in human history .
And almost all of the transactions are satisfactory for both parties .
You really can trust most people most of the time to keep their word in business matters , and never before has it been so clearly shown .
eBay ’s primary mechanisms of quality control and contract enforcement have sprung about in the voluntary sector , with no coercive monopoly .
Reputation plays a very crucial role .
If you have not sold much online to people who will vouch for you , it will be harder for you to unload a large expensive item at a reasonable price .
The market at eBay is self - correcting .
People succeed roughly as much as they deserve .
Honesty and entrepreneurial cunning are rewarded and cheating and waste strongly discouraged .
Every week , billions of dollars exchange hands on this site alone , which has encouraged people everywhere to trust the methods of mutual exchange and , even if only subconsciously , no longer associate market success with central planning .
Entire businesses , small and not so small , thrive by selling on this site and doing nothing else .
eBay could have probably brought us out of the Depression , and the unbridled capitalism it represents , along with all the millions of other marketing sites online , might be the only things keeping us out of another one .
Along with eBay came the success story of PayPal , another site that has helped to revolutionize an economic sector , in this case of money itself .
Money can be anonymous and transferable to anywhere in the world .
With the proliferation of such sites , we might see the unraveling of people ’s hope in the government as a major fiscal and monetary player .
The Internet has many people more jealous of their money , more resistant to hand it over to the tax men , and that alone is a blessing .
Consider Google .
Here we have the ability to search billions of pages of text in a matter of a couple seconds .
With the expansion of this software into new applications and uses , we are seeing the information age really coming to life .
What used to take all day at the library to dig up , even just ten years ago , now sometimes takes less than a minute .
The newest foray of Google into the book world is just the newest bloodless revolution — we now have the capability of searching the text of thousands of books , and their number is growing .
Have you ever had a phrase that you remembered from one book or another , but you could n’t remember which ?
What only a decade ago might have kept you awake at night , causing a brain itch you might have taken with you to the grave , might soon only take a minute or two to look up and turn from nagging suspicion into verified fact .
I remember a scene in the movie All the President ’s Men , where Robert Redford as Bob Woodward spends an entire day in a room full of phone books looking for the location of someone named on an incriminating check .
Today , his search would have taken seconds .
The searchability of text has only blossomed with the great success of PDFs — one of many digital formats that is fast replacing its analog counterpart .
I went to an Adobe Acrobat convention years ago , but was later disappointed when their enthusiastic promises of a totally searchable format were n’t totally realized in the first few versions of the program .
Anyone who has experienced how quickly and amazingly PDFs have evolved knows the folly of too quickly judging a technology by its initial incarnation .
As with so many other things in the digital revolution , I can only expect PDFs to continue to impress us .
Perhaps nothing right now is so astonishing as a demonstration of the wonders of spontaneous order as that online encyclopedia , Wikipedia .
For those of you do n’t know , Wikipedia is the largest collection of encyclopedia articles in the world , which are written completely by volunteers .
Anyone can edit the articles , anyone can write a new one .
It now boasts more than 810,000 articles in English , as well as hundreds of thousands more in dozens of other languages .
Each article was written , edited and rewritten by whoever in the world decided to contribute .
The division of labor , the capacity of people for consensus building and totally voluntary cooperation , and the general goodness of most people to respect each other ’s boundaries are on display at this one site , and the entire world is better informed as a result .
Wikipedia is a microcosm of a phenomenon online that many statists would have denied was possible before it came about .
Online we see millions of times more information than any of us has the capacity to read in our lifetimes — and it ’s all free to anyone who wants it .
Interestingly enough , people will put effort into sharing information with their fellow man .
The good side of humanity — the charity that we libertarians are so used to insisting exists and does n’t need government to thrive — is right there .
It is online , for everyone to behold .
With the explosion of information especially , a transformation of publishing and information distribution that compares only to the invention of the printing press , one is tempted to wonder how long it will take for the people to realize how bad a deal public education really is .
In the near future , people will see that the failing pubic school system can easily be replaced with a more customized , and far less - expensive system of learning .
The spontaneous order that has cultivated a free market in ideas , goods and services online has unmistakably been met with approval by the masses .
It is a genuine market , open to everyone for miniscule start - up and administrative costs and nothing like the barriers of entry we see in the highly regulated industries of realspace .
It is no surprise that most of the major Web sites and companies — eBay , Yahoo , Google , Pay Pal , Amazon — lean so heavily toward freedom and against the state .
Unlike the big businesses of the mercantilist realspace economy , the big players in e-commerce tend to see the government more as a clumsy obstacle , or more likely , a nonentity rushing to catch up to the technology of 1997 , rather than as a major player to lobby for kickbacks and favors .
There are surely big software and hardware companies that are not so favorable toward freedom , but they are almost all in bed with the state in one way or another , and so have a vested interest in the corporate state surviving .
Like the state itself , they will be on the losing side of history .
And when we see the way the state regards the Internet , we can only smile .
Half the time the politicians claim enthusiasm .
The other half they appear afraid , such as when they threaten to censor , tax or regulate it .
But it is clear that the political establishment has no idea whatsoever what it ’s up against , and those of us who love liberty can only cheer .
In the 2000 campaign , George W. Bush was asked what he thought about a parody website , designed to look like his campaign page , which portrayed him as a former cocaine - using , corporate tool ignoramus .
His response ?
He said he did n’t think it was too funny and “ there ought to be limits to freedom . ”
Many of us did n’t now how to react at first .
Should we be scared of this potential president ’s overtly anti-liberty statement ?
Or should we snicker that he would think that he could actually stop the wonderfully nasty things people were saying about him on the miraculously free Internet ?
What was even more notable was how quick the word got out — thanks to the Internet — that Bush was against our freedom of speech .
The man probably had no clue that what he said , along with all the many other stupid things he would say , once widely circulated on the net , would be far more damaging to his pretense of authority than any satire web site accusing him of being a drug addict .
During the last presidential campaign , almost everyone was online , keeping tabs on what the candidates were saying as had never been feasible for any of the other elections in American history .
And so when John Kerry posted on his Web site that he believed in a mandatory national service program , some activists caught it immediately and , correctly predicting the Kerry camp would take it down as soon as it was noticed and criticized , make caches online for posterity ’s sake .
The buzz about a possible draft spread infiltrated the mainstream , thanks to the net .
People began to fear conscription would come back under Kerry , and others suggested Bush might bring it back , too .
The Kerry people took the offending line off its site — which was pointless , since more people probably read about the removal than read his online platform .
But what was hilarious was Bush ’s reaction .
He said , “ I hear there ’s rumors on the Internets that we ’re going to have a draft . ”
That ’s right , he referred to that which he clearly did n’t understand at all as “ the Internets . ”
Well , when we see the dangers posed by the Internet to the obviously ignorant politicians who know nothing of its workings , we , along with the rest of the world , can see why Bush might think there ought to be limits to freedom .
Just recently , the White House has threatened to take action against The Onion for proprietary violation if it continues to use the Presidential Seal in its parodies .
This story has also been spread all over the net .
You ca n’t make this stuff up .
The Onion ’s writers could probably use some of the president ’s men on their staff .
Reporting on the goofs and verbal gaffes of politicians might sound like a trivial act in the overall fight for freedom , but it relates directly to the huge issue of news reporting and politics .
I need not argue for the importance of a free , independent press as a bulwark for freedom , as a guardian of truth against political deception and an irreplaceable service to the people .
Everyone in this room knows the significance of a press that will speak truth to power .
For many years , however , the establishment press has not done so .
There was , of course , the wonderful anomaly of the Nixon years , and a few other aberrations , but the mainstream press has , for as long as I ’ve been alive , been a reliable mouthpiece for the political establishment .
Back in the early nineteenth century , people at least knew that the press was biased .
Political parties published the widely read papers .
No one thought that a newspaper called the “ Daily Democrat ” was going to stray too much from the party line .
Starting in the 1870s , there was a concerted effort toward so - called journalistic objectivity , and for a century afterwards people believed that what they read in black and white must have been neutral and true .
So when a paper upheld this Splendid Little War or that New Frontier , this was the objective journalists talking , not just a partisan hack .
Thank goodness for the Internet !
Nowadays , people know that anyone can start up a web page , and of the millions of people ranting out there , it is known that you cannot believe every word — or even most of them .
And yet , the truth largely comes out through the processes of reputation .
The Internet is not built around an arbitrary traditional hierarchy , nor is it mindlessly egalitarian .
It combines the best of all worlds .
Allowing total freedom of speech , grounded in private property , and total interconnectivity thanks to HTML and hyperlinks , anyone can say anything and yet few will believe you unless you substantiate it .
Thomas Jefferson said , “ Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it . ”
Were Jefferson alive today , he would see his insight applied in the real world beyond his expectations — on the Internet , where the error of opinion is unlimited and only rivaled by the efforts of good people to combat it , the truth does , more than in the old media , come out .
Jefferson also said that , if it were up to him , he would choose a world with newspapers but no government rather than a world with government but no newspapers .
Thanks to the net , we might get to see the day when both artifacts are finally swept into the status of irrelevancy they deserve .
People still think of the press as anti-government , especially given the current so - called liberal media and the current so - called conservative president , but it ’s just not so .
They are basically on the same side , while the Internet is definitively on ours .
Whereas the establishment media echoed the administration line about weapons of mass destruction during the run-up to the Iraq war , the Internet was bursting with dissent and exposure of the lies .
Whereas the imbedded establishment media are dependent upon the good graces of the emperor and his cabinet , the Internet is saturated with independent thought and criticism .
While we can trust the talking heads on television to cower in fear of losing access to the White House or even being harassed by the FCC , there are billions of gigabytes of information on the Internet from which we can spring forward to attack the state and recoil back into a crowd of friendly faces .
And the truth is winning , and the Internet is winning , in the market of information and news media .
The print newspapers are hardly surviving the brutalities of the free market and competition .
According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations , there was a 2.6 percent drop for the circulation of 786 papers over a six - month period this year .
1.2 million subscribers in that time abandoned their papers .
According to the Pew Research Center , 23 percent of people under 30 read a daily newspaper , contrasted with 60 percent of their elders .
And as the Internet is the medium of the future , it is the medium of the young .
If we libertarians expect our ideas to thrive , we must get them to the young .
And the Internet is where they are , with all the expectations of freedom and doubts about the government I have outlined .
Doubtless , the Internet is taking over .
And it only makes sense .
There soon will be no structural , operational , logistical or technological reason for hardcopy to be a major player any more .
Witness the old media struggle just to figure out how to deal with the new medium .
They try to charge for their subscriptions online , often to compensate for the losses they suffer in their hardcopy operations .
When new online journals are popping up every week , some of us might even feel sorry for the anachronisms being swept away .
But we should n’t .
The newspaper as we have known it all our lives will largely go the way of the buggy whips and ice delivery .
Good riddance .
For libertarians , and opponents of war , the Internet has especially been a boon .
Now , I hear all the time people saying that we can talk on forums and Web sites all we want , but real activism is what ’s needed to make a difference .
Well , even on this , who can doubt how much the Internet has done ?
In 2003 , twenty million people congregated in protests , all around the world , in anticipation of and in mutual opposition to the U.S. and U.K. war against Iraq. 20 million !
This would have been unimaginable in previous times .
Thanks to telecommunications , and especially e-mail and Web sites , activists were able to arrange , more - or - less spontaneously and in decentralized fashion , these enormous shows of international solidarity against the war .
This was not in any way a real world departure from the ways of the Internet in political activism .
It was in fact only possible because of our online capacity .
These days we will sometimes finally see leaked information about secret meetings in the Oval Office of the Johnson administration from 40 years ago .
Meanwhile , we are already getting leaked information about secret meetings in the Oval Office of the Bush administration from last week !
If the Internet had existed during the 1960s , the Vietnam war would have ended sooner .
It is because of the Internet that there is such universal dissatisfaction of the current regime , such low approval ratings , and it was largely due to the net that even right after 9/11 so many people were willing to speak up against war .
Such dissidence would have not been nearly as easy during the World Wars or Cold War , when most information ran through the old media oligopoly .
No wonder the politicians fear the net .
The state and its old media simply cannot keep up .
At Antiwar.com and LewRockwell.com and hundreds of other sites we see the truth coming out every day .
A politician lies , and as soon as someone with a computer knows , we all know .
An innocent family is bombed by the government and video footage appeared is on your desktop in an hour .
A famous columnist tries to pass off a slimy smear or a dishonest argument in the mainstream press , and suddenly a thousand people are debunking him and ridiculing him on their independent blogs .
Antiwar.com was little more than a hobby of mine when I started it back ten years ago , but if you told me at the end of the 1990s how many readers we ’d have now I ’d say you were as crazy as I thought Timothy Leary was in 1977 .
We reach nearly 100,000 — three football stadiums of people — every single day .
They read from across the political spectrum and from more than 100 countries , and they see the radical libertarian case for nonintervention backed up by a dozen columns and 200 articles of new stories , culled from the independent and mainstream press , daily .
LewRockwell.com also offers an indispensable service , reaching tens of thousands every day , far beyond what libertarian publishers would have ever thought possible just five years ago .
For many years , libertarians were so few in number and those who wanted to make a difference spent the majority of their time and resources just to organize and get their message out to a small number of people .
To succeed at a print run of 1,000 was considered a grand accomplishment , and Lew achieves that , through the virtual world , dozens of times over , every single day .
No other website comes close to LewRockwell.com in reaching those type of numbers with an explicitly libertarian message .
The best libertarian commentary on the newest political crimes appear on your computer first thing in the morning .
Old writers , new writers , scholars on economics , antiwar journalists , revisionist historians , anti-state intellectuals and radicals of the libertarian ethic , all together , all on one site .
The archives available at LRC , and at Lew ’s other organization , the Mises Institute , are alone a wonder .
He has made thousands of the greatest writings of the classical liberal and libertarian movement available to anybody , anytime .
And it ’s all at a cost of nothing for the reader .
Classic economic texts and historical essays are completely retrievable and searchable with a click of a button .
Send that one compelling article to your friend that you were arguing endlessly with about taxes or gun control ; if it ca n’t convince him , maybe nothing can .
What we see at LRC and at the rest of the great libertarian sites is the libertarian movement finally finding its perfect method for outreach .
Nowhere else are people so open - minded , disabused of the administration ’s newspeak and the conventional history and economics that plague academia and the mass media , and ready to consider voluntary , peaceful solutions to fix society ’s problems and serve our individual needs .
Nowhere else are people so simultaneously skeptical of the current social order but grateful for their fellow man and the many fruits of voluntary , free exchange .
The Internet really is the destined home for libertarianism , and our greatest hope for freedom .
On it we see the free market of ideas and services flourish even as the politicians try to stamp out civil society in realspace .
On it we see the truth win out over the political and media establishment .
On it we see the spirit of liberty .
The state cannot catch up to , it cannot match , and it cannot begin to comprehend the full power of the Internet .
Politicians are baffled by it because it does n’t conform to their assumptions about the world , about human organization , about the need for central planning .
The glorious Internet is a major source of confusion for all with a statist mindset .
The net is revolutionizing society , all toward more voluntary , civil and efficient methods of organization .
It has given us all a way to participate in speaking the truth and standing up to the state .
The Internet is ours — it belongs to the people and especially the friends of freedom and peace who feel so at home online because it is so free and so much the way we ’d like to see the rest of the world .
And so , when the revolution comes — when the state declines and freedom triumphs — the Internet will have played a deciding role .
And I am hopeful of that future , and the move our culture is making toward it .
Thanks to the net , our wildest imaginations and dreams might come true , and our destiny and our society might prove to be — just like LewRockwell.com , and just like so much of the Internet culture — anti-state , anti-war , and pro-market .
My great thanks to Anthony Gregory , without whom I could not have organized my thoughts so well .

The Best of Eric Garris
In just a few days , much has been written about Florida Congressman Mark Foley ’s resignation over sexually explicit emails sent to underage boys .
People have written about how this is bad news for the Republicans in an election season , how this reflects on House Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R. - Ill . ) especially if he had an inkling this was going on , and about how Foley might be prosecuted under the laws he helped enact .
There are two issues that really bug me , though , that are n’t really part of the political football game .
First , how does a person in the year 2006 use IM and email to do something that would so obviously ruin their career ?
Second , why is it that a man who fought so hard against child pornography and was chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children end up getting in trouble for actions so disturbingly opposed to his public crusade ?
One the first point , I know we have plenty of evidence that members of Congress know very little about technology and the Internet .
But Foley is relatively young , just over 50 , and has worked on bills dealing with child pornography on the Internet .
Did he think the Internet is like a big truck , something you just dump something on ?
In reality , it ’s a series of tubes , leading directly back to your computer .*
Real anonymity on the Internet is difficult – especially when the boys you are contacting already know who â€ œ Maf54 â€ ?
really is !
My second issue is the apparent tendency of people in power to abuse their power to pursue starkly hypocritical vices .
I ’m not talking about the normal , run -of - the - mill campaign promise hypocrisy that most politicians fall into .
When Bush landed on that aircraft carrier and beamed to the cameras , depsite having defended the skies of Texas from the Viet Cong in his youth , it was a load of hooey , but an understandable , market - tested load of hooey .
Misdeeds in office are not , of course , limited to Republicansâ € ” we all remember Clintonâ € ” but man , there is quite a list of Republicans .
Foley ’s emails , though , crossed a line into a larger , more robust hypocrisy , televangelist - caught - with - hookers territory .
The rarefied air of â€œdrug addicts should be put in prison , except meâ€ ?
with an unsettling twist of harming others as well as himself .
Why is it that those who claim the most moral superiority so often end up on the news for not doing as they say ?
Was Foley ’s crusade against child pornography a calculated , elaborate cover design to let him get away with what he wanted to do ?
Did he start out with good intentions , only to be tempted by power and a feeling of invincibility ?
Is it the Michael Jackson disorder â€ “ being surrounded for so long by people who tell you that you are great no matter what you do that you lose touch with reality ?
I do n’t know .
Sometimes it is comforting to see how the mighty have fallen .
It can be nice to think , as you are lambasted by some some holier - than - thou gassbag , that it ’s just a matter of time before they find him with his thumb in some transvestite ’s rear end .
But how easily some make the long leap between normal hypocrisy and big , exploitative , risky hypocrisy is unsettling to me .
* Wow , did I really just take advantage of possible child solicitation to further ridicule Senator Ted Stevens ?
Yes … yes I did .

Meet the earliest baby girl ever discovered !
Discovery of an Australopithecus afarensis child will help to answer important questions concerning human evolution
3.3 million years ago , a three year old girl died in present day Ethiopia , in an area called Dikika .
Though a baby , she provides researchers with a unique account of our past , as would a grandmother .
Her completeness , antiquity , and age at death combine make this find unprecedented in the history of paleoanthropology and open many new research avenues to investigate into the infancy of early human ancestors .
The extraordinary discovery reported this week in the scientific journal Nature , was found in north - eastern Ethiopia , by a paleoanthropological research team led by Dr. Zeresenay Alemseged of the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig , Germany .
The scientific significance of the new find is multi-fold , contributing substantially to our comprehension of the morphology , body plan , behaviour , movement and developmental patterns of our early ancestors .
After full cleaning and preparation of the fossil it will be possible to reconstruct , for the first time , much of an entire body of a 3 year - old Australopithecus afarensis child , which will resolve many pending questions regarding early human evolution .

The new find consists of a skeleton of the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found that lived 150,000 years before Lucy .
She was only three years old when she died and belongs to Australopithecus afarensis ( the Lucy species ) and was found in an area called Dikika , in Ethiopia , by a paleoanthropological team , the DRP ( Dikika Research Project ) led by Dr. Zeresenay Alesmeged of the Max Planck Institute .
The DRP is an international and multidisciplinary project including several researchers with diverse areas of expertise , and about 40 assistants conducting field research in Ethiopia every year .
The first piece of the baby was found on December 10th , 2000 , but recovering the partial skeleton required intensive searching and sifting over four successive field seasons between 2000 and 2004 .
To date only recent Hominoids such as Neandertals and modern humans are known from fairly complete skeletons of infants .
For the preceding several million years of human evolution , however , not a single young child is know by remains representing more than a skull , a piece of jaw or some isolated teeth .
Against this background , the completeness and state of preservation of the Dikika girl stands as one of the major discoveries in the history of paleoanthropology .
The find comprises the whole skull with a natural brain sandstone impression in addition to previously completely unknown or very little known skeletal parts including the hyoid bone .
Of the upper part of the skeleton , most of the spinal column , both shoulder blades , the ribs and both collar bones were recovered .
Shoulder blades are almost absent in the fossil record of the earliest human ancestors except for fragmentary pieces from Lucy and another Australopithecus species ( Australopithecus afarensis ) .
Parts of the lower limb , including both knee caps and substantial parts of the thigh and shin bone from both legs were also recovered in addition to an almost complete foot .
Contextual evidence from the sediments that yielded the baby , in addition to the absence of evidence for carnivore activities , abrasion or corpse transport indicate that she was probably buried in a rapid flood event soon after death .
It is also possible that the same flood could have caused her demise .

When discovered , all bones of the upper part of the skeleton including the skull , the shoulder blades , the collar bones , the ribs and the spinal column were encased in a very compact sandstone block and glued to each other .
In most cases the difficulty paleoanthropologists face is putting very fragmentary pieces they find back together .
In the case of the Dikika girl , however , the challenge was the opposite ; sediments had to be removed almost grain by grain using dental instruments passing between ribs and the twisted spinal column .
The process has taken the MPI researchers five years so far .
The specimen was also CT scanned at the Diagnostic Centre in Nairobi , Kenya .
This technique enabled researchers to examine the developing permanent teeth allowing determination the sex and age at death of the new fossil .
Among the major scientific contributions of this find are , first , the Dikika girl documents for the first time the complete skull morphology of juvenile Australopithecus afarensis .
Based on the new find it is now possible to study how the skull of A. afarensis changed during growth when individuals passed from the childhood to adulthood .
Second , the brain size of the Dikika girl , who was 3 when she died , is estimated at 330 cubic centimetres which is not very different from that of a 3 year - old chimpanzee .
However , when compared to the adult values of its species , the Dikika baby had formed only between 63 and 88 % of the adult brain size , which is lower than that of chimpanzee where by the age of 3 over 90 % of the brain is formed .
This relatively slow brain growth observed in A. afarensis is slightly closer to that of humans , pointing to a possible behavioural shift in this species that lived 3.5 million years ago .
Third , the post cranium ( the skeleton other than the head ) is represented by many bones that carry vital information regarding the locomotion ( movement ) and height of A. afarensis .
The femur ( thigh bone ) , the tibia ( shin bone ) and the foot of the girl preserve evidence that this ancient species walked upright effectively even at the age of three .
However the two shoulder blades are similar to those of gorillas .
The fingers are also long and curved as seen in other A. afarensis specimens .

This raises old but unanswered questions .
While an effective biped when on the ground , A. afarensis probably preserved its capacities for tree climbing which could have been adaptive for sleeping at night and avoiding predators , particularly for the smaller ones .
Fourth , among the rare and exciting discoveries is the hyoid bone .
Its morphology in the Dikika girl is similar to that of African great apes and different from that of humans .
This bone is unknown from any extinct human ancestor species except for one Neanderthal specimen , and is presumed to have had an important role in human speech development , giving us some clues to understanding the nature and evolution of the human voice box .
Preparation of the new fossil is still in progress .
Elements that are discussed here were investigated only partly .
Also , it was not possible at this stage to examine many parts of the skeleton , particularly the ribs , the vertebrae and the collar bones and to analyze their relevance to the locomotor behaviour of A. afarensis .
After this is done , however , a clear picture of the body plan of baby human ancestors will emerge and will be crucial for addressing questions pertaining to behaviour , body proportions , height and skeletal development in early human ancestors .

The DRP was supported financially or logistically by the French Centre for Ethiopian Studies , the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University , the Leakey Foundation as well as the National Geographic Society until 2004 .
Since then funding is from the Max Planck Society .
The DRP conducts its annual field and laboratory research with permission from and under the auspices of the ARCCH ( Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage ) , the National Museum of Ethiopia and regional offices in Ethiopia .
More than 40 people including several researchers have contributed to uncover the remains of the baby as well as understand the geology , environment and significance of the find .
I 'm thinking this morning about students and crushes .
( Actually , I 'm also thinking about UCLA basketball , my boxing footwork , pacifism , the health of one of my youth group teens , my wife 's smile , and my chinchilla , but those are not subjects for the blog today .
Oh , and I still want a diet Coke very badly .
Is Lent half over yet ? )
Recently , I heard from one of my former students , " Darren . "
He took my class back when I was a new prof , in the mid-1990s .
He eventually finished his degree , got his master 's , and is now himself an adjunct at several Los Angeles - area community colleges ( PCC is not one of them ) .
Darren and I email every once in a while , and I got a note from him a couple of weeks ago that 's been on my mind .
Here 's some of what he wrote , which I 've edited a wee bit :
Hugo , I love teaching , and I really believe I am supposed to be doing this .
But I 'm becoming aware of a problem I have , and I think it may be one you had too : student crushes .
I 've got a few women in a few of my classes who have crushes on me , and one or two of them have been flirting with me pretty heavily .
I try and have good boundaries with them , because I 'm only an adjunct .
I do n't want to lose my job , and besides , I do very much want to be a professional in and out of the classroom .
But it 's so hard , because outside of the classroom I 'm so shy with women .
Inside the classroom , I feel so desirable and powerful .
My question is this , Hugo : how did you or do you keep this from going to your head ?
How do you keep yourself from paying special attention to the ones who make it so obvious that they like you / want you ?
Any advice you can give me would be awesome .
I have Darren 's permission to address this on the blog .
( Also , let me add three things : Darren is 31 , single , and his name is n't really Darren . )
I 've already emailed Darren back , and I did n't save what I wrote .
But he 's had me thinking about how it is that we who teach can best think about the crushes our students will get on us .
First off , before this starts to sound like a narcissistic rant about how " crushable " a teacher I am , let me be very clear that I 've rarely met a genuinely talented prof of either sex who was n't the object of desire from at least a few students .
A truly effective teacher will often be the object of desire , regardless of what he or she looks like .
Student crushes , I am convinced , are less about the physical attractiveness of the professor and more about that professor 's passion , certainty , and competence .
Those three attributes are , for lack of a better word , intensely sexy for many people !
When I was an undergrad at Cal , I had a crush on a fellow student named Tiffany .
Tiffany saw me as just a friend , however , in one of those all - too - common scenarios that most of us know plenty about .
But Tiffany had a massive crush on one of her anthropology professors .
He was in his late forties , and while he was reasonably fit for his age , no one would mistake him for a sex symbol .
He wore earth tones ( which did n't suit him ) ; he was balding and perhaps 5 ' 6 " .
But I was in his class too , and I have to admit , he was mesmerizing .
He had passion for his subject , he was a gifted lecturer , he had a sense of humor , and he struck the perfect balance between self - deprecation and arrogance .
( I 've always thought that 's a tough needle to thread , and I find myself striving for it often . )
Tiffany was in love with Professor P , and I eventually admitted I could see why .
I asked her one day what she wanted from him , and she told me :
It 's not about sex , really .
It 's that I want to be inside his head .
I want to be near him , I want him to talk to me for hours , I want him to focus just on me and I want to sit next to him and soak up everything about him .
" Oh " , I said .
I did n't get it .
But after thirteen years of teaching , I get it .
Students get crushes on me from time to time , just as they do on " Darren " and " Professor P. "
Occasionally , some of those crushes have a specific romantic agenda .
When I was single , I sometimes ( not often ) got asked out at the end of the semester or received other signs of clear interest in pursuing a relationship of some sort .
But the vast majority of crushes were not and are not about actual sexual or romantic desire .
Most are like Tiffany 's crush on Professor P .
If we 're doing our job right , we have the power to change the way a student thinks about himself or herself .
At our best , those of us who love to teach are practiced seducers , Casanovas of the classroom .
But my agenda is n't about sexual conquest , it 's about creating an interest and a passion where none previously existed .
It 's about getting students to want something they did n't know they wanted !
And when a student has a crush on me , I told Darren , it 's more often than not like Tiffany 's crush on Professor P .
Though some students may sexualize their crushes , what they really want is to continue to feel the way you make them feel : excited , energized , provoked , challenged .
If we take advantage of student crushes , I told Darren , we make a huge mistake .
We assume that the real interest was in us rather than in how we were able to make our students feel and how we were able to make them think .
The best way , I told Darren , to think about student crushes is to take them as a sign that you 're probably doing your job pretty damn well .
And while age and perceived physical attractiveness may play a small part in encouraging these crushes , the real precipitator is enthusiasm , talent , and an obvious commitment to your students .
There 's an old axiom in pop psychology : we do n't just get crushes on people whom we want , we get crushes on people whom we want to be like !
Students do n't get crushes on me because they want to go to bed with me or be my girlfriend or boyfriend ; they get crushes on me because I 've got a quality that they want to bring out in themselves .
They 're externalizing all of their hopes for themselves .
And rather than encourage the crush to feed my ego , my job is to turn the focus back on to the student , encouraging him or her to take their new - found curiosity or enthusiasm or passion and use it , run with it , indulge it , let it take them places !
That 's what student crushes mean to me .
After I wrote some of this to Darren , he wrote back :
" Hugo , thanks .
But honestly , I 'm a little bit crestfallen .
I did want it to be about me !
I did want my students to want me , even though I know that that seems so selfish and manipulative .
At the same time , I 'm glad to know that you think there 's a healthy function for these things .
Still , I 'm a bit chagrined . "
I told him I knew how he felt .
本記事では、交通状況とルートの表示について解説します。Google マップがどのように渋滞や最適なルートを表示しているかについて、少し掘り下げてみましょう。
世界中のドライバーから提供される交通状況
ユーザーが Google マップのナビゲーションを使うと、集合化された位置情報データが活用され 、世界中の道路の交通状況が把握できるようになります。この情報は、現在の交通量の予測に役立ちますが、これだけではルート上で発生している渋滞が、たとえば
10 分後 、20 分後、50 分後の交通量にどう影響するかまではわかりません。そこで、テクノロジーの力が必要になります。
高度な機械学習手法と過去のデータを用いた渋滞予測
近い未来の渋滞を予測するために 、Google マップは、過去の交通状況を分析しています。たとえば、カリフォルニア州北部の州間高速道路
280 号を走行する自動車の速度が、午前 6 時から 7 時は時速 100 km、午後遅くには時速 25 km から 30 km 程度を示しているとします
。Google は、そうした過去の交通パターンのデータベースとルートの現在の交通状況を組み合わせ、機械学習を使って双方のデータセットに基づいた予測を行っています。
Google マップの到着予定時刻はすでに非常に高い精度を誇っており、これまでも予測の実に
97 % 以上が正確に算出されていましたが 、Google マップ は Alphabet AI 研究所である DeepMind と協力し最新の技術を用いることによって、渋滞予測の精度が更に向上しました。DeepMind と協同で Graph Neural Networks ( GNN ) と呼ばれる機械学習アーキテクチャを使用することで、不正確な到着予定時刻の表示される割合をさらに減少させ、ベルリン、ジャカルタ、サンパウロ、シドニー、東京、ワシントンなどで大幅な改善を達成しています。この手法により、Google マップは、「これから発生するかもしれない渋滞」による影響をより正確に予測できるようになりました。
データを新鮮に保 つ
Google マップが交通状況データの提供をはじめてから 13 年間、ルートの交通状況を示す指標として過去の交通パターンは信頼できるものでしたが、それは絶対とは限りません。新型コロナウイルス感染症の拡大により、あらゆる場所で交通パターンが劇的に変化しています。2020 年前半にロックダウン ( 都市封鎖 ) が始まったことにより、世界中で交通量が最大
50 % 減少しました。一部の国や地域では移動が解禁されていますが、規制が継続されているエリアも残されています。こうした急激な変化に機敏に対応するため、過去 2 週間から 4 週間の交通パターンを自動的に優先し、それ以前のパターンの優先順位を下げるよう、計算モデルをアップデートしました。
Google マップがどのようにルートを選択している か
Google の渋滞予測モデル は 、Google マップの運転ルート選択の鍵でもあります。ルートの交通量が増えることが予測された場合、Google マップは自動的に代替ルートを検索します。ただし、ルート検索は、道路の種類などの要素も考慮に入れています。たとえば、舗装路と未舗装路 ( 砂利道や泥道など ) では、運転のしやすさが大きく異なります。そのため、Google マップは、なるべくそうした困難なルートを推奨しないようにしています。また、停止発進の多い生活道路よりも、幹線道路の方が効率的な場合が多いため、道路の大きさや直進性なども確認しています。
残る 2 つは、地方自治体から提供される正確なデータ、そしてユーザーから提供されるリアルタイムの情報です。これらは、最適なルートを推奨するために重要な役割を果たしています。これらのデータにより、制限速度、料金所、道路工事や新型コロナウイルス感染拡大防止措置による通行止めなどを把握できます。また、運転者が道路情報を報告できる
「 レポートの追加」機能を活用して、道路や車線の閉鎖、道路工事、事故車両、落下物などをすばやく表示しています。これらの情報は、土砂崩れ、吹雪、その他の自然災害などによる道路状況の予期せぬ変化の把握にも役立てられています。
すべてを組み合わせ る
では、こうした情報を実際にどのように使うことができるのでしょうか。たとえば、病院の予約時間に合わせていつものルートを運転するとします。渋滞予測と実際の交通状況を組み合わせる
Google マップを使えば、家を出た直後は道路の流れがよく、渋滞が発生していなくても、約
30 分後にルート上で予期せぬ渋滞に巻き込まれてしまい、予約時間に間に合わなくなる可能性を事前に知ることができます。そうした場合、Google マップは、周辺の道路状況や事故情報に基づいて、自動的に代替ルートを提案します。これにより、渋滞を回避して、予約時間に間に合うように目的地に到着できます。 渋滞予測とルート選択は、非常に複雑です
。Google マップは、渋滞を回避しながら、できる限り安全で効率的なルートを検出するツールやテクノロジーの開発に引き続き注力していきます。
Radium Water Baths
August 2000
Nowata Oklahoma is a little town about an hour North of Tulsa .
There are various legends and strange stories about the town 's past , but one of the oddest things is this sign on the side of one of the buildings downtown .
It seems that at some point ( before the effects of radio activity were well known ) , the locals discovered that they could make water glow by putting radium in it .
They opened a spa of sorts where people could pay money to come sit in a pool of toxic waste !
It was considered therapeutic .
According to www.radonmines.com the state of Montana says it is healthy for you to sit in a mine containing radon gas .
The owners of the mine will charge you $ 150 for the priviledge of sitting in the mine for 32 hours
With mobile phones becoming as prevalent as conventional phones ( there are 195 million cellular subscribers in this country ) , wireless companies are starting to exploit the phones ' tracking abilities .
For example , companies are marketing services that turn phones into even more precise global positioning devices for driving or allowing parents to track the whereabouts of their children through the handsets .
Not surprisingly , law enforcement agencies want to exploit this technology , too -- which means more courts are bound to wrestle with what legal standard applies when government agents ask to conduct such surveillance .
Cellular operators like Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless know , within about 300 yards , the location of their subscribers whenever a phone is turned on .
Even if the phone is not in use it is communicating with cellphone tower sites , and the wireless provider keeps track of the phone 's position as it travels .
The operators have said that they turn over location information when presented with a court order to do so .
The recent rulings by the magistrates , who are appointed by a majority of the federal district judges in a given court , do not bind other courts .
But they could significantly curtail access to cell location data if other jurisdictions adopt the same reasoning .
( The government 's requests in the three cases , with their details , were sealed because they involve investigations still under way . )
" It can have a major negative impact , " said Clifford S. Fishman , a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney 's office and a professor at the Catholic University of America 's law school in Washington .
" If I 'm on an investigation and I need to know where somebody is located who might be committing a crime , or , worse , might have a hostage , real - time knowledge of where this person is could be a matter of life or death . "
Pupils keep music on the iBooks so take care of it
Empire High School is one of a band of schools which is taking computer technology out of the classroom and into students ' bags .
Calvin Baker , chief superintendent of the Vail School district , told BBC World Service programme Go Digital that it has not signalled the total demise of text books .
" There are no text books other than a couple on the shelf for teachers to use as resource , " he explains .
" We still have a library - we are not anti-books .
We have a library and we encourage students to use it , but the primary delivery of instruction materials is being done through the laptops . "
The school joins many other educational institutions which are embracing technologies , such as iPods and laptops , and trusting students to use them appropriately .
Money routing
Providing all the pupils with Apple iBooks did not dent the school 's budget as much as might be expected .
But part of that is down to the school having been newly built .
The money that was budgeted to buy text books , which was about $ 500 a student , was spent instead on the laptops .
" Our laptops cost is about $ 800 per pupil .
Our net cost is probably $ 100 to $ 200 more than if we had used text books , " he says .
By giving all the students a laptop computer , the school has done away with computer laboratories too .
[ Music 's ] a very valuable part of their life , and that is where their collection is , and so they take pretty good care of it [ the laptop ] just because it is something that is personally important to them
Calvin Baker , Vale School district
Diary of a laptop student
" Some classes are relying primarily on a service , where you need a password to get to it .
Some classes ' teachers are using electronic text books as a resource - not as a primary tool but as a resource and then a lot of our classes are relying very heavily on simply free material that is available on the internet . "
One of the big advantages to this approach , he says , is that teachers have a lot more opportunity to choose material that is particularly relevant to that subject .
" When you are using or selecting a text book , it is an all or nothing package .
The beauty of the internet is that it allows teachers for every unit to go out and pick the material that they believe is absolutely relevant for that particular topic . "
Risky business ?
But providing every student with their own valuable bit of kit such as a laptop might be seen as risky by some .
Mr Baker thinks that by allowing the pupils to keep their music on the machines has meant they see the technology in a different way .
" That 's a very valuable part of their life , and that is where their collection is , and so they take pretty good care of it just because it is something that is personally important to them . "
The school also ensures there are no hi-tech excuses for not doing homework .
" The dog ate it " used to be the Monday morning cry .
But , with a laptop as a textbook , there are a host of other excuses they could employ , such as " the hard drive crashed " .
" That 's a hard one to use because everything is backed up continually on our server at school , " explains Mr Baker .
" But we have found that the laptops have not changed their basic human nature , so yes , students still figure out ways to come up with excuses for not having their homework in . "
Last year , a leading UK charity , Citizens Online , called on the UK government to provide laptop computers for every UK schoolchild by 2010 .
Humans have survived ice ages and deadly pandemics to become the dominant species on Earth , even if our reign over the planet barely represents a blip in a geological record that has seen countless living organisms come and go .
We have adapted to live almost anywhere , and have harnessed the power of nature by splitting atoms and splicing DNA to reshape the world .
Yet those same technologies could also doom humanity to extinction if misused .
Can humans survive ?
( Give your answer in poll below . )
A few doom prophets say no .
More experts say yes , but caution that humans must learn to wield technology more wisely to fend off natural threats such as asteroids .
Wisdom can also teach humans to avoid destroying themselves with biotechnology or nanotechnology run amok . [ 10 Ways to Destroy Earth ]
" As we move to a civilization that 's so much more powerful in terms of controlling nature and manipulating nature , and becoming ever more powerful in our tools and capabilities , there 's an inherent risk in that , " said Benny Peiser , a social anthropologist and director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation in London , England .
Technology has given humans a better shot at long - term survival today than at any point in their history , Peiser said .
He added the cautionary note that humans still face a risky transition before being able to responsibly use such technology .
People once faced extinction at their own hands during the Cold War , when the United States and the Soviet Union pointed hundreds of nuclear weapons at one another and stood ready for mutually assured destruction at a moment 's notice .
But nuclear does n't represent the only double - edged technology around today .
{{ embed = " 20100719 " }}
From biotech to nanotech
" The biggest challenges we have are that technology is growing at an exponential rate , which means the ability to fundamentally affect the world and affect large populations has gone from something that only governments can do to something that individuals and small groups can do , " said Peter Diamandis , chairman and CEO of the X Prize Foundation .
As a leading innovator and entrepreneur , Diamandis has supported both individual and collaborative solutions for some of the world 's greatest challenges through the X Prizes .
He noted that technology will enable almost anyone to change the world in the near future , for better or for worse .
" On the positive side , this means small DIY groups can develop and fly ships in space , or develop new medicines or drugs , " Diamandis told LiveScience .
" On the negative side , these same exponentially growing technologies enable terrorists to do incredibly powerful things . "
For instance , digital maps of DNA sequences and ever - cheaper lab equipment could eventually enable so - called garage biologists to design new synthetic organisms that could revolutionize medicine and usher in a new era of clean energy .
But they could also allow individuals to unleash new , deadlier infectious diseases upon the world , such as a reengineered version of the 1918 influenza virus that killed 50 million people .
Peiser recalled the late science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke once telling him about the idea of putting a computer chip in people 's brains to keep them from turning terrorist , so to speak .
But Peiser pointed to political or cultural solutions as the more realistic way to keep technology in check .
" There is no technological fix [ for super - tech ] , " Peiser said .
Biotechnology will pose the greatest challenges during the next decade , according to Diamandis .
The following rise of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence , or AI , could also raise fresh challenges .
Nanotechnology 's focus on manipulating molecules on the tiniest scales has evoked the apocalyptic " gray goo " vision of self - replicating creatures or robots running amok , at least in the popular imagination .
Yet a likelier challenge may come from AI becoming self - aware and perhaps rivaling humans as a second intelligent species .
Rise of the robots
Military experts do occasionally warn of the so - called " Terminator " scenario , given the thousands of rolling , crawling and flying robots now roam the battlefields .
But their concerns reflect a more practical view of how to get today 's robots to avoid killing the wrong targets due to malfunction or system error .
Indeed , today 's AI falls far short of sentience and still struggles to learn how to perceive and navigate the real world , not to mention detect the social behaviors and emotions necessary for complex interactions with humans .
Most AI outside of the labs has become the specialized brains behind certain technologies found in factories , homes and cars .
That partnership may still serve humanity well in tackling future threats posed by rogue individuals .
Better AI could figuratively crawl across the Internet and search for unrelated pieces of data that may create a trail to would - be perpetrators such as bioterrorists , Diamandis said .
They might also trigger automatic systems to prevent natural or man-made disaster , without the need for an error - prone human .
" We will soon have large sensor networks that are sensing the air and scanning for bacteria and viruses that you might breathe out , identifying those and shutting them down , " Diamandis explained , referring to bioweapons .
But if AI does truly become an intelligent rival in the future , humans may end up facing a situation not unlike that of advanced extraterrestrials descending upon Earth – except AI would possibly already control the world by default .
They came from outer space
People ranging from science fiction authors to famed British physicist Stephen Hawking have long pondered the idea of Earth at the mercy of aliens .
Researchers continue to fiercely debate about the widespread existence of extraterrestrial life in the universe , or lack thereof .
A more certain threat from outer space exists in the form of giant asteroids or comets .
One such space rock spelled doom for the dinosaurs that ruled Earth for hundreds of millions of years , and scientists say it 's only a matter of time before another planet - killer heads for Earth .
A loose coalition of ground and space - based observatories already watch out for incoming danger , even if astronomers still wish for better coverage of the sky .
Better instruments placed farther out from Earth could also give the advanced warning necessary to prepare a response .
Diamandis remained more concerned about the man-made threats from technologies emerging over the next several decades .
But he acknowledged the asteroid threat , and also pointed to the many benefits of humans spreading out beyond Earth .
" When I got a chance to talk with Stephen Hawking , Hawking said [ he did n't ] think humanity has a future if it does n't get off the planet because of all the exponential dangers , " Diamandis recalled .
" I do believe it 's a moral imperative for the human race to get off the biosphere . "
Clearing the doomsday climate
Escaping the Earth could also ease the strain that energy - hungry humans have placed on the planet .
Experts remain divided about whether humans have pushed Earth beyond its environmental and climate tipping points , but at least one scientist predicted last month that humans would go extinct within 100 years .
Frank Fenner , a microbiologist at Australian National University who helped wipe out the disease smallpox , told The Australian that he believed overpopulation , environmental destruction and especially climate change would seal humanity 's fate .
His views deviate sharply from those of most experts , who do n't view climate change as the end for humans .
Even the worst - case scenarios discussed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do n't foresee human extinction .
" The scenarios that the mainstream climate community are advancing are not end - of - humanity , catastrophic scenarios , " said Roger Pielke Jr. , a climate policy analyst at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Humans have the technological tools to begin tackling climate change , if not quite enough yet to solve the problem , Pielke said .
He added that doom - mongering did little to encourage people to take action .
" My view of politics is that the long - term , high - risk scenarios are really difficult to use to motivate short - term , incremental action , " Pielke explained .
" The rhetoric of fear and alarm that some people tend toward is counterproductive . "
Searching for solutions
One technological solution to climate change already exists through carbon capture and storage , according to Wallace Broecker , a geochemist and renowned climate scientist at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory in New York City .
But Broecker remained skeptical that governments or industry would commit the resources needed to slow the rise of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels , and predicted that more drastic geoengineering might become necessary to stabilize the planet .
" The rise in CO2 is n't going to kill many people , and it's not going to kill humanity , " Broecker said .
" But it 's going to change the entire wild ecology of the planet , melt a lot of ice , acidify the ocean , change the availability of water and change crop yields , so we 're essentially doing an experiment whose result remains uncertain . "
Others seemed more sanguine about humanity maintaining a happier existence on Earth .
For instance , X Prize founder Diamandis expressed confidence about humanity solving its energy and environment issues .
Similarly , social anthropologist Peiser called for a sober assessment of the risks ahead , but also kept an optimistic outlook .
" Obviously we need a little bit of luck in terms of time , where we can have perhaps a couple of centuries to prepare for big comet or asteroid impact , " Peiser said .
" But apart from that , I think it 's really in our hands . "
Defenders of Bush and his war of aggression in Iraq are getting desperate — and especially their self - appointed leaders .
You can tell by the ridiculous arguments that they are beginning to use .
One of the biggest apologists for Bush and the Republican Party is the self - proclaimed “ doctor of democracy , ” Rush Limbaugh .
Not only does he believe that the U.S. military in Afghanistan is “ doing the Lord ’s work over here , ” he is also an outspoken supporter of the war in Iraq .
In Limbaugh ’s mind , opponents of the Iraq war are all leftists .
He apparently has little regard for the first amendment when Republicans are in power , for he recently told dissenters : “ When our nation is at war , your duty is to support it , not offer your precious little opinion . ”
On his August 23rd radio talk show ( read the complete transcript here ) , Limbaugh used the most preposterous argument to date in defense of the war in Iraq : Now , the number of highway deaths in this country , 43,443 in 2005 , is 40 to 50 times our troop losses in Iraq and Afghanistan combined .
Well , ten or 20 times at least .
And a whole lot more deaths per month than any civil war in Iraq , if there was or is a civil war in Iraq .
I do n’t know whatever happened to “ if it bleeds , it leads , ” but there ’s a whole lot more bleeding on our highways than in the war zone in Iraq out there , and a whole lot more dying going on in the American highway system than there is in the so - called civil war in Iraq .
I do n’t hear a word from John Kerry who served in Vietnam or John Murtha or Joe Biden or Howard Dean .
For every Cindy Sheehan , there are 40 to 50 mothers who have suffered far worse heartbreak .
Cindy ’s son gave his life for his country , not for going to the drugstore .
In fact , the roadway deaths is at a highest level in 15 years , 43,443 Americans every year , ladies and gentlemen , and we ’re here turning ourselves into rags , pretzeling ourselves into contortions over the combat deaths in Iraq , regardless and mindless of the heroic mission that is taking place .
This is lunacy in broadcasting .
I think Rush ’s Viagra and OxyContin are having a severe drug interaction .
The “ highway deaths ” argument is so irrational that it almost seems like a waste of time to even consider it .
Yet , I have been asked about it several times , even before Limbaugh ’s most recent use of it .
I have not been a regular listener to Rush ’s show since the early Clinton years .
One of my faithful readers happened to tune in on August 23rd and notified me about Limbaugh ’s latest pathetic attempt to justify the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
After reading the transcript of the August 23rd show , I thought of six things that I would say in response to this argument .
I am sure that others have or will probably come up with more , but since I was just asked about it , and since many of Rush ’s loyal dittoheads will now accept and parrot his argument , I thought I would make mine public now .
First , why highway deaths ?
Why not compare the number of dead U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan to the number of deaths in the United States resulting from dog bites or drowning in the bathtub or getting caught in a piece of machinery ?
The answer should be obvious .
War proponents need a high number so as to discount the number of dead U.S. soldiers .
Second , does this mean that if 43,444 U.S. soldiers were to die in Iraq and Afghanistan , because it is one more than were killed in auto accidents , that troop losses would suddenly be too high ?
Or does it mean that if 43,442 U.S. soldiers were to die , because it is one less than were killed in auto accidents , that troop losses would be acceptable ?
Third , if the number of highway deaths is the standard for this war , then what about previous wars ?
We lost 405,000 U.S. soldiers in that “ good war , ” World War II .
I suppose then that since troop losses in World War II exceeded traffic deaths that we should say that World War II was an unjust war .
Fourth , if the number of highway deaths is the standard for this war , then what about future wars ?
Can we say that as long as traffic deaths exceed battle deaths by at least one that any amount of troop losses is acceptable ?
Fifth , how comforting this “ highway deaths ” argument must be to a mother or father who just lost a son !
How it must console a grieving wife who just lost her husband !
How it must assuage the anguish of a child who just lost his father !
Defenders of Bush ’s wars would n’t use such a ridiculous , irrational argument if it was their son or grandson who was killed .
And finally , most traffic deaths in the United States were accidents and could not be prevented .
That ’s why we use the term “ auto accidents . ”
But the death of every single U.S. soldier killed in battle Iraq and Afghanistan , including those who died from disease and accidents , was preventable .
Every death was preventable because there was no reason for the United States to launch these wars in the first place .
The shedding of the blood of even one American is not worth anything “ good ” that has happened in Iraq or Afghanistan .
It is supporters and defenders of Bush ’s wars who are anti-American .
Real patriots do n’t want to see even one American used as cannon fodder for the state .
Real patriots want their country to be admired not scorned .
Real patriots want their country to be a blessing to the world instead of a curse .
Rush is wrong : Cindy ’s son gave his life for a lie .
He was bushwhacked .

Eric Sink has been hanging around Joel on Software since the early days .
He was one of the creators of the Spyglass web browser , he created the AbiWord open - source word processor , and now he ’s a developer at SourceGear , which produces source code control software .
But most of us around here know him from his contributions as host of The Business of Software , a discussion group that has become the hub for the software startup crowd .
He coined the term micro-ISV , he ’s been writing about the business of software on his blog for several years , and he wrote an influential series of articles for MSDN .
He just published a full - fledged , dead - trees paper book called Eric Sink on the Business of Software , and he asked me to write the foreword , which appears here .
Did I ever tell you the story of my first business ?
Let me see if I can remember the whole thing .
I was fourteen , I think .
They were running some kind of a TESOL summer institute at the University of New Mexico , and I was hired to sit behind a desk and make copies of articles from journals if anybody wanted them .
There was a big urn full of coffee next to the desk , and if you wanted coffee , you helped yourself and left a quarter in a little cup .
I did n’t drink coffee , myself , but I did like donuts and thought some nice donuts would go well with the coffee .
There were no donut stores within walking distance of my little world , so , being too young to drive , I was pretty much cut off from donuts in Albuquerque .
Somehow , I persuaded a graduate student to buy a couple of dozen every day and bring them in .
I put up a handwritten sign that said “ Donuts : 25 ¢ ( Cheap ! ) ” and watched the money flow in .
Every day , people walked by , saw the little sign , dropped some money in the cup , and took a donut .
We started to get regulars .
The daily donut consumption was going up and up .
People who did n’t even need to be in the institute lounge veered off of their daily routes to get one of our donuts .
I was , of course , entitled to free samples , but that barely made a dent in the profits .
Donuts cost , maybe , a dollar a dozen .
Some people would even pay a dollar for a donut just because they could n’t be bothered to fish around in the money cup for change .
I could n’t believe it !
By the end of the summer , I was selling two big trays a day … maybe 100 donuts .
Quite a lot of money had piled up …
I do n’t remember the exact amount , but it was hundreds of dollars .
This is 1979 , you know .
In those days , that was enough money to buy , like , every donut in the world , although by then I was sick of donuts and starting to prefer really , really spicy cheese enchiladas .
So , what did I do with the money ?
Nothing .
The chairman of the linguistics department took it all .
He decided that the money should be used to hold a really big party for all the institute staff .
I was n’t allowed to come to the party because I was too young .
The moral of the story ?
Um , there is no moral .
But there is something incredibly exciting about watching a new business grow .
It ’s the joy of watching the organic growth that every healthy business goes through .
By “ organic , ” I mean , literally , “ of or designating carbon compounds . ”
No , wait , that ’s not what I mean .
I mean plant - like , gradual growth .
Last week you made $ 24 .
This week you made $ 26 .
By this time next year you might be making $ 100 .
People love growing businesses for the same reason they love gardening .
It ’s really fun to plant a little seed in the ground , water it every day , remove the weeds , and watch a tiny sprout grow into a big bushy plant full of gorgeous hardy mums ( if you ’re lucky ) or stinging nettles ( if you got confused about what was a weed , but do n’t lose hope , you can make tea out of the nettles , just be careful not to touch ‘ em ) .
As you look at the revenues from your business , you ’ll say , “ gosh , it ’s only 3:00 , and we ’ve already had nine customers !
This is going to be the best day ever ! ”
And the next year nine customers will seem like a joke , and a couple of years later you ’ll realize that that intranet report listing all the sales from the last week is unmanageably large .
One day , you ’ll turn off the feature that emails you every time someone buys your software .
That ’s a huge milestone .
Eventually , you ’ll notice that one of the summer interns you hired is bringing in donuts on Friday morning and selling them for a buck .
And I can only hope that you wo n’t take his profits and use it for a party he ’s not invited to .
There have been persistent claims of abuse by Iraqi security forces
The prisoners , many malnourished and some showing signs of torture , were found when US troops took control of an interior ministry building on Sunday .
The US raid followed repeated enquiries by the parents of a missing teenager .
Iraq 's prime minister has promised to find those responsible for any abuse .
Most of those held were Sunnis .
' Hard evidence '
The allegations are a deep embarrassment for the Iraqi government , says the BBC's Caroline Hawley in Baghdad .
But she says however shocking , they will not come as a major surprise to many Iraqis .
I saw signs of physical abuse by brutal beating , one or two detainees were paralysed and some had their skin peeled off various parts of their bodies
Hussein Kamal
Deputy interior minister
There have been persistent allegations of abuse by members of the Shia - dominated security forces , she says .
But Sunday 's discovery is hard evidence and officials believe it may be the tip of the iceberg .
There are suspicions the building may also have been used as a base for a militia called the Badr Brigade , and that such militias may have infiltrated Iraq 's security services , our correspondent adds .
The prison is reported to be in the central Jadiriya district of Baghdad .
Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari said he had been told that 173 detainees had been held , that they appeared malnourished , and may have been " subjected to some kind of torture " .
He launched an inquiry and said the prisoners had been moved and would be given medical care .
Deputy interior minister Hussein Kamal , who saw some of the abuse victims personally , said : " I 've never seen such a situation like this during the past two years in Baghdad , this is the worst .
" I saw signs of physical abuse by brutal beating , one or two detainees were paralysed and some had their skin peeled off various parts of their bodies . "
Dr Laith Kubba , a spokesman for Mr Jaafari , said the prime minister was putting all his weight behind the inquiry .
" This is outrageous , " he told the BBC's Newsnight programme .
" It goes very much against the core values that the prime minister and his government hold . "
But he said methods used under Saddam Hussein had not been completely eradicated despite efforts to introduce new practices .
Repeated allegations
Anne Clwyd MP , the UK government 's human rights envoy in Iraq , said she had raised such allegations with Iraqi authorities back in May .
" It is shocking what has happened , " she told Newsnight .
After 35 years of abuse , it takes a long time for people 's mindsets to change
Anne Clwyd MP
She said the UK had been trying to help bring about a cultural change by providing human rights training to Iraq security forces .
" After 35 years of abuse , it takes a long time for people 's mindsets to change , " she said .
The head of Iraq 's largest Sunni political party said attempts to raise claims of torture in government detention centres had been rebuffed .
" According to our knowledge , regrettably , all the detainees were Sunnis , " Mohsen Abdul - Hamid , head of the Iraqi Islamic Party , told the Associated Press news agency .
" In order to search for a terrorist , they used to detain hundreds of innocent people and torture them brutally . "
A US soldier who carried out the raid said : " It 's not what we expected at all , we were looking for a 15 - year - old boy . "
Warnings
Farid Sabri , a UK - based spokesman for the mainly Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party , called for a UN - led independent inquiry into the allegations .
Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari said the prisoners had now been moved
" This is the tip of the iceberg , " he told Newsnight .
" We told the government about this months ago and they did nothing . "
Human rights group Amnesty International welcomed the investigation but said it should cover other allegations of torture and maltreatment by Iraqi police and security forces belonging to the interior ministry .
The security forces have faced repeated allegations of systematic abuse and torture of detainees , and of extra-judicial killings .
A report by pressure group Human Rights Watch earlier this year said methods used by Iraqi police included beating detainees with cables , hanging them from their wrists for long periods and giving electric shocks to sensitive parts of the body .

FOR A while , George Bush seemed confident of getting his way .
In a speech earlier this month he said interrogators of terrorist suspects should be free to use “ alternative techniques ” to gather information to foil pending plots .
Suspects , he added , should be tried in military courts , where defendants enjoy fewer rights than in civilian ones .
And his proposal to sign all this into law seemed to be a sharp political move .
It helped both to shift attention from troubles in Iraq to the “ war on terror ” and to make Democrats squirm .
If they opposed his plans , they risked seeming soft on terrorism just weeks before mid-term congressional elections .
Mr Bush 's bill would have narrowed the interpretation of the Geneva Conventions , to make those chilling “ alternative ” techniques legal .
These include waterboarding — making a suspect believe he is drowning — and the “ cold cell ” , when a naked suspect in freezing conditions is repeatedly doused with icy water .
It would also have created military commissions where suspects could be tried without seeing the evidence against them .
But a group of Republican senators intervened this week to put a stop to Mr Bush 's plans .
The armed - services committee in the Senate did the job .
John McCain , himself tortured while a prisoner in Vietnam , was joined by three other Republicans , including the committee 's chairman , John Warner , and all the Democrats present , in forcing Mr Bush 's hand .
They also got some surprising outside support .
Colin Powell , who served as Mr Bush 's secretary of state , wrote a letter supporting Mr McCain shortly before the vote .
He believes that “ the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism . ”
Last week , the army 's deputy chief of staff for intelligence pointed out what should have been obvious : that that no good information is obtained by torture .
In another curious turn , attention was focused this week on the position of senior military judges .
Some of these had recently testified that suspects , in particular those who face the death penalty , must be able to know about ( and thus contest ) any evidence that is used against them — something Mr Bush 's courts would not allow .
But in a sudden reversal this week , the judges sent a short , tame letter to Congress saying that they now “ do not object ” to Mr Bush 's plans .
Washington DC is abuzz with rumours that they were coerced to recant , probably by civilians in the Pentagon .
The House of Representatives had earlier passed a bill closer to Mr Bush 's wishes , but this will now have to be reconciled with a very different Senate version , which is unlikely before elections in November .
In any case , Mr Bush had originally not wanted to push through new laws .
Suspects at secret CIA prisons in Europe and at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba have already been subjected to waterboarding and the like .
And Mr Bush has already set up plans for military tribunals for those in Guantánamo .
The administration has been operating as though what it was doing was already legal .
That now seems somewhat in doubt .
The Supreme Court has ruled that while terrorist suspects — mainly from the battlefields of Afghanistan — may not have the full rights given in an American domestic criminal trial , they must have some legal process worthy of the name .
Not all is lost with Mr Bush 's anti-terrorism agenda .
He made headway with an effort to legalise electronic eavesdropping ( without getting a warrant in advance ) on international calls and emails .
Again , that is something that the administration has confessed to doing already while on shaky legal ground .
Congress this week moved closer to supporting the idea .
Other democracies ' governments have similar powers , and Americans by and large support it .
Many voters still give Mr Bush the benefit of the doubt on how to fight terrorism .
But trust may now be wearing thin , especially after his scrap with Republican grandees in the Senate .
He still has plenty of fight in him , but he would surely prefer to do it with the Democrats and not the generals and war heroes of his own party .
In Saddam Hussein ’s war crimes trial for the 1988 Iraqi “ Anfal ” campaign that gassed Kurdish villages , his defense lawyers have argued that Iraqi forces were really attempting to strike Iranian forces and the Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga militias that were in and supported by the hamlets .
In other words , the lawyers are asserting that the innocent Kurds who were killed were collateral damage in an effort by the Iraqi government to rid its territory of Iranian fighters and their Kurdish allies during the Iran - Iraq War in the 1980s .
Curiously , this defense sounds similar to Israel ’s defense of killing more than one thousand Lebanese and perpetrating widespread destruction of Shi’ite neighborhoods , apartment houses , water services , electrical power stations , ports , factories , roads , and bridges in Lebanon in its efforts to punish Hezbollah .
Yet Saddam Hussein is on trial for war crimes and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is still in office .
Of course , rabid supporters of Israel would be horrified at a comparison between a democratically elected leader and an autocratic tyrant .
But we are not talking about the selection method for leaders here ; we are comparing their specific actions during wartime .
Supporters of Israel would also note that the Israelis did not use poison gas in Lebanon .
But although chemical weapons provide a grisly death , they kill far fewer people than explosive bombs .
Because they have been wrongly included in the ominous - sounding category of “ weapons of mass destruction ” ( nuclear weapons are probably the only true , practical weapons of mass destruction ) , their use implies a war crime from the get - go .
That is not to defend Saddam ’s use of these area weapons against villages , it is merely to say that the Israelis are no less guilty of committing war crimes by leveling entire villages in southern Lebanon simply because they used conventional bombs to do it .
Amnesty International , a human rights group , has accused Israel of military strikes that included “ directly attacking civilian objects and carrying out indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks . ”
Amnesty concluded that “ the evidence strongly suggests that the extensive destruction of public works , power systems , civilian homes , and industry was a deliberate and integral part of the military strategy rather than collateral damage . ”
The group also accused Israel of deliberately targeting food stores and gasoline stations .
Furthermore , the U.S. State Department , because of complaints from human rights groups , has launched an investigation into whether Israel violated U.S. rules banning the use of U.S. - made cluster bombs  bombs releasing bomblets that explode over a wide area to target people  in residential areas .
The UN Mine Action Coordination Center has confirmed 289 instances of cluster bomb usage by Israel , many of them in civilian areas .
Although the investigation is not yet complete , the circumstantial evidence looks damning , and the Israeli track record on this score is not good .
According to the Washington Post , as a result of a congressional investigation that discovered the Israelis had violated agreements on the use of U.S. - made cluster weapons during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon , the Reagan administration suspended sales of them to Israel for six years .
In fact , the main difference between Saddam ’s war crimes and Israel ’s is that while Saddam denies them , Israeli officials indirectly admit them .
Amnesty cites a comment by Israel ’s top uniformed military official that implied that Israel was trying to punish the Lebanese population and government to get them to oppose Hezbollah .
The group noted that Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen.
Dan Halutz called Hezbollah a “ cancer ” that Lebanon must expunge “ because if they do n’t , their country will pay a very high price . ”
Adding to this intentional targeting of civilians for political reasons ( when Hezbollah and other non-governmental groups do it , it is called “ terrorism ” ) in Lebanon , Israel is currently still conducting a military and economic siege of Gaza .
To punish the people of Gaza for electing the wrong party in democratic elections last January , and for Hamas ’ capture of an Israeli soldier , Israel slapped a blockade on the area that prohibits almost all goods from being exported and restricts imports , except for limited food supplies .
Israel bombed an electricity plant in Gaza , making supplies of power and water intermittent , since water supplies depend on electric pumps .
Thus , most factories in Gaza are shut down .
Also , the Israeli military routinely bulldozes the homes of relatives of people it believes to be Hamas fighters .
Trying to kill a population slowly  by strangling the flow of critical goods and cutting off electricity and water to hospitals , orphanages , schools , and factories producing vitally needed goods  is little better than attempting to exterminate it quickly with explosive bombs .
To justify its ill - advised invasion of Iraq , the Bush administration regularly gripes about Saddam Hussein ’s war crimes , while cheering on Israel as it does the same thing in Lebanon and Gaza , just using different weapons .

__Location : __Los Angeles
__Interested in :__Solving the problem of finding a soul mate by creating a fully searchable database of love .
Chau Vuong , a 33 - year - old former equity analyst who specialized in pharmaceutical companies at the investment bank Robertson Stephens , admits he 's never kissed a girl .
He hopes that one day he 'll get married and lose his virginity .
" I do n't actually date , " he explains .
" I just research it . "
With a doctorate in pharmacy and a background in computer science , the self - described " extreme type - A personality " works full time on a desperately personal project : " to solve dating by turning Google into a global dating service . "
Vuong 's boyish smile and giddy laugh give him the air of an awkward college freshman .
Vuong confides that he is " socially retarded in the real world , " but he comes across as just plain innocent .
It 's easy to imagine having a blast with him watching Finding Nemo and drinking hot chocolate .
It 's harder to picture him in a romantic situation .
Vuong is the author of an underground Internet classic , The Soulmate Manifesto , a cost - benefit analysis of romance that proposes " a mathematical model that could predict and explain all human behavior pertaining to love . "
Lately , he 's been all over the Net with his theories about using statistical analysis to find a date .
A few months ago , he launched an online dating service , SocialGrid , which he promised would " change the world . "
Nobody was sure if he was kidding or serious .
When I meet Vuong for lunch at a hip LA diner near Beverly Hills , it 's clear he 's not kidding .
As soon as we sit down , he whips out his laptop to show off its 12 - hour battery .
He tells me about the Grid .
" It 's just like bioinformatics , where you 're searching for a sequence of code in a pool of DNA , " he explains .
" But the DNA is all the Web pages in the world . "
His idea is as simple - and as simplistic - as HTML .
The lovelorn use Vuong 's trademarked Identification Coding System to convert their every physical , intellectual , and psychological attribute into a string of characters .
Then they post the code on their Web sites .
SocialGridsters can surf Google for their ideal mate by typing in their most - wanted combination of codes .
They can customize their searches to locate people of a particular height , religion , educational background , even level of risk tolerance .
In Vuong 's world humans become fully searchable , utterly logical , machine - readable data .
It 's an eccentric courtship strategy but it suits Vuong perfectly .
" My ideal date is to go somewhere with our laptops and do work , " he says with a grin .
Spinning his computer around , he invites me to try his Soul mate Calculator , an app he wrote to convince people that they need his Social Grid technology .
A page full of pulldown menus and checkboxes boots up :
The calculator uses a simple script to crunch US census figures on age , gender , and geographic location to estimate how many people I 'll have to meet before I find my soul mate .
To fill the thing out I need to decide what my potential mate 's ethnicity should be , and whether I want him or her to be in the top 10 percent of people in terms of facial attractiveness , optimism , or musical talent .
Also , how compassionate do I want my soul mate to be ?
Top 50 percent ?
Top 1 percent ?
I have no idea what to check , so I ask the expert .
Vuong confides that he always picks " top 1 percent " on everything .
The calculator crunches my data and tells me I need to meet 200 million people to find my true love .
" It 's a numbers game , and I can lower the search cost for people , " Vuong says .
Vuong 's not only the owner of the SocialGrid , he 's the number one client .
" If I was a tall , good - looking white guy , I 'd be on The Bachelor , " he sighs .
" But I 'll never make it on there .
I 'm a nerdy , short Asian guy . "
Recently , he looked into how much it would cost to put a personal ad up on a billboard next to the freeway .
Resting his chin in his hand , Vuong fiddles with his tuna sandwich .
As our coffee cools , I wonder aloud if Vuong 's romantic quest leaves him lonely .
" In reality , your soul mate is yourself , " he replies with a laugh , wrapping his arms around his shoulders in a hug and then kissing his own hand .
" It 's like Mariah Carey says , " he tells me , surprising our waiter with an impromptu serenade : " The hero lies in you . "

By night , he 's Filchyboy , publisher of a much - read blog .
He delivers a running shtick about the futility of dating in Los Angeles .
He 's tried them all : Match.com , Spring Street Networks , Yahoo !
Personals .
" I joined a lot of online dating services , " he recalls , " but I wound up just dissecting how the sites were put together , which I tend to do with a lot of things . "
Then one day he had a realization : Dating should be more like blogging .
So he began coding something he calls the Dating Syndicate .
When I arrive at the Condomania offices to meet Filkins , he 's finishing up some business on the phone .
I wander around his workspace while he talks , peering with mild trepidation into giant candy jars full of tricolor condoms and shiny plastic packets of lube .
In one room , I discover a " condomenorah . "
Condoms of various hues and sizes are attached to nine PVC pipes arranged to resemble Hanukkah lights .
Filkins joins me and grins as his colleague flips a switch , sending air through the pipes and allowing me to inspect the wares in their fully operational state .
Surrounded as he is by contraptions and condoms , it seems only natural that Filkins would turn to technology for a solution to a romantic conundrum .
Filkins wants to wed online dating to open source software to create the first dating service with a peer - to - peer type of architecture .
The idea is a little like Vuong 's SocialGrid , but far more sophisticated .
And , Filkins hastens to add , a lot more private .
" If I 'm married and want to screw around on the side , I would n't want to post that on Google , " he says .
" I 've perused all the dating sites , and what people want most is privacy . "
At the core of the Dating Syndicate is a relatively untested open source protocol called FOAF ( friend of a friend ) .
This is a flavor of XML file that holds data on a person 's attributes : body type , interests , friends , and assorted other personal information .
Like all XML file types , FOAF files are platform - independent , although Filkins plans to keep all the Dating Syndicate FOAF files on a secure server to ensure user privacy .
Multimedia pioneer Marc Canter 's fledgling Friendster - esque social networking site , People Aggregator , is built on FOAF .
The beauty of the system , he says , is that personal data can be searched and assembled as easily as blog entries are now .
" You can't break down relationships to the ultimate granularity , " Filkins admits , but you can keep up with who 's looking for a hookup .
Filkins imagines the Dating Syndicate as a vast , distributed network of love - seekers who access one another 's profiles P2P - style , thus avoiding the centralization of a Match.com or Spring Street .
" I 'm not positive I can make money out of this , but I 've had a lot of interest from the blog community , " he says .
Personally , I 'm taken with the idea .
" Basically , if I can get a date out of this , it would be great , " Filkins says , flashing an infectious smile .
Which leaves me wondering :
Why does this guy need to hunt the Web for a date ?
He 's got a sweet face and even sweeter personality .
A single dad , he glows with pride when he describes how his 6 - year - old daughter is starting her first blog .
" It 's just hard to find somebody to date when you have a kid , " he explains .
Because he's had such a hard time finding someone , Filkins spins out endless scenarios for dating hyper- personalization .
" I would design the initial set of questions that people answer to create their FOAF file , " he says .
" Then there would be a system available to build new ones .
If , for example , transsexuals wanted to use the protocol , they could come up with their own particular set of questions to ask . "
The Sniffer
__Name:__Kevin Burton
__Status : __Swinging single
__Age:__28
__Location : __San Francisco
__Interested in :__Wardating : using every trick in the hacker playbook to get geeks the girls they never had a chance with in high school .
There are two kinds of optimizers : those who write programs , and those who hack what other people have written .
Kevin Burton is a perfect example of the latter .
With his all - American look , Burton seems to have just stepped out of a Gap ad .
But that does n't mean he can meet women on his own .
For that , he relies on a sneaky little program he invented called the AIM Sniffer .
The cofounder of an Internet startup , Burton spends his days coding in Wi-Fi-enabled cafés and using his AIM Sniffer to keep an eye on all the data traveling over the cafés ' networks .
Between marathon Java - thrashing sessions , he often finds he wants to introduce himself to " a cute girl with a laptop " but is too shy to make an approach .
That 's where the Sniffer comes in handy .
If a hottie fires up her AOL Instant Messenger client , Burton sees her login name and can send her an IM .
" I 've gotten several first dates that way , " he says .
" Women think it 's cute when I can make a message pop on their machine as if by magic .
Now that so many women are online , it 's our chance as geeks to start getting more dates . "
He calls the process wardating , in homage to the old - school hacker practice of wardialing , calling every possible combination of numbers to find open computer networks .
" IM is my medium , " Burton says with a laugh .
" If I can get a girl to respond to my chat message , I 'm golden . "
The trick , he confides , is to deploy certain " social hacks " in the instant message .
" Like smiley - face optimization , " he says .
" You can say anything to a girl if you put a smiley face or a wink after it .
I 've said things like ' You should come over to my house and have sex with me . :) :) :) ' and it's fine because they just think I 'm joking .
And then , more often than not , they 'll come over and have sex with me ! "
It sounds more like a wet dream than reality , but the glint in Burton 's eye makes me a believer .
The guy just does n't have that twitchy , hungry look I associate with sexual desperation .
Despite Burton 's erotic conquests , his AIM Sniffer is still buggy .
He once IM'd the wrong person in a café .
A woman opened her laptop at the same time as a man , and Burton mistakenly wrote a flirty message to the guy .
" He got really angry and threatened to call the cops , until I explained to him what I was doing , " Burton recalls .
" Then he got into it and started IMing me about all the cute girls in the café he wanted to meet . "
Wardating is n't limited to the world of Wi-Fi .
Burton says he 's written dozens of hacks , including a bot that combs Craigslist personals and IMs him when it finds a candidate that meets his specs .
But his favorite is a browser plug - in for the dating site Hot or Not .
" The problem with Hot or Not is it keeps presenting the same pictures over and over because it 's random , " he explains .
" My plug - in remembers which ones I 've seen and will skip them .
That way I can get through the whole site .
When I did that , I had about 50 hot women spamming me the next day . "
Gaming the system like this does n't bother Hot or Not cofounder James Hong .
" As long as he's not selling it , more power to him , " Hong says .
" It 's dating Darwinism - survival of the fittest .
He can outthink , outwit , outplay , and outhack the other guys .
That 's very cool . "
The Stalker
__Name:__Jonathan Moore
__Status : __Happily married
__Age:__27
__Location : __San Francisco
__Interested in :__Exposing vulnerabilities in social networks .
How dirty can dating tricks get ?
To find out , I head to a coffee bar in San Francisco 's Haight - Ashbury district to meet software engineer and entrepreneur Jonathan Moore and his two pals .
When I arrive , they are set up around a forest of laptops covering two tables .
" Need some juice ? " one asks , gesturing to a power strip by the wall .
I do .
These guys churn out hacks that thin the membrane between dating and stalking .
They spend their afternoons chronicling and exploiting the vulnerabilities in dating sites and social networks .
But the strange thing is , they 're not doing it to meet women .
They do n't care about getting lucky .
Moore , in fact , is married and has a baby daughter .
Looking like a young mope - rocker , Moore explains that he wants to call people 's attention to the potential dangers of dating and networking online .
" The security holes in Friendster definitely make it easier for someone to stalk a stranger , " he warns , a hank of hair covering one eye .
His friends nod in unison .
Moore has written several Unix shell scripts that run on - the - fly background checks on people who use wireless networks in his neighborhood .
With the help of the popular network - traffic analysis utility Netcat , his script " sniffs all the traffic on the Wi-Fi network , greps for email addresses , and looks them up on Friendster . "
Then the script sends Moore an email that includes a link to the users '
Friendster profiles , along with their pictures and login IDs .
At a time when it seems that nearly everyone has a Friendster account , Moore says , " You can do really creepy stuff .
You can get the profiles on everyone in your local café , then see who their friends are , and just walk up to them and ask , ' Are n't you Tom 's friend ? ' "
More disturbing , Moore 's toolkit allows him to get zip codes and last names , making it easier to track down the real - world addresses of his targets , thus opening up a whole new universe of creepiness .
" You could do all sorts of mean things , " he says .
And Moore does n't need an insecure Wi -Fi connection to suck up private data .
For a while he had a script running on MySpace , another social network .
Whenever anyone looked at his profile , a dialog box would pop up on their computer and say you are now my friend , and " forcibly add me as a friend to whoever was looking . "
As someone 's " friend , " Moore gains access to personal information from his target .
Moore 's buddy Matt Chisholm chimes in to tell me about a similar hack , a JavaScript app he wrote with Moore that works on Friendster .
It mines for information about anyone who looks at his profile and clicks through to his Web site .
" I get their user ID , email address , age , plus their full name .
Neither their full name nor their email is ever supposed to be revealed , " he says .
Notified of the security holes Moore and Chisholm exploit , Friendster rep Lisa Kopp insists , " We have a policy that we are not being hacked . "
When I explain that , policy or no , they are being hacked , she says , " Security is a big concern .
We have n't seen this problem , though .
No complaints about it . "
Of course , the more hopelessly out of touch a dating site is , the more it encourages geeks to innovate around it .
Today 's dating hacks will be tomorrow 's Friendster or Match.com .

Unix command - line utility netcat gets called the " network swiss army knife " with good reason .
Like the best UNIX utilities , it 's very simple but can perform all sorts of useful tasks .
It 's also described well by its title : netcat is like the utility " cat , " but runs across the network .
One machine is set up with netcat to listen , and then other machines connect to it .
Once connected , you can pipe text through it , open up a command shell on the listening machine , or anything you could do with cat on a local machine .
Advertisement
If you 're a command line geek who 's never used netcat but often works across networked machines , this quick netcat primer 's for you .
( On most distributions , netcat is called " nc . "
It could also exist as netcat .
Here , we 'll assume it 's called nc - which it is in Cygwin for Windows and in Mac OS X. )
Advertisement
Let 's get started netcat 'ting .
Open up two command windows on machines running netcat .
You could do this with one machine for testing purposes or with terminal sessions connecting to two different stations .
In one window , type :
nc -l -p 1234
This tells netcat to start a server and start listening on port 1234 .
Meanwhile , in the other window , type
nc < ip address of listening station >
1234
Not too exciting yet ; it should just be sitting there in each window .
But type something into the second window and hit return .
You should see what you typed pop up in the first window .
Pretty snazzy , no ?
Like I said , it 's a lot like cat .
Advertisement
The snazziness comes from the flexibility of it .
Like , you can have a process running on machine A and pipe its output to machine B . Let 's say you want to watch who 's logged in to machine A .
You might set up a listening server on machine B , and then on machine A you 'd type something like
watch w | nc < machine B ip address >
1234
Then , on the listening machine you'd be watching a running log .
What 's the point ?
Well , you might do this for security reasons — you might want to maintain a log of a process list on a friend 's colo box somewhere across the net .
Advertisement
You can also use netcat as a quick and dirty file copy utility , like so :
( On the destination machine : )
nc -l -p 1234 > destination.filename
( On the source machine : )
cat source .
filename | nc < destination ip >
1234
Advertisement
Once again , you might ask why .
Well , netcat is so standard that you can be almost sure it 'll be on any given machine — much more so than , say , the OpenSSH suite .
Netcat does n't just need to connect to itself .
It can connect to any arbitrary service , and since it can listen on a port , it can connect from any service .
If you start up your listen server again on port 1234 , and then connect to it using Firefox to that port , with the address http://<ip address >: 1234 / " Hello there , " you 'll see your HTTP GET attempt scrolling up in the listen session .
Advertisement
Or you might want to start up a shell .
Start your listen server like so :
nc -l -p 1234 -e /bin/ bash
Connect to it with :
nc < destination ip > 1234
You should be able to type commands to the bash shell and see the output .
( Note : the -e is only enabled when netcat is compiled with it turned on .
When Gina tested this on her machines , Cygwin allowed the -e but Mac OS X did not .
Run a nc -h to list the options available to you ; if -e is listed , you 're golden . )
Advertisement
There is , however , a big problem with Netcat .
It runs everything in plaintext , so anyone sniffing your network can see what you 're doing .
It 's much more secure to use the program cryptcat , available here , which lets you set up arbitrary encrypted sessions .
You can use netcat to run quick chat sessions similar to the old UNIX write command .
To do this , the listen server does :
nc -vlp 1234
Here the -v specifies verbose ; connect to it as normal and both windows should be able to type back and forth .
Advertisement
Netcat can even scan ports !
If you want to scan your machine for open services , type :
nc -v localhost 1-1000
It will return any ports between 1 and 1000 that are responding .
For me , it returned one open port .
localhost [ 127.0.0.1 ] 631 ( ipp ) open
I could n't remember what 631 was so I netcatted to it :
nc -v localhost 631
And it started up a server .
I typed " QUIT " which is a standard exit command for many types of TCP port and it spit back some HTML , including " Server : CUPS / 1.2 . "
It was the web interface for my print server .

Netcat is very useful and very handy .
If you carry around a thumb drive full of apps , netcat should be one of them .
Just like cat , netcat is designed to work as a backend .
With a little python programming ability and netcat , you can do amazing things .
Let 's hear about all the cool uses you 've found for it !
Jason Thomas is a writer and computer professional living in the Twin Cities .
From the shoreline of an ancient salty sea to the bottoms of deep , flood - carved channels , Mars is scarred with geological signs that indicate liquid water once flowed on the its surface .
These findings , combined with the discovery of tiny , spherical " blueberries " and the detection of water ice in the planet 's polar ice caps , have lead scientists to scour the planet for liquid water in recent years .
The elusive quarry has remained hidden , possibly because it may not exist for more than a fleeting second .
Due to Mars ' low temperatures and extremely low atmospheric pressure - less than a hundredth that of the Earth - pure water evaporates from ice to gas so quickly that it skips the liquid phase .
But now , new research by a team of scientists at the University of Arkansas suggests that liquid water could persist for some time on Mars , so long as it is salty .
In the lab
Using a planetary environmental chamber - a tank that mimics the atmosphere , temperature , and pressure of other planets - the team exposed various concentrations of briny water to conditions that match Mars ' colder , less pressurized environment .
Based on these experiments , salty water , it seems , can exist as liquid on Mars .
" It was thought that any liquid on the surface would evaporate almost immediately , " Julie Chittenden , a graduate student with the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences told SPACE.com .
" These brine solutions enable water to stay liquid at colder temperatures .
If you expose these brine solutions to cold temperatures , they can exist for a very long period of time . "
While pure water freezes at zero degrees Celsius , water mixed with sodium chloride and calcium chloride salts - the two salts used in these experiments - remains liquid down to - 21 and - 50 degrees Celsius respectively .
Because salty water can exist as liquid at colder temperatures than pure water , it wo n't make the jump from ice to vapor as quickly , giving it a better chance of existing as liquid on the surface or just below it .
Average Martian temperatures range between - 125 degrees and 28 degrees Celsius at various latitudes at different times during the day , and the salty test samples stayed liquid within the range .
The key
The key to staying liquid is to stave off evaporation , which occurs when the molecules in a liquid are excited to a state where they bump into each other until they break the liquid 's surface and turn into gas .
The best way to do prevent evaporation is to keep the molecules from becoming excited , and the best way to do this is to cool the liquid .
For example , a cup of water placed outside in the middle of summer will evaporate much quicker than the same water on a mid-winter day .
" Colder temperatures are what suppress evaporation , " Chittenden said .
" There 's a huge decrease in the evaporation rate the colder it gets . "
If liquid water is discovered , there is a good chance it may not sit right at the surface .
NASA 's Mars rover Opportunity discovered signs that salty liquid once existed only after digging a small trench in the Martian soil .
So , having completed this series of direct atmosphere contact experiments , Chittenden and her colleagues have begun investigating whether ice melts to liquid or jumps straight to gas when placed beneath a layer of simulated Mars soil in the planetary environmental chamber .
This research is detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
" Inherent Authority " to Violate Federal Law ?
Marty Lederman
A thoughtful interlocutor ( " T. More " ) gently inquired , in a comment to a previous post , whether my posts on the NSA matter would n't be more effective , more persuasive , if I stopped bolding and emphasizing the adjectives " criminal " and " felonious " -- a tactic that , he rightly chided , might make my posts appear too intemperate , especially in light of the fact that previous Presidents have " presumed the [ article II ] power to eavesdrop on our enemies , and that even Carter and Clinton authorized warrantless wiretaps . "
His comment alerted me to the fact that I have not been clear about the reason for my emphasis on the lawbreaking nature of the conduct here .
I 've bolded adjectives such as " criminal " not because I 'm trying to get folks to think that the President should be locked up , or impeached , nor to precipitate a criminal investigation ( and certainly not , T. More , to suggest that those who disagree with me are criminal or mendatious ! ) .
Instead , I 've been emphasizing those words in order to signal the radical nature of the constitutional power that this Administration is asserting : the presidential power ( under article II ) to act in violation of federal criminal statutes ( the Torture Act , the UCMJ , the War Crimes Act , FISA , etc. ) if such statutes impinge in any way on the President 's judgment about how best to execute the war on terrorism .
That assertion of a sweeping constitutional power to ignore any duly enacted laws that impinge on what the President could otherwise do in war is , I think , virtually unprecedented in U.S. history .
Over the past 48 hours , we 've heard defenders of the President increasingly focus on the argument that the President has " inherent " authority to engage in warrantless sureveillance of the enemy .
It 's important here to heed Justice Jackson 's warning in the Youngstown steel seizure case that " [ l ] oose and irresponsible use of adjectives colors all non-legal and much legal discussion of presidential powers , " and that terms such as " ' [ i ] nherent ' powers , ' implied ' powers , ' incidental ' powers , ' plenary ' powers , ' war ' powers and ' emergency ' powers " are often bandied about in such discussions " without fixed or ascertainable meanings . "
Just to be clear , then :
The Administration is claiming not simply that the President has some " inherent " authority to surveille the enemy in times of war -- a proposition that is undoubtedly correct -- but instead the much broader , more audacious claim that the President has an unregulable authority , such that he may ignore FISA 's constraints .
That is to say , their claim is that FISA itself is unconstitutional .
A lot of folks are making a category error here -- a Youngstown category error , that is -- with respect to the nature of " inherent " presidental powers .
Over at Powerline , for instance , John Hinderaker argues that " Congress can neither add to , nor detract from , the constitutional powers of the executive branch . "
This is simply flat - out wrong -- a fundamnetal misunderstanding of foreign affairs and war powers under the Constitution .
These are the most important -- and truest -- words in all of Justice Jackson 's concurrence :
The actual art of governing under our Constitution does not and cannot conform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles torn from context .
While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty , it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government .
It enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence , autonomy but reciprocity .
Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate , depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress .
It is true , as T .
More writes , that previous Presidents have " presumed the [ article II ] power to eavesdrop on our enemies , and that even Carter and Clinton authorized warrantless wiretaps " ( although my understanding is that the Clinton example folks are citing was not a wiretap but a physical search ) .
I doubt that any President has asserted the right to engage in a dragnet as intrusive on U.S. person conversations as this appears to be -- or as tenuously tied to the enemy as this apparently is -- but , be that as it may , I do n't disagree about the history .
Indeed , I do not deny that the President has the power as Commander - in - Chief to engage in at least some forms of warrantless surveillance against the enemy in the absence of statutory prohibition .
That would be a Youngstown " Category II " case , and the conduct would probably be constitutional to the extent it did not violate the Fourth Amendment .
Thus , if we were still back in the mid-1970s , before the FISA prohibition in question had been enacted , I would not be complaining too much here about the President 's constitutional authority to authorize the surveillance ( except perhaps on Fourth Amendment grounds ) .
Indeed , from 1968 to 1978 , a statute was on the books that specified that the then - existing federal wiretapping law was not intended to in any way limit the constitutional power of the President : " Nothing contained in this chapter or in section 605 of the Communications
Act of 1934 shall limit the constitutional power of the President to take such measures as he deems necessary to protect the Nation against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of a foreign power , to obtain foreign intelligence information deemed essential to the security of the United States , or to protect national security information against foreign intelligence activities . "
During that period , some ( if not all ) of the warrantless surveillance here may have been within the President 's constitutional power .
( I may slightly disagree with the superlative post of my esteemed co-blogger Stephen Griffin on this point :
Although the President may not have " inherent " authority to engage in all of the surveillance that FISA regulates ( if it intrudes too much into the domestic setting , for instance ) , he certainly has some constitutional authority to spy on the enemy , even where the enemy is speaking to U.S. persons -- as long as there are not statutes regulating such surveillance ! ) .
But the critical point for present purposes is that , as Prof .
Griffin emphasizes , the Nation had exactly this debate in the mid-70s -- after gross abuses in connection with such warrantless surveillance -- and the legislature and Executive agreed to enact FISA , a statute regulating such warrantless surveillance .
Moreover , FISA specifically repealed that prior provision of law preserving virtually unbounded Executive discretion .
That puts us in Youngstown Category III , where the President 's constitutional authority to act -- even if he had it in the first place -- is at its " lowest ebb . "
( The Youngstown " categories " and quotations are from Jackson 's concurrence , which " brings together as much combination of analysis and common sense as there is in this area . "
Dames & Moore , 453 U.S. at 661 .
For much , much more on Youngstown and the Administration 's assertion of Executive authority , I 'd urge you to please read Jack 's extremely helpful post here . )
As far as I 'm aware , Presidents Carter and Clinton did not authorize any surveillance that would violate any duly enacted law .
This Administration , by contrast , sees statutes as mere parchment barriers .
Their argument -- just to be clear -- is that FISA , and the Torture Act , and the Uniform Code of Military Justice , and the federal assault statute , and the War Crimes Act , and the 60 - day - limit provision of the War Powers Resolution -- and even the 9/18 AUMF itself ( to the extent it is read , as it ought to be , as in some respects limiting the scope of force -- and treaties governing the treatment of detainees , and ( probably ) the Posse Comitatus Act , and who knows how many other laws , are unconstitutional to the extent they limit the President 's discretion in this war .
In OLC 's words -- written just one week after the AUMF was enacted -- neither the WPR nor the AUMF , nor , presumably , any other statute , " can place any limits on the President 's determinations as to any terrorist threat , the amount of military force to be used in response , or the method , timing , and nature of the response . "
" These decisions , " OLC wrote , " under our Constitution , are for the President alone to make . "
Think about that .
Such a sweeping claim of presidential power to ignore all statutes regulating his behavior in warime is radical and profoundly troubling -- and , as far as I know , virtually unprecedented .
( I welcome other examples of such an extreme assertion . )
And that is what this crisis -- from the torture memo to the FISA violations , and much else in between -- is about .
That is to say :
It 's not about warrantless surveillance ( or not only about such surveillance , anyway ) ; it 's about this Administration 's assertions that Congress has no role to play in the war on terror ; that " mere " statutes cannot limit the President 's discretion ; that FISA and the Torture Act , and the War Crimes Act , etc. , are unconstitutional ; and that the President can ( and does ) violate such statutes if they stand in his way .
P.S. The Administration 's defenders are citing a 2002 dictum by the FISA Court of Review : " We take for granted that the President does have that authority [ to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information ] and , assuming that is so , FISA could not encroach on the President ’s constitutional power . "
In re Sealed Case , 310 F.3d 717 , 742 ( FIS Ct. Rev. 2002 ) ( emphasis added ) .
That throwaway line -- not germane to the holding in that case -- was almost certainly written by Judge Laurence Silberman , who ( I am told ) testified in his personal capacity to the same effect in the mid-1970's , when FISA was being considered .
The dictum is , in my view , dead wrong , not because the President does n't have the authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information -- in the absence of statutory restriciton , he probably does -- but because even if he does , FISA can and does " encroach " on ( i.e. , modestly regulate ) that authority .
More to the point , however , Congress and the President rejected Silberman 's unorthodox constitutional view when they enacted FISA , and the FISA system has worked for almost three decades on the assumption -- shared , as far as I am aware , by all three branches , without any dissent until Silberman 's stray dictum -- that its modest constraints are not unconstitutional usurpations of presidential authority .
If Silberman and the Bush Administration are correct , then there 's no need for FISA at all -- nor for the FISA Court .
The President may simply proceed with surveillance on his own iniitiative , if he thinks it will help in the war on terrorism .
As one FISA judge said to the Washington Post , " members could suggest disbanding the court in light of the president 's suggestion that he has the power to bypass the court . "
[ UPDATE : Well , just goes to show you never know :
It appears the Administration is running ( at least for now ) only with the argument that the AUMF authorized exceptions to the FISA regime , and not that FISA is unconstitutional under Article II : See the DOJ Letter here . ]

Java and Tiger Woods
For years I have wished that Sun would make Java truly Open Source .
Two days ago , Sun 's executives publicly committed to make it happen .
Now I have to figure out why I do n't care .
Actually , I do care .
In fact , I 'm angry .
Java had so much potential , and most of its opportunities are lost .
Java today is like what Tiger Woods would have been if his Dad had made him live at home until he was forty .
At the age of 3 , Tiger Woods played nine holes of golf and shot a 48 .
His father saw the potential and dedicated himself to helping his son become all that he could be .
In the early years , this meant strict control .
Later , the father 's primary role was to simply never be obstacle in his son's path .
Am I being outrageous by comparing Java to Tiger Woods ?
Sure .
Everybody knows that parents who want their kids to realize their full potential need to let them go .
But Java is not a child ; it 's an intellectual property asset .
Like I said , I 'm angry -- do n't expect me to be entirely rational about this . :-)
But even if my illustration is absurd , I want to finish it : Earl Woods ( who sadly lost his battle with cancer just a few weeks ago ) will primarily be remembered as the man who allowed his son to reach his full potential and become the best golfer in the world .
In contrast , Sun will primarily be remembered as the company who created Java and then impeded its success by retaining strict control over it .
So on Tuesday Jonathan Schwartz and Rich Green promised that sometime soon , their 40 - year old daughter Java will be allowed to quit her job in the family business and begin a pro golfing career .
Frankly , it 's a little late for that .
Please do n't put labels on me .
I 'm not an open source zealot .
I 'm not a .NET zealot .
I 'm not a Java zealot .
I 'm just angry .
I do n't understand why Sun could n't make this decision seven years ago when it might have made a difference .
Is it really too late ?
Perhaps not , but the remarks by Schwartz and Green this week indicate that these guys still do n't really " get it " .
They showed up at JavaOne to announce their intentions , but they had no details of how it 's going to happen .
Why not ?
Reading between the lines , their attitude suggests that the reason they do n't have a plan yet is that they are still trying to figure out how they can make Java Open Source while continuing to remain in complete control over it .
Yeah -- good luck with that .
If Java is going to realize at least some of its potential , Sun will need to get really serious about letting Java go .
That means facing what appear to be their two primary fears :
If we make Java truly Open Source , will it benefit Sun as a company ?
If we make Java truly Open Source , wo n't that encourage people to fork ?
Seven years ago , the answers were :
Yes .
It will benefit Sun , but not directly .
Releasing Java as Open Source will change the industry .
Finding ways to profit from that change is a separate step that Sun needs to figure out .
If you do it right , then dozens of vendors will have a common foundation upon which they can unify against Microsoft .
Sun can be one of the leaders , along with companies like IBM , Motorola , and Apple .
Probably not .
People do n't fork projects when the primary maintainer is doing a good job .
Today , the answers are completely different :
No .
It wo n't benefit Sun .
You already screwed it up so badly that it no longer matters what you do .
Your company is just waiting to die , and unlike the situation with Earl Woods , most people will be struggling to find anything nice to say at its funeral .
Definitely .
If you Open Source Java on a Monday , a community fork will be the most active project on SourceForge by the end of the week .
Dozens or hundreds of people will be granted commit access .
None of them will be Sun employees .
Oh , wait -- that 's the anger talking . :-)
Let me try again :
Maybe .
This is n't the high - percentage play that it would have been seven years ago , but there is still a chance that you can catalyze some major change .
If that happens , and if you swallow your pride , you can probably find a way to be a leader .
Probably , but maybe not .
The way to prevent a fork is to take away the motivation to fork .
If you show the Open Source community that you " get it " , you will have countless allies and fans in your community instead of countless developers trying to repress all memory of you as they fix your bugs .
I confess that I gave up on Java years ago .
I 'm a C# developer now , but I do n't get religious about platforms .
If it 's not too late , I would still love to see Java realize its incredible potential .
If that 's going to happen , I see only one possibility : Crazy as it may sound , Sun needs to stop thinking of itself as Java 's owner and start thinking of itself as Java 's proud parent .
Sun , your child was born to change the world , and the only thing preventing that from happening is you .
Tuesday night , a Girls Gone Wild tour bus collided with a bicyclist in Iowa City , Iowa , landing the cyclist in the hospital .
According to a fire department report obtained by TMZ , the accident happened just after 8 p.m.
Firefighters arrived to find a male bicylist trapped beneath the tour bus , where he remained for 20 minutes before high - pressure air bags could be used to lift the vehicle and get him out .

The existence of such students — eager , yet at high risk for failure — exposes a split in education policy .
On one hand , believers in the standards movement frown on social promotion and emphasize measurable performance in high school .
At the same time , because a college degree is widely considered essential to later success , some educators say even students who could not complete high school should be allowed to attend college .
Nowhere is this contradiction more evident than in California .
This year , 47,000 high school seniors , about 10 percent of the class , have not passed the exit examinations required to graduate from high school .
They can still enroll in many colleges , although they are no longer eligible for state tuition grants .
State Senator Deborah Ortiz , Democrat of Sacramento , has proposed legislation to change that .
" As long as the opportunity to go to college exists for students without a diploma , " Ms. Ortiz said , " qualifying students from poor or low - income families should remain entitled to college financial aid . "
Many community colleges and two - year commercial colleges take these students , as do some less selective four - year colleges .
At Interboro Institute , a large commercial college in Manhattan , 94 percent of the students last year did not have a high school diploma .
Yet most received federal and state financial aid , up to $ 9,000 a student for the neediest .
At the College of New Rochelle , a four - year Catholic women 's college whose main campus is in Westchester County , N.Y. , students without high school degrees account for one - third of the students entering its School of New Resources , for those 21 or older , which has 4,500 students .
At Interboro , the state recently found cheating by employees on the exam students have to pass to qualify for state and financial aid .
The college , part of EVCI Career Colleges Holding , said the problems were not pervasive .

So , I ’ve had some more time to play with the latest build of Firefox , and I liked it so much that I could n’t use the 1.5 version anymore .
And this left me with a problem : hardly any of my extensions were compatible with the latest and greatest Firefox version .
I ’ve made a bit of a research out of it , and here we are : I present you with the 3 ways to make extensions compatible with Firefox 2.0 .
Firefox Books
If you like Firefox , you will find the following books extremely useful :
First though , I ’d like to give you a few warnings :
not 100 % of your extensions will work , some of the older ones would really be incompatible .
But if you had Firefox 1.5 , than I doubt you ’ll have any problems .
if you update any of the “ made compatible ” extensions using the automatic update function of Firefox , you may easily end up with an incompatible version again .
This means you ’ll probably have to make it compatible once more .
That said , I hope you will find useful at least one of the following ways to make old extensions Firefox 2.0 compatible .
I ’ve also given you the main advantage and disadvantage of using each of the methods .
1 ) Making Extensions Compatible – THE EASY WAY
All you have to do is to go and download a wonderful Nightly Tester Tools extension .
Not only it is compatible with your newest Firefox version , but it will also add a button to your Extensions manager ( Tools - > Add-ons ) :
Just click this button and restart your browser .
Please note that this is a screenshot taken AFTER making all the xtensions compatible – so as you can see they ’re all active already .
The advantage of this way is that it ’s really easy to make all your extensions compatible with any Firefox until Firefox 3.0 ( that ’s what this extension puts as the MaxVersion for each of the extensions it fixes )
The disadvantage is that there is no equally easy way to revert the changes , so once “ made compatible ” , your extensions will stay this way – there is no button to make them uncompatible again .
However , disabling the extension seems to restore the versions .
2 ) Making Extensions Compatible – THE FIREFOX GURU WAY
What you can do is open the configuration ( about : config ) in your Firefox browser , right click the list and create a boolean extensions .
checkCompatibility option there .
Set its value to false and restart the browser .
Most of your extensions should work now .
If you go to the Add - ons dialog , it will look like this :
As you can see , extensions which would otherwise be incompatible , are flagged with the exclamation mark .
You can also see a warning message which suggest you enable the compatibility check again .
The advantage of this approach is that it ’s really simple to make the change which affects all the extensions .
The disadvantage is that this way can be used as a temporary solution only , as it may lead to unpredictable consequences ( some really old or really new extensions may malfunction ) .
3 ) Making Extensions Compatible – THE HARD WAY
This is essentially a manual way of accomplishing the result of using the Nightly Tester Tools extension .
The advantage of this way is in total control over which extensions you ’ll hack to become compatible .
The disadvantage is in the fact that every step of this method is rather hard : distinguishing extensions to make sure you ’re changing the one you really want , and
manually changing the versions supported .
Close your browser
Go to the folder with all your Firefox extensions :
C: \Documents and Settings \USER \Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox \Profiles \PROFILE\extensions
In this line , USER is to be replaced with your Windows login , and PROFILE will be the name of your Firefox profile ( weird looking folder name , usually the only one found in Profiles folder )
You ’ll see a list of folders there , 1 folder for each extension .
The names of the folders are the unique identifiers for extensions , so they may seem scary at first :
{ 34274bf4-1d97-a289-e984-17e546307e4f} – this is the Adblock extension GUID .
Go to any folder , and open the install.rdf file for editing with your favorite clear text editor .
Notepad works , but using it will make things even harder cause it does n’t part rdf files properly .
Your choice :)
Now back to the business .
You need to look for 2 things : name of the extension , to make sure you ’re editing the right one Just look for the em:name , and try to recognize the extension from the description that follows :
<!– Front End MetaData –>
< em:name > Adblock </em:name >
< em:description > Filters ads from web - pages < / em:description >
< em:creator > The Adblock Crew </ em:creator >
< em:contributor > Henrik Aasted Sorensen </em:contributor >
Just look for the , and try to recognize the extension from the description that follows : a block of minimal and maximum Firefox versions the extension will work on .
Warning : there could be few similar blocks with versions , so make sure you ’ll edit the one which has EXACTLY this em:id , the one which belongs to Firefox browser : ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384 . <! – FireFox –>
< em:targetApplication >
< Description >
< em:id>{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}</em:id >
< em:minVersion >0.7</em:minVersion >
<em:maxVersion >1.5</em:maxVersion >
</ Description >
</em:targetApplication >
Edit the maxVersion parameter ( shown in bold to make it easier ) , and change it from 1.5 to 2.0b2 .
Remove the extensions .
cache file from the C : \Documents and Settings \USER \Application Data\Mozilla \Firefox \Profiles \PROFILE \ folder – this will make sure Firefox will read all the changes from install.rdf files and pick up the now “ compatible ” extension Restart your browser , enable the previously disabled extension you ’ve just edited Restart your browser again to activate this extension
There you have it .
Enjoy !

Israeli officials say vigilance prevented a higher casualty toll
Two guards were seriously injured in the morning rush hour blast .
It was the first such attack since Israel pulled its settlers out of the Gaza Strip .
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , condemning the attack , described it as a " terrorist operation " .
But he also described a recent Israeli raid in the West Bank in which five Palestinians died as a " provocation " .
The Islamic Jihad group had sworn to take revenge for the deaths .
Israel warns Palestinians
A bus driver told Israel Radio that the suicide bomber was carrying a heavy bag , prompting him to alert a security guard .
Before he could get on the bus he was stopped , and he blew himself up nearby , according to police .
A paramedic covered the dead bomber 's head with a bag
The two security guards who were critically wounded suffered shrapnel wounds and burns all over their bodies , a paramedic told Israel 's Channel 10 TV .
The bomber 's remains were scattered at the scene .
The last serious bomb attack in Israel was in the coastal city of Netanya on 12 July , when five people were killed .
Beersheba was hit almost a year ago , when twin bus blasts in the city killed 16 people .
Those attacks were claimed by Palestinian Hamas militants .
Speaking after Sunday 's blast , a spokesman for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said " Israel has taken the necessary steps to further the prospects of peace with the Palestinians . "
The bombing , said spokesman David Baker , " is another indication that the Palestinian Authority must take proper steps against terror , and without these steps , there will be no progress between both sides " .
Mr Abbas said in a statement that it was vital everyone remain committed to the truce , " despite all the Israeli provocations , most recently the killing of five Palestinians in Tulkarem , among them three children " .
Israel says the five men killed in the West Bank raid were militants wanted in connection with suicide bombings .
' Fire with fire '
Hamas has said attacks on Israel must continue , despite the withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip .
Mr Sharon told Israelis at the time that while the withdrawal was a risky manoeuvre , it was the best way to ensure security in the longer term .
But he also gave stark warnings on how Israel would respond if it appeared that the Palestinians were failing to crack down on extremist groups .
" To an outstretched hand we shall respond with an olive branch , " he said , " but we shall fight fire with the harshest fire ever . "
Israeli forces have been astonished at the discovery of networks of bunkers and computerised weapons in Hizbullah positions , according to officials .
Troops have found air - conditioned bunkers 40 metres ( 125 ft ) below the ground and anti-tank weapons that originate in France , the US and Russia in southern Lebanon .
Many of the tactics and weapons employed by Hizbullah have neutralised Israel 's military superiority and made a complete victory difficult to achieve .
Hizbullah 's use of rockets to attack Israel was not unexpected but the Israeli armed forces have been repeatedly surprised since they went on the offensive a month ago .
The first major shock was when Hizbullah narrowly missed sinking an Israeli destroyer with a Chinese shore - to - sea missile .
Four were killed in the attack .
" There were some weapons we did not know about , " said General Ido Nehushtan .
" There were others such as the unmanned aerial vehicles which we had detected before . "
The revelations have increased since Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon .
" The main threat is the use of sophisticated anti-tank weapons against our armoured vehicles .
One of the most effective is the Kornet which was supplied by Russia to Iran and then to Hizbullah , " said Lieutenant Colonel Olivier Rafowicz .
" We have been very surprised by the quantity of weapons and the building that has been carried out in the last six years .
We knew they were preparing for war but we did not realise to what extent . "
Soldiers have discovered bunkers with listening and observation devices working in tandem with computers .
The bunkers meant that Hizbullah fighters could shelter from Israeli air and artillery bombardment and then surprise advancing Israeli forces .
Often the bunkers were so well hidden that fighters could wait until the soldiers had passed and then attack them from behind .
Israel has so far lost more than 80 soldiers in combat .
Its highly mobile armour and air support is less effective against guerilla fighters , and its armour has been neutralised by Hizbullah 's acquisition of state of the art weapons .
Hizbullah 's older anti-tank weapons have been effective against armoured personnel carriers and buildings used by soldiers for shelters .
Its newer weapons such as the Russian Kornet and US TOW missiles have been highly effective succeeded in piercing the armour of Israel 's main battle tank , the Merkava , reputedly one of the best - defended tanks in the world .
One member of an Israeli tank crew who had just left Lebanon told the Guardian : " It 's terrible .
You do not fight anti-tank teams with tanks .
You use infantry supported by artillery and helicopters .
Wide valleys without shelter are the wrong place to use tanks . "
Although he said Hizbullah 's weapons had been supplied by Iran , Lt Col Rafowicz admitted the militants ' prowess also stemmed from its morale and organisation .
They are very keen to engage our forces .
They are not wearing suicide bomb belts but they are not afraid to die , which makes deterrence very difficult . "
Gen Nehushtan said : " We have to recognise that we will be dealing with new definitions of victory .
There will be no white flags being raised on this battlefield , " he said .
Maybe I should call this article “ why I should stop reading Upside Magazine ” .
I really have been trying to stop , but they send it to me for free , and I really needed bathroom reading material , so I grabbed it and found one of the most wrong - headed articles I ’ve seen in a long time .
Well , actually , there are wrong - headed articles all over Upside magazine , but this one was particularly irksome .
It ’s an article by Stephen James called “ Lessons in Survival ” .
( March 2000 Upside ) .
Every month , I ’m told , Mr James will share with us “ some of the simple lessons [ he ’s ] learned from [ his ] own startups ” .
It includes lots of extremely useful advise that you would never figure out on your own , like , do n’t spend a lot of money on office space and try to find a neighborhood where you do n’t have to stand in line at the local restaurants .
If you are starting a dot com , Mr James reminds us , “ Get out of the house …
Working at home sucks . ”
And he points out that you should never pay more than $ 1.50 per square foot .
Thanks , Mr James !
It ’s extremely strange to me that you could expect the same price in every market .
Maybe he just assumes that everyone in the world starts all companies in Silicon Valley .
“ Forget the free coffee and drinks .
Sure they ’re free at Microsoft … who wants to be like Microsoft ? ”
Hello ?
Is this a joke ?
Did Upside schedule their April issue for May ?
I guess Mr James lives in a funny la-la world where there are millions of programmers just dying to work at your startup .
When you are the founder of a company , you want to skimp on frills ; they seem like a waste of money to you .
That ’s fine .
But do n’t think that candidates interviewing at your company will have the same emotional attachment ; they wo n’t .
They are looking for a nice place to work .
Skimping on free soft drinks , a completely standard benefit at most high tech companies , is a great way to send your employees and potential employees the message that you just do n’t care about being an attractive workplace .
Everybody in Silicon Valley seems to be talking about Charlie , the gourmet cook at Google who used to work for Jerry Garcia .
I can tell you , the food is spectacular even by Michelin standards , not just corporate cafeteria standards .
Because the food in the company cafeteria is so good , people do n’t leave work to eat .
They eat with their colleagues , which increases learning and communication .
They get back to work within half an hour , making them more productive .
They feel like Google cares about them , making them more loyal .
Meanwhile , “ Build - outs are a bad idea , ” Stephen James tells us .
“ Do n’t build out your space with walls or partitions — leave it open …
If employees need an office with a door , let them go to law school or Apple . ”
Guess what ?
They will go to Apple !
And replacing just one of them will cost on the order of $ 50,000 in recruiting and training .
A friend of mine provides gorgeous private office space for his programmers in the most expensive real estate district in the USA , Manhattan , and it ’s probably costing about $ 6,000 per person per year .
Not much in the scheme of things .
What ’s worse , Mr James seems to be completely ignorant of the documented productivity gains provided by giving knowledge workers space , quiet , and privacy .
The classic software management book Peopleware documents these productivity benefits extensively .
( To be fair , Mr James is not alone in his cluelessness .
He ’s just reflecting the folk wisdom prevalent in the Valley ) .
Here ’s the trouble .
We all know that knowledge workers work best by getting into “ flow ” , also known as being “ in the zone ” , where they are fully concentrated on their work and fully tuned out of their environment .
They lose track of time and produce great stuff through absolute concentration .
This is when they get all of their productive work done .
Writers , programmers , scientists , and even basketball players will tell you about being in the zone .
The trouble is , getting into “ the zone ” is not easy .
When you try to measure it , it looks like it takes an average of 15 minutes to start working at maximum productivity .
Sometimes , if you ’re tired or have already done a lot of creative work that day , you just ca n’t get into the zone and you spend the rest of your work day fiddling around , reading the web , playing Tetris .
The other trouble is that it ’s so easy to get knocked out of the zone .
Noise , phone calls , going out for lunch , having to drive 5 minutes to Starbucks for coffee , and interruptions by coworkers — ESPECIALLY interruptions by coworkers — all knock you out of the zone .
If you take a 1 minute interruption by a coworker asking you a question , and this knocks out your concentration enough that it takes you half an hour to get productive again , your overall productivity is in serious trouble .
If you ’re in a noisy bullpen environment like the type that caffinated dotcoms love to create , with marketing guys screaming on the phone next to programmers , your productivity will plunge as knowledge workers get interrupted time after time and never get into the zone .
With programmers , it ’s especially hard .
Productivity depends on being able to juggle a lot of little details in short term memory all at once .
Any kind of interruption can cause these details to come crashing down .
When you resume work , you ca n’t remember any of the details ( like local variable names you were using , or where you were up to in implementing that search algorithm ) and you have to keep looking these things up , which slows you down a lot until you get back up to speed .
Here ’s the simple algebra .
Let ’s say ( as the evidence seems to suggest ) that if we interrupt a programmer , even for a minute , we ’re really blowing away 15 minutes of productivity .
For this example , lets put two programmers , Jeff and Mutt , in open cubicles next to each other in a standard Dilbert veal - fattening farm .
Mutt ca n’t remember the name of the Unicode version of the strcpy function .
He could look it up , which takes 30 seconds , or he could ask Jeff , which takes 15 seconds .
Since he ’s sitting right next to Jeff , he asks Jeff .
Jeff gets distracted and loses 15 minutes of productivity ( to save Mutt 15 seconds ) .
Now let ’s move them into separate offices with walls and doors .
Now when Mutt ca n’t remember the name of that function , he could look it up , which still takes 30 seconds , or he could ask Jeff , which now takes 45 seconds and involves standing up ( not an easy task given the average physical fitness of programmers ! ) .
So he looks it up .
So now Mutt loses 30 seconds of productivity , but we save 15 minutes for Jeff .
Anyway , I fully expect that most of you , reading this , will write to say , “ what the heck are you doing reading Upside anyway ?
You get what you deserve ” .
How true .
Serves me right .
Linda
Walker says she hates what has happened to her
Watch the interview
Linda
Walker awoke in hospital to find her distinctive Newcastle accent had been transformed into a mixture of Jamaican , Canadian and Slovakian .
The 60 - year - old may have Foreign Accent Syndrome , where patients speak differently after a brain injury .
The former university administrator says she hates what has happened to her and now feels like a different person .
Mrs Walker said : " My sister - in - law said that I sounded Italian , then my brother said I sounded Slovakian and someone else said I sounded French Canadian .
" But the latest is that I sound Jamaican , I just do n't know how to explain it .
" Everybody is obviously hearing me differently .
I 've lost my identity , because I never talked like this before .
I 'm a very different person and it's strange and I do n't like it
Linda Walker
" I did n't realise what I sounded like , but then my speech therapist played a tape of me talking .
I was just devastated . "
Researchers at Oxford University have found that patients with Foreign Accent Syndrome have suffered damage to tiny areas of the brain that affect speech .
The result is often a drawing out or clipping of the vowels that mimic the accent of a particular country , such as Spain or France , even though the sufferer has limited exposure to that accent .
The syndrome was first identified during World War II , when a Norwegian woman suffered shrapnel damage to her brain .
She developed a strong German accent , which led to her being ostracised by her community .
Different sounds
Dr Nick Miller , a senior lecturer in speech language science at Newcastle University , said the condition could occur in patients who had suffered a stroke or other brain injury .
He said : " The stroke has affected the coordination between different muscle groups like the lips , tongue and vocal cords .
" The balance has been changed and certain sounds get distorted so vowels and consonants take on different sounds .
" Intonation is also affected so sometimes it will fall at the end of a sentence and sometimes it will rise . "
Mrs Walker added : " I 've lost my identity , because I never talked like this before .
I 'm a very different person and it's strange and I do n't like it .
" It 's very hard and I get very upset in my head , but I 'm getting better . "
Welcome
Welcome to the official OfficeGuns website .
Use the menu on the left to navigate .
Check out the new Ruler of the office and the Cluster Maul .
Do also check out the pictures some of our visitors has sent us .
It started in a meeting .
We were playing bullshit bingo , and on the third round I thought to myself : " Oh my God !
Ca n't someone just shoot that bastard ? "
I was getting tired of bullshit bingo and was fingering with some office supplies .
As a sworn Lego - fan , I always try to connect things together .
I was connecting two Maulies , then suddenly one of them flew across the room and hit the boring speaker right on the nose .
He got a nose - bleed and had to stop the presentation early .
Later that week , people came in to thank me .
Some even brought chocolate .
But most of them wanted to know where I had bought that fabulous gun .
I showed them how it was made .
They were thrilled and from that day on , we have n't had a single boring presentation .
Someone said to me that I could patent the use of the Maulies and sell the ideas .
But I told him : " There is enough greed in the world .
I want to help people .
I want their life to be a better life .
I want them to have what I have .
A whole range of guns .
Made from office supplies . "
Testimonies
" Before , I spent most of my salary at thinkgeek.com on toy weapons for the office .
A net - friend told me about OfficeGuns .
Now I can build my own for free and use the money on this nifty green laser . "

" I used to get all the boring assignments at the office .
Now my boss does not dare and gives them to Brian .
Thank you OfficeGuns ! "
- Stan , Builth , Wales
" Life at work was peachy .
Stan got all the boring assignments and I could surf all day .
Now the boss comes to me with these assignments .
But times are changing .
I 've found OfficeGuns "
- Brian , Builth , Wales
" Life as a supervisor used to be quite simple .
I could delegate boring assignments to my two clueless assistants : Brian and Stan .
Now they have found OfficeGuns .
I do not dare approach them with boring assignments anymore .
I have to do them myself .
Thanks alot ! >:-( "
- Reg , Builth , Wales
" My husband Bubba used to come home from work all pissed off .
He did not get the same respect at the office as he gets at home from me and our 5 children .
But now , thanks to OfficeGuns , he can get the respect both at the office and at home .
Thanks OfficeGuns ! "
- Becky , Lubbock , Texas , USA
" I used to make guns from office accessories myself , but after a few accidents and some not - really - needed limbs later I 've turned to OfficeGuns for the safe and tested stuff . "
- Wilhelm , Peiss , Germany
Note :
We never said these guns were safe !
But they are tested .
" I used to be fat and without friends at the office .
In meetings , I was afraid to come forward with my opinions .
Then a friend told me about OfficeGuns .
Now when I sit in meetings and disagree , I just shoot the bastard .
I 've lost weight thanks to higher confidence and now Brady is the fat friendless one .
Thank you OfficeGuns "

Holy shit I ’ve forgotten how to use Gimp and Inkscape it ’s been so long .
In fact , I still remember how to use them but they ’ve changed so much !
Luckily , they have so many awesome new features this strip took half the time to make – which brings the average down to a sweet 3.5 months or so .
And GIMP now supports CMYK !!
– expect ELER in printed book form by next Xmas !
Assuming analogue books will still be available then .
And that we have enough oil left to transport them around .
The hiatus was due to upstream .
Though normal programming may or may not resume shortly .
Promises will not be made , guarantees surely broken , hope sold on ebay .
Craigslist posters robbed at gunpoint in Walnut Creek
2006-07-17 04:36:00 PDT
WALNUT CREEK --
An advertisement on the Craigslist.org Web site led to an armed robbery in a Walnut Creek Target store parking lot Sunday night , Lt. Mark Covington of the Walnut Creek Police Department reported .
According to Covington , the victims , who were from the Livermore - Pleasanton area , posted some hooded jackets for sale on the Web site .
They arranged to meet with the suspects to sell the jackets at the Walnut Creek Target store at 1871 N. Main St .
At about 8:20 p.m. the two suspects , both Asian males about 16 to 19 years old , arrived in the parking lot in a black Lexus .
One of the suspects then pulled a silver handgun and pointed it at one of the victims , reportedly saying " This is how we 're going to do this . "
As the suspects made off with 11 jackets , they flashed a gang sign and said , " This is West Pittsburg , " according to Covington .
The suspects left in the Lexus and were last seen driving out of the south driveway of the Target store , Covington said .
The first suspect , who was the driver , was described as 5 feet 6 inches tall , 130 pounds , and was wearing a white T - shirt , blue jeans and a gold " grill . "
The second suspect was described as 5 feet 8 inches tall , 145 to 150 pounds , and was wearing a white ball cap with the word " Vietnamese " on it and a white T - shirt .
He carried a silver semi-automatic handgun with brown grips .
The suspects ' vehicle was described as a black Lexus four - door with paper plates .
No injuries were reported .
The investigation is ongoing and police have not yet located the suspects , Covington said .
Anyone with information is asked to call the Walnut Creek Police Department at ( 925 ) 943-5844 .
In an apparently unrelated incident approximately three weeks ago , San Jose police reported a series of armed robberies by a suspect posing as a seller or buyer on the Craigslist.org Web site .
That suspect was described a black man between the ages of 18 and 25 , standing 5 feet 9 inches to 6 feet tall , weighing between 140 to 160 pounds with a " thin but muscular build . "
Apple blames iPod nano screen defects on obese Americans / tight pants Posted by Dr. Macenstein on Wednesday , September 28 , 2005 · 128 Comments
Apple today officially acknowledged that a small number of iPod nano owners have reported problems with the hot - selling music player .
Customers are reporting instances where after removing the iPod nano from their front pockets ( much as Steve Jobs did during the iPod nano ’s famous unveiling ) finding that the nano ’s LCD screen is cracked , and in some instances , no longer works at all .
Apple ’s SVP of Marketing Phil Schiller said today in a press release “ … this issue has affected less than 1/10 of 1 percent of the total iPod nano units that we ’ve shipped .
It is not a design issue .
It has more to do with obese Americans in tight pants putting the nano in their front jeans pocket , and then sitting for extended periods of time . ”
Blaming the nano ’s screen issues on fat people is not the first time Apple has come under fire for attacking its super - sized customers .
In 1998 the American Obesity Association filed a complaint against Apple charging the company ’s hot - selling iMac computer shipped with a miniature keyboard and mouse that could not accommodate the enlarged fingers of obese Americans .
In the complaint , the AOA alleges the keyboard made correct spelling all but impossible for large fingers that would sometimes accidentally press up to 3 keys at a time .
The “ hockey puck ” mouse that shipped with the unit was also criticized for not being able to support the increased weight of a 7 pound hand .
During extended use the track ball would often become oval - shaped , causing the mouse to stop functioning corectly .
The AOA ’s Gabrielle Vargas says Apple computers have always been a favorite of husky Americans , due in large part to Apple ’s insistance on using the 1 - button mouse .
The 1 button mouse is perfectly designed for fat fingers which often find multi-button mice unwieldy .
Apple has also designed its operating systems to be navigated with a single - click mouse , eliminating the need for right - clicking .
“ It is this loyalty from our members ” says Vargas , “ that has helped Apple capture over 3 % of the personal computer market .
For Apple to now blame manufacturing defects in its newest iPod on ‘ fat people wearing tight pants ’ is just plain wrong . ”
According to the AOA , Approximately 127 million adults in the U.S. are overweight , 60 million obese , and 9 million severely obese .
If Apple worked harder to actively cater ( no pun intended ) to the obese , it could mean a huge ( no pun intended ) increase in market share .
Apple , for its part , seems to realize this .
It has offered to replace the “ defective ” nanos .
However , they are insisting that all customers weighing over 230 Pounds also agree to sign a form stating they will carry their nano in an altoids case for protection .

Ms Mai says she will fight her battles inside Pakistan
Amnesty International introduced Ms Mai at Washington offices " not as a victim , but as a champion for women 's rights " .
Ms Mai shot to world attention after her rape in 2002 , allegedly on the order of a village council in Pakistan .
On her US visit she will receive a magazine 's Woman of the Year award presented by ex-President Bill Clinton .
Ms Mai told assembled rights activists through an interpreter : " I am fighting a fight against oppression , where women and the poor are oppressed ... by feudal lords .
" They have power and money , and all I have is you and your support .
God willing , truth will have victory . "
Travel ban
Ms Mai said her rape and the subsequent court battle would not force her out of her homeland .
" I think that the fight can be fought only by living in Pakistan .
You can not fight by leaving . "
President Musharraf ordered then rescinded a travel ban
On Tuesday Ms Mai will attend a congressional hearing on human rights as a special witness .
On Wednesday she will receive the Glamour magazine Woman of the Year award and a prize of $ 20,000 .
Ms Mai , 36 , has said she will give $ 5,000 to the relief programme for victims of the 8 October earthquake and the rest will fund schools and a women 's crisis centre .
Ms Mai's trip to the US has been controversial .
Earlier this year , Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf banned her from travelling abroad because he feared her visit might " tarnish " Pakistan 's image .
He rescinded the ban after criticism from US officials and rights activists .
Ms Mai has an appeal pending in the Pakistan 's Supreme Court against a high court order to free 13 men accused of involvement in her rape .
Since her highly publicised rape three years ago , she has become an icon in the campaign for women 's justice in conservative Pakistan .
Critics of Pakistan 's judicial system and social systems say the Mukhtar Mai case is an example of appalling treatment often handed out to women , particularly in feudal , rural areas .
Her rape was allegedly ordered by a village council as a punishment for a misdemeanour blamed on her brother .
What ’s going on with the current bustle around U.S. naval stations ?
According to Time , the Navy has issued " Prepare to Deploy Orders " ( PTDOs ) to a strike group including minesweepers , a submarine , an Aegis class cruiser , and a mine hunter .
Taken alongside disclosures that the chief of naval operations asked his planners for a rundown of how a blockade of Iranian oil ports would work , these military preparations led Time to conclude cautiously that the United States " may be preparing for war with Iran . "
Military officials downplay these recent moves as routine .
But given the administration ’s recent history of manufacturing threats , misreading intelligence , and misrepresenting war plans , it is tempting to read between the lines  especially when increasingly hot rhetoric is coming from Washington .
Asked whether the United States will do anything to stop the Iranians from having a nuclear bomb , Vice President Dick Cheney paid lip service to diplomacy before emphasizing that " we think they should not have a nuclear bomb the president has always emphasized no options have been taken off the table . "
President Bush leveled some barbed criticism at Iran during his recent UN General Assembly address .
Tehran continues to " fund terrorism , and fuel extremism , and pursue nuclear weapons , " he said .
" Iran must abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions . "
What might push this combative rhetoric over the edge toward war ?
Iran ’s purported interest in nuclear weapons and its insistence on the right to enrich uranium have been portrayed as one and the same .
And members of the administration have cited Tehran ’s hostility to Israel , its support of terrorism , and its alleged desire to control some of the world ’s richest oil regions as part of an apparent propaganda campaign to justify acts of war against Iran .
President Bush claims that the United States is " working toward a diplomatic solution to this crisis , and as we do , we look to the day when you can live in freedom , and America and Iran can be good friends and close partners in the cause of peace . "
But U.S. military preparations belie this talk of peace .
On Sept. 17 , speaking to a group of peace activists , former CIA official Ray McGovern offered a dire warning : " We have about seven weeks to try and stop this next war from happening . "
The Absurdity of War
Given the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the sheer cost of existing military commitments , it would seem that the last thing the United States can afford right now is another war .
But as retired Air Force Col .
Sam Gardiner observes , the Bush administration did n’t apply the " making sense " filter over the past four years in Iraq .
It is therefore unlikely to use common sense in evaluating whether to attack Iran .
In a report for the Century Foundation [.pdf ] , Gardiner puts forward a hypothetical view of the " seven truths " about Iran shared by members of the Bush administration .
Of these propositions , Gardiner sees two as true : that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons and that sanctions aimed at stopping them will be ineffective .
He also maintains that Bush policymakers mistakenly assume that the Iranian people support " regime change " and that Iran can not be negotiated with .
He further notes that U.S. and Israeli commandos have been exploring targets in Iran for some time .
This combination of U.S. beliefs and real - world actions , Gardiner believes , will lead to U.S. air strikes against Iran and even possibly a campaign for regime change .
Bombing Iran , however , is not an easy proposition .
According to estimates quoted in Time , there are 1,500 different " aim points " ( or viable targets ) in Iran related to their nuclear development complex .
Air strikes would require almost everything the Air Force has , and even then , a White House official admits , " we do n’t know where it all is so we ca n’t get it all . "
Gardiner and most other analysts assume that air strikes would bring Iranian retaliation , from stepped up support for Hezbollah and a greater role in fostering attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq to efforts to block the straits of Hormuz , a main outlet for Persian Gulf oil .
Less likely but not out of the question would be Iranian attacks on the oil pipelines of other major suppliers such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia , which would send world oil prices through the roof and make Iran ’s reserves worth all that much more .
In light of these potential counter moves , Anthony Zinni , former commander of U.S. troops in the Middle East , warns : " You ’ve got to be prepared for the worst case , and the worst case in Iran is [ U.S. ] boots on the ground . "
Bluff or Chicken ?
The administration may well be bluffing to demonstrate its " hard - nosed " diplomatic resolve .
The U.S. military does not believe that air strikes on Iran are either workable or advisable , and , as noted above , an attack would not likely hit all major Iranian nuclear sites since U.S. intelligence does n’t know where they are .
Fred Kaplan , writing at Slate , argues that Iran policy may be moving along parallel tracks  one involving force as a form of pressure and the other involving plans for an actual military attack .
He imagines the current situation as a dangerous game of highway chicken in which two drivers speed toward each other , head on .
The winner is the one who does n’t veer off the road , and it ’s a tie if both drivers steer off the road .
" If they both keep driving straight on , pedal to the metal , certain of victory , opposed on moral principle to backing down , the outcome is mutual catastrophe , " Kaplan writes .
" And in this case , we ’re all sitting in those cars . "
The flaw in Kaplan ’s metaphor is that it implies two equal adversaries .
Even with a nuclear weapon , Iran could n’t subject the United States to the kind of damage that Washington could inflict on it .
But as we see every day in Iraq , the car that " veers off the road " can come back to fight another day , by other means that are just as deadly .

Simple means launching something Jason 61 comments Latest by Jim
We ’ve been talking about launching a Basecamp affiliate program for a few months now .
I ’ll stress talking .
Talk , talk , talk .
No walk .
Why ?
Cause what we had in mind was pretty complex which means we ’d never get around to doing it .
It meant research and research is n’t our thing .
So yesterday I said fuck it — let ’s make this simpler .
I wrote up a brief story describing the feature , designed a few UI screens that were needed , and we got started on it .
Now we ’ll launch the affiliate program next week .
1 week from idea to launch sure beats 3 months from idea to nothing .
Here ’s the exact story posted to our “ Storyline ” Basecamp project ( this is where we keep ideas for features we ’re working on ) :
Ok …
Let ’s simplfy .
Instead of dealing with cash payouts and the related accounting nightmare , I suggest we start simple first .
People can earn credits towards their account .
That ’s good enough to get this started .
We can introduce cash later if we want .
Cash will have more impact , but I think this is a first good step to test the waters .
So , here ’s how it works .
Everyone gets an affiliate link / code they can pass around .
If someone clicks that link or uses that code to sign up for paying plan , the code owner gets a credit towards their account .
The credit would be applied at the time that the new customer ’s card is charged , not when they sign up for the 30 day free trial ( since we need to take in someone else ’s money to give someone else a discount ) .
We should show a “ pending credit ” to the code owner so they can see it “ working . ”
So I ’m thinking the credit is 50 % of the new customer ’s first charge .
So , if someone uses a link , signs up for the Plus plan ( $ 49 / month ) , and then keeps the plan and is charged $ 49 in 30 days , the code owner gets a credit of $ 25 applied to their account .
Credits will accrue so you can build up $ xxx in credit and never pay for your Basecamp account again .
Simple .
Done !
Moral :
If you find yourself talking more than walking , shut up , cut the vision in half , and launch it .
You can always fill in the gaps later .
In fact , you ’ll know more about what gaps need to be filled after you ’ve launched “ half a feature ” than if you tried to fill them in before launching anything .
Christophe Fauviau was devoted to his children 's tennis careers
Christophe Fauviau , 46 , appeared in court in Mont - de - Marsan on charges of unintentionally causing a death by administering noxious substances .
He is accused of spiking water bottles of 27 of his children 's opponents with a drug causing drowsiness .
If found guilty , the retired soldier faces up to 20 years in prison .
Prosecutors will tell the court that Mr Fauviau is suspected of drugging 21 rivals of his daughter , Valentine , 15 , and six of his son , Maxime , 18 , between 2000 and 2003 .
He allegedly used the drug Temesta - an anti-anxiety medicine which can cause drowsiness - to improve his children 's chances in the matches .
All the opponents concerned , nine of them aged under 15 , complained of weak knees , dizziness , nausea or fainting during the games .
Some were later taken to hospital .
' Diminished responsibility '
Police investigations began after a player beaten by Maxime Fauviau died in a car crash while driving home after the amateur tournament in July 2003 .
Twenty - five - year - old teacher Alexandre Lagardere had suddenly suffered great fatigue and loss of balance while playing the teenager .
The parents of Alexandre Lagardere attended the trial opening
On his arrest in August 2003 , police said Mr Fauviau had admitted spiking the drinks of Mr Lagardere and two others .
Ahead of the trial , his defence lawyer , Pierre Blazy , said the prosecution would have to prove a direct link between the administration of the drug and Mr Lagardere 's fatal crash .
Mr Blazy told France 's Sud-Ouest newspaper that his client had been in a state of diminished responsibility at the time of the incident and had sought psychotherapy while in custody .
Suspicion quickly fell on Mr Fauviau , from the south - western town of Dax , because of complaints by two other players who had competed against Maxime in preceding weeks .
One allegedly saw Mr Fauviau tampering with a water bottle before the game and gave it to police .
It tested positive for Temesta .
The ex-helicopter pilot was said to be devoted to the tennis careers of his children , particularly that of Valentine , who was already high in the rankings .
A verdict is expected in the case on 10 March .

Hands - On with the Wii Controller Table of Contents Controller preview
What do we think ?
Most intuitive ?
LOS ANGELES -- With Nintendo's Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference and the show itself looming , we had the opportunity to pop by the company 's booth and try out the Wii .
During our brief time , we tried out a variety of first - party titles to get a practical feel for just how the unique controller is going to work .
Though you 'll find our impressions of the five titles we played , Wii Sports : Tennis , Excite Truck , WarioWare : Smooth Moves , Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption , and The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess elsewhere , we wanted to offer a quick run-through of just how the controller feels and how it 's changed since we last saw it .
Before we start , we should note that during our play session Nintendo reps said that the controller we were playing was still considered a prototype , as the possibility for some fine - tuning still existed .
That said , the controller we got our hands on was n't radically different from what we tried last year at the Tokyo Game Show , though there have been some noticeable tweaks to the design .
The most radical is the addition of a speaker that rests just below the three buttons that divide the controller in half .
The small speaker came into play during the Legend of Zelda fishing sequence we played and complemented its built - in rumble during the parts of the demo where we reeled in our catch , as it emitted the sound of a reel turning .
This addition has resulted in the controller being a bit longer , to accommodate the new feature .
The Wii controller has a " nunchaku " analog stick attachment .
The other more subtle differences revolve around the names for the buttons .
The main button on the face of the unit is still named A , and the trigger button on the underside is still named B .
The vertical row of buttons has seen some tweaks that differ from the official controller images Nintendo released during TGS , though .
The first button , seen in photos as saying " select , " now has the image of an arrow that 's curved counterclockwise , similar to those seen in the refresh icon on a Web browser .
The second button , labeled " home " in official images , now has the image of a house on it , similar to one you 'd see in a Web browser .
The third button , originally labeled " start , " now has two horizontal bars on it that look like the pause icon on a music or movie player .
Nintendo displayed an image of the controller with different button icons during its E3 2006 press conference , with a minus sign on the left button , the same house icon on the middle button , and a plus sign on the right button .
Below these three buttons and past the speaker are the two buttons that have been alternately labeled a and b ( lowercase ) , or 1 and 2 on the controller variants we 've seen in the past .
The controller we tried at E3 had the 1 and 2 buttons .
Wii controller from all sides .
The second part of the controller , the analog attachment that goes by the " nunchaku " moniker , had a more streamlined shape and featured a tweaked button design .
The two shoulder buttons , named Z1 and Z2 respectively , have also been reshaped and renamed since we last saw them at the Game Developers Conference a few months ago .
The top shoulder button , now called C , is a good deal smaller than the lower shoulder button , now called Z .
The C button was oval shaped , while the Z button was a more traditional square .
Though Nintendo still considered the units we were using to be prototypes , we reckon they gave a pretty good sense of the unit 's heft .
The controllers we had in our hands at the Tokyo Game Show were wired and weighed almost nothing .
The wireless prototypes have a decent heft to them now , though .
They use AA batteries , which will further add to the weight .
At the moment , the main controller feels about as heavy as a Nintendo DS .
The nunchaku weighs about as much as a cell phone .
Holding both units in either hand feels fine , and the buttons are easy to reach .
We expect it will take time before our fingers get used to the controller 's unique landscape and feel totally comfortable sliding around hitting buttons , but so far the controller feels good .
The only thing we noticed was that you may find yourself gripping the main controller a little too tightly at first while playing .
We reckon this will be an unconscious thing in much the same way most people playing a racing game will lean into turns without thinking or grip their controllers in a vicelike grip when walking around the sky stage in a Mario game .
We have to hand it to Nintendo : Despite the Wii controller 's unorthodox appearance , the thing is dead easy to pick up and play .
So there you have it .
Though we 'll again note that Nintendo reps stated the controllers we played were prototypes , we expect that the final units will be pretty close to what we tried .
Though we expect there will be tweaking , much like the DS underwent following our first look at E3 two years ago , we have to say that Nintendo has managed to create a controller that 's poised to revolutionize how games are played .
GameSpot Editor Gut Reactions Table of Contents Controller preview
What do we think ?
Most intuitive ?
Build around the Wii's strengths Ryan Davis , Associate Editor After watching the Nintendo pre-E3 2006 press conference , I was more convinced that the motion - sensitive Wii controller might actually work out .
Just watching Miyamoto , Reggie , and Iwata playing tennis with contest winner Scott Dyer , it seemed like they were having themselves a blast , and I wanted in on that .
I made my way into the inner-circle of the Nintendo booth first thing Wednesday morning , making a bee - line to The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess .
The very , very first thing I noticed when actually holding the Wii controller for the first time was that it seemed kinda , I dunno , small .
I guess after looking at dozens of super - high - res images of the controller for nearly nine months now , I figured it would be about the size of the universal remote in my living room .
As I started in on the demo , it began to dawn on me that , although I was enjoying the experience , perhaps Twilight Princess was n't the best game to be retraining my brain on how video games work , especially not with a long line of rather voracious Nintendo fans standing behind me .
Not that the game did n't control well , but I 've played so much Zelda that having those familiar controls transplanted into this very unique control scheme took quite a bit of getting used to , sort of like the first time I tried playing Quake with a mouse and keyboard instead of just the keyboard .
The games that were designed with the Wii in mind from the ground up , on the other hand , were some of the most intuitive and easy to use games I 've played in a long time , Wii Sports : Golf in particular .
This is the ultimate challenge that the Wii controller faces -- games designed specifically for it seem to have the potential to flourish , while ports of other , more traditional game types will have to struggle to fit in .
Better than the treadmill Brian Ekberg , Sports Editor After spending some extended time with the Wii controller at a Nintendo developer event on the first night of E3 , I 'm convinced of one thing : I need to head back to the gym .
Checking out games such as Wii Sports : Baseball , Golf , and Tennis were good warm - ups , as they got you into the spirit of using a console controller as something other than an object to hold stationary for long stretches of time .
And hey , wiggling the remote during our batting stance in Baseball let us practice our impression of Nomar 's freaky warmup routine .
In the end though , it was Wii Music Orchestra that really got my heart pumping .
Pumping the Wii controller up and down like a particularly thick conductor 's baton made for a surprisingly brisk cardiovascular workout and I 'm more than a little ashamed to say I was a bit winded at the end .
Thank goodness the only two tunes available for conducting were the theme to Bizet 's Carmen and the Legend of Zelda theme .
Had it been Flight of the Bumblebees I might be laid up in a hospital instead of sitting here typing this now .
It 's growing on me Bob Colayco , Associate Editor
So far I 've had a chance to use the Wii controller with Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption , and Madden .
The controller 's met my expectations in that it 's interesting to use , works ok most of the time , and has a bit of a learning curve .
It only took me a few minutes to get acclimated to aiming and shooting with the remote with Samus , and it was even easier to throw passes and kick the ball in Madden .
Madden actually seemed to have pretty advanced controls with the remote as I was easily able to gun or put touch on passes as appropriate , and quickly learned how to put some hook or slice on kicks in order to compensate for wind .
But the remote also met some of my negative expectations ; in its current iteration there are some fairly serious flaws that should be addressed before the Wii ships .
The main issue I noticed was with Metroid -- it seems as though the sensor array you attach to the TV expects your hands to be on a certain horizontal plane before it will respond to your movements .
If you drop or raise your arms below the " strike zone " for any reason ( for example , you put down the controllers to go to the bathroom , or drop your hands in disappointment after dying , or just get a little tired and drop your arms ) , then reacquiring the signal can be a tricky affair .
In the meantime , the screen goes crazy and constantly spins you around or points you in one direction , not unlike an optical mouse that 's going haywire .
This issue came up more than a couple of times during my 10 minutes or so playing Metroid .
When the sensors are locked in , the aiming and action with the remote and nunchuk work just fine .
But the casual and non-gamers that Nintendo is supposedly trying to attract with this device may become frustrated if the kinks are n't worked out of the remote sensor .
That caveat aside , I came away from my experience with the Wii more interested in the console than I was when I came to E3 .
If Nintendo keeps the price point low ( as in $ 200 or not much higher ) , then I will likely pick one up at launch .
I freely admit being wrong about the DS 's touch screen and dual screen , so despite the remote 's current problems , I 'll give Nintendo the benefit of the doubt this time .
I totally do n't hate it .
Honestly .
Alex Navarro , Associate Editor
Here 's the thing I decided after sampling a few of the Wii's available titles : you need to be very clear on how sensitive the controls for your game ought to be , otherwise you 're going to end up frustrating a lot of people .
Key examples on either side of the equation : Mario and Excite Truck .
Super Mario Galaxy , in my mind , was one of the tightest and most enjoyable games shown in Nintendo 's booth .
I really liked the spinning mechanics used to send Mario flying from planet to planet , and the boss fight I tried was a great deal of fun .
Conversely , I can't say I loved Excite Truck .
I think there 's a great deal of potential for that game to be fun , but something about the sensitivity of the steering in that game seemed overwrought .
It 's like , yeah , it took some serious getting used to just to adjust to tilting the controller , rather than using a D - pad to steer the damn thing .
But even once I got used to doing that , I still felt like I was in terrible danger of oversteering with even the slightest tilt too far in one direction .
I still need to try some games like Zelda and WarioWare , as I 've heard both make very good use of the Wii controller .
But from my initial impression , I do actually think there 's a great deal of potential for the thing .
However , this system 's success , more than any other in history , is going to rely heavily on developer creativity and skill .
Maybe that 's how it ought to be , really , but it could also be quite the risky proposition if not enough of the right people get their hands on this thing .

Auch im Bereich der Datenbanken beginnt Open - Source - Software , sich ihren Platz im Markt zu erobern .
Mit Firebird , Ingres , MaxDB , MySQL und PostgreSQL buhlen fünf Kandidaten um die Gunst der Anwender .
Leicht gekürzter Vorabdruck aus dem Open Source Jahrbuch 2006 .
Der
Text steht unter der Creative - Commons - Lizenz ( Namensnennung - Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 2.5 ) und darf unter Nennung der Autorin und Beibehaltung der Lizenz auch in veränderter Form weitergegeben werden .
2005 war ein aufregendes Jahr bei den Open - Source - Datenbanken .
Neue Versionen von MySQL ( 5.0 ) und PostgreSQL ( 8.0 , 8.1 ) warteten mit wesentlichen Funktionserweiterungen auf .
Oracle gelang mit dem Kauf von Innobase der Zugriff auf eine wichtige Komponente von MySQL : den InnoDB - Tabellentyp .
Sun startete kommerziellen Support für PostgreSQL .
Mit Bizgres steht seit diesem Jahr ein vollständiger Open - Source - Business - Intelligence - Stack zur Verfügung .
Und schließlich wurde im November in Frankfurt die erste internationale Konferenz zum Thema Open - Source - Datenbanken veranstaltet .
Dieser Artikel vergleicht die Big 5 ( Firebird , Ingres , MaxDB , MySQL , PostgreSQL ) mit Blick auf ihren Einsatz im Rahmen großer Unternehmensanwendungen .
Dabei soll es nicht darum gehen , eine Rangliste zu produzieren .
Der Ansatz ist vielmehr , dass für jede Aufgabe das passende Werkzeug verwendet werden sollte : Die Entscheidung für ein bestimmtes Datenbankmanagementsystem ( DBMS ) muss sich an den Anforderungen des jeweiligen Einsatzszenarios orientieren .
Einwände gegen Open Source
Gerade in Unternehmen mit wenig Erfahrung mit Open - Source - Software stehen viele Entscheider diesem Softwareentwicklungsmodell skeptisch gegenüber .
Man befürchtet informellen Support , mangelnde langfristige Planung , ein kompliziertes Wirrwarr unterschiedlicher Lizenz - Modelle , unklare Haftbarkeiten und erhöhten administrativen Aufwand .
Speziell Open - Source - Datenbanken wird ein Mangel an Features im Vergleich zu den proprietären Pendants wie Oracle oder MS SQL Server unterstellt .
Und nicht zuletzt stellt sich die Frage nach der Verfügbarkeit von Applikationen , die in der Lage sind , mit Open - Source - Datenbanken zusammenzuarbeiten .
Einige dieser Befürchtungen sind leicht zu entkräften .
So gibt es für alle fünf großen Open - Source - Datenbanken Anbieter kommerziellen Supports : MySQL AB für MySQL , Computer Associates und Ingres Corp. für Ingres , IBPhoenix ( international ) und HK - Software ( Deutschland ) für Firebird , SAP AG und MySQL AB für MaxDB und eine große Auswahl internationaler Firmen ( darunter Fujitsu und Sun ) für PostgreSQL ( im deutschsprachigen Raum beispielsweise credativ und Cybertec ) .
Und die Entwickler der jeweiligen Software direkt per IRC , Mail , Foren oder Bug - Tracker ansprechen zu können , ist für viele AnwenderInnen hilfreicher als die Nutzung einer Telefon - Hotline .
In eine ähnliche Richtung gehen Fragen der Gewährleistung und Haftbarkeit .
Bei den drei Datenbanken , die Firmen gehören ( MySQL , Ingres , MaxDB ) , ist auf jeden Fall genauso viel ( oder wenig ) Haftung wie bei Closed - Source - Software zu erwarten .
Was die langfristige Planung anbelangt , so finden sich auf den Webseiten fast aller Open - Source - Datenbanken ausführliche Roadmaps .
Das Thema Lizenzierung ist schon etwas komplizierter .
Die fünf großen Open - Source - Datenbanken lizenzieren alle auf unterschiedliche Weise : Firebird verwendet die eigene Interbase Public License ( IPL ) , Ingres die Computer Associates Trusted Open Source License ( CATOSL ) , MySQL und MaxDB duale Lizenzierung ( GPL und kommerziell ) und PostgreSQL steht unter der BSD - Lizenz .
Das Vorurteil eines erhöhten administrativen Aufwandes und geringerer Benutzerfreundlichkeit bei Open - Source - Software bestätigt sich im Datenbankbereich nicht : Neben sehr ausgereiften Kommandozeilen - Werkzeugen bringen alle fünf Datenbanken selbstverständlich auch Tools mit grafischen Oberflächen mit .
Meist sind sie sogar einfacher zu administrieren als ihre proprietären Gegenparts .
Zwei Argumente gegen den Einsatz von Open - Source - Datenbanken wiegen jedoch schwer .
Zum einen ist dies die Frage nach der Unterstützung durch Software - Hersteller .
Also : Kann ich das Datenbankdesign - Tool oder die Business Intelligence Suite , die ich bisher mit proprietären Datenbanken genutzt habe , weiter einsetzen ?
Die Antwort lautet immer noch oft : Leider nein .
Und zweitens muss man den Umfang an unterstützten Features erwähnen .
Obwohl alle fünf Open - Source - Datenbanken einen sehr großen Funktionsumfang mitbringen , gibt es doch immer wieder Anforderungen , bei denen einzelne oder sogar alle passen müssen .
Materialized Views , eine Technik , die im Data - Warehouse - Bereich genutzt wird , um die Bereitstellung von Daten auf komplexe Abfragen zu beschleunigen , stellt zum Beispiel keines der Projekte zur Verfügung .
Pro Open Source
Die Argumente für Open - Source - Datenbanken sind dieselben wie für Open - Source - Software im Allgemeinen : niedrige Kosten und die Vorteile des Open - Source - Softwareentwicklungsmodells .
Kostenberechnungen sind allerdings kompliziert , weil man nicht nur die Lizenzkosten , sondern auch die mit dem Einsatz und der Administration der Software verbundenen Arbeitskosten mit berücksichtigen muss .
MySQL zum Beispiel nimmt in einem White Paper für sich in Anspruch , weniger als halb so viel Kosten zu verursachen wie der Einsatz einer Closed - Source - Datenbank .
Aber neben niedrigeren Kosten hat Open - Source - Software einen weiteren ganz entscheidenden Vorteil : der offene Quellcode .
Der Einsatz von Open - Source - Datenbanken in einem Unternehmen bringt die folgenden Vorteile mit sich :
Finished files are the result

How many F's does the following passage contain
Carrying the Olympic flame to the summit of Everest live on television is , even by Chinese standards , a demanding challenge .
This week mountaineering authorities in Lhasa announced they wanted to limit the number of foreign climbers on the Tibetan side of the 8,850 metre ( 29,035 ft ) peak in spring 2007 to allow a trial run to assess the technology and manpower needed to start the Beijing Olympics from the summit of the world .
But the propaganda value has been severely compromised by video footage taken by a western mountaineer of a 17 - year - old Tibetan nun being shot in the back by Chinese border guards as they tried to stop a group of 73 refugees crossing the Nangpa La , a 5,800 metre pass 15 miles west of Everest , to Nepal .
The nun was Kelsang Namtso from Nagchu prefecture , the only daughter in a family of six .
Like many Tibetans , she had no access to education and planned to study at the Dolma Ling nunnery in India .
Travelling with her childhood friend Dolma Palkyi , she endured high winds and deep snow .
The two young women ran out of food as they approached the difficult pass .
The trail to the Nangpa La pass is overlooked by the base camp of the 8,200 metre mountain Cho Oyu , often used as a training peak by climbers gaining experience for an attempt on Everest .
Footage of People 's Armed Police ( PAP ) taking aim at refugees and of bodies hitting the snow was taken by Romanian mountaineer Sergiu Matei and broadcast around the world .
A death has been reported by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua , but it did not name the victim and claimed PAP opened fire in self - defence .
Mary Beth Markey of the International Campaign for Tibet ( ICT ) said : " We do n't know if the targeting of this group was an isolated incident by Chinese border police or represents hardline protocols . "
The appointment of hardliner Zhang Qingli as party secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region ( TAR ) in May has signalled a renewed determination by Beijing to cement the region to China .
Chinese migration into Tibet has accelerated with the opening of the new high - altitude railway to Lhasa .
Restrictions on religious freedoms in the TAR have been tightened in what Mr Zhang called a " fight to the death struggle " against the Dalai Lama in a speech in May .
Patriotic re-education in nunneries and monasteries has driven more nuns and monks to face the dangers of the Nangpa La to escape Tibet .
Most refugees travel in autumn and winter when deep snow reduces the chance of meeting border patrols , but conditions are severe .
Palkyi , 16 , claimed she had paid $ 700 ( £ 370 ) to smugglers who guide groups over the Himalaya mountains .
Western tourists attempting to climb Cho Oyu frequently encounter refugees and there have been several reports of violence in recent years .
ICT 's director , John Ackerly , himself a mountaineer , says climbers should be bolder in criticising human rights abuses .
" You can compare it to our responsibility to help an injured fellow climber on the mountain , " he said .
" It 's a basic human concern for another individual .
Obviously there are choices and things you need to balance .
It 's not an easy decision all the time , but sometimes , as in this instance , it 's no skin off anyone 's back to speak out .
People think that China holds a much more rigorous list than they do . "
Changes in regulations on Everest are also being seen as a response to criticism in the spring that the low cost of climbing the mountain from Tibet caused accidents , including the death of British mountaineer David Sharp in May .
Although reports that fellow climbers ignored the dying Sharp proved false , mountain guides say independent climbers operating on a shoestring are relying too heavily on the resources of others .
So China is making it more expensive to climb Everest , as well as limiting numbers during the run up to the Olympics .
It will also require climbers going to Everest to have previous experience of climbing another mountain of more than 8,000 metres .
So far , China has not changed its comparatively light regulations on communications equipment such as satellite phones .
That may change .
With the Olympics drawing closer , China may decide it does n't need more negative publicity from incidents such as the death of a young nun .

The exodus
· Mountain border crossings , such as the one attempted by nun Kelsang Namtso , whose body is pictured above , are risky and expensive .
· China invaded Tibet in 1950 and claims sovereignty over the Himalayan region .
Tibetans pledge allegiance only to the Dalai Lama .
· The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising during which monasteries were destroyed .
· Each year between 2,500 and 4,000 Tibetans attempt to cross the Himalayas to reach India via Nepal .
· The Indian embassy in Kathmandu , Nepal , issues up to 30 travel documents a day to Tibetan refugees .

The Brangelinas are trying to keep a happy face and give the Indian and international paparrazi some much - coveted shots while they ’re holed up in a luxurious hotel in India while Angelina films “ A Mighty Heart . ”
Maddox looks just thrilled to be out with them , and I ’m sure the rickshaw driver appreciates all the hassle and attention .
Angelina and Brad might be superficially acting nice , but their bodyguard Mickey Brett is a cruel mofo .
He was seen choking a photographer trying to get some innocent pictures .
He was accused of beating the shit out of a guy who dared breach the Brangelina compound in Namibia back in April .
Maddox was even said to have witnessed the beat - down .
He also grabbed a female reporter around the neck at that time and threatened several others so this seems to be his MO .
Brad and Angelina should have fired this asshole a long time ago .
He was suspected of a murder for hire in the 90s , but was not charged because there was not enough evidence to link him with the crime .
From the looks of this video , he ’s capable of murdering someone with his bare hands !
one of Pitt ’s and Jolie ’s bodyguards caught a British photographer trying to take their photo , grabbing the man by his neck and verbally abusing him .
On Saturday , Video of the incident was broadcast on India ’s CNN - IBN news channel , and the Hindustan Times newspaper identified the photographer as Sam Relph of Barcroft Media .
The newspaper reported that the security guard had shouted at photographers to stop shooting the couple and moved for Relph when the photographer refused to put down his camera .
“ He said if I took his pictures he would kill me , ” the Times quoted Relph as saying .
“ I could n’t breathe .
He had his fingers on my windpipe and he knew what he was doing . ”
Two Indian journalists also complained that they , too , had been threatened by the same security guard , who was not identified in the report .
Why have n’t they fired this creep ?
They ’re probably afraid that he knows too much personal information about them and will go to the press .
There was also a story that Brad was jealous of Mickey Brett ’s fatherly protecting influence over Angelina , and since he ’s worked for her for over five years there is undoubtedly a bond there .
I ’ve almost soured on these two .
After writing a post on Fantasy Celebrity Futures I ’ve been thinking that donations are admirable and all , but it would be much better if they would give up their extremely comfortable lifestyle for a short while in order to make their charity that much more genuine ?
Is that too demanding and hypocritical of me while I sit behind a computer dissing them as Fergie would point out ?
Probably .
There ’s no way they could escape the paparrazi , even if they went to a remote village somewhere , as they proved by taking over an entire country and commandeering its national security force to meet their privacy needs .

" Do unto others what you would have them do unto you . "
A lot of people think Jesus said that , because it is so much the sort of thing Jesus liked to say .
But it was actually said by Confucius , a Chinese philosopher , five hundred years before there was that greatest and most humane of human beings , named Jesus Christ .
The Chinese also gave us , via Marco Polo , pasta and the formula for gunpowder .
The Chinese were so dumb they only used gunpowder for fireworks .
And everybody was so dumb back then that nobody in either hemisphere even knew that there was another one .
We 've sure come a long way since then .
Sometimes I wish we had n't .
I hate H-bombs and the Jerry Springer Show
But back to people like Confucius and Jesus and my son the doctor , Mark , each of whom have said in their own way how we could behave more humanely and maybe make the world a less painful place .
One of my favourite humans is Eugene Debs , from Terre Haute in my native state of Indiana .
Get a load of this .
Eugene Debs , who died back in 1926 , when I was not yet four , ran five times as the Socialist party candidate for president , winning 900,000 votes , almost 6 percent of the popular vote , in 1912 , if you can imagine such a ballot .
He had this to say while campaigning :
" As long as there is a lower class , I am in it .
" As long as there is a criminal element , I am of it .
" As long as there is a soul in prison , I am not free . "
Does n't anything socialistic make you want to throw up ?
Like great public schools , or health insurance for all ?
When you get out of bed each morning , with the roosters crowing , would n't you like to say .
" As long as there is a lower class , I am in it .
As long as there is a criminal element , I am of it .
As long as there is a soul in prison , I am not free . "
How about Jesus ' Sermon on the Mount , the Beatitudes ?
Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the Earth .
Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy .
Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of God .
And so on .
Not exactly planks in a Republican platform .
Not exactly George W Bush , Dick Cheney , or Donald Rumsfeld stuff .
For some reason , the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes .
But , often with tears in their eyes , they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings .
And of course that 's Moses , not Jesus .
I have n't heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount , the Beatitudes , be posted anywhere .
" Blessed are the merciful " in a courtroom ?
" Blessed are the peacemakers " in the Pentagon ?
Give me a break !
It so happens that idealism enough for anyone is not made of perfumed pink clouds .
It is the law !
It is the US Constitution .
But I myself feel that our country , for whose Constitution I fought in a just war , might as well have been invaded by Martians and body snatchers .
Sometimes I wish it had been .
What has happened instead is that it was taken over by means of the sleaziest , low - comedy , Keystone Cops - style coup d'état imaginable .
I was once asked if I had any ideas for a really scary reality TV show .
I have one reality show that would really make your hair stand on end : " C - Students from Yale " .
George W Bush has gathered around him upper - crust C- students who know no history or geography , plus not - so - closeted white supremacists , aka Christians , and plus , most frighteningly , psychopathic personalities , or PPs , the medical term for smart , personable people who have no consciences .
To say somebody is a PP is to make a perfectly respectable diagnosis , like saying he or she has appendicitis or athlete 's foot .
The classic medical text on PPs is The Mask of Sanity by Dr Hervey Cleckley , a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Georgia , published in 1941 .
Read it !
Some people are born deaf , some are born blind or whatever , and this book is about congenitally defective human beings of a sort that is making this whole country and many other parts of the planet go completely haywire nowadays .
These were people born without consciences , and suddenly they are taking charge of everything .
PPs are presentable , they know full well the suffering their actions may cause others , but they do not care .
They cannot care because they are nuts .
They have a screw loose !
And what syndrome better describes so many executives at Enron and WorldCom and on and on , who have enriched themselves while ruining their employees and investors and country and who still feel as pure as the driven snow , no matter what anybody may say to or about them ?
And they are waging a war that is making billionaires out of millionaires , and trillionaires out of billionaires , and they own television , and they bankroll George Bush , and not because he 's against gay marriage .
So many of these heartless PPs now hold big jobs in our federal government , as though they were leaders instead of sick .
They have taken charge .
They have taken charge of communications and the schools , so we might as well be Poland under occupation .
They might have felt that taking our country into an endless war was simply something decisive to do .
What has allowed so many PPs to rise so high in corporations , and now in government , is that they are so decisive .
They are going to do something every fuckin ' day and they are not afraid .
Unlike normal people , they are never filled with doubts , for the simple reason that they do n't give a fuck what happens next .
Simply can't .
Do this !
Do that !
Mobilise the reserves !
Privatise the public schools !
Attack Iraq !
Cut health care !
Tap everybody 's telephone !
Cut taxes on the rich !
Build a trillion - dollar missile shield !
Fuck habeas corpus and the Sierra Club and In These Times , and kiss my ass !
There is a tragic flaw in our precious Constitution , and I do n't know what can be done to fix it .
This is it : only nut cases want to be president .
This was true even in high school .
Only clearly disturbed people ran for class president .
The title of Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a parody of the title of Ray Bradbury 's great science - fiction novel Fahrenheit 451 .
Four hundred and fifty - one degrees Fahrenheit is the combustion point , incidentally , of paper , of which books are composed .
The hero of Bradbury 's novel is a municipal worker whose job is burning books .
While on the subject of burning books , I want to congratulate librarians , not famous for their physical strength , who , all over this country , have staunchly resisted anti-democratic bullies who have tried to remove certain books from their shelves , and destroyed records rather than have to reveal to thought police the names of persons who have checked out those titles .
So the America I loved still exists , if not in the White House , the Supreme Court , the Senate , the House of Representatives , or the media .
The America I loved still exists at the front desks of our public libraries .
And still on the subject of books : our daily news sources , newspapers and TV , are now so craven , so unvigilant on behalf of the American people , so uninformative , that only in books do we learn what 's really going on .
I will cite an example : House of Bush , House of Saud by Craig Unger , published in early 2004 , that humiliating , shameful , blood - soaked year .
In case you have n't noticed , as the result of a shamelessly rigged election in Florida , in which thousands of African - Americans were arbitrarily disenfranchised , we now present ourselves to the rest of the world as proud , grinning , jut - jawed , pitiless war - lovers with appallingly powerful weaponry - who stand unopposed .
In case you have n't noticed , we are now as feared and hated all over the world as Nazis once were .
And with good reason .
In case you have n't noticed , our unelected leaders have dehumanised millions and millions of human beings simply because of their religion and race .
We wound 'em and kill 'em and torture 'em and imprison 'em all we want .
Piece of cake .
In case you have n't noticed , we also dehumanised our own soldiers , not because of their religion or race , but because of their low social class .
Send 'em anywhere .
Make 'em do anything .
Piece of cake .
The O'Reilly Factor .
So I am a man without a country , except for the librarians and a Chicago paper called In These Times .
Before we attacked Iraq , the majestic New York Times guaranteed there were weapons of mass destruction there .
Albert Einstein and Mark Twain gave up on the human race at the end of their lives , even though Twain had n't even seen the first world war .
War is now a form of TV entertainment , and what made the first world war so particularly entertaining were two American inventions , barbed wire and the machine gun .
Shrapnel was invented by an Englishman of the same name .
Do n't you wish you could have something named after you ?
Like my distinct betters Einstein and Twain , I now give up on people , too .
I am a veteran of the second world war and I have to say this is not the first time I have surrendered to a pitiless war machine .
My last words ?
" Life is no way to treat an animal , not even a mouse . "
Napalm came from Harvard .
Veritas
Our president is a Christian ?
So was Adolf Hitler .
What can be said to our young people , now that psychopathic personalities , which is to say persons without consciences , without senses of pity or shame , have taken all the money in the treasuries of our government and corporations , and made it all their own ?

Recently I landed a great job at a video game company .
On the surface , putting on a helmet and storming into a 6 - floor office building carrying a very large , weapon would n't seem like the most appropriate way to be considered for a job .
Putting that aside , here 's what I did ...
When I submitted my portfolio and phoned the company , the receptionist said ,
" I 'm sorry , we have over 200 resumes of artists we 're going through .
We 'll call you when we get to yours . "
200 ?
How the heck can I make a dent in that ?
I could go in and as my mild - mannered self , smile and say , " Hi , I 'm Chris .
Wo n't you consider me for this position ? "
Now where would that get me ?
How much of an impression would that really make ?
I 'd just look like every other 30 - something teenager who 's dying to work at a video game company .
So , I thought ... this sounds like a job for TK409 .
I asked my wife about it and she was very uneasy about the idea , for exactly the reason I mentioned in the first paragraph .
I decided I would , but first , I needed something for the receptionist to remember me by - something to pass along .
So , I took one of my Sandtrooper figures , glued him to a plastic base ( like a trophy ) and wrote in silver pen on the base , my name and the url to my portfolio website .
This would be my " leave - behind . "
When I got to the location that Friday afternoon , I found a remote section of the parking lot and hid behind my car to suit up .
I had a sore throat , so my voice was unearthly low and raspy - very Boba Fett - like .
I was very nervous .
Would security guards throw me out of the building ?
Would the game company think I was psychotic ?
Probably , but I had to try .
I got done and marched across the parking lot to the structure , in full , weathered Sandtrooper gear , backpack and Lewis Gun , I was really sweating this idea : I needed to just get in , stay in - character , make a small impression with the probably - unappreciative - receptionist and leave my mini-me with her to give to someone important - all before someone had me thrown out .
This would be like a game in itself .
I entered the first floor lobby and headed straight for the elevators .
Then there was the wait for the doors ... " open , open , open ... "
I pleaded under my breath .
Finally I entered the empty car unnoticed , because the large , sculptured - glass lobby was empty .
I later learned that the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( yes , that FBI ) has an office in the building and I had marched right past their windows ... twice !
So much for homeland security .
I rode to the 6th floor and the doors opened .
An Epic Games employee stood there , mouth agape .
My trooper voice said , " ' Scuse me sir , ~ click - shht~ , " and I headed down the nearest hall , looking for any open office door .
Another employee appeared and the trooper asked , " Which way to Epic Games . "
It was n't a question .
I was telling him to direct me .
Because by now the sweat from my forehead brought on by the humid 95 degree weather was stinging my eyes and I needed to get this done .
With a big smile he asks , " Oh cool !
Are you here for the meeting ? ! "
OK , right now a couple thoughts go through my head : Either I say , " Yes sir " and march myself to the head of a conference room in front of an entire company and play like I have a presentation until I reveal I 'm just there to give them my portfolio ... and they have me thrown out .
Which would be painful on several levels .
OR , I be honest and see where that gets me .
I was honest , sorry .
Looking back I could have gone with the first option and it would have been fantastic , but you know , hindsight .
Little trooper found a place of reverence on Creative Director Jerry O'Flaherty 's desk
He says , " Oh , Chris Bartlett , yes I know his work , he 's a graphic designer and animator , yeah , I like his work . "
Then he thought for a second and said ... " Are you Chris Bartlett ? "
Again , uncomfortable ?
Yes .
But honesty is , after all , the best policy .
I paused to consider the ramifications of being revealed as the world 's biggest nerd .
And then I confessed , " Yes ........ clik - chht . "
He was thrilled .
But ... keeping with my mission , I said goodbye and turned to head for the elevators .
When I turned I saw that several people had filled the hallway of the sixth floor , all looking at me .
Thankfully , many of them were smiling .
Some even wanted photos !
Then , this pair of 20 - something guys walked up and said , " AWESOME MAN !
What are you doing here ? "
I told them of my mission of portfolio delivery and one said , pointing to the other , " Well , this is the CEO . "
Now , having been previously poked fun of by people with self - importance issues at various events or conventions , had thickened my skin a little .
I dismissed his comment and said , " Yeah , thanks ... " and I turned for the elevator .
Behind me I hear him say , " No really ! "
Unconvinced , I calmly turned around and said , " This is n't a Jedi- mind trick ... is it ? "
They laughed and said , " Nope ! "
So I shook his hand , said it was a pleasure to meet him , and gave him the web address .
I turned to answer a couple questions and then made my exit into the elevator car , where I had to hold the doors open 5 times while people crowded through to ask me questions .
Finally the doors closed and I sank with relief .
Little did I know that the entire company was heading into a meeting where , if I had been just a few minutes later , I would have missed everyone - no one would have been available to share in my giant display of dorkery .
I later learned that the trooper was the talk of the meeting .
Some had thought I was from LucasArts to make some big announcement .
They told me that everyone was talking about me and my website and the guts it took to make an appearance like that .
Remember , I only thought I 'd be able to meet with the receptionist .
I was very pleased with this outcome .
When I returned home , there was an email from the CD saying how much I impressed the folks there and he said , " Huge points to you for showing up like that .
That 's the type of creativity we 're looking for . "
So , they tell me I moved to the top of the pile from that point on .
25 interviews later ( this place is like Fort Knox ) I was offered the position , and today was my first day at work .
My first assignment ?
" Play these two particular games as much as possible and become familiar with every inch of them . "
Um ... that sounds ... doable .
Pass the free donuts and OJ .
I 'm going to be here a while !
Now , I do n't think this would work for like , a banking job or a position at Intel .
This formula will probably mostly work for creative companies who employ 20 - 30 - something , video - game playing , sci - fi freaks .
If you try it , good luck !
But do n't come crying to me if it does n't work .
I warned you .
Intelligent design is the belief that living organisms are so complex that the best explanation is that they were created by an intelligent force of some kind .
At issue in the lawsuit is whether the concept 's introduction into biology class is an abridgment of the separation between church and state .
The board voted last year to require that students in ninth - grade biology listen to a four - paragraph statement saying that there are gaps and problems with the theory of evolution and that intelligent design is among the alternatives worth considering .
The statement said that among the resources available in the school library for further study is an intelligent - design textbook , " Of Pandas and People . "
In two days on the stand , Professor Behe has insisted that intelligent design is not the same as creationism , which supports the biblical view that God created the earth and its creatures fully formed .
The Supreme Court has ruled that creationism is a religious belief and cannot be taught in public school .
The cross-examination of Professor Behe on Tuesday made it clear that intelligent - design proponents do not necessarily share the same definition of their own theory .
Eric Rothschild , a lawyer representing the parents suing the school board , projected an excerpt from the " Pandas " textbook that said :
" Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features already intact , fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks and wings , etc . "
In that definition , Mr. Rothschild asked , could n't the words " intelligent design " be replaced by " creationism " and still make sense ?
Professor
Behe responded that that excerpt from the textbook was " somewhat problematic , " and that it was not consistent with his definition of intelligent design .

Scholastic squashes ' The Path to 9/11 ' guide
The children 's publishing company says will create a discussion guide focusing on media literacy , critical thinking and historical background .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Children 's publishing company Scholastic said that it is removing materials from its
Web site originally created for use in conjunction with ABC's " The Path to 9/11 " amid growing controversy over the docudrama .
The company said it will create a new classroom discussion guide for high school students that focuses more specifically on media literacy , critical thinking , and historical background .
Scholastic is removing materials from its site that were created for classroom use in conjunction with ABC 's docudrama , " The Path to 9/11 . "
" After a thorough review of the original guide that we offered online to about 25,000 high school teachers , we determined that the materials did not meet our high standards for dealing with controversial issues , " Dick Robinson , Chairman , President and CEO of Scholastic said in a statement .
" At the same time , we believe that developing critical thinking and media literacy skills is crucial for students in today 's society in order to participate fully in our democracy and that a program such as ' The Path to 9/11 ' provides a very ' teachable moment ' for developing these skills at the high school level .
We encourage teachers not to shy away from the controversy surrounding the program , but rather to engage their students in meaningful , in - depth discussion . "
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , former National Security Adviser Sandy Berger , Clinton Foundation head Bruce Lindsey and Clinton adviser Douglas Band all wrote in the past week to Robert Iger , CEO of The Walt Disney Co. ( Charts ) , to express concern over " The Path to 9/11 . " ( Full story . )
The letter writers said that the miniseries contained factual errors , and that their requests for an opportunity to see it had gone unanswered .
In a statement released in apparent response to the growing uproar , ABC said , " No one has seen the final version of the film , because the editing process is not yet complete , so criticisms of film specifics are premature and irresponsible . "
Scholastic 's new guide states that it had no involvement with developing the ABC docudrama and that the company is not promoting the program .
The new guide will be available on Friday , Sept. 8 , the company said .

Trump v Biden : Competing plans to bring back manufacturing jobs
Both candidates want to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US but have different visions for how to achieve it .
What a shower
It certainly beats your common or garden water feature .
Inventor James Dyson , he of the bagless vacuum cleaner , has stolen the headlines from the gardeners at this year 's Chelsea Flower Show with his " Wrong Garden " .
A set of four glass ramps positioned in a square clearly show water travelling up each of them before it pours off the top , only to start again at the bottom of the next ramp .
It is a sight which defies logic , and has become probably the most memorable image of this year 's show .
Mr Dyson says his inspiration was a drawing by the Dutch artist MC Escher ( he of Gothic palaces where soldiers are eternally walking upstairs , and of patterns where birds turn into fish ) .
" One of these is an optical illusion that shows water going uphill and round and round the four sides of a square perpetually , " he says [ see Internet Links ] .
" I wanted to create a series of cascades that are all on the same level - an everlasting waterfall . "
" James came up to me and said he wanted this idea to make water go uphill .
My initial reaction was to look for Paul Daniels ' phone number .
But I 've had to become a bit of an illusionist myself . "
How is the illusion achieved ?
Covering the ramp is a glass surface .
Water is pumped in at the bottom , and comes out of the opening at the top .
At the opening , some of the water is diverted back down the ramp , covering the glass in a thin layer of water .
Compressed air is also pumped in where the water enters - bubbles then travel up the ramp to the opening .
These bubbles , combined with the thin layer of water going downhill , are what create the illusion that the surface of the ramp is not just a glass lid .
I stand a discreet distance away and listen to some of their theories - there are some fantastic ideas there
Derek Phillips , Dyson engineer
" I stand a discreet distance away and listen to some of their theories - there are some fantastic ideas there , some of them I actually wish I could make .
" One person was saying that they thought the water was actually travelling the other way - they were wondering how I was managing to get a water jet to shoot up to the top of the glass . "
No sooner has it got to the top than it starts again up the ramp
" We could certainly make mini versions of it - or even larger versions , " says Mr Phillips .
" I 've had a few architects coming up to me asking me about it .
But I 'm not telling exactly how I achieve the effect . "
Before someone tries to market their own uphill water feature , they had better be warned .
James Dyson - no stranger to court battles over patents - has presumably taken care of the necessary legal business .
Gas prices tumble 21 cents
Prices at the pump ' punctured ' by rise in supplies , sharply below a year ago .
( CNN ) -- Gasoline prices plunged more than 21 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to a national average of $ 2.66 amid an abundant supply of fuel at service stations , a national survey said Sunday .
Lower demand for gas with the end of the summer driving season and a drop in crude oil prices combined to send prices downward across the United States , according to Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the " Lundberg Survey . "
Quick Vote
What was the top business news story of the past week ?
Hewlett - Packard leak investigation may have broken law BP execs slammed by lawmakers over pipeline Labor costs revised up , raising inflation concern Oil slips to 5 - month lows Concern about Fed rate hike resumption roils markets or View results
Lundberg , whose survey tallies prices every two to three weeks at about 5,000 gas stations in all 50 states , said gas prices were " punctured . "
The average price of a gallon of gas has fallen nearly 37 cents a gallon in the last four weeks , according to the Lundberg Survey taken on Sept.
8 .
The drop means prices are 35 cents lower than a year ago in the days following Hurricane Katrina , which disrupted of the oil industry along the Gulf coast .
" The situation has reversed itself , " Lundberg said .
" Rather than a shortage of gasoline hiking prices , we 've had more than enough gasoline . "
" Most of the impetus for the retail gas puncture has been spent , " she added .
" Unless crude oil prices lose several more dollars per barrel , which is not very likely , then further retail gas prices cuts will be slower from here . "
OPEC oil ministers meet in Vienna on Monday and are not expected to change production levels among member countries , Lundberg said .
Drivers in Des Moines paid the least , at $ 2.32 per gallon ; drivers in Honolulu the most , at $ 3.17 .
Los Angeles and Chicago led the Lower 48 , at $ 2.96 .
The following are prices in other U.S. cities :
Tulsa , Okla . : $ 2.34
Cleveland : $ 2.37
Atlanta : $ 2.48
Houston : $ 2.49
Phoenix : $ 2.57
Boston : $ 2.68
Denver : $ 2.87
Gas may head back near $ 2
BP fell short on pipeline , execs admit
Mr Morales says he wants to share the burden of the poor
The decision means that the salaries of all Bolivian public sector employees will be reviewed , as no official can earn more than the president .
Mr Morales said the money saved would be used to increase the numbers of doctors and teachers .
Mr Morales suggested that members of Congress should cut their salaries too .
During the campaign , Mr Morales had pledged to halve his own pay if elected .
The move announced after his first cabinet went beyond that , with a cut of 57 % .
BBC South America correspondent Daniel Schweimler says many voted for Mr Morales believing that he was different from the more conservative politicians who have governed in the past .
The former llama herder and coca leaf farmer was inaugurated last Sunday as Bolivia 's first indigenous president .
He has promised to fight corruption , introduce a new tax on the wealthy , and renationalise energy companies .
The Laotian rock rat
More details
The Laotian rock rat , known locally as the kha - nyou , was identified as a species new to science in 2005 .
It was spotted at a hunter 's market in Laos by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) .
A return visit has uncovered more specimens , suggesting the squirrel - like animal may not be that rare .
The creature was originally thought to belong to an entirely new rodent family more closely related to rodents in Africa and South America than in Asia .
However , after a detailed search through the fossil records of the Natural History Museum in London , the mammal is now believed to be the sole survivor of an ancient group of rodents that died out 11 million years ago .
" The Laotian rock rat ( Laonastes aenigmamus ) , described last year by the Wildlife Conservation Society scientists in Laos , is certainly new to science and a genetically distinct species , while also representing the lone survivor of an ancient family , " the WCS said .
" However , it may not be that rare .
On a recent visit to a hunter 's market in Laos , WCS conservationist Peter Clyne found the rats to be quite common , photographing several specimens . "
The conservation status of the species is unknown , and it has never been observed by biologists in the wild .
Cases of soldiers deserting the army are said to be rising
Figures for those still missing are 86 from 2001 , 118 from 2002 , 134 from 2003 , 229 from 2004 , 377 from 2005 , and 189 for this year so far .
The news comes as Parliament debates a law that will forbid military personnel from refusing to participate in the occupation of a foreign country .
The MoD insists " absent without leave " figures have remained constant .
A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said the soldiers currently missing were considered to be " absent without leave " and would have to be court martialled before they could be found guilty of deserting .
She added only one person has been found guilty of deserting the Army since 1989 .
According to MoD figures 2,670 soldiers went " absent without leave " in 2001 , with the figure rising to 2,970 in 2002 and falling in 2003 to 2,825 .
In 2004 it rose to 3,050 , falling back again in 2005 to 2,725 .
She added : " We regard that figure as fairly constant .
It often happens for family reasons and there is no evidence to suggest operational commitments contribute significantly to the figures . "
There is no hard fact to suggest that our engagement in Iraq is actually causing people to leave the service
Former defence minister Don Touhig
John McDonnell , Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington told , Parliament last Monday that the number of absconders had trebled since the invasion with more soldiers " questioning the morality and legality of the occupation " .
On Sunday he insisted the numbers of British troops trying to absent themselves from service in Iraq were rising .
" My understanding is there are a lot more seeking to avoid service , through different mechanisms , " he said .
I am approached regularly by people who are seeking to absent themselves from service
Justin Hugheston - Roberts
" I think what the MoD is saying flies in the face of all the other evidence and the experience of soldiers on the ground . "
But former defence minister Don Touhig told BBC Radio Five Live there were no " hard facts " to suggest the Iraq conflict was prompting increased numbers to leave the forces .
' Illegal acts '
Justin Hugheston - Roberts was the solicitor for Flight Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall - Smith who was sentenced to eight months in prison for refusing to follow orders in connection with a deployment to Iraq .
He said : " I am approached regularly by people who are seeking to absent themselves from service .
There has been an increase , a definite upturn . "
Military law expert Gilbert Blades , who represents soldiers at courts martial , said the numbers leaving because of Iraq were often obscured as they were not counted as conscientious objectors .
" One ca n't help thinking that what 's behind every absence is the problem in Iraq and I would think that if the real truth was told , then the Iraq problem has contributed to a huge number of people going absent , " he told BBC Radio Five Live .
There 's a lot of dissent in the Army about the legality of war and concerns that they 're spending too much time there
Ben Griffin
Former SAS member Ben Griffin was allowed to leave the military after telling his commanding officer he was not prepared to return to Iraq because of what he believed were illegal acts being carried out by US forces .
Mr Griffin would never have considered deserting but says his views are shared by many others in the British military .
He told the BBC : " There 's a lot of dissent in the Army about the legality of war and concerns that they 're spending too much time there . "
Major General Patrick Cordingley , who commanded the 7th Armoured Brigade " Desert Rats " in the first Gulf war , said servicemen 's views on Iraq prompted some to leave but " good leadership " would stop it reaching epidemic proportions .
He said those who had been to Iraq before or whose families were unhappy about them going were among those who might not want to serve there .
" If you have such a person in your unit you have to discuss things with them ... you do not necessarily want people with you if they have that particular view , " he added .
You ’ve got a company of ten , somebody decides to leave .
You ’ve got a company of 60,000 , somebody decides to leave .
Which company gets the most benefit out of an exit interview ?
Which company should do an exit interview ?
After talking with a number of former Microsoft folks , I circled back to them as well as adding some others to the mix as a look see into this whole notion of former employees , the value of , etc .
The longest was a MFST guy that did a 15 + year tour of duty , the shortest being a 10 month process at one of our portfolio companies .
All left on ‘ good terms ’ or they resigned vs. being overtly fired .
For me , there were no surprises .
IBM / Sun/Microsoft / Intel all started these interview with a reminder / review of the confidentiality agreement .
Right out of the gate .
Everybody got the COBRA briefing ( Cobra , for non -US folks , is the law that allows you to pay for your own benefits at the group rate , unsubsidized , for a set period of time .
Designed to keep you from having zero health benefits immediately ) .
Everybody got reminders of vesting issues , if any , and the checklist of what not to steal , err , reminders of what to turn in .
As I said , exactly what I suspected .
Here ’s what nobody got .
Free software .
Employee discounts for 6 months , or a thank you .
Over 15 years of service , last words are , yeah , bummer , I might quit too but , hey good luck to ya .
If you assume 500 people a year leave , say Microsoft , that ’s 500 people going some place else that should be 500 people talking up , using , and still being involved in , at a minimum , cheer leading from the side .
Or at least there is the possibility of those folks being ‘ on your side ’ , if I can phrase it that way .
This is just a talent going to waste .
Here is my take on the Microsoft ( or other ) Exit interview checklist with the lessons for you and your company , regardless of size .
1 . Do the interview yourself until you hit 100 people
If you tell me you are too busy to do this , you ’ve got a turnover problem .
Do n’t get all anal on the number , you get the concept .
Clearly , Bill / Steve can ’t / wo n’t do it , but , get some people that are n’t in HR ( when you have an HR Department ) to do this .
Not the person ’s boss ( Duh ) , but others .
Like , say Robert Scoble doing Mini-Microsoft ’s exit interview .
Now , that ’s an exit interview .
Get your most vocal , kool - aid drinking , troops ( just kidding , Robert ) and let them get the unvarnished stuff .
And report on it to the management team .
Hey , we lost a person X because he did n’t feel like his code mattered .
Here that enough , unfiltered from the HR drones and maybe , just maybe it gets heard .
No shot at HR intended .
HR has a process role to play but there is no way , in my opinion a HR person can hear , really hear what a good coder leaving is really saying about the why .
And the why matters .
2. Say Thank You .
First words spoken at an exit interview .
Thank you for working here and contributing , all of us appreciate it .
And mean it .
Say thank you .
3 . If a re-hire , then give them a priority “ come on back ” pass .
After you say thank you , simply say , if you decide to come back , here is the priority way to go right to the head of the line .
How hard is this ?
If you are a ten person team , give them your home phone number .
If you are a Microsoft , create a priority system for these folks to get immediately noticed , interviewed , and dealt with .
Folks with 3 , 5 , 10 , 15 + years of experience ?
Good people ?
American Airlines , after you hit a million miles flown , you get Advantage Gold Status forever .
A tiny bit of special treatment forever .
This is a non-cost , easy thing to do and will mean something to people .
4 . Free software / services / equipment for over X number of years .
If you ’ve been at Microsoft for over 5 years and you leave in good standing , you get a year of MSDN and a year to use the company store to get stuff .
Again , how hard is this ?
Back to my 500 people a year , gee , seems to make sense to have 500 people a year going off to other companies armed with Microsoft stuff ; who knows , they might inject a little into that new whatever company they are doing / going to .
Cost is a bunch of DVDs .
If you are IBM , after 5 years ( or ten ) , a thinkpad at cost or a Notes package for your start up , whatever , you get the point .
For your company , think about what you can give your former employees so they can continue to spread the word and feel the love .
Case in point .
Dave Winer supporting Doc Searls and Robert Scoble with the blogs .
Nothing to it and the love just keeps on flowing .
Dave is a great guy and a friend to both but that notwithstanding , it make solid business sense .
Scoble as a former employee , good business sense , Doc being helped out , also simply good business sense .
Do you think Symantec is still giving Winer code drops / product for free ?
Probably not .
A check every now and again , yeah fine , pesky detail , but you get my point .
I do n’t think Marc Canter is still getting free stuff from Macromedia .
And so it goes .
5. Keep a connection .
Give your former employees and email address and put em in an alias for the former employees ( again , all assuming good standing ) .
It ’s one domain and simple Linux , err , exchange box .
@fmrmsft.com or @fmrYourcompany.com , etc. Simple , cheap , single point of contact to talk , reach out , etc , to a group of people that , at one time , roamed your halls .
Mike Maples , to this day ( and to the best of my knowledge ) still has a Microsoft email address , he is that well thought of .
There is a big / smart lesson in that for you .
6. Respect
Over and over again , I hear about former IBM / Sun / Microsoft people after having spent 10 + years at the company being treated like some goober a the county fair pie eating contest .
Here ’s an extra special message to the 26 year old that I had the pleasure of meeting with in Redmond .
I and three other former folks that represented about 25 years of MS time .
Put away the smart phone , get your feet off the table , stop slumping , and remember that all three of us were coding for a living when you were crawling up to Cafe Mommy for a swig .
It is a fundamental mistake to think you used to be one of us and now you ’re not .
It ’s just bad .
Respect will get you armies of people you are n’t paying for , perspective you probably need , and help you wo n’t have to ask for .
Respect , its not just for breakfast anymore .
The U.S. Military has this down pat .
If you wore the uniform , you are always part of the family .
And the Marines have it tuned to a fine art .
Your company needs to be built like that .
The few , the proud , the 37signals machine , the icerocket rangers , Team Technorati , whatever .
All of these companies are growing or will grow .
All of them will have former employees , veterans if you will .
Think about how this impacts your company and what you are doing about it today .
This is n’t a slam on Microsoft or any other company , rather a good lesson for you and your company , large or small .
Good people move on for lots of reasons and assuming bad stuff was n’t the prime reason , it makes good sense to retain some value in that relationship .
Democrats say the report weakens Mr Bush 's case for war
The finding is contained in a 2005 CIA report released by the Senate 's Intelligence Committee on Friday .
US President George W Bush has said that the presence of late al - Qaeda leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi in Iraq before the war was evidence of a link .
Opposition Democrats are accusing the White House of deliberate deception .
They say the revelation undermines the basis on which the US went to war in Iraq .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says that the US president has again and again tried to connect the war , which most Americans think was a mistake , with the so - called war on terror , which has the support of the nation .
The report comes as Mr Bush makes a series of speeches on the " war on terror " to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the 11 September attacks .
Requests rejected
The report is the second part of the committee 's analysis of pre-war intelligence .
The first dealt with CIA failings in its assessment of Iraq 's weapons programme .
The committee concluded that the CIA had evidence of several instances of contacts between the Iraqi authorities and al - Qaeda throughout the 1990s but that these did not add up to a formal relationship .
It added that the government " did not have a relationship , harbour or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi and his associates " .
It said that Iraq and al - Qaeda were ideologically poles apart .
" Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al - Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime , refusing all requests from al - Qaeda to provide material or operational support , " it said .
The Senate report added that the Iraqi regime had repeatedly rejected al - Qaeda requests for meetings .
It also deals with the role played by inaccurate information supplied by Iraqi opposition groups in the run-up to the war .
' Devastating indictment '
Democrats said the White House was still trying to make the connection between the former Iraqi leader and al - Qaeda in an attempt to justify the war in Iraq .
Less than three weeks ago Mr Bush said in a speech that " Saddam Hussein ... had relations with Zarqawi " .
Democrat Senator Carl Levin described the report as a " devastating indictment " of these attempts .
White House spokesman Tony Snow told the Associated Press news agency the report contained " nothing new " .
" In 2002 and 2003 , members of both parties got a good look at the intelligence we had and they came to the very same conclusions about what was going on , " he said .

Welcome to TTL ( the Tiny Template Library )
Download
For discussions about the library , support or feature requests , use the mailing list .
If you 'd like to contribute , please e-mail the project admin .
Overview
The Tiny Template Library ( TTL ) is a C++ template library for generic programming .
The main objective is to develop a lightweight practical alternative to some of the Boost components .
TTL started as an experiment during the development of Notus , a GUI template library .
TTL was heavily influenced by Boost .
As much as possible we try to support the Boost interfaces and semantic .
In most cases switching between Boost and TTL should be as easy as switching headers and namespaces .
For example
# if defined ( __USE_BOOST_VARIANT__ )
# include " boost/variant.hpp "
# define VAR boost
#else
# include " ttl/var/variant.hpp "
# define VAR ttl::var
#endif
VAR :: variant < int , char > v( 1 ) ;
Note : the comments about boost and ttl reflect our experience with boost v1.31.0 and TTL v1.0 .
Installation
Download
The whole library resides in headers files only .
There is nothing to be built or installed , just copy the TTL files into one of you folders and and make sure that this folder is in the list of include folders in your compiler .
You can then include TTL headers as in the following example .
#include " ttl/var/variant.hpp "
Boost does n't have a consistent approach to the memory management .
Some classes use allocators , while others use global new / delete .
Boost does n't have a consistent exception handling policy .
I would argue that some of the classes are not safe .
For instance some components use try / catch ( ... ) internally catching all possible exceptions that might happen on the system and so triggering the stack unwinding in a potentially unsafe environment .
Long compilation times even for seemingly simple classes .
I did n't want to link to a static library to get a simple signal - like functionality .
A heavy use of macros and # if / #else clauses make it very difficult to read and debug boost sources .
One of the Boost 's objectives is to support as many compilers as possible including non-compliant compilers such as MSVC v6.0 .
The result is that there are many flavors of the same object that are separated by nested # if / #else blocks such as // real C++ version is already taken care of
# if defined ( BOOST_NO_TEMPLATE_PARTIAL_SPECIALIZATION )
Design Notes
One of the main objectives is a compact and readable implementation .
The library requires a relatively compliant compiler .
As for now , we test TTL on two compilers , MSVC v7.1 and GCC v3.2.3 .
If you are still using MSVC v6.0 , please come back after you get rid of it .
One definition
All classes have only one definition .
For example if a definition compiles on MSVC v7.1 but not GCC 3.2.3 , we 'll choose to change the definition instead of adding # if defined ( _MSC_VER ) block .
Memory Management
TTL will never use global new / delete .
All memory allocations / deallocations will be done with a user defined allocator or allocator defined in ttl : : mem:: memtraits class .
Exception Handling
TTL never throws an exception type other than derived from the ttl : : exception class .
The library will never attempt to catch all exceptions with catch ( ... ) .
Internally the library is allowed to catch std:: exception derived exceptions only .
Sample
To build the sample , make sure to set TTL_ROOT environment variable to your TTL folder .
The sample is located in the samples / test folder .
When ran , it should output
int event : 10
double event : 2.3
The sample source code :
# if defined ( _MSC_VER )
# include < crtdbg.h > // just to generate the memory dump
#endif
#include < iostream >
#include " ttl/func/function.hpp "
#include " ttl/sig/signal.hpp "
#include " ttl/var/variant.hpp "
namespace VAR=ttl::var ;
namespace SIG=ttl::sig ;
namespace SIG_CON=ttl::sig ;
namespace FUNC=ttl::func ;
typedef ttl:: sig:: connection connection ;
// define event type
typedef VAR :: variant < double , int > event ;
struct event_visitor
{
void operator ( ) ( int x )
{
std :: cout <<" int event : " < < x < < "
" ;
}
void operator ( ) ( double x )
{
std :: cout <<" double event : " < < x << "
" ;
}
} ;
void event_callback ( event& ev )
{
event_visitor v ;
VAR ::apply_visitor( v , ev ) ;
}
main ( )
{
# if defined ( _MSC_VER )
_CrtSetDbgFlag ( _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF
| _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF ) ;
#endif
// create signal and connections
SIG :: signal < void ( event& ) > sig ;
connection con = sig.connect ( event_callback ) ;
event ev( 10 ) ;
sig( ev ) ;
ev = 2.3 ;
sig( ev ) ;
//disconnect
con.disconnect ( ) ;
}
The flg namspace contains :
flags
flag_mapper
ttl : : flg::flags
flags <> provides a type safe and generic way to handle collections of flags that are usually defined as bitfields
template < typename T , // flags type usuall enumeration int Bits = sizeof ( int ) * 8 , // number of bits typename Holder = typename impl : : bestfit :: type //hold combinations of flags > struct flags { typedef flags this_t ; typedef T value_type ; Holder f_ ; flags ( ) ; flags ( T f1 , T f2 , ... ) ; //intializes to f1|f2 ... Holder get_holder ( ) const ; bool test ( const this_t& ) const ; // applies operator & to the holders bool test ( ) const { return f_!=0 ; } } ;
Usage
The flags <> class supports all bitwise and logical operatos .
// define some flags struct winstyle { enum type { CAPTION = 1 , BORDER = 1 < < 1 , size = 2 // the last used bit } ; } ; typedef flags < winstyle > winstyle_flags ; void set_style ( winstyle_flags style ) { if ( style.test ( winstyle :: CAPTION ) ) ... do something about CAPTION } main ( ) { // initialize to winstyle :: BORDER|winstyle::CAPTION
winstyle_flags f( winstyle :: BORDER , winstyle : : CAPTION ) ; set_style ( f ) ; }
ttl::flg::flag_mapper
The TTL has a function for mapping one set of flags to another set .
For instance if we need to map our winstyle flags to Win32 WS_CAPTION and WS_BORDER .
struct flag_map { std::multimap < std::pair<winstyle_flags , int > > map ; flag_map ( ) { if ( init_ ) { init_ = false ; // initialize only once map_.insert ( winstyle :: CAPTION , WS_CAPTION ) ; map_.insert ( winstyle :: BORDER , WS_BORDER ) ; } } static bool init_ ; static map map_ ; } void set_style ( winstyle_flags style ) ; main ( ) { flag_map map ; set_style ( winstyle_flags ( winstyle : : CAPTION , winstyle :: BORDER ) ) } void set_style ( winstyle_flags style ) { // map our flags to Win32 int style = ttl::flg::flag_mapper( flag_map.map_.begin( ) , flag_map.map_.end ( ) , style ) ; :: CreateWindow ( ... style ) ; //use Win32 function with ' style ' :) }
The tup namespace implements tuple .
Its semantic is very similar to boost : : tuples .
However the implementation concepts are quite different .
The tup namespace contains the following symbols :
tuple <>
get < >
length <>
element <>
The maximum number of fields in tuple is defined by the TTL_MAX_TUPLE_PARAMS macro in config.h
Usage
ttl :: tup::tuple<int , double > my_tuple ;
my_tuple t( 1 , 2.3 ) ;
int n = ttl ::tup:get<0>( t ) ;
double x = ttl :: tup:get<1>( t ) ;
int l = ttl : : tup::length<my_tuple >:: value ;
assert ( l==2 ) ;
ttl::tup::element<N , Tuple >:: type //type of the Nth element in Tuple .
ttl::meta
The meta namespace provides a small set of meta programming facilities .
typlist <>
get < >
type_switch <>
ttl:: meta::typelist
typelist is is a list of types that is specified as a set of template parameters .
typelist < int , char > is a list of ' int ' and ' char ' types .
typelist is very efficient .
It is implemented as a plain set of typedefs .
It does n't have the overhead associated with nested templates as in some more popular implementations that use cons<H , cons < H , ...> > or duo < H , duo < H , ...> > kind of techniques .
There is a number of meta functions that operate on typelists .
ttl:: meta::get<L , N >
typedef typelist < int , char > list ;
get <list , 0 >:: type //returns int
get <list , 1 >:: type //returns char
Since typelist is a plain list , get <> can be implemented as a constant time random access enumerator .
template < typename T > struct get<T , 0 >
{
enum { index = 0 } ;
typedef typename T :: type1 type ;
} ;
template < typename T > struct get<T , 1 >
{
enum { index = 1 } ;
typedef typename T :: type2 type ;
} ;
...
ttl:: meta::type_switch
type_switch is a run-time switch - like function on typelists .
struct my_functor
{
template < typename T >
void operator ( ) ( ) { ... do something }
} ;
typedef typelist < int , char > list ;
void f()
{
int type = 0 ;
my_functor f ;
type_switch < list > ts ;
ts ( type ) ; //calls my_functor::operator ( ) < int >( ) ;
type = 1 ;
ts ( type ) ; //calls my_functor::operator ( ) < char >( ) ;
type = 2 ;
ts ( type ) ; //run -time exception
}
func namespace contains :
The ttl : : func:: function is very similar to boost : : function ( see Sample ) .
Comments
I was scared by the complexity of the boost : : function implementation for such a basic class .
Just including " boost/function.hpp " ( 10 parameters limit ) adds about 4 sec in compilation time on my machine while including " ttl/func/function.hpp " ( the same limit ) does n't appear to have any noticeable impact on the compilation time .
named_params_function <> can be used to to convert any function into a functor with named parameters .
The declaration consists of pairs ( parameter name , parameter type ) .
Here is an example .
#include " ttl/func/named_params_function.hpp " // there is a C function that is implemented somewhere .
// int CreateWidget ( const char * title , int style ) ; // define argument names // struct title ; struct style ; // declare a function that returns ' int ' and accepts // named paramters ' title ' and ' style ' typedef ttl:: func::named_params_function < int // the function returns ' int ' ( //' argument name ' , ' argument type ' title , const char* , style , numeric_argument <int , 45 > // the default is 45 ) > create_widget ; int main ( ) { create_widget cw( CreateWidget ) ; // call with ' style ' 3 and title ' nill ' cw ( cw.arg < style >
( 3 ) ) ; // call with ' title ' " hi " and ' style ' 45 cw ( cw.arg < title > ( " hi " ) ) ; // call with ' title ' " hi " and ' style ' 5 // note the order of parameters does n't matter only names cw ( cw.arg < style > ( 5 ) , cw.arg < title > ( " hi " ) ) ; return 0 ; } ;
create_widget <> can be used with any function or method that have the specified signature .
You can find a working sample for class members in samples / test/named_params_test.cpp .
The sample used boost : : bind for bindind class members .
The var namespace contains
variant <>
apply_visitor <>
get < >
ttl ::var::variant
ttl : : var :: variant has almost the same interface as boost : : variant including unary and binary visitors .
variant cannot include ' const ' types .
variant <>:: list is the typelist <> class composed of of the variant types .
Comments
There are following differences between ttl variant and boost variant .
ttl : : var :: variant can be in an uninitialized ( singular ) state .
ttl :: var:: variant becomes singular if it has not been initialized or there was an exception ( see section on exceptions ) during assignment .
On the other hand boost : : variant always contains a user defined type .
If the assignment fails the content of boost : : variant might be changed under the covers to a default - constrictable value .
boost :: variant visitors cannot assume that the variant content has not been changed by the variant internally .
ttl : : var:: variant visitors simply wo n't be called if the variant is in singular state .
In other words if a visitor is called , the variant content is guaranteed be valid ( that was set by the user ) .
ttl : : var :: variant visitors are not required to be derived from another class like boost : : variant visitors need to be derived from boost : : variant :: static_visitor .
ttl visitors cannot return a value .
This limitation has a simple workaround with a wrapper class .
int visitor ( my_type& x ) ;
struct visitor_wrapper
{
int return_value ;
void operator ( ) ( my_type& x )
{
return_value = visitor(x ) ;
}
} ;
variant < my_type& > var ;
visitor_wrapper vw ;
apply_visitor ( var , vw ) ;
int r = vw.return_value ;
We are planning to generalize such a wrapper latter .
In some cases boost : : variant will allocate heap memory dynamically , ttl : : var : : variant never does that .
ttl : : var :: variant implementation is very simple .
The sig namspace contains :
signal
connection
ttl::sig::signal
tll : : sig:: signal provides a very similar functionality to boost : : signal .
Although ttl : : sig:: signal has a more basic interface comparing to boost : : signal , we believe that ttl : : sig:: signal is a better choice for wide range of applications where the advanced features of boost : : signal are not needed .
For a sample code , see Sample
Comments
ttl : : sig::signal calls connections in the order they created .
Comparison with boost : : signal
ttl : : sig::signal has a much better compilation time performance .
ttl : : sig::signal has a very simple implementation that resides in header files only .
There is no need for a dynamic or static libraries .
ttl : : sig::signal supports plain functions directly while it appears that boost : : signal requires functors ( see Sample ) .
The following boost : : signal features are not supported .
boost : : signals groups .
boost : : signals combiners .
trackable objects .
So when a connected object is destroyed , all its connections must be implicitly closed .
boost : : signals::scoped_connection
Note : we believe that all these features can be implemented using ttl : : sig:: signal as a low - level building block .
Sales of air - conditioning units boomed during the July heatwave that saw many areas of northern Europe enduring record - breaking temperatures .
Such units keep people cool , but the carbon dioxide they churn out could wreck attempts to meet Kyoto protocol targets , says a report by the London - based Association for the Conservation of Energy ( ACE ) .
The UK government is hoping that energy - efficient housing will cut the country ’s CO 2 emissions in 2020 by 5.5 million tonnes .
The scheme is one of the central planks in the country ’s strategy for meeting Kyoto protocol targets , and is particularly important because residential energy use has been growing at 1 per cent a year – about three times the rate of the commercial sector .
But the ACE report , released this week , predicts that by 2020 emissions of CO 2 from domestic air conditioners could hit 4.9 million tonnes per year .
The study assumes that as global warming sends temperatures soaring , Europeans will come to expect the same level of comfort as people in the US , where two - thirds of homes have air conditioning , compared with 5 per cent in Europe .
In the UK , ACE predicts this will rise to 16 per cent of homes by 2020 , concentrated in southern England , where a whopping 84 per cent of homes are expected to have air conditioning , says Anson Wu , one of the study ’s authors .
Neighbouring countries such as France , Germany and the Netherlands are likely to see even faster growth in air conditioning because the continental climate has greater extremes of temperature .
The best way for healthy people to cope with hot weather is to use blinds to keep out the sun during the day and to open windows at night , says Wu .
If you must have air - conditioning , avoid mobile units with exhaust hoses that have to be put out of the window .
“ That just lets in the hot air . ”

Terry Dix , a ventilation specialist with the international civil - engineering consultancy Arup , says we should avoid domestic air conditioning completely .
“ That should be readily achievable . ”

Chris Anderson did a masterful job of identifying and defining The Long Tail back in 2004 in a Wired Article .
What i havent seen yet is a definition of when content crosses over from being part of the long tail , and onto the Vert Ramp ( The perfect term to steal from skateboarding ) .
I think trying to define where the Long Tail ends and the Vert Ramp begins is critical , because the fact of the matter is : No Content Creator wants to be on the Long Tail .
Anyone who has ever created content realizes that there is a very thick bar a bit above the the base of the Vert Ramp that acts as a content ceiling ( thanks to Oliver Luckett for the term ) .
that they are desperately trying to break through in order to get off the long tail and on to the Vert Ramp .
The illustration reflects my horrendous paint skills , but illustrates the point .
The concept of the content ceiling recognizes that there is a hierarchy that each content creator tries to work their way up .
First content providers , whether podcasters , vloggers , bloggers , movie makers , writers , poets , whatever the content type make the decision of the creation of the content is about love or money .
Is the goal of the finished product commercial , or purely personal ?
If the goal is commercial , whether to make money directly or indirectly from the content , then the battle to fight through the Content Ceiling begins .
The bottom line is that people want to get paid for their work .
Creators have a vision .
They think there is something special about it , and they want to get rewarded for their effort .
Its a simple goal in concept , but its incredibly difficult to achieve .
Very few commercial content creators aspire to get 10 k aggregate views from all the videohosting sites .
Very few bands are happy with having 10 k free downloads , or even 10 k friends on Myspace as their endgame .
Very few commercial content creators aspire to see their creations end up on Community Access TV .
All content creators recognize each of these as a way to create incremental demand for their content , in hopes of breaking through the Content Ceiling , but none of these will reward the content creator with direct revenue .
For content creators trying to make a living from their work , they all just represent the Long Tail Ghetto .
The first step towards the Vert Ramp and up the hierarchy is to get paid .
More and more sites like Revver are creating opportunities for video creators to make money , just as sites like WeedShare.com and CDBaby.com have been doing for music for years .
The reality however are very , very few make minimum wage for their work .
If a content creator gets paid for their work , that by itself put them out of the longail of the longtail .
Thats how difficult it is .
The next step up the hierachy comes from breaking out at least once .
You got paid enough for your work to think you or your company have a chance to create content full time .
It may be a one time reward , or just the first of many rewards .
But as long as its just one so far , you are still in the long tail .
Still underneath the content ceiling looking up at the Vert Ramp , but at least you lost your financial virginity .
Its for those that have gotten paid that the content ceiling really becomes an issue .
At this point , the content creator has had a taste of some level of success and the pressure is on not only to recreate that success in some manner , but also to gain financially from it .
Are you a 1 hit wonder , or a meal ticket ?
At this point , in order to fight through the content ceiling almost all content creators look to Big Money for help .
Big Money is / are all the people and companies that control distribution and have big bank accounts .
They are the people who can elevate the content creators from fearing their lights will be off when they get home , to buying a new house .
For all the talk of the internet changing distribution , the reality is that in order to break through the Content Ceiling and to climb the Vert Ramp , 99.9 pct of content creators are going to do need OPM ( Other Peoples Money ) .
The internet alone is not going to get the job done .
You can put your content everywhere and anywhere the net allows you to be hosted , but for most people the amount of revenues for that content you had before you started the hosting process will be the exact same as what you have after the hosting process .
This is exactly why media celebrates when someone is discovered on Youtube , or when a contest winner is given a budget to produce a broadband show , or possibly even a TV show for a cable network .
They broke out from poverty to primetime .
This is exactly why they said yes to production deals and financing .
They know that they cant break through the content ceiling without the help .
Revver and its peers are working hard to change this , but its far from there .
Its not that signing a deal with a Big Money company guarantees that you will sell enough of your content to break onto the VertRamp .
It certainly doesnt .
There are plenty of failures with Big Money behind them .
However , regardless of content type , if Big Money invests enough of their money and distribution , you chances of being on the VertRamp have increased exponentially .
If you do a deal with Big Money , AND your content sells enough to be on the Vert Ramp of content sales in your genre , you have broken through the content ceiling .
The chances are very good that BigMoney will want to work with you again .
They have made money from their investment in you .
Success breeds success .
They will probably come back to you and give you another shot to stay above the content ceiling and climb higher up the Vert Ramp
Once you as a creator have broken through the content ceiling and are on the Vert Ramp , the rules of the game get interesting .
In fact , the success of your work , is far more dependeng on Big Money than it is on you .
The further up the ramp ( unless you reach the very top ) , the less influence you have in the success of your content .
The competition on the Vert Ramp is cut throat .
Big Money vs Big Money with enormous stakes .
They dont want your help .
They want to be Big Money and do what Big Money does .
They try to make as much money as possible .
Every Big Money company wants everyone of their products to reach the very top of the Vert Ramp .
To be # 1 in sales , ratings , viewers , whatever their critical metric is .
This is an important definition at this point in time .
With all the discussion of the value of views and listens on the internet , it raises the question of just how valuable is a view or listen to a product / company with a product on the Vert Ramp .
The first distinction that needs to be made is a view / listen that Big Money creates versus one that a user creates for Big Money content .
Big Money created views / listens are controlled to the liking of Big Money .
You only see or hear what they want you to see or hear .
So we dont have to identify value there .
They do that internally before the content is posted .
User Created uploads of Big Money content , infringing content a user uploads content that belongs to someone else on to a hosting site for open consumption is a different story .
A lot of people feel that user uploads of infringing content is always a good thing .
its new or incremental viewership .
Its a new fan for a TV show .
Its possibly a revenue share o
f advertising .
All would seem to be positive .
However they are not always positive .
A revenue share might seem great , until you realize that the videohost selling advertising around The Daily Show is competing with the Comedy Central sales force that is selling ads on the TV show , in the cable VOD , on the ComedyCentral.com website , on the mobile distribution of the show , etc , etc .
It may also be competing for viewers , with the revenue per user from their website split being lower than what they earn for ads on the TV show itself .
This is a simple example .
You can find examples of how it helps and how it hurts for any piece of infringing content .
But the real question is ;
At what point does the copyright owner , usually Big Money , step in and say that they dont want their content being uploaded by users ?
Here is a way to get an idea when .
I think there is a correlation between the Vert Ramp and the value of “ views ” on video hosting sites , or listens on illegal download sites .
In fact they are inversions of each other .
Each company has an expectation of where their content will fall on the Vert Ramp .
They have a point they consider failure .
They have a point they consider break even .
They have a point they consider good , not great .
They have a point where its a success .
Each is a higher and higher point up the Vert Ramp .
If we were to graph that point on the Vert Ramp , the higher up the Vert Ramp the performance is , the less value there is to views of infringing uploaded content .
In addition , the higher up the Vert Ramp the performance is , the more likely BIg Money will go after the infringer or host to take down the infringing content .
The reason is obvious .
The more successful the content , the more confidence Big Money has in its ability to optimize the value of the content to their organization .
The more control Big Money wants over every aspect of the content .
Infringing content creates risk to them that can negatively impact value ( an exclusive interview on a super popular syndicated talk show that airs at different times around the country ) .
Its not that they always will .
Maybe
Fox likes the idea of American Idol videos around the net .
I dont know .
But i do know that they likelihood that they will have questioned it is much higher than say from the producers of a tv show that is underperforming or at risk of cancellation .
The more expectations of performance are achieved , the less value a view or listen online is .
On the flipside of course , the lower on the Vert Ramp , the more value of every listen or view .
Big Money content that is not meeting expectations lets users do whatever they want with their content in hopes of increasing their metrics past the failure , then break even points .
So it wont be unusual to see one company allow content from one show to slide under the radar in terms of copyright violation , while pumping out takedown notices for another show .
I think its an interesting discussion .
What is the long tail .
What happens when content gets off .
What happens to the people who are on it .
what is the impact of the internet .
Is the only way out of the Internet Long Tail ghetto to work with Big Money ?
Time will tell .
Coming From Microsoft : ' Hosted Everything '
Within a year , Microsoft plans to offer hosted implementations of SharePoint as well as its CRM and ERP applications .
Microsoft wants to get into hosting -- in big and small ways .
Within a year , the Redmond , Wash .- based company plans to offer hosted implementations of SharePoint as well as CRM and ERP applications , several sources said .
A handful of service partners now host Microsoft applications for customers ; the difference is future customers could choose Microsoft or a partner to run the infrastructure .
Microsoft declined to comment on specific hosting plans .
However , Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates hinted at the strategy in an interview with CRN last month .
" Share Point today runs primarily on premises .
We have some partners who are doing hosted SharePoint .
We are looking at what our role is in helping people with SharePoint , ” Gates said Microsoft ’s Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles .
“ So technologically , the server equals service thing year by year is making good progress . "
SharePoint Portal Server and Windows SharePoint Services act as the linchpin for most of Microsoft 's current and planned collaboration products and services .
Microsoft 's acquisition of Groove Networks last year brought the software giant the expertise it needed to bolster the security and reach of such collaboration beyond and between corporate firewalls .
And Gates stressed in the interview that regardless of where the software runs -- on premises or " in the cloud " -- partners with domain expertise and other knowledge will be needed for implementation help .
However Microsoft proceeds , the company knows it must explore new software and service delivery modes .
Microsoft faces rising competition from vendors like Salesforce.com and NetSuite on the CRM / ERP front , yet by moving ahead with hosting Microsoft also could end up taking on longtime partners that host Microsoft software .
Microsoft officials have told partners that the company ’s hosting offerings will be " revenue - neutral " to them .
Presumably , that means partners would sell and even customize applications for customers that could run on Microsoft servers .
Next week in San Francisco , Gates and Ray Ozzie , one of Microsoft 's CTOs , are slated to talk more about the company ' software - as - a - service push .
Ozzie , the former chairman of Groove Networks , has been charged with leading Microsoft ’s charge in this area .
This week at another San Francisco event , Ozzie said the company will rely on experience gleaned from its MSN online service .
Microsoft ’s hosting push is expected to target the gamut of users -- including small companies with five to 10 PCs and no dedicated IT staff -- who may want to do things like share calendar items but not worry about how that is accomplished .
A hosted SharePoint could become the basis for a variety of such services .
Outsourced e-mail for companies of all sizes also would be big .
" How much competitive advantage does e-mail give any company ?
Would n't those internal IT resources be better deployed elsewhere ? " said one Microsoft source , who asked not to be named .
Microsoft has been investigating ways to ease e-mail deployments and migrations by internal IT departments and to make e-mail more easily supported outside the firewall .

what does this have to do with web programming frameworks ?
Do all your programming in one language !
Not know SQL !
Let the framework handle database / SQL optimization !
Let the framework build your database for you !
Update your model classes based on any schema changes you make !

the solution ...
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD STATUS statusname LEADS TO subsequent_statusname1 , subsequent_statusname2 , ...
conclusion
Anyone who has been around the web programming world ( or any programming world , really ) has no doubt realized that there is n't a whole lot to what we do ; basically , we create pretty forms and screens that manipulate data in some sort of database and return formatted results to the end user .
Input goes in , processing happens , and output comes out .
There are many different languages used to express this , but the underlying formula remains the same .
Now , programming is a very individualist exercise .
We are generally a pretty talented group ( at least in our own minds ) , and understanding the above formula often leads us to believe that we can somehow streamline the process so that creating a new web application takes much less code than it currently does in whatever platform we are using .
And in this we are right ; everybody who does this professionally comes up with their own framework or CMS system that they think is the cat 's meow and purrfectly ( sorry ) summarizes their view of how a web application should fit together .
Very often these systems allow us , as individuals , to spit out web applications faster .
Some of the better ones ( or better marketed ones ) can even help other people make applications faster , as long as they can live with the assumptions made by the original developer .
That said , we have myriad application frameworks out there which promise the great MVC experience , where content is perfectly separated from the presentation , designers can be designers , coders can be coders , and the world will live in perfect harmony .
Despite 10 years of this , however , we are still stuck in a world of buggy and difficult - to - maintain code .
Systems like Fusebox , Ruby on Rails , Struts , and even .
Net can all make your job a little easier if you follow their rules closely , but none are able to live up to the productivity hype which surrounds them or they would quickly jump to the front of the pack and take over the space .
Think about it .
If RoR made you 10 times as productive as .
Net , would anyone still code in .
Net ?
These systems all provide incremental improvements at best .
The reason for this is that the problem does n't lie in the web layer , but in the persistence / database layer .
Yes , databases .
I 'll get right to the point ; databases are great devices for storing tabular data , but they lack the crucial ability to represent state / time information in a uniform way .
This probably requires some explanation , so I will try to do that below .
Relational databases handle data as rows , a logical abstraction which is what makes them good for being able to store arbitrary objects ( the classes of which are represented by tables ) in a uniform way .
The problem comes in how the database can only see 3 different types of transactions on a per-row basis , the CREATE ( in which the row is created ) , the UPDATE ( any update to the row ) , and the DELETE ( where the row is removed from the table entirely ) .
For the most part , decent application design rules out ever performing DELETES ( except for in associational tables ) because it will result in a loss of rows needed for foreign key constraints , so practically speaking there are only two DML statements ever run , and one of those is only done once .
Now the database engine itself is only geared to handle these two transactions .
Columns can be declared as NOT NULL , but this is only useful for cases in which the row will ALWAYS contain data .
There is no clean way of saying ( without ridiculous check constraints or trigger logic ) that a field must always have a value when the row it is in reaches a certain point in its workflow .
Similarly , any attempt to validate data at the database level ( always a good practice if your database supports it ) will likely result in adding another ON UPDATE trigger or independent stored procedure , resulting in another complicated piece of application logic that is left to the whims of the developer coding the procedure .
Five years down the road , will anyone currently working on the project understand that STPROC_ADD_TICKNUM_U is the procedure to call that will associate a user with a problem ticket ?
Maybe or maybe not .
I would guess that 50 % of the applications out there are coded by one programmer who does things his or her own way , making naming conventions entirely arbitrary .
Most shops that specialize in development adopt systems to handle just this situation , but even those involve retraining yourself to think like the guy who first developed the system .
Let 's do a quick thought exercise to illustrate these issues .
The scenario : a typical web shopping cart , with the requirement that all of the steps of the checkout save themselves to the database so that the customer can pick up the process mid-order in case they leave the site in the middle for some reason .
The schema is simple ( and not totally normalized ) : order_id : intorder_num : varchar ( 10 ) order_date : datetimeship_date : datetimestatus : intcreate_date : datetimemod_date : datetimebill_name : varchar ( 100 ) bill_address : varchar ( 200 ) ship_name : varchar ( 100 ) ship_address : varchar ( 200 ) order_item_id : intitem_id : intprice : floatNow the workflow .
For the orders , we need to make all of the fields except for create_date and order_id nullable , since when the user is first entering data they can enter it piecemeal .
The customer said the order_num should be sequential based on the order in which the orders were , a silly restraint but one which we must deal with anyway .
The billing address , order number , and at least one item must exist when the order reaches " ordered " status , so we need to account for that somewhere .
The ship date is only entered if the order reaches the " shipped " status .
The create_date is pretty trivial in this example since it only represents the point in time that the user pressed the checkout button the first time , and the mod_date only represents the last time somebody touched the record for any reason .
We are forced to have separate fields to account for the progression dates through the various statuses , and to update those either through some kind of application logic .
Even in this trivial and everyday example , we are left with putting the bulk of our order logic withincode , notcode .
This is a critical difference , because it means the database itself has no concept of an order except for a list of possible fields it might have and therefore we can't use its powerful built - in integrity features to make sure the data stays pristine .
In place of that , we have a bunch of procedures or DML statements written by developers in whichever style they choose , which aside from being prone to error , will also be totally arbitrary and difficult for new developers to decode .
I 'd like to take a moment to talk about the art of software development .
I must say art here , because software is unlike any other type of engineering or mathematical discipline .
It is often lamented by IT companies , project managers , and customers alike that software development projects are impossible to accurately forecast in terms of time and resources needed .
This is due to the fact that regardless of language , technology stack , and even methodology , 90 % of what makes a program do interesting work is arbitrary code written by a single developer .
Even if this code follows some sort of framework , this framework is only useful in doing what the designer of the framework intended for it to do .
It is doing stuff that it wasdesigned to do that gets the developer paid .
Taking Ruby on Rails as an example , it contains handy convenience methods and conventions for creating new rows , updating mod_date fields , and even handling row locking ( provided Rails is the only thing updating the database ) .
But virtually every single statement you will write will involve some arbitrary WHERE clause , will need to SELECT rows using a JOIN and needing to skip the built - in functions because of the " id " column convention , or do some other cockimamy thing that the designers could n't include in a general purpose framework .
That is before you even get to how you choose to design and allocate functions between your various model classes , what you decide to name your functions , how you choose to design your controllers , what brand of HTML you want to use in your view layer , how you use CSS , etc .
The net result to all of this arbitrary code is that programming does n't scale very well as you add more developers to it .
Every new team member must learn what was done by those who came before in terms of both functionality and coding style , and then they will usually end up adding their own twists on top of that , making the next developer even more confused .
For a project lasting a substantial period of time you must also deal with attrition as people leave the team , and then somehow regenerating their knowledge amongst new or existing staff .
As a result of all this , programming productivity does n't increase linearly as you throw more bodies at it .
If you get productivity 1.5 from 2 programmers , it may take you 7 to get to productivity 3.0 .
And even that is assuming you hire good people .
:) Good question .
Getting back to the task at hand , the issue is that most web programming frameworks base themselves on some sort of database abstraction layer .
This is usually the source of their substantial productivity claims , since it lets you ( alternately ) While these sound nice on paper , they are often of dubious value ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) , are a bad programming practice ( 1 ) , or outright falsehoods ( 2 ) .
The bigger issue , though , is that when the database does n't let you design your schema in a way that much metadata can be extracted from it , any database abstraction layer willbe a lowest - common - denominator abstraction .
It 'sto not have to manually update your classes when you add new columns to the database , but you still need to incorporate those changes into any web forms that use the new field and any functions that need to incorporate it into the workflow .
This means still more arbitrary , single developer code .
The way to get out of this conundrum is to come up with a new version of the SQL standard that can account for status / time as a database - level entity .
We need to give rows the concept of status that is separate from a programmer - designated , arbitrary field and a batch of procedures or application language functions .
One idea would be to have anstatement which can show the order in which statuses occur .
The status that has nothing leading to it will be the initial status .
Then triggers could be created on a per-status basis , and stored procedures could be defined that are tied to moves between statuses , either to a new one or back to an old one .
Also , special syntaxes can be added for NOT NULL fields to account for the status changes .
Such a system , with some natural extensions , would provide a richer set of DDL - level data for the various frameworks to take into account when creating their model libraries , and some could even go to the lengths of making web pages templates based one what fields are available for editing on which statuses .
Over time we can evolve to the point where more logic is stored in the database / persistence layer where it belongs than in arbitrary language code .
Web development has reached a point in it is receiving diminishing returns with attempts to refine it further at the application code level .
We have long ago distilled websites into their basic elements and attempted to abstract out all that can be abstracted out , and we are left with a battery of competing standards and frameworks which differ very little from one another in anything more than syntax .
At the same time , demands for increasing productivity and faster time to market are always ringing in our ears .
The only way to fix this in a fundamental way is to add metadata that is presently being defined in an ad - hoc basis by developers into the database / persistence layer .
This will accomplish the dual objectives of giving the framework developers a richer set of data with which to abstract the database , and incorporate information presently stored in crude 3rd generation languages into an elegant 4th generation language like SQL .
Database integrity will be assured , and the world will be as one .
Until next time .
… but were afraid to ask .
One of the most common questions asked on the Business of Software board by a new aspiring uISV is “ How do I protect my software ? ”
This post is meant to be a comprehensive answer to that question , so folks can point to it and say “ Alright , now get out of my hair ! ” .
Kidding , kidding , we were all there once .
First , a brief discussion on why you want to protect your software .
The only reason you want to protect your software is to enforce the limitations you have put on the trial version .
Many people mistakenly come to the table with the assumption that protecting the software will somehow , magically , “ protect my intellectual property ” or something to that effect .
This might be theoretically true but you will have an easier time conceptualizing your registration scheme if you think of it as primarily a marketing , rather than technical , measure .
Its your salesman that encourages folks to pay you money .
Why is it important to remember your registration scheme is a salesman ?
Because salesmen do not typically kick their prospective customers where the sun does n’t shine , and many registration schemes do .
Aside from some clubs in Tokyo ( and the less you know about them , the better , really ) , people generally do n’t pay money for the privilege of being kicked .
Yet many software developers keep including Nutcracker Suite protection systems , such as Starforce , which severely harm the user experience , out of the mistaken belief that this will eventually increase profits .
If you will permit be a bit of amateur psychoanalysis , I think this is because software developers in general , and uISVs in particular , feel violated when someone is using their software illegally .
I know the feeling , it has happened to me ( and , mark my words , it will happen to you ) .
Someone who downloads your software and cracks it has n’t cost you any more money than someone who picks your door and walks around your apartment for 20 minutes without touching anything , yet the feeling that your rights have been violated is the same .
And perhaps in a fit of less - than - rational anger you might demand your apartment upgrade its security system to include dead - locks , pitbulls , a batallion of US Marines with shoot - to - kill - orders , and some cleverly disguised booby - traps involving acid or flaming oil , or perhaps just flaming acid .
Of course , the local Girl Scout troop selling cookies will probably not react too well to the fortifications ( aside from the “ cute wittle puppy ! ” ) , so if you like having cookies delivered to your door this is probably not a good idea .
So lets talk about four classes of users and how they interact with your registration scheme .
The first type of user is perfectly honest and will always comply with your licensing scheme to the letter , even if ways to circumvent your registration scheme are obvious .
Approximately everyone thinks they are this kind of user .
To this kind of user , your registration scheme ( a salesman for your software ) can be only a hindrance in getting to use the software which he happily paid for .
The second type of user is mostly honest .
He ’s not a pirate , after all , he has a wife and kids and works at an insurance company .
He scoffs at the kids on Napster who feel entitled to free music .
And yet he also will happily buy one license of your software when your license tells him he really requires five , install and uninstall a time - limited trial version every two weeks , and perhaps even reset his system clock to get around a time limitation .
But he wo n’t download a crack , no .
A crack would be stealing , and stealing is wrong .
This second type of user is where your protection ( a salesman for your software ! ) will make most of his keep .
How many of these users relative to totally honest users you have depends on your market , but sadly , they ’re a lot more common than most non-developers would think .
The third type of user wants to use your software , but will pirate it given half the chance .
Its too expensive , it does n’t do quite what he needs , he does n’t have the money , for - profit software development is evil , piracy is wrong but oh well … he has a lot of mental excuses .
Some of this user group is very technically adept at finding cracks — they know what IRC channels to go to and what shady connections to excercize .
Some of them rely on Google searches .
You can potentially wheedle a small number of sales from this group with your protection scheme , and they ’ll hate you for every minute of it .
The fourth type of user …
“ Do what you want ’cause a pirate is free , YOU ARE A PIRATE ! ”
He flies the Jolly Roger and you will never , ever make a legitimate sale to him .
Even if he does “ buy ” your software it will be with a stolen creditcard or chargebacked within 24 hours .
You ’ll find that there are countries on earth ( * cough * China * cough * ) where there are few users from any other type .
Your protection system is not really relevant to this type of user , since he ’ll be using the crack anyway .
Oh , yeah , lets talk about cracks a little bit .
You .
Will .
Be. Cracked .
I really strongly recommend you read that post , because its true : no protection scheme will survive indefinite contact with the adversary .
Your goal in instituting a protection scheme is not to achieve 0 utilization of your software by the Jolly Rogers of the world .
It is primarily to keep circumvention methods obscure enough that it will take dedicated effort to discover either a way around your software or find someone who has found a way around your software .
There are several varities of cracks which you have to worry about .
We are now crossing into the technical portion of this article , and will be discussing implementation details rather than philosophy , so pay attention .
1 ) A single good key .
The cracker discovers , either via a “ legitimate ” purchase or analyzing your code , one single good key , and publishes it .
This is the least damaging type of crack , because you can just ban that key in further updates to your software , and because if you use keys which are tied to other user data it will prevent someone from using the good key without otherwise impersonating the user it is tied to .
2 ) Keygen , or “ key generators ” .
You have one of these lying around on your PC or server which generates good keys for your software .
The cracker ’s goal is not to replicate your system , but instead write one which produces at least some subset of the keys your system will produce .
Many crackers prefer to write keygens because they get a psychological thrill out of “ beating ” you , but to most user groups there is no difference between one download and another .
3 ) A patch / crack which strips off your protection .
For example , if you leave in a debug mode ( if ( ! debug ) { checkRegistrationKey ( ) ;} else { registered = true ;} ) , all the patch has to do is modify your executable to flip the debug bit and then your software is locked into the registered version .
Creating a patch requires that your executable be a stable binary , as if the offsets of the bits to flip change applying an old patch will be impossible .
4 ) A cracked executable .
This is the cracker ’s least favorite method , because then he has to spend non-trivial amounts of bandwidth hosting the executable , and since he wants to host literally tens of thousands of executables this is irksome to him .
However , remember , bandwidth is cheap — this is a speed bump , not a security mechanism .
In general , it is to your advantage to force the adversary to use countermeasures which are higher up that list .
This means that your protection scheme should :
1 ) Require user - specific data so that a single good registration key does not break your software everywhere .
The most obvious choice is username , but this is not very secure .
Other popular choices include hard drive serial numbers , MAC addresses , GUIDs , etc . Remember , this will inconvinience legitimate users — you will have users who spell their name differently on their Paypal accounts versus in your software ( example : McKenzie !=
Mckenzie has gotten my mother a few times , Bob Smith versus Robert Smith ) , you will have users who expect ( and are perhaps , depending on your license , entitled ) to use the software both at work and at home , you will have users whose hard drive dies and your software will cease to work on the new one .
All of these become support issues for you , because your salesman is busy trodding on the toes of people who have already given you money .
Consider carefully how much pain you will authorize him to inflict .
For myself , I thought the risk of a serial key leaking was less than the amount of difficulty I would have policing unique serials , so while I ask folks for their name to generate my keys they ’ll actually work for any name you put in ( Shh , do n’t tell the crackers 🙂 ) .
2 ) Obfuscate your code .
Especially if you are using an interpreted language , such as .NET or Java , decompilers exist which will print out your protection routines in their entirety .
This was how my very first hacked in version 1.0 happened , and that resulted in a keygen ( i.e. total tactical victory for the bad guys ) .
I ’ve since started using ProGuard , a lovely OSS utility which takes your nice , easily decompileable JAR file and returns gibberish which still executes .
This plus a ( partial , backwards compatible ) fix for the earlier keygen has kept me from getting hit with another wave of me hearties from China , although I know of at least one functioning keygen out there — but its buried beyond the reach of my casual pirate customers , which is a total strategic victory for me .
Obfuscation is nice in that unless you need reflection or debugging stack traces it ca n’t hurt a legitimate user .
3 ) Change binaries early and often .
Frequently changing your binary , via any method you want ( obfuscation utilities can often do this — so can minor patches to your code ) , forces pirates to either host the executable themselves or deal with “ customer support ” requests like “ Waaaaaah your patch does n’t work anymore lol ” .
OK , now , finally , on to license key generation algorithms .
Some design considerations :
1 ) Are you going to run this offline , or are you going to run this on a server ?
2 ) How much information from your customer does the algorithm require ?
How are you going to get this ?
e.g. if you require their hard drive serial number , you suddenly add the requirement “ Customers can only purchase my application through my application ” , which may be less than desireable .
3 ) Are you going to roll your own , or use an off - the - shelf system like Armadillo ?
In general , you ’re not paying for security ( although its likely that their system is more secure than yours , its not totally secure ) , you ’re paying for convinience .
Armadillo has been broken before and will be broken again , like every other security system .
4 ) How do you get the registration key to the user ?
Do you want to display it on a website , display it on an email , or update the application directly ( sometimes called “ automatic key injection ” ?
A lot of the payment processors ( including e- Sellerate , as I recall ) promote systems that have this as a feature .
Its quite nice , as it reduces customer support headaches ( what was my registration key ?
How do I input it again ? ) , particularly with non-technical customers .
I did n’t do this myself , primarily because it required more development effort than my schedule had time for .
OK , if you ’re still with me , lets talk some strategies for key generation if you want to do it yourself .
1 ) Public key encryption .
Basically , your registration key sends a message : “ Bob Smith , I hereby give you the right to use my software , in exchange for the consideration you have given me ” .
The problem is that Jolly Roger wants to be able to forge the message and replace Bob Smith with Jolly Roger , thus bamboozling your program into functioning for him .
Luckily , there is a solution to this : public key cryptography .
Public key cryptography works like this : you have a pair of keys .
One of them is public and you can give it out to everybody , including the adversary .
One of them is private and you guard it with your life .
Since your trial version will be in the hands of the adversary , the only thing the trial version can know is your public key .
Practically speaking , you first take the hash value of all the identifying information you have .
Then , you encrypt this with your private key : the output of this encryption is your “ registration key / serial number ” .
Your software then performs the same calculation of the hash value in parallel , and decrypts your serial number using your public key , which results in a hash value .
If the two hash values match , you unlock the software .
If not , you display a nicely worded message to contact support ( remember , your protection mechanism is a salesman ) .
If you are interested in the math behind encryption , which gets kind of heady , Wikipedia has a nice article on RSA .
I ’ll give you my dirty little secret : I ’ve got a very incomplete understanding of a lot of the number theory involved , and I do n’t trust myself to implement encryption .
Neither should you .
Really , trust Bob Schneider , you ’ll probably just end up breaking something .
Instead , take the crypto library which comes with your package of choice , and USE IT .
Look for “ MD5 digest ” or “ message signing ” in your documentation if you ’re unfamiliar with the whole field and just want to be done , quickly .
2 ) Everything else .
Any other mechanism is insecurity which you ’re tolerating for the sake of preserving your time as a developer .
With that in mind , for preventing casual piracy you do n’t need to go as far as public key crypto , although I would oh - so - strongly suggest doing so .
I ignored my own advice though , and did something similar to the following : take two random constants A and B , which are “ secret ” in the sense that you have to actually decompile my program to find them ( “ But Patrick , thats not very secret is it .
After all , the program is in the hands of the adversary . ” EXACTLY ) . if ( serial ^ A ) % B == 0 , then the serial is good .
Note this does n’t allow for any use of identifying information , and was chosen totally because I could implement it in 30 seconds .
If I did another product today , I would spend 30 minutes instead and use Java ’s excellent crypto libraries .
The weaknesses of my approach are obvious : with access to the code breaking it takes a matter of seconds , one serial number will work for any number of computers , etc etc .
But it was sufficient to my purposes because my target customer has enough difficulty getting a legitimate version installed , to say nothing of navigating the dark corners of the Internet where the keygens flourish .
Where / when to check the serial number : I check once on startup .
A lot of people say “ Check in all sorts of places ” , to make it harder for someone to crack by stripping out the check .
If you want to be particularly nasty to the cracker , check in all sorts of places using inlined code ( i.e. DON ’T externalize it all into SerialNumberVerifier.class ) and if at all possible make it multi- threaded and hard to recognize when it fails , too .
But this just makes it harder to make the crack , not impossible , and remember your goal is generally not to defeat the cracker .
Defeating the cracker does not make you an appreciable amount of money .
You just need to defeat the casual user in most instances , and the casual user does not have access to a debugger nor know how to use one .
Alright , that about wraps it up .
This article is a work in progress , so I might beef it up some more , perhaps with code samples or techniques to impose , e.g. , time limitations .
Someday .
In the meanwhile , I hope you learned something .
[ Edit : Yo ho , me hearties .

Nachdem ja Google Earth bereits vor einem Monat willens war , die Luftbilder von Deutschland in einer hohen bzw .
stark verbesserten Auflösung darzustellen ( siehe auch „ Google Earth und GoYellow : Kampf um Deutschland - Karte ? „ ) , sind diese Daten nun auch in Google Maps integriert wurden , wie auch ein erster Testblick auf den bisher unkenntlichen Kölner Dom zeigt :
Die Geschwindigkeit läßt an einigen Stellen allerdings noch etwas zu wünschen übrig ; ich war wohl nicht der einzige , der nachgesehen hat 😉
Die Integration ist offenbar am Freitag erfolgt und fällt somit mit der ( Wieder - ) Einführung des Namens „ Google Maps “ anstelle des bisherigen Namens „ Google Local “ zusammen , die ebenfalls am Freitag verkündet wurde ( siehe auch www.golem.de):
Als Grund für die Umbenennung gibt Google an , dass der Dienst Google Maps eine große Beliebtheit gehabt habe und die Kunden immer wieder danach gefragt hätten .
Daher hat sich der Suchmaschinenbetreiber nun entschieden , den bisher als Google Local angebotenen Dienst unter dem Namen Google Maps weiter zu führen .
Damit solle keinesfalls die lokale Suche heruntergefahren werden , beteuert Google .
Google Maps findet ihr wie bisher auch unter maps.google.com ( englisch )

Joke : A poor Jew lived in the shtetl in 19th century Russia .
A Cossack comes up to him on horseback .
“ What are you feeding that chicken ? ” asks the Cossack .
“ Just some bread crumbs , ” replies the Jew .
“ How dare you feed a fine Russian chicken such lowly food ! ” says the Cossack , and hits the Jew with a stick .
The next day the Cossack comes back .
“ Now what are you feeding that chicken ? ” ask the Jew .
“ Well , I give him three courses .
There ’s freshly cut grass , fine sturgeon caviar , and a small bowl of heavy cream sprinkled with imported French chocolate truffles for dessert . ”
“ Idiot ! ” says the Cossack , beating the Jew with a stick .
“ How dare you waste good food on a lowly chicken ! ”
On the third day , the Cossack again asks , “ What are you feeding that chicken ? ”
“ Nothing ! ” pleads the Jew .
“ I give him a kopeck and he buys whatever he wants . ”
( pause for laughter )
( no ? )
( ba dum dum )
( still no laughter )
( oh well ) .
I use the term “ Econ 101 ” a little bit tongue - in - cheek .
For my non-American readers : most US college departments have a course numbered “ 101 ” which is the basic introductory course for any field .
Econ 101 management is the style used by people who know just enough economic theory to be dangerous .
The Econ 101 manager assumes that everyone is motivated by money , and that the best way to get people to do what you want them to do is to give them financial rewards and punishments to create incentives .
For example , AOL might pay their call - center people for every customer they persuade not to cancel their subscription .
A software company might give bonuses to programmers who create the fewest bugs .
It works about as well as giving your chickens money to buy their own food .
One big problem is that it replaces intrinsic motivation with extrinsic motivation .
Intrinsic motivation is your own , natural desire to do things well .
People usually start out with a lot of intrinsic motivation .
They want to do a good job .
They want to help people understand that it ’s in their best interest to keep paying AOL $ 24 a month .
They want to write less - buggy code .
Extrinsic motivation is a motivation that comes from outside , like when you ’re paid to achieve something specific .
Intrinsic motivation is much stronger than extrinsic motivation .
People work much harder at things that they actually want to do .
That ’s not very controversial .
But when you offer people money to do things that they wanted to do , anyway , they suffer from something called the Overjustification Effect .
“ I must be writing bug - free code because I like the money I get for it , ” they think , and the extrinsic motivation displaces the intrinsic motivation .
Since extrinsic motivation is a much weaker effect , the net result is that you ’ve actually reduced their desire to do a good job .
When you stop paying the bonus , or when they decide they do n’t care that much about the money , they no longer think that they care about bug free code .
Another big problem with Econ 101 management is the tendency for people to find local maxima .
They ’ll find some way to optimize for the specific thing you ’re paying them , without actually achieving the thing you really want .
So for example your customer retention specialist , in his desire to earn the bonus associated with maintaining a customer , will drive the customer so crazy that the New York Times will run a big front page story about how nasty your customer “ service ” is .
Although his behavior maximizes the thing you ’re paying him for ( customer retention ) it does n’t maximize the thing you really care about ( profit ) .
And then you try to reward him for the company profit , say , by giving him 13 shares of stock , and you realize that it ’s not really something he controls , so it ’s a waste of time .
When you use Econ 101 management , you ’re encouraging developers to game the system .
Suppose you decide to pay a bonus to the developer with the fewest bugs .
Now every time a tester tries to report a bug , it becomes a big argument , and usually the developer convinces the tester that it ’s not really a bug .
Or the tester agrees to report the bug “ informally ” to the developer before writing it up in the bug tracking system .
And now nobody uses the bug tracking system .
The bug count goes way down , but the number of bugs stays the same .
Developers are clever this way .
Whatever you try to measure , they ’ll find a way to maximize , and you ’ll never quite get what you want .
Robert Austin , in his book Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations , says there are two phases when you introduce new performance metrics .
At first , you actually get what you wanted , because nobody has figured out how to cheat .
In the second phase , you actually get something worse , as everyone figures out the trick to maximizing the thing that you ’re measuring , even at the cost of ruining the company .
Worse , Econ 101 managers think that they can somehow avoid this situation just by tweaking the metrics .
Dr. Austin ’s conclusion is that you just can’t .
It never works .
No matter how much you try to adjust the metrics to reflect what you think you want , it always backfires .
The biggest problem with Econ 101 management , though , is that it ’s not management at all : it ’s really more of an abdication of management .
A deliberate refusal to figure out how things can be made better .
It ’s a sign that management simply does n’t know how to teach people to do better work , so they force everybody in the system to come up with their own way of doing it .
Instead of training developers on techniques of writing reliable code , you just absolve yourself of responsibility by paying them if they do .
Now every developer has to figure it out on their own .
For more mundane tasks , working the counter at Starbucks or answering phone calls at AOL , it ’s pretty unlikely that the average worker will figure out a better way of doing things on their own .
You can go into any coffee shop in the country and order a short soy caramel latte extra-hot , and you ’ll find that you have to keep repeating your order again and again : once to the coffee maker , again to the coffee maker when they forgot what you said , and finally to the cashier so they can figure out what to charge you .
That ’s the result of nobody telling the workers a better way .
Nobody figures it out , except Starbucks , where the standard training involves a complete system of naming , writing things on cups , and calling out orders which insures that customers only have to specify their drink orders once .
The system , invented by Starbucks HQ , works great , but workers at the other chains never , ever come up with it on their own .
Your customer service people spend most of the day talking to customers .
They do n’t have the time , the inclination , or the training to figure out better ways to do things .
Nobody in the customer retention crew is going to be able to keep statistics and measure which customer retention techniques work best while pissing off the fewest bloggers .
They just do n’t care enough , they ’re not smart enough , they do n’t have enough information , and they are too busy with their real job .
As a manager it ’s your job to figure out a system .
That ’s Why You Get The Big Bucks .
If you read a little bit too much Ayn Rand as a kid , or if you took one semester of Economics , before they explained that utility is not measured in dollars , you may think that setting up simplified bonus schemes and Pay For Performance is a pretty neat way to manage .
But it does n’t work .
Start doing your job managing and stop feeding your chickens kopecks .
“ Joel ! ” you yell .
“ Yesterday you told us that the developers should make all the decisions .
Today you ’re telling us that the managers should make all the decisions .
What ’s up with that ? ”
Mmm , not exactly .
Yesterday I told you that your developers , the leaves in the tree , have the most information ; micromanagement or Command and Control barking out orders is likely to cause non-optimal results .
Today I ’m telling you that when you ’re creating a system , you ca n’t abdicate your responsibility to train your people by bribing them .
Management , in general , needs to set up the system so that people can get things done , it needs to avoid displacing intrinsic motivation with extrinsic motivation , and it wo n’t get very far using fear and barking out specific orders .
Now that I ’ve shot down Command and Control management and Econ 101 management , there ’s one more method managers can use to get people moving in the right direction .
I call it the Identity method and I ’ll talk about it more tomorrow .
That genial face has become familiar across the globe – almost as recognizable when it comes to religious leaders , perhaps , as Pope John Paul II .
When in America , the Dalai Lama is a sought - after speaker , sharing his compassionate message and engaging aura well beyond the Buddhist community .
After inaugurating a new Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education in Vancouver , B.C. , the Tibetan leader this week begins a visit to several US cities for public talks , sessions with young peacemakers , scientists , university faculty , corporate executives , and a California women 's conference .
But he 'll also sit down for teach - ins among the burgeoning American faithful .
Buddhism is growing apace in the United States , and an identifiably American Buddhism is emerging .
Teaching centers and sanghas ( communities of people who practice together ) are spreading here as American - born leaders reframe ancient principles in contemporary Western terms .
Though the religion born in India has been in the US since the 19th century , the number of adherents rose by 170 percent between 1990 and 2000 , according to the American Religious Identity Survey .
An ARIS estimate puts the total in 2004 at 1.5 million , while others have estimated twice that .
" The 1.5 million is a low reasonable number , " says Richard Seager , author of " Buddhism in America . "
That makes Buddhism the country 's fourth - largest religion , after Christianity , Judaism , and Islam .
Immigrants from Asia probably account for two - thirds of the total , and converts about one - third , says Dr. Seager , a professor of religious studies at Hamilton College , in Clinton , N.Y .
What is drawing people ( after that fascination with Zen Buddhism in the '50s and ' 60s ) ?
The Dalai Lama himself has played a role , some say , and Buddhism 's nonmissionizing approach fits well with Americans ' search for meaningful spiritual paths .
" People feel that Buddhist figures like the Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh of Vietnam are contributing something , not trying to convert people , " says Lama Surya Das , a highly trained American lama in the Tibetan tradition .
" They are not building big temples , but offering wisdom and ways of reconciliation and peacemaking , which are so much needed . "
Even a larger factor , he suggests , is that Buddhism offers spiritual practices that Western religions have n't emphasized .
" People are looking for experiential practices , not just a new belief system or a new set of ethical rules which we already have , and are much the same in all religions , " Surya Das says .
" It 's the transformative practices like meditation which people are really attracted to . "
At a sangha " sitting " in Cambridge , Mass. , last week , some 20 devotees sat cross -legged on four rows of large burgundy - colored cushions before a small candlelit altar .
A practice leader led a quiet hour of meditation interspersed with the chanting of prayers and mantras .
The group then gathered in a circle for a half hour of discussion .
Carol Marsh , an architect who served as practice leader for the evening , had an interest in finding a spiritual path for years , but was " resistant to anything nonrationalist , " she says afterward in an interview .
" Then I read ' Awakening the Buddha Within , ' [ Surya Das 's first book on ' Tibetan wisdom for the Western world ' ] , and it spoke to me directly ....
My ultimate aim is liberation . "
After eight years of practicing , " I am happier , more grateful , more able to roll with whatever punches or moments of annoyance may present themselves , " Ms. Marsh says .
What 's so valuable to Jane Moss , who 's been practicing 15 years , is learning how " to be in the present moment . "
And also to accept that reality involves perfection and " to view the world as good and people as basically loving . "
Each month , the group holds a meditation focused on love and compassion .
The sangha has been meeting since 1991 , when Surya Das opened the Dzogchen Center here after decades of training with Tibetan teachers .
Before becoming a lama , he was Jeffrey Miller , raised in a middle - class Jewish family in Brooklyn .
An anti-Vietnam - War activist while at the University of Buffalo ( N.Y. ) , he was stunned when his good friend Allison Krause was shot and killed by the National Guard at Kent State in 1970 .
" When I graduated in 1972 , I was disillusioned with radical politics – I realized fighting for peace was a contradiction in terms , and I wanted to find inner peace , " he explains .
Instead of graduate school , the young Miller headed off on a search that ended up in the Himalayas , where he spent the rest of the ' 70s and ' 80s learning from Buddhist teachers while teaching some of them English .
There were plenty of struggles and moments of doubt , but also illumination , he says .
Following a centuries - old path to cultivate awareness , his training included two three - year retreats of intensely focused practice .
" One of the great lessons of that monastic brotherhood was learning to love even those people I did n't like , " he says , speaking by phone from a retreat in Texas where he 's training others .
There are many schools of Buddhism , but " everyone agrees that the purpose is the individual and collective realization of Enlightenment , " Surya Das continues .
" That is defined as nirvanic peace , wisdom , and selfless love .
It involves a practice path that depends on meditation , ethical behavior , and developing insight and active love . "
Buddha means " awakened " in Sanskrit , a language of ancient India , where Siddhartha Gautama founded the faith and an Eightfold Path some 2,500 years ago .
Buddhists believe that through that path one awakens to what already is – " the natural great perfection . "
They do not speak of God , but of the human or ego mind with a small " m , " and the Buddha ( awakened ) Mind with a big " m . "
" Healing energy takes place through an agency far greater than , yet immanent in each of us , " Surya Das has written .
" We are all Buddhas . "
One does n't have to subscribe to a catechism or creed , or be a vegetarian .
Nor do people have to give up their religion .
That 's why some Americans speak of being Jewish Buddhists , for instance .
The Dalai Lama , in fact , often encourages people to stay with the faith of their cultural upbringing , to avoid the confusion that can sometimes result from a mixing of Eastern and Western perspectives .
Yet others are going more fully into Buddhist study , particularly as the writings and training by American - born teachers increase its accessibility .
The Dzogchen Center ( Dzogchen means " the innate great completeness " ) , which has sanghas in several states , teaches an advanced Tibetan practice ; annually , it offers numerous retreats , from one - day to two - week gatherings .
Surya Das – whose Tibetan teacher gave him his name , which means " follower or disciple of the light " – is the spiritual director .
Thirty devotees are currently cloistered in a 100 - day retreat for advanced students at the Dzogchen retreat center outside Austin , Texas .
They are in the third of a 12 - year cycle of silent retreats – which will likely produce new teachers .
Several Tibetan teachers helped introduce Buddhism in the US , and one , Chogyam Trungpa , founded Naropa University in Boulder , Colo .
But the teacher succumbed to excesses that tempt clergy of various faiths – alcoholism and sexual misconduct .
The Dalai Lama has warned , too , of some teachers who seek leadership for financial rather than spiritual reasons .
The issue of students and teachers is today one of the most controversial in transmission of teaching from East to West , says Surya Das .
Still , a healthy American Buddhism with its own characteristics is emerging .
It is less doctrinal and ritualistic than in the East and more meditation oriented , less hierarchical and more democratic and egalitarian .
It is more lay - oriented than monastic , and more socially and ecologically engaged .
Perhaps most noticeably , " the role of women as leaders and teachers is very significant here , " Seager says .
The Dalai Lama speaks of Buddhism naturally taking new forms in each culture .
As he travels the globe , he also emphasizes building bridges between faiths , as well as finding nonviolent means for resolving differences .
This weekend , the Nobel Peace Laureate will spend time with youths in Denver engaged in conflict - resolution projects .
He 'll bless the Great Stupa , the largest example of Buddhist sacred architecture in the US , located at Colorado 's Shambhala Mountain Center .
Next week he 'll speak to 20,000 at a football stadium in Buffalo , and at the alma mater of Surya Das , who was one of his attendants for several years .
The American lama will also speak .
" Buddhism made me a mensch and brought me happiness , " Surya Das concludes contentedly , " and helped me find my place in life and the universe . "

An Australian man has registered a patent for a " circular transportation facilitation device " - more commonly known as the wheel .
Melbourne patent lawyer John Keogh said he registered the patent to show flaws in an intellectual property law that came into effect in May , the Australian newspaper The Age reported .
The patent office would be required to issue a patent for anything - all they 're doing is putting a rubber stamp on it
John Keogh
The new law established the " innovation patent " system , which Mr Keogh said did not require sufficient oversight from the patent office .
The new innovation patent can be prepared without professional help and only requires claimants to show " innovation " , not " invention " .
Mr Keogh said it represented the government caving in to claimants who said it was too expensive to obtain a standard patent .
" The government decided to find a way to issue a patent more easily , " he said .
Obtaining a patent for the wheel would require a false claim , which would certainly invalidate the patent

All that is left is a deserted shack , open to the four winds , in the middle of nowhere , its three rooms littered with filthy mattresses and rolled up blankets .
There are any number of similar places on the highlands of Foggia province in the south of Italy .
The place must have looked even worse when Stanislav Fudalin , 51 , arrived here one night in early January after an exhausting journey by minibus from Krakow .
The windows were already broken and the door would not shut .
He stayed for almost a month with eight other Polish workers , with neither running water , electricity nor heating , apart from the brushwood they collected to burn in the fireplace .
From dawn to dusk they laboured in the fields , and all night they struggled to survive the cold , hunger and despair .
" I was mad enough even to consider walking home to Poland , " Fudalin says with a smile .
But it is difficult starting when you do not know where you are .
When they arrived the " reception committee " - two Poles and a Ukrainian called Pedro - made it quite clear escape was not an option .
Fudalin still remembers Pedro's threats and the beatings he meted out at the slightest excuse : " He said : ' I make the rules here .
You 're my slaves .
If you try to leave , I 'll track you down and kill you .
You 'll go back to Poland in a dustbin bag ' " .
Fudalin and his mates nevertheless got away , partly by luck and largely thanks to the Polish consulate , which came to pick them up one night with a van .
On July 18 their testimony , and evidence provided by 30 others , led the carabinieri to liberate 113 Polish farm workers , slaving under inhuman conditions in several neighbouring localities .
The police arrested Pedro and 26 other suspects - Poles , Ukrainians , an Algerian and an Italian - all charged with human trafficking and slavery .
This was the first the Italian public had heard of any forced labour camps .
The investigation , codenamed Promised Land and carried out jointly with the Polish police , uncovered a vast operation supplying illegal labour .
It had been running for at least two years between the south of Poland - where about 20 traffickers are now behind bars - and the Foggia area .
In this part of Apulia , where millions of tonnes of tomatoes are harvested every summer , casual workers from eastern Europe have gradually replaced Moroccan pickers , but no one imagined they had been reduced to slavery .
They had no contract , suffered terrible hardship , humiliation and " worse still sometimes " , adds a police officer .
Lorenzo Lerario , from the anti-mafia prosecutor 's office in Bari , has decided to reopen the cases of 14 Poles who died under suspicious circumstances over the past two years near Foggia .
Police dealt with each case in isolation and tended to assume the men died in fights or in accidents .
But prosecutors now suspect the death rate was abnormally high for people who were mostly young and healthy .
Every summer for the past three years a mobile Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) unit has been operating in the Foggia area .
" We are facing the same situation again , with foreigners arriving in good health and falling ill here because of the foul conditions to which they are subjected , " says Andrea Accardi , head of the MSF mission in Italy .
An MSF report published last year shows that the worst diseases are diagnosed on foreigners who have been here longest .
More than a third of all immigrant workers live in derelict buildings .
More than half have no running water , a third must do without electricity and almost half without proper sanitation .
A third of the workers examined by MSF doctors had suffered ill treatment in the course of the previous six months .
The Promised Land investigation revealed the full scale of the problem .
" It is not just a police matter , " says Lerario , adding that the Bari prosecutors are handling the matter " very carefully and with all available resources , in close collaboration with the judicial authorities in Poland " .
Domenico Centrone , the Polish consul for the Apulia region , says : " The local authorities did not want to know .
I have been sending them letters for four or five years , particularly the chief of police in Foggia , but all to no avail .
They just would not believe me . "
It was the discovery , in August last year , of 90 Poles locked up in a labour camp at Orta Nova , south of Foggia , that finally prompted a response .
Centrone , 49 , who runs a food processing firm , subsequently accommodated and even employed several of the inmates , ultimately persuading them to file a complaint .
Many were so scared of reprisals they would not talk .
Some of the gangs are still operating and the authorities advise journalists not to visit certain places without an escort .
Once the Poles had been moved to Castellana Grotte , a small town 150 km south of Foggia , the bravest agreed to make an official statement .
Apart from a few details , they all told much the same story : a small ad in a local paper or on the net promising a decently paid job ( €5 or € 6 an hour , with board and lodging ) , a loan from the bank or their family to cover travel expenses ( €200 to € 400 ) , a minibus driving round and round in the Italian countryside till night fell , and finally their arrival in hell .
Marek Pajestka , 45 , still looks scared stiff .
He says : " At 4 am the gangmasters took us off to an artichoke field where we worked for six hours , then on to a tomato field for another 10 hours , without any breaks . "
He worked 16 hours a day for the next two months .
For € 6 an hour it might almost been worth his while .
Pajestka , a burly unemployed coach driver , certainly needed the work .
But when the exhausted workers reached the Orta Nova camp every night at 10.30 pm they had to pay for everything .
Only the beatings were free of charge .
To spend the night in the house , with 60 other inmates , the price was € 5 .
Alternatively they could sleep outside in a tent , on the hard ground , for € 3 .
They were also charged for food ( bread and pasta ) and candles ( there was no electricity ) .
They even had to pay € 1 every morning for the ride to the fields .
If they fell ill it cost them € 20 for every day not worked .
" I lost all hope of ever getting paid the day six of them laid into a big lad who was demanding his pay , " says Pajestka .
" After that they dragged him out of the camp , all covered in blood , and dumped him beside the track .
They were shouting : ' You 've got two hours to clear out , otherwise we 'll kill you ' . "
Jakub Olszewski , 21 , landed up in the same hell - hole .
In three weeks Olszewski lost seven kilos .
He had given up the idea of ever escaping when the carabinieri turned up .
" There were no latrines and only two showers . . . more like pipes . . . for about 100 of us , " he says .
Pajestka and Olszewski describe a compound , surrounded by walls topped with barbed wire .
At night the gate was padlocked .
The only light in the vicinity came from a nearby house where the gangmasters were based .
All the workers - Poles , Romanians , Africans and Italians - refer to these men as " capos " .
The caporalato is as old as farming itself in an area dominated by vast properties , where the bosses never deal directly with their labourers .
Capos have always hired day - workers , driven them to the fields , paid them and taken them home in the evening .
They are an integral part of a system based on illegal employment .
But with the disappearance of Italian pickers , their place taken by foreign workers , the gangmasters ' methods have become increasingly brutal in the battle to harvest the crop of " red gold " .
The carabinieri admit they are not up to the task .
" How are we to keep a check on invisible labour that 's constantly on the move ? " asks one of the nine men at the station in Ascoli Satriano , pointing to a map of the 334 - square - kilometre locality .
The day of our visit the commander of the Ascoli carabinieri met a Polish couple who had had no news of their son , Gregorz Kusz , 28 , for two years .
The authorities in Warsaw have registered 119 missing people who have travelled to Italy since 2000 .
Half of them are thought to have disappeared in the Foggia area .
Polish police have now posted the names and photographs of these men and women on their website and the embassy in Rome has officially submitted the list to the Italian prosecutors .
The Kuszes have left a photocopy of their son's passport at the police station in Ascoli , as they have done elsewhere , but there is little chance of success .
" How can we be expected to look for people with no proof they ever arrived ? " asks a prosecutor .
However the increased publicity does seem to have stirred the office of public prosecution in Foggia into action .
Cases are being reopened and evidence from different sources correlated .
Some of the phone conversations recorded during the Promised Land investigation suggest there is plenty of cause for alarm .
Police overheard one gangmaster telling his girlfriend how angry he was about two workers who had escaped .
He said : " I wo n't allow them to behave like that .
Today I 'll go along to the fields and kill a couple , just to set an example . "
Olszewski only saw fellow workers being beaten and kicked .
He says : " Some of the people missing may have been killed , but I reckon most are still alive and working somewhere else .
They borrowed money from their families to come here .
They can't go straight home after such a failure . "
He smiles faintly and adds : " Maybe they died of shame . "

The axis of diesel
Mercedes , GM , even Honda , is betting on a new breed of green diesels .
The goal ?
To leave hybrids in the dust .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
As night fell over the 24 Hours of LeMans this summer , spectators at France 's prestigious endurance race detected a pattern .
While competitors entered the pits to refuel , a sleek pair of Audi R10s kept stealing laps around the 13.7 - kilometer track .
Already the fastest cars on the course , and eerily quiet thanks to a unique emissions filter , the Audis were also proving the most fuel - efficient .
When the checkered flag flew , the Audi had made history as the first diesel car to win a major international race .
Diesel is n't just changing LeMans .
Thanks to technological breakthroughs , at least six automakers - starting with Mercedes on Oct. 16 , Jeep in early 2007 , and eventually even hybrid pioneer Honda - will be launching a fleet of New Age diesels .
They promise to boost fuel economy by 25 % to 40 % , with huge torque and turbochargers to deliver the power American drivers crave .
Though initial models wo n't pass air - quality standards in five states ( California and New York among them ) , Mercedes has announced three 2008 SUVs that will achieve 50 - state standards .
Honda ( Charts ) , VW , and GM ( Charts ) are close behind .
How big is the market ?
J.D. Power estimates that diesel sales will triple to 9 % of the U.S. market by 2013 , compared with a projected hybrid share of 5 % .
While a diesel may have won LeMans , winning over American consumers wo n't be easy .
" [ Toyota 's ] success has been to put the idea in consumers ' minds that hybrids are the only solution , but that 's wrong , " says clean - diesel proponent Carlos Ghosn , the CEO of Renault ( Charts ) and Nissan ( Charts ) .
Though half the new cars in Europe have diesel engines ( credit $ 6 - a - gallon gas and tax subsidies ) , most Americans still associate the word with soot - spewing , bone - rattling specimens from the ' 70s .
" People ask why we do n't just bring them over , but it's a challenge , " says Frank Klegon , chief of Chrysler Group 's global product development .
While hybrids are seen as cutting - edge , " with diesels , it 's ' Well , those have been around for 100 years . ' "
More than 100 , actually .
Bavarian Rudolf Diesel patented his groundbreaking engine in 1892 .
While a gasoline engine squeezes gas and air together , a diesel compresses only air , at high pressures , creating so much heat that added fuel ignites without a spark .
( Diesel contains more energy than gasoline , and engines burn it more efficiently . )
Shifting America 's gears
Though diesels produce fewer greenhouse gases , they make more smog - forming pollutants .
Mercedes debuted the first mass - produced car model in 1936 , and popularity peaked here during the early ' 80s , when four of five Benzes sold featured a so - called oil burner .
But the era of cheap gas left most buyers oblivious to fuel economy .
As emissions standards got stricter , the EPA even discussed banning diesel a decade ago , notes Margo Oge , director of the EPA 's office for transportation and air quality .
Except for pickups and a fringe of Volkswagen fanatics , the technology largely fell by the wayside .
Until now .
The first breakthrough is that ultra - low - sulfur diesel fuel will roll out to the nation 's pumps this month .
The move was mandated by the EPA , whose 2009 emissions rules will hold diesels to the same standards - the world 's toughest - as gasoline cars .
( Environmentalists were thrilled , oil companies less so :
The rollout will cost them $ 6 billion to $ 9 billion . )
The new fuel eliminates 97 % of sulfur , and it's also the catalyst for automakers to devise strategies to reduce the remaining pollutants .
Mercedes is furthest along .
In the E 320 Blutec , a trap stores and purges smog - forming nitrogen oxides .
A second filter captures particulate matter - diesel 's black calling card , long linked to cancer , asthma , and other health risks .
Then ammonia compounds are used to convert nitrogen oxides to water and nitrogen .
What will consumers notice ?
It goes fast , it delivers a knockout 38 highway miles per gallon , there 's no smell , and it costs just $ 1,000 more than the gas model , vs. Lexus 's $ 8,000 premium for its GS hybrid sedan .
To pass the strictest air - quality rules , part two of Mercedes ' plan involves adding a small tank of urea , an ammonia - like fluid that further neutralizes pollution .
The EPA 's
Oge says that while the agency has been leery of emissions systems that require maintenance , it will back Mercedes ' approach .
By the time Mercedes ' 50 - state diesels launch , the competition will be heated .
In September , Honda - a company long associated with hybrids - announced a catalytic - converter breakthrough that requires no fluid additives , saying it will deliver 50 - state models by 2009 .
And GM recently showed off a burly , ultra - clean V - 8 diesel that should arrive around the same time .
VW , Audi , Nissan , BMW , and Chrysler Group also have versions in the works .
The question is , Are Americans ready for diesel 's second coming ?
" We 've always been a proponent , " says Mercedes ' E - Class chief , Bart Herring .
" But changing the perspective of the rest of the market will take time and effort . "
Honda 's research showed that older Americans are more skeptical of diesel .
" Younger people are more open to it , " says John Watts , Honda 's manager for product planning .
" They 're more our target of who diesel would appeal to - cars with lots of power yet low fuel consumption . "
In other words , for eco-conscious buyers , the race is on .

EuroStemCell scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris have demonstrated one of the body ’s most sophisticated ways of regulating the genetic material of stem cells .
Their findings , published in Nature Cell Biology , show for the first time the mechanism that adult muscle stem cells use to protect their DNA from mutations .
Understanding this has important implications for cancer research , the study of gene regulation , and ultimately growing stem cells of therapeutic potential in the laboratory .
When a cell divides , its DNA is duplicated and each resulting daughter cell inherits one copy of the DNA .
Over time , errors arising during the duplication process can lead to mutations and cause cancers .
Using sophisticated approaches including video imaging the Pasteur team show that stem cells retain the original DNA strands .
Their findings also represent the best visual evidence yet for immortal DNA - a controversial theory first proposed more than 3 decades ago .
A stem cell can produce two different daughter cells when it divides in the body – another stem cell and a specialised cell that will contribute to the tissue .
This is called “ asymmetric division ” and helps stem cells regulate their numbers and retain their capacity to regenerate tissue throughout the life of an organism .
According to the immortal DNA hypothesis , when a stem cell divides , only the specialised cell inherits the imperfect copied DNA .
The stem cell retains the original “ immortal ” DNA strand .
Leading the Pasteur team , Shahragim Tajbakhsh says “ the immortal DNA theory has captured the imagination of many scientists for decades , but it has been particularly difficult to prove .
By tracking skeletal muscle stem cells from mouse muscle fibres , both in vivo and in the dish , we have shown that the DNA strands of the double helix are not equivalent , and we have linked this phenomenon with the general asymmetry apparatus of the dividing cell . ”
He adds “ this is an exciting finding , as it seems to defy one of the basic rules of cell biology and genetics : that genetic material is distributed randomly .
It appears that the cellular machinery distinguishes old from new when it comes to DNA , and it may use this distinction to protect the body from mutations and cancer .
It is also possible that this mechanism is used to silence gene expression in the stem cell . ”

Sept. 10 , 2006  -- On Sept. 11 , 2001 , when then - fifth - grader Mike Andrews heard President Bush was coming to his school , Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota , Fla. , he could hardly believe it .
" I just thought it was unreal , " said Andrews , now a 15 - year - old student at Booker High School .
" All of us , we just looked at each other .
We were like , ' Are you serious ?
Like he 's actually coming here just for us ? '
Like , of all the places in the nation he could have went to and he came here .
Like , all the way just to Sarasota . "
Thirteen - year - old Booker Middle School student Tyler Radkey was in second grade at the time , and did n't really think the president would come .
When he saw Bush , he felt like he was going to faint .
" I thought it was going to be a lie , and they were just trying to get us excited , " Radkey said .
The President Gets Word
The president visited the students ' classroom to promote his education bill .
But then , at 9:07 a.m. , White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card interrupted the class .
" I just remember one of his staff members walk up to him , and he turns back and looks at us , and his face starts to turn red , " Radkey said .
" So I 'm thinking to myself that he has to go to the bathroom . "
Another student in that classroom , 12 - year - old Natalia Jones , who 's now a seventh grader at Booker Middle School had a different take .
" I thought he was mad at us or something because his face was red and he was staring in one spot , " Jones said .
In fact , with that quick whisper , the world was changed forever .
The president had just been told a second plane had crashed into the World Trade Center .
America was under attack .
Bush finished the class before making a brief stop in a nearby staff room to speak with his national security advisor .
A School Reacts
Andrews clearly remembers when he first realized that something awful had happened that morning .
" When he walked on stage , he had a look of concern and a look of worry , like we did n't know exactly what was going on but we could tell something was wrong , " he said .
" You could kind of feel it in the air a little bit . "
For Byron Mitchell , a 14 - year - old tenth grader at Booker High School , the realization came seconds later .
" When he started talking , he was talking like it sounded like he was getting ready to cry or something , " Mitchell said .
" His voice was cracking .
I thought to myself something 's , everything was wrong . "
Andrews also remembered the other students , and even teachers , getting equally worried .
" For me being in fifth grade , I did n't know what was going on ; I was confused at the time , " he said .
" I was looking around , me and my friends were looking around at each other like , ' What happened ? '
And all of the adults were sad and worried .
And some of them were beginning to cry and what not .
And we were all sitting here like , ' What 's going on ?
What 's happening ? '
We did n't find out really until we actually saw it on TV later . "
At the time , Andrews did n't even know what the World Trade Center was .
The news was a lot to process for a 10 - or 11 - year - old child , Andrews said .
For him , looking back is a surreal experience .
" Just thinking about it , I was just shocked when I saw the actual footage of what was going on .
When I saw it on TV , I could n't believe my eyes , " he said .
" My whole class just sat there in awe because we actually figured out what was happening and how big this really was for everybody . "
Five Years Later , Still Scared
Andrews felt safer that morning than he does now .
" I had a bit of a comfort level , you could say , and that morning kind of gave me the indication and led me to believe that you could never really feel safe -- like anything could happen at any given moment or time , " Andrews said .
Five years later , Mitchell does n't feel safer either .
" They might feel the same way we feel about fighting the war and they might retaliate , and I think about it every day , " he said .
" I do n't think that I should have to be scared just walking around .
I should n't have to be scared of what 's going to happen to me . "
Sometimes , Mitchell said , that fear gets the best of him .
" When something happens in the news , I think about it , " he said .
" But most of the time , I 'm not afraid . "
Questions About the Future
Andrews has a few questions for the president .
" What is he really doing to prevent war from happening , and what 's he really doing to ensure our safety here ? " he asked .
Jones has questions , as well .
" I would ask him , ' Are we ever going to be safe ?
Can we ever walk around and say , ' I 'm safe , I 'm safe , ' without really having to double check that ? " she asked .
Jones also has ideas for reaching out to the people she thinks might want to hurt America .
" I would get everybody together , and I would ask them why are we fighting and should we be fighting and what is the way we can prevent this ? " she said .
Mitchell feels sympathy for those that died in the towers that day .
" I feel sorry for the people that were in the buildings , and I really wish that it would n't have happened , " he said .
" That whole day , it would have been remembered in a totally different way .
And instead of me having to look back on Sept. 11 as a day that was bad , I can go back to it as a good memory . "
Andrews believed he witnessed an important moment in history .
" That 'll be a day or something I could tell people for ages and everything , because that is a big event , " he said .
" Even though it was such a bad time , still most people could not even say that they came close to meeting him and I was standing right behind him . "
Mitchell , for one , wonders how his fellow students felt that day .
" When I see the people , other people that I stood on the stage with , I 'm thinking to myself : I wonder if they feel like I do , " he said .
" Because that might have been a big day for them too , as well , as it is for me . "
" That was the biggest day of my life , " Mitchell continued , " and I think that 's going to be the biggest day of my life . "
The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown .
It may be frail — its roof may shake — the wind may blow through it — the storm may enter — the rain may enter — but the King of England cannot enter — all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement !
~ William Pitt
Have no fear , America !
Despite the claims of alarmists , the United States is not coming underneath the type of steely totalitarian gauntlet where we need fear a knock at the door .
No , your Supreme Court has eliminated that fearful scenario .
Instead , there will be no knock .
In its June 15th ruling in Hudson v Michigan , the Supreme Court has basically eviscerated the requirement that there be a knock on the door by authorities before the execution of a search warrant .
While the prohibition essentially remains in form , the penalty for the failure to knock has lost its major deterrent force — the exclusionary rule .
Quite simply , what the exclusionary rule did was to exclude from the available evidence at trial any evidence that was obtained from a violation of the standards for execution of a search warrant .
One of these search warrant standards is ( or more aptly , was ) the requirement that police knock and announce themselves .
While the court has formerly whittled away at this requirement through the use of certain " exigent circumstances , " Hudson effectively lays the practice of knocking in a shallow grave .
While the death of the knock is in itself troubling enough , the Court ’s rationale may be even more troubling .
The Court , relying on the ever arbitrary and equally dubious " balancing test , " weighed the " deterrence benefits " of the use of the exclusionary rule against its " social costs . "
Such social calculus always provides an interesting insight into the mind of the Court .
For the majority , " social costs " consist of such factors as ( 1 ) " a constant flood " of legal challenges for alleged failures to observe the knock and announce rule , ( 2 ) the risk that " officers would be inclined to wait longer than the law requires " after knocking ( and we all know that SWAT team types truly tend to agonize decisions before springing into action ) , and ( 3 ) that the delay after knocking ( in the past , three seconds has been viewed by the Court as adequate wait time ) provides time for the destruction of evidence and the arming of dangerous suspects .
Conversely , the " deterrence benefits " of the exclusionary rule as a check on rampant police aggression are viewed as minimal .
Rather , an aggrieved party who has been the victim of a knock and announce violation can file a civil rights law suit .
But even more surreal is the Court ’s contention that such law suits might not even be necessary because of the " increasing professionalism of police forces , including a new emphasis on internal police discipline . "
Who could argue with that ?
One can almost take a perverse pleasure in watching the " originalist " and " textualist " Justice Antonin Scalia hypocritically perform the arbitrary balancing test that girds so many of the Court ’s pro-State rulings .
It is not explained ( if explainable at all ) how the supposed " constant flow " of legal challenges to the knock requirement at criminal trial is somehow more onerous to the court system than the constant flow of civil rights law suits which the Court views as a more proper remedy .
Of course the real benefit to the aspiring authoritarian state is that those civil rights law suit would most likely be pursued by people in prison .
A deterrent to police abuse indeed !
Likewise , the timing issue surrounding a proper knock is bizarrely treated .
One is left to ask how much crack cocaine can be flushed down a toilet if the scruple - ridden cops wait 10 seconds ( instead of the permissible three seconds ) after knocking and is the preservation of such a paltry amount worth calling in the jack - booted thugs ?
Additionally , is n’t it the über - ninja style raids that send panicked suspects grabbing for their guns in the first place ?
What happened to the film noir scenes of the cops telling Mugsy that the jig is up , the joint is surrounded , and he better come out with his hands held high ?
As an insulting coup de grâce for this injurious constitutional coup d’état , the Court assures us that law enforcement has had Original Sin exorcised at the new and improved police academy .
Justice Scalia writes that concerns about police behavior may have been valid in 1980 but that now " we now have increasing evidence that police forces across the United States take the constitutional rights of citizens seriously . "
While on one level such a statement is worth a gasp and a chortle , on another level Scalia writes the truth — for as constitutional rights are stripped away by the Supreme Court , there are fewer and fewer police behaviors that are violative of the law .
By legalizing thuggery , thuggish law enforcement is not only christened but encouraged .
But the heralding of contemporary law enforcement as the new Soviet man is instructive as to how the Court sees itself .
There is no thought of " inalienable rights " or the 9th Amendment .
The much - feared " natural law " of Clarence Thomas is not to be found .
Instead , with the Hudson decision , the Supreme Court has not only laid a firm foundation for a police state , they have reminded us that we the people are the ruled and they are the rulers .
They are the wise balancers of scales .
They are the sole guardians of justice .
They are the ultimate guarantors of our rights .
So help us God .

Most classroom learning sucks
The problem with most corporate / adult learning programs is that they 're just like school .
And the problem with school is that it sucks .
It works against the way the brain wants to learn .
The best learning occurs in a stimulating , active , challenging , interesting , engaging environment .
It 's how the brain works .
The best learning occurs when you move at least some part of your body .
The best learning occurs when you 're actively involved in co-constructing knowledge in your own head , not passively reading or listening .
( Taking notes does n't really count as being actively involved . )
People complain that their kids can't pay attention in school , then their kid comes home and spends two hours studying the elaborate world of Halo 2 .
Reading , absorbing , problem solving , using sophisticated mental maps , and on it goes .
When learning is " presented " in a push model , your brain says , " This is SO not important . "
You 're in for the battle of your life when you try to compete against the brain 's natural instinct to scan for unusual , novel , possibly life - threatening or life - enhancing things .
Forcing people to sit in a chair and listen ( or read ) dry , formal words ( with perhaps only a few token images thrown in ) is the slowest , least effective , and most painful path to learning .
Yet it 's the approach you see replicated in everything from K - 12 , to universities , to adult / corporate training .
Skyler ( my switcher - daughter ) was fortunate enough to go to a private school until 6th grade .
In that school , there were no classrooms .
There was no teacher - at - the - front rows of chairs thing .
Kids sat where they wanted to do their work -- on the floor , on the deck , at the kitchen table , whatever worked for them .
There were no lectures , no formal lessons .
When kids needed help on a " project " , they asked , and one of the teachers helped them .
If a few kids were dealing with the same thing , the teacher might take them into what looked like a little corporate conference room , for an ad - hoc session .
Even then , the teacher was more like a mentor / guide , and not the " sage on the stage " .
Kids were allowed to work on whatever they wanted , as long as they were fulfilling , somehow , their goals to include geography , math , language , etc .
And each kid had his entire curriculum custom - made for his personal interests .
For the things that turned his brain on .
One kid was obsessed with dinosaurs , so with the help of his teacher , he designed his entire first year around dinosaurs .
Everything he did was based on learning more about dinosaurs .
Math was based on calculating sizes and dates , and making his own categorizations .
Language was , well , he had to learn to read if he wanted to learn about his passion .
Geography was based around researching the areas where different dinosaurs lived at different times , creating timelines , etc .
Another kid's father frequently traveled on business , and his son was fascinated with hearing the stories his father told about the places he went .
So they built a program around the hotel brochures his father brought back .
He learned to read the brochures , then to work out the distances between the different hotels , and even make little spreadsheets to calculate expenses and work out budgets , etc .
The important thing was that they took the time to discover what the kids were passionate about , and used that as a vehicle for motivation .
Kids are n't motivated about geography .
They 're motivated by where dinosaurs lived , or where their dad is today .
They are n't motivated by arithmetic .
They 're motivated by how big dinosaurs are or calculating which hotel their dad should visit .
And that 's just the first year .
By the next year , they 've done the dinosaur / hotel thing to death and they 're ready for something completely different .
The idea of weaving everything — math , science , language , history , geography , whatever — into a framework that capitalizes on the learner 's passion was the most dramatic example of powerful education that I 'd ever seen .
Her school had no grades , and no homework .
Ever .
It was a leap of faith for most of the parents , that somehow your kids were keeping pace with their counterparts in the " normal " school system , especially since most of us knew that we could n't afford this forever , and that our kids would all eventually make their way into public schools to finish out .
The school did give standardized tests , and the typical score for the kids in the high 80's to 90's percentile against the national average for their grade .
Even more importantly , most kids left 6th grade scoring at least two years ahead of their public school ( and every bit as intelligent ) peers .
The most depressing result of Skyler 's transition to public school was when she came home one day a few weeks into her 7th grade , and said , " In real school , they do n't seem to like it when you question the teacher ... "
She was horrified to be labeled somewhat of a troublemaker , because she 'd been treated for so many years as a thinking person , encouraged to challenge and question and not assume it was her fault if she did n't understand something .
Suddenly dropped into the US public school system , she quickly learned that it's a very different world .
She knew more about learning theory and the brain than most of her school 's administration , and her tolerance for poor / weak educational experiences was pretty low .
She did have some fabulous teachers throughout the rest of her public school days , but would n't you know it -- they were always the teachers getting into trouble with the school administration or even parent 's groups .
In a later post I 'll tell you a shocking story about one of her teachers who made the national news , twice , for encouraging students to think -- and act -- for themselves .
He was nearly fired during a witch hunt that both local and national media seized on ( although most later offered apologies when it became obvious what was really going on ) .
One of the biggest mistakes adult learning programs and learners can make , in my opinion , is to use traditional school as the model .
It does n't work for kids , and it does n't work for adults .
Because it does n't work for the brain .
I know there are enormous challenges and pressures for delivering public school learning ( that so many teachers do n't have the option or power to change ) , but most adult education programs that follow the same poor model do n't have those excuses .
In many cases , adult classroom training looks like school just because that 's how it always looks .
There are a lot of interesting and wonderful exceptions in the adult learning world , of course , and a lot of novel things being done with everything from arrangement of chairs in the room to the role of the instructor as facilitator rather than " teacher " , and I 'll say more on that later .
But for the most part , we 're still using the same approach that , given the pace of information change today , is even LESS useful than it was in the past .
We need a big change .
[ Update : several people have asked about Skyler 's school -- it was Manhattan Academy in Manhattan Beach California .
Be sure to read their philosophy section ; when Skyler was there they really meant these things .
Too many schools have a nice set of bullet points about their values , but putting them into practice is a different thing .
Manhattan Academy walked the walk . ]

Ok , I 'm seriously envious of Skyler 's 1 - 6 education .
Sounds like a blast .
If only all our schools would wake up and do it right !

Was a part of a group that wrote a grant proposal to develop a 3d engine to build engaging curriculum like this last year and were turned down .
Not only were we turned down but the phrase " video games will NEVER be a part of the public school curriculum " came back with the rejection notice .
Was not overly enlightening .
Currently , I am teaching a software architecture class using your HF Design Patterns as a model ( unfortunately I was two weeks behind discovering it to spec it for the class ) but you should see the response from the students .
They literally start each class with zero energy and by the end of it a. dont want to stop and b. are dancing all around excited .
It 's alot more fun than trying to open up their heads and pour in the information ( which is n't possible anyway ) .
Making it fun and engaging makesthem want to learn more .
So I know that this works !
Some of the responsibility lies in the laziness ( too harsh ? ) of teachers .
It 's the time to make the donuts syndrome .
That gets transmitted to the students jsut as enthusiasm is infectious so is apathy .
heh this is a rant that could go on ad nauseum and probably already has . . .

Unfortunately the university system is no better .
One of the worst teachers I 've ever encountered was numerical analysis prof at Yale that , and this is very close to a quote , told us one day in class " you have to suffer to learn . "
The pretty much summarizes her brilliant teaching style as well .
If you asked her to write Head First Numerical Analysis , you 'd get back S&M Numerical Analysis .
I 'm happy to report she did n't get tenure ( although that obviously has NOTHING to do with teaching ) . ;)
That said , there 's a few brilliant teachers there that fully get it .

I agree with everything you say , and have tried to live this in the University engineering design courses that I have taught .
Interestingly enough there 's a great paper called ( IIRC ) " The Two Sigma Problem " in which the author describes how individual attention can help any student achieve excellence .
However there is a catch .
Everything you describe works well if there is a student : teacher ratio of about ( personal opinion ) 10:1 which does not seem to be reasonable under current administrations .

Love this post !
My 3 - year - old son started Montessori school last year .
They learn much the same way , choosing their own projects and doing whatever excites them while learning at the same time .
I 've seen him grow in self - confidence and in a willingness to try things out , even if he 's never done them before .
It 's too bad adults in the business world often are n't allowed to experience their work the same way .

This is right on !
I teach at a Sudbury School , Greenwood Sudbury School ( www.greenwood.nu) in Connecticut , which is probably similar to the experience Skyler had at her school .
One difference is that we extend this model through the entire K - 12 experience .
Students aged 5 - 19 mix with each other , sharing learning and play , and are free to explore their interests as fully as they want .
( And they do want ! )
Transitioning to college is not difficult for the teens after they graduate , either .
Sudbury Valley School has published studies over the last 40 years where they show something like 80 - 90 % of their graduates go on to graduate from college .
And this is coming from a school that has no transcript , no grades , no tests .
Adults , on their own , learn in a similar manner .
How many times have you been interested in a subject , and you might sit down with a book and delve into it , think about it all the time , play and experiment with new ideas ?
Learning is fun , and the only reason it's not for most people in our society is that it 's been beaten out of them .

We made a great game for teaching electromagnetism here http://www.educationarcade.org/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=7
which was really successful .
Right now , though , all the focus kinda shifted to teaching high school history .

The Inaugural Game Programming in Schools Conference
Melbourne , Friday September 9th 2005
Victoria Australia
Literature on school improvement is full of exhortations to make the content of instruction " relevant . " ……..
But if one does belong to a culture in which video games are important , transforming oneself from a consumer to a producer of games may well be an even more powerful way for some children to find importance in what they are doing .
Preface by Seymour Papert to Minds in Play by Yasmin Kafai
This conference will explore the learning theory underpinning game programming in schools .
Speakers from around Australia will share best practice in using game programming as a relevant , authentic and highly motivating task which develops higher order cognitive and metacognitive skills .
It is a unique opportunity to network with leaders from around Australia in this rapidly growing area .

Jason Foster makes a good point about student - teacher ratios .
In the public school system , it is cheaper to continue doing things in the same manner .
That way they can squeeze 30 - 35 students into a classroom with one teacher ( and within that classroom are students of various abilities and levels ) .
People would not want to pay the increase in their taxes to fund such schools across the province or country .
There would also be outcry from some of the public if they thought students were just " sitting " around doing whatever they wanted .
You can not please everyone when it comes to education .
What did a school like this do with the unmotivated students ?
What about students who would not want to do anything no matter how hard the teacher tries to motivate them .
They would just sit and listen to music or play video games .
How does the teacher in the MA school deal with this behaviour ?
Do they fail ?
Also , I think it is unrealistic to say to children that they do n't have to take home work that they could not complete in class time .
What kind of job does n't have some take home work sometimes ?
When I was a student , I would often see students playing cards on their spares instead of getting work done .
This does n't make sense to me , especially with all of the pressure to complete the new harder curriculum ( here in Ontario ) .

So - called " hands - on " learning is simply overstated .
The so - called benefits are actually not benefits .
Nothing works best than traditional teaching , in my opinion , as it is the method to effectively teach to a large classroom , as well as to enable an instructor to complete the objectives put out by professional organizations , state boards , etc. in a timely manner .
The idea of having a student have his entire semester make use of " dinosaurs " is a joke .
This is nothing more than trying to make learning " fun " .
All this does is dumb - down learning and dilute content , all in the name of improving the child 's self - esteem and making school more entertaining for the child .
I am a traditional teacher .
I have the students copy notes .
Five years in a row , my students have outperformed my collegues ' students , individuals who have hands - on instructors that believe that the idea of instruction is full of labs and hands - on activities .
Last year , I did not have one student fail the state standardized test .
My colleagues , on the other hand , had close to ten to fifteen fail the same exact test .
So go on , continue teaching in a manner that is optimal only in controlled settings .
Something that is completely impractical to today 's classroom , not to mention a method that does not challenge a student enough to be able to build in - depth knowledge .
If you want to believe the contemporary , liberal learning theorists , your students will suffer .

Actually adult learning for some reason often includes more playing .
It was a wonderful story I could n't help reading .
But I 'm wondering how big is the problem of changing schools ?
is n't the impact on the child 's psychology too huge ?
Posted by : School Teacher | Nov 24 , 2005 2:27:42 AM
Good article , but I want to observe that many educators are aware of this -- and their efforts just make things worse .
In my experience , the biggest block to students ' learning is that they do n't even know what it really is ; geography is learning maps , but somehow avoids learning what maps really are , and why they matter ( beyond " if you want to go somewhere " , which kids do n't ) .
Your daughter 's school had one way to fix that ; and in general , when that 's fixed , learning becomes fun .
Posted by : Joshua | Dec 10 , 2005 3:30:28 PM
I just love this post .
I am doing a presentation on fun in the classroom and I would like to quote you .
Furthermore , I am having such frustration with my daughter 's school .
She has traveled already to over 10 countries and her school criticized her for missing math homework .
Moreover , I 'm afraid she is doing less well in school becuase it is so boring .
Where is the school ?
I would really like to look into that .
Thanks !

You 're students were able to pass a standardized test .
That means that they 're better at rote memorization than their peers .
It does n't mean that they understand all the notes you made them copy , or that they can apply it to real life .
If you seriously judge your teaching ability based on government standardized tests than you are one shitty teacher .

That would be valid if his collegues ' students could pass the test and have fun , too .
The later does not supercede the former .
That is not the case : some alternative methods apparently fail to teach the most basic things .
Without foundation , you can't continue learning further .
If a child has difficulty with multipliaction , then exponents and logarithms wo n't come easy .
And wait until they see the dreaded integrals of trigometric functions
( or the method of cylindrical shells if you prefer applications ) .
Maybe a few very * talented * teachers can get away with a non-structured curriculum and still teach to motivate their pupils enough to learn all the hard sciences and social sciences .
More power to them .
However , only in a perfect world would you have so many super - talented teachers available .
And what if you have a below - average teacher totally losing the students who end up fooling around ?
I doubt the state 's tests were designed with PhD graduates in mind - they are more likely to be a bit on the easy side .
If alternative methods fail there , throw them out .
I do n't believe learning should be " painful " as a criteria , but neither should it be " easy . "
The idea is to pass on knowledge to the next generation .
It 's that simple .
You do whatever you 've got to do to get the job done .
If you can sign and dance and somehow ( doubtful ) learn about electrolysis , then that 's wonderful .
I am exaggerating here but do n't discount repetition / reinforcement as an important method of learning .
There has to be a balance between engaging interest and teaching , evaluating the standards .
By the way , the quizzes , tests and exams are a very good time - tested " stick " that complements the " carrot " of getting praised for a good grade .
This may seem old - fashioned but if you throw away these strong incentives , you could be doing more harm than good .
If a teacher sacrifices too much of " passing knowledge " for " entertaining students " , they should be on the comedy channel .
The students need to be ready for the next stage of learning if they choose to .
Imagine the frustration if you like healing and medicine , go to college and realize that you have n't encountered half of the jargon in a physics class because it was n't related to your interest but it turns out physics counts for a lot on MCAT !
I have to side with Paul Parker here .
1 ) I do n't understand the deal with North America trying to re-invent the wheel .
The students are failing and every year there 's a cry to make learning " fun " and " relevant " and whatever .
Here 's the crux of the matter why many American students are not motivated to learn :
- Football players , rappers and movie stars are praised in our culture ( e.g. TV ) a lot more than literature critics , archeologists or cohomology theorists .
- They do n't learn self - discipline and hard work early enough in elementary school .
It 's a joke over here in many schools .
- Singapore , Central and Eastern European countries , I believe , have descent public school education .
Yes , there are exceptions where some students are handicapped and require special attention .
Surely , it is not true that the average student is mentally challenged !
Yes , to an extent learning should not be " dreaded " but that is no reason to water it down .
The standards have a reason .
The same reason why we have accreditations , professional licenses etc .
It simply reduces uncertainty in ability of strangers .
Extreme example : imagine if you were n't sure whether your doctor studied hotel brochures or genetics .
What if you were wrongfully accused and your lawyer studied only law as it is applicable to dinosaurs ?
I am disgusted to see how a grade 11 student brags about getting through school not knowing how to multiply because he has a pocket calculator .
How much misuse has resulted from not knowing the tools !
No wonder some students here do n't even notice that when you square radical equations , some of the roots may not " work , " yet not everyone checks .
We have so much technology in our calculus that some students do n't even learn that z^ ( x+y ) is generally not equal to z^x+z^y .
I think technology is wonderful but care needs to be taken to explain what 's going on behind the scenes in theory , too .
No wonder they struggle proving theorems .
Few but the best educators would be able to preserve complete rigor of classical geometry or real analysis and make it " math in your life . "
I am not counting a few examples about shadows or something like that but general way of thinking .
2 ) The games at MIT may show great potential !
That looks like it could have a good balance of theory and applied work .
3 ) The opening post has some merit but , in my humble opinion , it over emphacises the hands - on approach too much .
Yes , it 's great for some students .
Others learn better by listening and others yet by ( gasp ) by motor memory of doing 50 exercises on the multiplication table .
4 ) Some students find the flexibility of pure mathematical abstractions no less interesting and , perhaps , more beautiful than any dinosaur - bone counting .
E.g. Fibonacci numbers and golden mean ratio reappear in seeming different appliations and not the other way around .
Mathematics * could * explain the real world , but it does't have to .
5 ) What if a student has a latent talent in quantum physics or fungi taxonomy but never develops an interest because they did n't know they had a passion for it ?
How many young people do n't know what they want to do with their lives even in early 20s ?
Many do not know .
I do n't think it 's wise or reasonable to let children and teenagers effectively set their own curriculum .
Yes , they may have a passion for dinosaurs or tanks at early age but only a few will actually want to become paleontologists or army officers .
Some passions during childhood are only temporary .
Realize that there is an inherent trade - off between learning a few marginal topics about one interest and actually learning several disciplines from foundations up without skipping " unrelated to dinosaurs " topics .
Whatever happened to the idea of liberal arts education : expose students to concepts , even a little against their will , because they can't make informed decisions without trying a bit of everything .
Here we are talking about learning different languages , not " trying out " different drugs :) .

I think that both alternative forms of schooling and the public school systems suck .
The problem is that you do n't have any balance between what is fun , and what is serious .
And what is taken seriously within academics , is n't taken seriously by the teachers .
Teachers create religious , political , emotional , racial , and social bias .
This causes problems between a lot of teacher - student relationships , since teachers generally teach what they grew up experiencing .
Some of these things are important , but they are often many years old and belong to the history books .
If you throw out all of the trash the American schools put
into their curriculum , you get reading , writing , and arithmetic .
If you teach these basic subjects solely to students in K - 8 grade , they would definately be capable to pass most standardized tests normally given to high schoolers who sometimes fail .
Standardized learning needs to be standardized .
It needs to have a national standard , with a standarized platform .
If myself were to decide , I would have children learning their basics on computers and have teachers there to babysit and help in any way they are able .
They are obviously very good at doing that , as many of you have stated in previous comments .
High school should be able to teach more modern trades , advanced subject matter , and things that stimulate adolecent minds which are more focused on what is happening in the present .
These can include computer programming , operation , and repair ; basic electrical engineering , physics , computer aided design , economics , philosophy , family values , health , and fine arts .
They need to be able to form ideas , and take information that is truely useful to the real world as it is , but not totally mis-informed , which is what history is for .
That is why high school students are disillusioned with the system that they have to put up with on a daily basis , anyways .

Balance , moderation is the key to life really , and education is no different .
I like the post that said the main point of teaching is passing knowledge from one generation to another .
How should we do that ?
the same way ?
Has n't this generation learned better ways to pass that knowledge on ?
Havn't we discovered things like multiple intelligences and learning styles that we can use to make that passing of knowledge more interesting , more relevant , and more available to more students ?
This is America .
The land of We Can Make it Better .
Why should our schools settle for teaching the same way we learned ?
In addition , we do n't need every teacher in the country to be fantastic , we just need enough to make sure that more children that have the potential are being tapped and brought to their potential and extended beyond the minimum level standards that everyone seems content with .
The political and ecomonic climate for the next ten years will continue to be of the pass the knowledge at the minimum level - mindset .
That 's too bad , but at least we know there are schools out there that are preparing the best and brightest that can afford it .

From a skimming / reading of the responses here , I wonder how many have closely read the posting .
" as long as they were fulfilling , somehow , their goals to include geography , math , language , etc .
And each kid had his entire curriculum custom - made for his personal interests . "
I come from a family of teachers , and I throughly applaud these teachers , who every day meet the challenge of helping children to learn all of these subjects while blending with the kid 's interests .
I am not complaining or griping about teachers in a standard situation , they go through fire daily as well , but they are very hampered by rules , regulations , political and internal games , security and definitely paperwork and a lack of support .
Standard school teachers would love to be able to teach their students , draw the students in more by use of their interests , to help their students , and so forth .
The current situation does not foster that very well , if at all .

Awesome post !
Thanks for letting us know about the school ( Manhattan Academy ) it 's great that they give kids such a wonderful early start .
Public schools in my experience at least just pass on irrelevant information from generation to generation .
The same things someone learns about now are the same things that someone else learned about in the 60's or 70's and people wonder why we are n't farther ahead as a society ?

The comments to this entry are closed .
The former Soviet Union 's Venera -13 and Venera - 14 were identical spacecraft , both successfully landing on Venus in March 1982 .
Beefed up imagery taken from the hellish surface of Venus nearly 25 years ago is offering new glimpses of that strange landscape .
Don Mitchell of Redmond , Washington is a retired researcher from Bell Labs and Microsoft Research .
He has matched his computer science and image processing skills with a passion to study old Soviet spacecraft data .
One result of this high - tech harmony of interests has been a relook at imagery relayed via twin Venera - 13 and 14 probes that landed on Venus in 1982 .
Mitchell obtained the original data from the two landers with the help of the designer of the Venera cameras , Yuri Gektin .
[ New images : Hills / Landscape ]
Surprising results
Processing of the Venera lander imagery was done in several stages , Mitchell explained .
The biggest task was first taking multiple transmissions - live and from tape - then merging them to produce one very clean master copy of each of four spacecraft cameras .
Venera -13 and 14 each had two cameras .
A new camera calibration function was calculated .
That conversion teased out a lot of the very dark and very light regions caught by Venera cameras , Mitchell said , detail not brought out in the original Russian photo reduction work .
Surprisingly , in the case of Venera - 13 , distant hills hazily seen were clearly revealed .
To produce the images , Mitchell mixed in in special purpose source code , resampling , and other image wizardry , along with knowledge about dimensions of the Venera lander and location of its camera lens .
He was able to preserve the original sharpness of the Venera surface pictures .
A series of projected views were combined in Photoshop .
A few missing spots at the horizon were filled in by duplicated or reversing other portions of the image .
" So there is a little artistic license ... but not very much , " Mitchell told SPACE.com .
A task still ahead is color processing of the Venera imagery .
" Fully accurate calibration of the color has not yet been done by anyone , " he said .
Critical calibration data is coming from Russian colleague , Gektin .
Fun challenge
Why take a new look at old space imagery ?
Mitchell said he first worked in space physics , but switched to a career in computer science and image processing .
" It 's fun to come back to some space science again and also find challenging image - processing problems , " Mitchell said .
" By challenging , I mean things you cannot just do with Photoshop . "
Mitchell said he 's labored over the reconstruction of the Venera - 9 and Venera - 10 images .
" Currently , I am starting to work on the Venera - 9 orbiter images , which very few people have seen . "
In studying the Venera - series of spacecraft sent to cloud - veiled Venus from the mid-1970s into the early 1980s , Mitchell explained that he 's become absorbed in the space history of it all .
" It 's time to start telling objective stories about all the fascinating things done in the Soviet space program , " Mitchell added .
" I 'm proud of American achievements ... glad to see socialism decline .
But I hate it when people make their politics into the subtext of writings about science and history . "
Mitchell hopes to avoid that issue as much as possible while working on his book on the Soviet exploration of Venus .
Posh Spice , who claims she has never read a book , is about to find out ( if she can be bothered to read this ) .
We all learn to read but what happens in adult life when we fail to keep this up ?
Does the brain shrink like a withered prune ?
Studies in America found that continued intellectual activity from age 20 to 60 may protect against dementia in later life .
One study found that continuing intellectual pursuits reduced the risk of Alzheimer 's disease by a third .
In another study , relatively inactive patients were 250 % more likely to develop Alzheimer's .
Damaged brains can adapt and learn .
Researchers who have used brain scanners have found that other parts of the brain can compensate .
But exercising the brain , in much the same way one would exercise a damaged muscle , perhaps by repeating a list of items , does not help regrowth .
Are you going to benefit more by reading Shakespeare than Vogue ?
It probably does n't matter as long as the brain is exposed to new information that stimulates your cells .
Luckily for Posh ( author , as is her husband , of an autobiography ) physical activity also counts .
Whether physical exercise is as beneficial as intellectual activity remains unknown .
Before Sir Ian McKellen took the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy , Sir Sean Connery was sought for the part .
New Line Cinema even offered him 10 to 15 percent of the worldwide box office earnings to get him aboard .
However , Sean Connery declined the offer because he did n’t understand the story .
New Line were indicating that having a major name like Connery was necessary in order for them to green - light the film .
They asked us if we would agree to send a copy of the Fellowship screenplay to Sean with a view to enticing him to play Gandalf .
I could n’t imagine him wanting to spend eighteen months in New Zealand , and I did n’t think they could afford his fee , but [ Mark ]
Ordesky [ the film ’s executive producer ] told me New Line were going to offer a small fee in exchange for a large slice of the gross .
Had Sean Connery accepted , he would have earned anywhere between $ 289 million and $ 433 million which would have gone down in history as the highest earnings from a single screen role than any actor has made in the history of motion pictures .
They say they do n’t think Sean Connery regrets not taking the role .
I would say this regret ranks right up there with not using a condom on that $ 5 hooker and punching Mike Tyson in the face .

Scientists from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , South Africa , and the University of Chicago have uncovered a remarkably well - preserved fossil lamprey from the Devonian period that reveals today 's lampreys as " living fossils " since they have remained largely unaltered for 360 million years .
Chicago 's Michael Coates ( homepage ) , PhD , joined Witwatersrand 's Bruce Rubidge , PhD , and graduate student and lead author Rob Gess to describe the new find in the article , " A lamprey from the Devonian of South Africa " to be published in the October 26 , 2006 , issue of the journal Nature .
" Apart from being the oldest fossil lamprey yet discovered , this fossil shows that lampreys have been parasitic for at least 360 million years , " said Rubidge , director of the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research .

Haditha , Bush & Nuremberg 's Law By Peter Dyer
June 6 , 2006 Editor 's Note :
As the U.S. military completes its investigation of the alleged murder of 24 Iraqi civilians at the hands of U.S. Marines last November in Haditha , the next phase likely will be some form of court martial against Marines implicated in the case .
If that happens , President George W. Bush has made clear that he expects justice to be meted out to any Marine found guilty of a war crime against Iraqi civilians .
But , as we anticipated in an earlier article , virtually no U.S. media attention has focused on the Nuremberg principles and Bush 's culpability in the crime .
In this guest essay , Peter Dyer reviews the principles of international law that were set by U.S. and other allied jurists after World War II , rules against aggressive war that were meant to apply to the architects of illegal conflicts as well as to the grunts on the ground : G eorge W. Bush -- in his first public comment on the alleged massacre of 24 civilians by U.S. Marines in Haditha , Iraq , last November -- said :  If , in fact , these allegations are true , the Marine Corps will work hard to make sure that ... those who violated the law -- if indeed they did -- will be punished .
Now that President Bush has resolved publicly that those who committed war crimes will be punished , the subject of U.S. war crimes may begin to move closer to its deserved prominent place in the American public discourse .
If this happens , more Americans are likely to realize that the man who spoke of punishing war criminals has himself violated the law and should be accordingly punished .
In fact , according to the Nuremberg Charter , a document which the U.S. had a major role in drafting , those who initiate a war of aggression quite literally bear individual criminal responsibility , not only for waging unprovoked war , but for the war crimes which inevitably flow from aggression .
In 1946 , the chief American prosecutor of the first Nuremberg trial , U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson , took this principle seriously enough to help secure the conviction of 17 of the most prominent surviving German leaders for initiating a war of aggression .
Eleven were sentenced to death .
Three received life sentences and three received lesser sentences .
Reading the transcript of the first Nuremberg trial , we see that all who committed war crimes , from the foot soldiers to the highest leaders , were to be held responsible for their crimes .
We also see , however , that the leaders who initiated the aggression were assigned primary criminal responsibility by the prosecutors and by the Tribunal , since none of the subsequent crimes would have been committed had the aggression not occurred .
This principle was absolutely central to the Nuremberg Charter and Trials .
Moreover , we see that the intent of the authors of the Charter was not to limit the principles involved in this body of law to prosecution of Germans in 1946 but rather to set a precedent for all times and for all countries , including the United States .
Article 6 of the Charter states :  The following acts , or any of them , are crimes coming within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for which there shall be individual responsibility : ( a ) CRIMES AGAINST PEACE : namely , planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression , or a war in violation of international treaties , agreements or assurances , or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing ; ... Leaders , organizers , instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan . 
And from Article 7 :  The official position of defendants , whether as Heads of State or responsible officials in Government Departments , shall not be considered as freeing them from responsibility or mitigating punishment .
On Aug. 12 , 1945 , three months before the trial began , Justice Jackson made the intent of the American prosecution and of the law clear in a statement on the War Trials Agreement :  If we can cultivate in the world the idea that aggressive war - making is the way to the prisoner 's dock rather than the way to honors , we will have accomplished something toward making the peace more secure .
... We must make clear to the Germans that the wrong for which their fallen leaders are on trial is not that they lost the war , but that they started it .
Bearing in mind the relationship of the Marines now awaiting trial for the Haditha massacre to their Commander - in - Chief and his subordinates , Justice Jacksons words in his Nov. 21 , 1945 , opening statement concerning the German leaders then on trial go to the heart of the matter :
 These defendants were men of a station and rank which does not soil its own hands with blood .
They were men who knew how to use lesser folk as tools .
We want to reach the planners and designers , the inciters and leaders without whose evil architecture the world would not have been for so long scourged with the violence and lawlessness , and wracked with the agonies and convulsions , of this terrible war .
... We have here the surviving top politicians , militarists , financiers , diplomats , administrators , and propagandists , of the Nazi movement .
Who was responsible for these crimes if they were not ?
If we bear in mind that the U.S. aggression in Iraq was a violation not only of the Nuremberg Charter but of the U.N. Charter ( Article 2 , Sec. 4 and Articles 39 and 51 ) and if we remember the several shifting justifications for the aggression presented by the Bush administration , Justice Jacksons later words that day resonate today for us and for President Bush :
 The very minimum legal consequence of the treaties making aggressive wars illegal is to strip those who incite or wage them of every defense the law ever gave , and to leave war - makers subject to judgment by the usually accepted principles of the law of crimes .
...
Our position is that whatever grievances a nation may have , however objectionable it finds the status quo , aggressive warfare is an illegal means for settling those grievances or for altering those conditions .
And speaking to the concept of individual responsibility for war criminals at the highest levels , then and in the future , Justice Jackson said :  The ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars , which are inevitable in a system of international lawlessness , is to make statesmen responsible to law .
And let me make clear that while this law is first applied against German aggressors , the law includes , and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations , including those which sit here now in judgment .
We are able to do away with domestic tyranny and violence and aggression by those in power against the rights of their own people only when we make all men answerable to the law .
This trial represents mankind 's desperate effort to apply the discipline of the law to statesmen who have used their powers of state to attack the foundations of the world 's peace and to commit aggressions against the rights of their neighbors .
In his closing statement for the American prosecution , July 26 , 1946 , Justice Jackson hammered again at the relationship between the criminals at the bottom and the criminals at the top :  The gist of the offense is participation in the formulation or execution of the plan .
These are rules which every society has found necessary in order to reach men , like these defendants , who never get blood on their own hands but who lay plans that result in the shedding of blood .
All over Germany today , in every zone of occupation , little men who carried out these criminal policies under orders are being convicted and punished .
It would present a vast and unforgivable caricature of justice if the men who planned these policies and directed these little men should escape all penalty .
On Oct. 1 , 1946 , judgment was delivered by the Nuremberg Tribunal .
From the judgment :  To initiate a war of aggression , therefore , is not only an international crime ; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole .
... Crimes against international law are committed by men , not by abstract entities , and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced . 
The simple truth is that had President Bush not ordered an illegal war of aggression , the 24 civilians in Haditha , along with countless thousands of other Iraqis and Americans , would be alive today .
Justice Jacksons last sentence in his closing statement , July 26 , 1946 , concerns the German leaders on trial at the time , but speaks to contemporary American leaders as well :  If you were to say of these men that they are not guilty , it would be as true to say that there has been no war , there are no slain , there has been no crime . 

Purdue suspends 14 students , including 13 athletes , for party that violated Pledge
For second time this semester , Purdue suspended students for breaking a new student conduct rule that bans parties and other Protect Purdue Pledge violations .
This time , 14 students , including 13 athletes , were caught partying in a dorm .
A few years ago I was visiting Bahrain and sitting with friends in a fish restaurant when news appeared on an overhead TV about Muslim terrorists , men and women , who had taken hostages in Russia .
What struck me , though , was the instinctive reaction of the Bahraini businessman sitting next to me , who muttered under his breath , " Why are we in every story ? "
The " we " in question was Muslims .
The answer to that question is one of the most important issues in geopolitics today :
Why are young Sunni Muslim males , from London to Riyadh and Bali to Baghdad , so willing to blow up themselves and others in the name of their religion ?
Of course , not all Muslims are suicide bombers ; it would be ludicrous to suggest that .
But virtually all suicide bombers , of late , have been Sunni Muslims .
There are a lot of angry people in the world .
Angry Mexicans .
Angry Africans .
Angry Norwegians .
But the only ones who seem to feel entitled and motivated to kill themselves and totally innocent people , including other Muslims , over their anger are young Sunni radicals .
What is going on ?
Neither we nor the Muslim world can run away from this question any longer .
This is especially true when it comes to people like Muhammad Bouyeri -- a Dutch citizen of Moroccan origin who last year tracked down the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh , a critic of Islamic intolerance , on an Amsterdam street , shot him 15 times and slit his throat with a butcher knife .
He told a Dutch court on the final day of his trial on Tuesday : " I take complete responsibility for my actions .
I acted purely in the name of my religion . "
Austin , Tex .
WILL STOVALL , a history student in his fifth and final year as an undergraduate at the University of Texas , returned from studying in Mexico last fall determined to go to law school .
In service of this goal , he resolved to work harder , which meant he would have little chance to see old friends or to acquire new ones , and that , in turn , seemed to require a very particular kind of domestic arrangement .
“ My thinking was that I would n’t have time to make a social life , so I needed to have people around , ” said Mr. Stovall , who looks as if he has spent much of his life on the verge of hoisting a spinnaker .
Instead of renting an apartment , the custom for most seniors , he moved into French House , one of 15 cooperative living facilities run by students on the university ’s campus .
“ People shudder when I say this , ” he said , “ but a co-op is very much like a frat , without all the fratty people . ”
After a fallow period in the 1980 ’s and much of the 90’s , residential co-ops , where students cook and clean for themselves , have undergone a renaissance at the University of Texas and on other campuses across the country .
About 10,000 students are living in co-ops in the United States and Canada , said Jim Jones , former executive director of the North American Students of Cooperation and a historian of trends in communal living .
That figure is roughly as high as it was during the two liveliest periods of the co-op movement : the late 1940 ’s , when cooperative housing emerged as a cost - efficient alternative to dormitory living for returning G.I. ’s , and the late 1960 ’s , when the culture of shared ownership embodied the era ’s anti-authoritarian sensibilities .

The current interest in co-ops stems in part from the economic imperative that rising housing costs have wrought .
But more than anything else , students suggest , it has grown up in reaction to the alienating aspects of modern campus life , where the increased presence of technology , while enabling certain kinds of connection , has had a hand in limiting others .

See , while technically ' cancer free ' for the past several months , I still feel the effects of $ 236,000 in treatment .
I 'm only 29 , but I get out of breath so easily , exercise is so tough .
It 's a pure hell to me .
I mean all I had was Non-hodgkins lymphoma .
That 's the Cancer you want to pick if someone says " You have to get cancer , now pick one " .
8 months of having toxic chemicals pumped through my veins ...
A catheter in my heart ...
A scar and 3 tattoos to remind me about what I went to , though I can't ever forget .
My biggest downfall is I handle it all in stride outside .
When I was rushed to the HCMC ER , almost unable to breathe , a tumor the size of a dinner plate inter - twined around my heart and lungs , pressing against them ..
I thought I had pneumonia .
After all , for a month or so I had the sniffles , a cough , a weird rash on my arms and horrible horrible night sweats .
I 'd easily miss 2 day sof work a week , so tired I cant move .
The doctors , well several oncologists , enter the room and quietly tell me I have cancer .
I think they expected me to freak out when I simply looked at them calmly and said " Ok. Let 's take care of it " .
And I think it bothered them a tad when I made the joke " Hey , at least I 'll lose some weight now ! " .
But I did n't .
The prednisone steroid made me nauseous , so I had to eat a little bit all the time .
The chemo destroys any fast dividing cells , like taste buds , so cherry laffy taffy became my comfort food ( And I have yet to eat it since I got better ! ) .
I think I destroyed a really good relationship that occurred at the wrong time , with a woman I love very deeply .
Radiation was n't bad .
In fact , compared to 6 hours in the Oncology unit for chemo it was a breeze - 15 mins and out .
Quick and painless .
Free parking .
Good deal .
It 's been months , and I 'm still so tired .
My sleep schedule is destroyed - I 'm up 40 hours , then sleep 18 .
Or maybe I 'll be in bed by 10 every night this week .
Or maybe not .
I want to exercise , but it 's so hard - I can do so little .
And at 6 ' 1 " , 280 lbs I look like I should do a lot more .
More then being winded by half a flight of stairs .
It also sucks , because I do n't know who I can talk to about it .
People think it 's so hard ...
It was n't , it 's just a different struggle ...
But they hear the C word and think the worse ...
I never thought I was going to die .
I found out later I was a week tops from dying from my tumor ..
But I just knew it was n't my time .
I remember saying that to my girlfriend , tears welling up in my eyes ...
It 's not my time .
It 's not my time .
But the results , the shell of a man I 'm left with ..
Maybe I did die .
Maybe emotionally and spiritually succumbed to the cancer .
I do n't know any more .
I go to work , clean my apartment , I do the things people do - but I 'm hollow inside .
I 'm missing something and I do n't know what it is .
I 'm scared .
I 'm sad .
I 'm lonely .
I 'm a lot of things ....
What I 'm not is the old me .
I miss the old me ...
I hope I come back
A few years back , I read “ The Collapse of Chaos : Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World ” by Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart .
As a popular science addict , I thoroughly enjoyed this book .
I particularly remember it for introducing me to Stephen Jay Gould ’s Panda principle .
All of us have seen the Panda ’s principle in action , yet few of us know of it .
The following lines will , I hope , shed some light on this principle .
I will start by exposing how it came to be discovered .
Then I will look at a couple of typical examples to show that it reaches beyond biology .
Finally I will explain why the Panda principle is relevant in the context of this blog — because for a couple of paragraphs , you will wonder .
The Panda ’s Thumb : Survival of the Fit-ish
In “ The Origin of the Species “ , Charles Darwin popularized the concept of natural selection .
Here it is , summed up by the man himself :
I have called this principle , by which each slight variation , if useful , is preserved , by the term of Natural Selection .
Contrary to popular belief , Darwin did not coin the phrase “ Survival of the Fittest ” , Herbert Spencer did when he applied Darwin ’s theory to human societies .
This phrase suggests that only the cream of the cream thrives , the rest being condemned to extinction .
Enter the panda .
Check out this thumb !
How could such a poorly formed appendage be the result of millions of years of natural selection .
Should it not be the best possible thumb to manipulate bamboo shoots ?
Stephen Jay Gould answers this question by observing that pandas might have evolved better thumbs but their current thumb is good enough — and sufficiently widespread among the panda population — to prevent improved thumbs from being a selective advantage .
He named this the Panda Principle .
As Cohen and Stewart put it :
Evolution leads to the occupation of niches by locally optimal creatures , not by globally optimal ones .
In effect , once locally optimal creatures get a foothold they prevent globally optimal ones from occupying the same niche .
The Panda Principle in action
The Panda Principle manifests itself in a wide range of domains .
Stephen Jay Gould uses the example of keyboard layouts .
Christopher Sholes , an early typewriter inventor , realized that his original design suffered from one problem : fast typists would frequently jam the type - bars .
He had to slow them down .
He came up with the QWERTY layout by trial and error in 1873 .
It is fair to say that QWERTY is a slow - ptimized layout !
That hardly makes it the most efficient design for today ’s usage where RSI sufferers ’ fingers are the only thing that can actually jam .
In the 1930s , Dr. August Dvorak found that virtually any random layout leads to faster typing speed than the QWERTY layout —
Sholes had worked hard to reach this ( global ) minimum .
Dvorak invented the Dvorak layout — I am sure the amazing and unlikely coincidence is not lost on you .
Throughout his life Dvorak fought unsuccessfully to get his layout adopted .
He died a bitter man in 1975 .
Sadly , the man had a point : in every single comparative study , the Dvorak layout proved faster , more comfortable and less error - prone .
There is still a community of Dvorak layout users , most of them programmers who have decided to use the fittest layout .
But by all account , the QWERTY specimen is here to stay .
It might well be the least fit specimen in the keyboard - layout - space but it will not be replaced any day soon .
A perfect example of the Panda Principle in action .
At first , I thought the Betamax v. VHS war was another manifestation of the principle .
I had it all typed and it looked promising : “ despite Betamax being superior to VHS in technical terms — and being the Simpsons ’ favourite videotape format — it lost the war ” .
Then I discovered that the original Betamax tapes were only one hour long , whereas VHS would stretch up to 3 hours long .
In hindsight , this is a huge argument against Betamax ’s fitness .
As it turned out , in the videotape space , fitness is strongly correlated with the record - ability of hollywood movies .
Hardly a good example to illustrate the Panda Principle .
Panda sighting # 1 : Smalltalk
Now , you must be wondering where I am going to with this principle and what is the link with this blog .
Well , I have recently stumbled upon two manifestations , or so I believe , of the Panda Principle in the realm of software development .
The first one was a couple of weeks ago when I decided to pick up a Smalltalk book from Stéphane Ducasse ’s collection and learn the language .
Smalltalk is a fascinating and beautiful language .
It was destined to be the next best thing .
Then came Java .
We all know what happened next .
The more I read about or play with Smalltalk , the more I wonder how Java won the match .
It seems to me that Smalltalk had everything Java does and much more — yes , I am once again talking about metaprogramming , but there are so many other aspects .
The two most common arguments to Java ’s dominance are :
Java was an incremental step from C++. Whereas Smalltalk was influenced by the far less popular Simula and Sketchpad .
It was therefore easier for Java to gather momentum as it appealled to a larger audience
Sun made the JDK available for free .
Smalltalk development kits where expensive and more often than not incompatible .
Both arguments seem to forget that at the beginning , Sun envisaged Applets as being Java ’s spearhead .
Ironically , Java only really took off when people started using it on the server side .
What surprises me is the impressive list of contributions the Smalltalk community made to the Java community .
Take Eclipse , arguably one of the most successful open - source Java project .
Eclipse was originally derived from IBM ’s VisualAge Micro Edition .
VisualAge , up to the Micro Edition release , was Smalltalk based .
As Joe Winchester puts it
From a technology point of view Eclipse has a lot of Smalltalk DNA in it .
Take the JUnit framework , written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck .
It has inspired countless testing frameworks in virtually any programming language .
Well , JUnit actually had a precursor : SUnit , also written by Kent Beck .
Martin Fowler ’s classic “ Refactoring : Improving the Design of Existing Code “ , although not a pure Java book , is on the bookshelf of most Java programmers ( go buy it if is not ! ) .
The foundations of this book lie in Smalltalk as Fowler acknowledges in the preface .
It is hard to conceive that a language so ahead of its time and yet so simple failed to overcome the challenge of what seems a less evolved language .
Moreover , Smalltalk had been preparing since 1971 for the advent of OOP ‘s widespread acceptance .
Java ’s inception , on the other hand , only dates from 1990 .
When C++’s dominance came to pass , how did the fittest lose to the slightly fitter ?
Is this another manifestation of the Panda Principle ?
Panda sighting # 2 : Mac/OS X
I have always been curious about Operating Systems and more particularly OSes for personal computers .
I still remember my Pentium - 75 triple - booting OS / 2 WARP , Windows 95 and Linux .
For quite a few years I have been a proponent of Linux and FreeBSD .
I rarely use Windows , I get rashes and spots when exposed to it for more than a couple of minutes .
But lately , through the Ruby and Io community , I have been frequenting a bad bunch : Mac users .
I heard so much about the Mac that I decided to have a closer look .
I looked a bit too close .
Here I am proud owner of a brand new iMac .
I have been using it for less than a week and I have no doubt : this is the best machine I have ever had the pleasure to work with .
My wife used to complain about my excessive usage of computers .
Now , we are almost fighting about whose turn it is to use the Mac .
I thought it would take me a while to get use to the Mac idiosyncrasies .
After only a couple of hours , I feel pretty comfortable with the interface .
Not only is it gorgeous , it is also far more comfortable and consistent than most systems I have used in the past .
A typical example of consistency is the key bindings .
No matter what application I use I know command - F will let me search whatever this application manipulates .
Compare that with Windows , ctrl - F is used by most applications but not all : see for yourself , try it in IE .
It actually opens a side panel to let you search the web .
If you look in the main menu , you will discover that ctrl - F is indeed the binding for searching into the current page … and sometimes it does — let me know if there is a cartesian explanation for this infuriating behaviour .
The problem also exists in Gnome and KDE .
It tends to be related to non-native applications like X - based ones .
But let ’s go back to the Panda Principle , nobody can dispute Windows dominance in terms of marketshare .
It is however hard to fathom how Windows could be considered the fittest OS for personal computers .
I am talking fitness in the market space , not fitness in my own little OS fanatic space .
Since I work in computers , I tend to get called by other people to fix their computers .
I am pretty sure this resonates with your own experience .
Are these people masochistic ?
How much pain can they endure ?
That repeatedly ?
Microsoft is losing the trust of its own customers .
This has been going on for quite a few years , and yet only few people switch to alternatives .
And there are many viable alternatives !
I think this is a typical manifestation of the Panda Principle .
Windows might not be the fittest but the shear number of users virtually guarantees that it will keep its place .
That is fine by me .
I am quite happy with my very own globally optimum machine !

For the last couple of weeks , i’ve been watching the Wikipedia bru - ha - ha .
As folks probably know , i got really upset a while back when folks were talking about Wikipedia being the essential collection of knowledge , meant to replace school books and other refereed knowledge containers .
I still strongly believe that Wikipedia will not be that .
But Jimmy
Wales reminded me that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia , not a library replacement .
It should be the first source of information , not the last .
It should be a site for information exploration , not the definitive source of facts .
This convinced me and i developed a great deal of respect for the project and its intentions .
Of course , i still get annoyed with Wikipedia obsessives who promote it as the panacea to all knowledge problems .
So , when i heard about Seigenthaler , i rolled my eyes .
Welcome to being a public figure – people will say mean things about you on the web .
None of it is guaranteed to be true – it ’s the web .
( Of course , my view probably stems from being a native web kid – no one likes the meannies but we ’ve gotten used to it . )
Wikipedia is better than most of the web because YOU CAN CHANGE IT .
And if you inform them that someone is acting in a malicious way , Wikipedians will actually track it to keep it neutral .
Can you even imagine Google doing that for every webpage out there ?
Ha ha ha ha ha .
Try getting an article that is libelous removed from the Google index , like a mean - spirited blog entry .
Not going to happen ( unless you ’re Scientology ) .
Seigenthaler had a very reasonable conversation with Wikipedia , telling them of the troubles .
Wikipedia , in Wikipedia - form , acted immediately to remedy the situation , even volunteering to remove the history .
I applauded them .
And then Seigenthaler wrote a rather mean - spirited , anti-Wikipedia opinion piece in the USA Today .
He went around calling for the end to Wikipedia .
Uncool .
I was outraged .
What pissed me off more was how the academic community pointed to this case and went “ See ! See !
Wikipedia is terrible !
We must protest it and stop it !
It ’s ruining our schools ! ”
All of a sudden , i found myself defending Wikipedia to academics instead of reminding the pro-Wikipedians of its limitations in academia .
I kept pointing out that they would n’t let students cite from encyclopedias either .
I reminded folks that the answer is not to protest it , but to teach students how to read it and to understand its strengths and limitations .
To actually TEACH students to interpret web material .
I reminded academics that Wikipedia provides information to people who do n’t have access to books and that mostly - good information is far better than none .
Most importantly , i reminded academics that the vast majority of articles on Wikipedia are super solid and if they had a problem with them , they could fix them .
Academics have a lot of knowledge , but all too often they forget that they are teachers and that there is great value in teaching the masses , not just the small number of students who will help their careers progress .
Alas , public education has been devalued and information elitism is rampant in an age where we finally have the tools to make knowledge more accessible .
Sad .
( And one of the many things that is making me disillusioned with academia these days . )
I found myself being the Wikipedia promoter because i found the extreme academic viewpoint to be just as egregious as the extreme Wikipedia viewpoint .
And then , as if i could n’t be more cranky , i watched Internet Researchers take up the same anti-Wikipedia argument .
I was floored .
These are n’t just academics , they ’re the academics who study the web .
The academics who should know better .
But they felt as though it was a problem that Wikipedia would allow for a man to be defamed .
As the conversation progressed , someone pointed out that Wikipedia ’s policies and platform supports Seigenthaler ’s concern that “ irresponsible vandals [ can ] write anything they want about anybody . ”
Much to my complete and utter joy , Jimmy Wales responded with a fantastic structural comparison that i felt should be surfaced from the mailing list and shared to the world at large :
Imagine that we are designing a restaurant .
This restuarant will serve steak .
Because we are going to be serving steak , we will have steak knives for the customers .
Because the customers will have steak knives , they might stab each other .
Therefore , we conclude , we need to put each table into separate metal cages , to prevent the possibility of people stabbing each other .
What would such an approach do to our civil society ?
What does it do to human kindness , benevolence , and a positive sense of community ?
When we reject this design for restaurants , and then when , inevitably , someone does get stabbed in a restaurant ( it does happen ) , do we write long editorials to the papers complaining that “ The steakhouse is inviting it by not only allowing irresponsible vandals to stab anyone they please , but by also providing the weapons ” ?
No , instead we acknowledge that the verb “ to allow ” does not apply in such a situation .
A restaurant is not _allowing_ something just because they have n’t taken measures to _forcibly prevent it_ a priori .
It is surely against the rules of the restaurant , and of course against the laws of society .
Just .
Like .
Libel .
If someone starts doing bad things in a restuarant , they are forcibly kicked out and , if it ’s particularly bad , the law can be called .
Just .
Like .
Wikipedia .
I do not accept the spin that Wikipedia “ allows anyone to write anything ” just because we do not metaphysically prevent it by putting authors in cages .
All too often we blame the technology for problematic human behaviors .
We fail to recognize that technology makes them more visible but the human behaviors are rooted in larger issues .
In turn , we treat the symptoms rather than the disease .
The solution is not to bandaid the problems by taking away or limiting the technologies , but to make the world a better place from the inside out .
I am worried about how academics are treating Wikipedia and i think that it comes from a point of naivety .
Wikipedia should never be the sole source for information .
It will never have the depth of original sources .
It will also always contain bias because society is inherently biased , although its efforts towards neutrality are commendable .
These are just realizations we must acknowledge and support .
But what it does have is a huge repository of information that is the most accessible for most people .
Most of the information is more accurate than found in a typical encyclopedia and yet , we value encyclopedias as a initial point of information gathering .
It is also more updated , more inclusive and more in - depth .
Plus , it ’s searchable and in the hands of everyone with digital access ( a much larger population than those with encyclopedias in their homes ) .
It also exists in hundreds of languages and is available to populations who ca n’t even imagine what a library looks like .
Yes , it is open .
This means that people can contribute what they do know and that others who know something about that area will try to improve it .
Over time , articles with a lot of attention begin to be inclusive and approximating neutral .
The more people who contribute , the stronger and more valuable the resource .
Boycotting Wikipedia does n’t make it go away , but it does n’t make it any better either .
I will be truly sad if academics do n’t support the project , do n’t contribute knowledge .
I will be outraged if academics continue to talk about having Wikipedia eliminated as a tool for information dispersal .
Sure , students should n’t be citing from Wikipedia instead of the primary texts they were supposed to have read .
But Wikipedia is a stunning supplement to most texts and often provides pointers to other relevant material that one did n’t know existed .
We should be teaching our students how to interpret the materials they get on the web , not banning them from it .
We should be correcting inaccuracies that we find rather than protesting the system .
We have the knowledge to be able to do this , but all too often , we ’re acting like elitist children .
In this way , i believe academics are more likely to lose credibility than Wikipedia .
Few things have stirred the imagination and hopes of the public in matters of nutrition or vexed nutrition scientists as much as Linus Pauling ’s 1970 book , Vitamin C and the Common Cold . [ 1 ]
The book ’s main claim was that taking 1 gram ( 1,000 mg ) of vitamin C daily would reduce the incidence of colds by 45 % for most people , but that some persons might need much larger amounts .
It recommended that if symptoms of a cold do start , you should take 500 or 1,000 mg every hour for several hours — or 4 to 10 grams daily if symptoms do n’t disappear with smaller amounts .
Without question , publication of this book , combined with Pauling ’s reputation as a Nobel Prize - winning scientist , has made vitamin C a best seller .
When his theory was announced , millions of Americans rushed to try it for themselves .
The second edition of the book , issued in 1976 as Vitamin C , the Common Cold and the Flu , suggested even higher dosages [ 2 ] .
Vitamin C and the Common Cold also suggested that most people need a daily vitamin C intake of 2,300 mg or more for “ optimum ” health and to meet stresses , including infections .
In a subsequent book , How to Live Longer and Feel Better , Pauling stated that individual biochemical variability is so great that optimum intake may may be as great as from 250 mg to 20 grams or more per day [ 3 ] .
Many concerned persons have wondered whether Pauling ’s advice was prudent , and millions have experimented upon themselves to see whether they could tell .
Pauling himself reportedly took 12,000 mg daily and raised it to 40,000 mg when symptoms of a cold appeared ! [ 4 ]
Pauling apparently adapted to such dosage , but most people would suffer chronic diarrhea and the risk of kidney stones .
Also , the vast majority of reputable medical and nutritional scientists strongly disagree with him .
Before looking at the experimental evidence , let ’s discuss how scientists form their opinions .
How Scientific Facts Are Determined
The “ scientific community ” consists of thousands of scientists throughout the world , most of whom operate under a strict set of rules known as the scientific method .
Simply stated , this is a system of logical steps designed to separate cause - and - effect from coincidence .
This method is used to answer such questions as : “ If you do a particular thing , will something else take place ? ” and “ If two things follow one another , are they related ? ”
A scientific “ fact ” is determined by analyzing the results of all the experiments that bear on that particular fact .
In the case of vitamin C , there are two key questions .
First , does vitamin C prevent colds ?
And second , does it reduce their severity ?
Before discussing experiments on these questions , however , we should note that not all experiments are created equal .
To be valid , an experiment must be well designed , and Its data must be honestly collected and Interpreted with good techniques of statistical analysis .
One hallmark of a good experiment is that others can repeat it and get the same results .
Experimental studies of the possible value of vitamin C in the prevention of infections have been conducted by medical investigators ever since preparations of the pure crystalline vitamin became commercially available during the 1930s .
By 1982 , about thirty of these were reported and the majority of medical scientists had concluded that supplementation with vitamin C does not prevent colds and , at best , may slightly reduce the symptoms of a cold .
Two subsequent reports have not altered these findings .
Linus Pauling remained steadfast in his belief that the scientific community was wrong — basing his ideas on the same experiments but interpreting their results differently .
Moreover , he suggested the following way to determine one ’s correct vitamin C dosage : “ If you are taking 1 gram [ 1,000 mg ] per day , and find that you have developed two or three colds during the winter season , it would be wise to try taking a larger daily quantity . ”
Presumably , if you have fewer colds than expected , you should believe that vitamin C has been responsible for the decrease .
Unfortunately , in the real world , scientific facts cannot be determined that simply .
Consider the following questions :
Is it possible that you actually had a different number of colds than you recall ?
This would be faulty data collection .
Is it possible that you would have had only one cold this year anyway ?
If so , what happened to you would be a mere coincidence .
Is it possible that you had a very mild cold but wish so strongly for a favorable result that you did n’t count it ?
If so , this would be an effect of bias .
Scientific experiments must be designed to overcome these possible sources of error .
The problem of faulty memory can be overcome by keeping close track of the individuals involved in an experiment .
The problem of coincidence can be overcome by using large numbers of people and following them for significant lengths of time .
The problem of bias , however , is far more complicated .
Use of the double - blind method is critical , but as you will see , experiments with vitamin C have encountered some very curious results when subjects were able to figure out whether they were getting the vitamin or the placebo during experiments intended to be double - blind .
So far , at least 30 experiments have tested the ability of vitamin C to protect against colds in large groups of people .
Four biomedical scientists who have analyzed the results of these trials have found Pauling ’s claims unsupported , except for slight reduction in severity , in most of those trials that were scientifically properly designed and executed [ 5 - 8 ] .
Now let ’s examine the evidence .
Well - Designed Experiments
One way to test whether high - dosage vitamin C prevents colds is to inoculate the throats of volunteers with cold viruses .
Two studies of this type found that everyone got colds whether they took vitamin C or not .
Walker and co-workers in 1967 and Schwartz , Hornick and associates in 1972 - 73 gave half of their volunteers a placebo and the rest 3,000 mg of vitamin C daily for several days before inserting live cold viruses directly into their noses ; and then continued 3,000 mg of vitamin C ( or placebo ) for seven more days .
All of the volunteers got colds , which were of equal severity [ 9 - 11 ] .
Another way to test vitamin C is to see what happens to matched groups over a period of time .
Two teams of investigators have done this more than once , one team led by Dr. John L. Coulehan and the other by Dr. Terence Anderson .
Dr. Coulehan ’s first study was done on 641 Navajo Indian children , half of whom received a placebo while the rest received 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily .
A complicated system of judging the severity of head , throat and chest symptoms was used .
The Coulehan team reported in 1974 that the vitamin C group had less severe colds , but other scientists who reviewed the study criticized the method of judging the severity of symptoms [ 12 ] .
So in 1976 the Coulehan team repeated their study with 868 Navajo children but used a better system of scoring severity .
The children receiving vitamin C averaged 0.38 colds per person while the placebo group averaged 0.37 .
The average duration of the colds was 5.5 days in the vitamin group and 5.8 in the placebo group .
Thus , in this test , vitamin C neither prevented colds nor shortened their duration [ 13 ] .
In 1979 , Dr. Coulehan published his analysis of vitamin C versus the common cold and concluded that extra vitamin C is not worth taking [ 14 ] .
In 1972 , Dr. Terence Anderson and colleagues at the University of Toronto published the results of a 3 - month double - blind study of 818 volunteers aged 10 to 65 .
Half received 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily before colds and 4,000 mg per day during the first 3 days of a cold , while the other half received “ equivalent ” placebos [ 15 ] .
This study was designed to test Pauling ’s claims that ingestion of 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily would reduce the frequency of colds by 45 % and the total days of illness by 60 % .
These claims were certainly not supported by the study ’s outcome .
In the vitamin group , 74 % had one or more colds during the study period while 82 % of the placebo group had one or more colds .
The difference , which amounted to “ one - tenth of a cold per person , ” was judged by Dr. Anderson to be “ of no practical importance . ”
The severity , as measured by days confined indoors , averaged 1.36 days for the vitamin group and 1.87 days for the placebo group — a 30 % difference that Anderson decided to explore further .
At the end of this trial , before the double - blind code was opened , all volunteers were asked whether they had experienced any unusual feelings of well - being [ euphoria ] during the trial .
Nineteen percent of both groups said yes — an interesting example of the placebo effect
In 1974 , the Anderson team , reported on a larger trial to see what results would be obtained with different amounts of vitamin C [ 16,17 ] .
Some 3,500 volunteers were divided into eight groups , six of which received various daily dosages of vitamin C while the others received placebos for 3 months .
No difference in the incidence of colds was found among the groups taking no vitamin C , 250 mg , 1,000 mg or 2,000 mg daily .
A possible slight reduction in severity of symptoms was found in the vitamin C groups , but volunteers taking dosages of 4,000 or 8,000 per day when a cold began did no better than those taking only 250 mg per day .
The third Anderson trial , reported in 1975 , covered 16 weeks and used 488 volunteers ( ages 14­67 ) , with one - third receiving a pill of vitamin C as its sodium and calcium salts , and one - third given vitamin C in slow - release capsules , and one - third getting a placebo [ 18 ] .
The vitamin C dosage was 500 mg once a week ( equivalent to about 70 mg daily ) before colds , but 1,500 mg the first day of a cold followed by 1,000 mg on the second and third days .
No reduction in the incidence of colds was observed , but those taking vitamin C averaged less time at home ( 1.62 vs. 1.12 days indoors ) .
Do you think that a half - day ’s less confinement is of practical significance ?
Taken together , the Anderson studies suggest that extra vitamin C nay slightly reduce the severity of colds , but that it is not necessary to take the high dosages suggested by Pauling to achieve this result .
Nor is there anything to be gained by taking vitamin supplements year - round in the hope of preventing colds .
In 1975 , Carson and co-workers reported treating company employees with 1,000 mg of vitamin C or a placebo daily during colds .
The number of colds per person , the duration of colds and their severity were the same in both vitamin and placebo groups [ 19 ] .
In 1975 , Karlowski and associates at the National Institutes of Health reported treating volunteers as follows : 25 % received placebos ; 25 % took 3,000 mg of vitamin C daily before colds but placebos during colds ; 25 % were given placebos daily before colds and 3,000 mg of vitamin C daily during colds ; and 25 % got 3,000 mg daily before colds and 6,000 mg daily during colds .
The experiment was supposed to be double - blind , but the doctors had failed to make the placebo taste the same as the vitamin C pills as is done in most trials .
As a result , half of the volunteers correctly guessed which pill they were getting and therefore became unblinded .
When the results were tabulated with all volunteers lumped together , the average number of colds per person was 1.27 colds for the vitamin group and 1.41 for the placebo group .
But among those who remained blinded , no differences in the incidence or severity were found [ 20 ] .
This fascinating result shows how many people who think they are taking a positive step ( such as taking a vitamin ) may report a favorable result even when none really exists !
In 1977 , Miller and colleagues 22 treated 44 pairs of identical twins for 5 months as follows .
One twin in each pair received a vitamin C capsule while the other got a placebo .
The daily vitamin C dosages before and during colds ranged from 500 for younger children to 1,500 mg for older ones .
The investigators noted “ no significant overall benefit on cold symptoms ” as reported by the children ’s mothers , but the responses varied among the subgroups when the children were divided according to sex and age [ 21 ] .
After the data were analyzed , four mothers admitted tasting the capsules in an attempt to figure out which twin was getting the vitamin C !
Thus it is possible that the ratings of these mothers and possibly others were influenced by guessing which twin was getting the vitamin C .
Two studies using identical twins have been reported .
In 1977 , Tyrell and co-workers reported treating 743 men and 758 women for 5 months as follows .
Half received placebo pills daily .
The others took vitamin C but only during colds at these dosages : 4,000 mg on the first and second days of a cold and 200 mg on the third day .
There was no benefit from taking vitamin C .
The incidence and duration of colds were the same for both men and women in the vitamin and placebo groups [ 22 ] .
Men in both groups missed an average of half a day ’s work while women missed about a day [ 23 ] .
The other study , reported in 1981 , used 95 pairs of identical twins .
One of each pair took 1,000 mg of vitamin C for 100 days while the other received a placebo
The vitamin C group had slightly more colds but a shorter duration of colds ( 5 days instead of 6 ) . [ 23 ]
An 8 - week trial with 764 Marine recruits carried out by Pitt and Costrini was reported in 1979 .
Half of the recruits received 2,000 mg of vitamin C daily , while the others took placebo pills on the same schedule .
No benefit from vitamin C was found .
Ninety percent of both groups got colds , and no difference in severity or duration of colds was found [ 24 ] .
In a 1984 study , Dr. X. H. Briggs 26 divided 528 volunteers and gave half 1,000 mg vitamin C daily and the other half a daily placebos for three months .
In the vitamin C group 47 % got colds , and 46 % of the placebo group .
Severity of symptoms lasted on average 3.1 days for the vitamin C group and 3.3 days for those getting placebos .
Briggs concluded : No prevention and no benefit [ 25 ] .
In 1990 , Dr. Elliot Dick and coworkers summarized the methods and results of their three double - blind controlled trials to test methods of transmission of viruses , by contaminated fingers or inhaling viruses in the air , and to test the protective effect of vitamin C .
They used 24 volunteers , 8 donors and 16 recipients .
The recipients were nonsmoking men testing negative for antibodies to the RV16 type cold virus .
Half were pretreated for 3 1/2 weeks with 2,000 mg of vitamin C daily ( 4 x 500 mg ) , and the other were eight given 4 placebos daily .
The eight donors were infected with RV16 cold virus by direct inoculation into the nose and then were housed with the recipients 24 hours a day for a 7 - day interaction period .
All donors developed colds first and then all 16 of the recipients .
The vitamin C or placebo pills were continued during the week of interaction and for the following two weeks .
During the 7 - day interaction period the men were supervised and slept , ate and played cards in the same room .
Results :
All got colds [ 26 ] .
In 2001 , an Australian team published the results of a double - blind , randomised clinical trial with four intervention arms : vitamin C at daily doses of 0.03g ( “ placebo ” ) , 1 g , 3g , or 3g with additives ( “ Bio - C ” ) taken at onset of a cold and for the following two days .
The study included 400 healthy volunteers who were followed over an 18 - month period .
The participants were instructed to take the pills when they had experienced early symptoms of a cold for four hours , and to record daily their symptoms , severity , doctor visits , and use of other medications .
Among the 149 participants who returned records for 184 colds , no significant differences were found from one group to another [ 27 ] .
Do Added Bioflavonoids
Help ?
In 1979 , Dr. I. M. Baird and co-workers reported ona 10 - week experiment with 350 volunteers ( ages 17 to 25 ) who were divided into 3 groups .
One - third of them , as the placebo group , received a daily “ supplement ” of a synthetic orange drink containing no vitamin C. A second group got a synthetic orange drink containing 80 mg of synthetic vitamin C .
The third group was given enough pure orange juice daily to provide 80 mg of natural vitamin C plus bioflavonoids .
The incidence of colds was the same for all three groups .
Both vitamin C groups had slightly leas severe colds than the placebo group .
Thus the synthetic vitamin C was as effective as the natural vitamin C and the presence of bioflavonoids had no apparent effect [ 28 ] .
Antihistamine Effect of Vitamin C
Histamine in varying amounts is almost always released in the tissues of the respiratory tract by an allergic - type response to the stress of common cold infections .
Perhaps the first clue that animals and humans might use vitamin C to combat stress that involves histamine release came in 1940 from the research team led by the co-discoverer of vitamin C , Professor Charles Glen King of Columbia University .
Dr. King ’s group showed that stressing rats with certain drugs stimulated their bodies to synthesize extra vitamin C [ 29 ] .
Later , evidence was presented to support the belief that animals , such as the rat , who can make their own supply of vitamin C , react to histamine by producing extra vitamin C .
In 1974 , two other research teams found that rats given vitamin C along with histamine - releasing drugs had a reduction in stress symptoms and reduced histamine in the urine [ 30,31 ] .
They concluded that vitamin C can act like an anti-histamine drug .
However many physicians believe that reducing infection - caused inflammation ( nature ’s defense reaction ) slows recovery .
Overview
In 1986 , Professor A. Stewart Truswell of the University of Sydney , Australia concisely summarized the results of 27 trials conducted since 1970 . [ 8 ]
Of these , five were treatment trials with vitamin C or a placebo given only at the onset of a cold and for only several days and all of which found no benefit .
The other 22 were double - blind controlled trials giving daily vitamin C or placebo before and during colds .
Of these , 12 trials showed no prevention and no reduction in duration or severity , five trials showed no prevention and only slight , statistically nonsignificant lessening of severity , and the other five trials reported no prevention and a small but significant in reduction of duration of the colds .
Dr. Truswell concluded : “ It is now fairly clear that for preventing colds , vitamin C has no worthwhile effect , ” but he believed that : “ There is thus a little more evidence for a small therapeutic effect of ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) .
However , as Dr. T.W. Anderson ’s second trial in 1974 revealed 250 mg of vitamin per day reduced severity as much as did 1,000 mg or 4 , 000 mg [ 16 ] .
Does it make sense to supplement with vitamin C ?
If so , should it be done daily or only at the first sign of a cold or other infection ?
And what dosage should be used ?
The many studies done in the last 30 years clearly prove that daily vitamin C supplements , whether 100 mg or 5,000 mg , do not prevent colds and provide , but only for some people , only a slight reduction in duration and severity of colds .
Dr. Thomas Chalmers concluded in 1975 : “ I , who have colds as often and as severe as those of any man , do not consider the very minor potential benefit that might result from taking vitamin C three tines a day for life worth either the effort or the risk , no matter how slight the latter might be . ” [ 5 ]
If you choose to supplement when a cold strikes , there is no reason to take more than 250 mg per day , as shown in the 1974 Anderson study .
This amount is easily obtained from the age - old “ remedy , ” fruit juices .
Supplementation with larger amounts of vitamin C has not been shown to be more effective , and it may cause diarrhea or have other adverse effects .
Editor ’s Note
Dr. Marshall , who died in 1997 at the age of 90 , was a biochemist who devoted most of his retirment to investigating the benefits and risks of vitamin supplementation .
His landmark book , Vitamins and Minerals : Help or Harm ? won the American Medical Writers Association award for best book of 1983 for the general public and became a special publication of Consumer Reports Books .
In 1992 , Dr. Marshall revised the book ’s chapter on vitamin C and colds as a first step in developing a second edition , which , unfortunately , he was unable to complete .
Upon his death , his family transferred his files and the rights to his writings to me with the understanding that I would use them for public education .
This article was condensed from the revised chapter and will be updated when additional studies are done .

Surprise !
Until today I 'd never heard of this special Douglas Feith plan after September 11th :
Days after 9/11 , a senior Pentagon official lamented the lack of good targets in Afghanistan and proposed instead U.S. military attacks in South America or Southeast Asia as " a surprise to the terrorists , " according to a footnote in the recent 9/11 Commission Report .
The unsigned top - secret memo , which the panel 's report said appears to have been written by Defense Under Secretary Douglas Feith , is one of several Pentagon documents uncovered by the commission which advance unorthodox ideas for the war on terror .
The memo suggested " hitting targets outside the Middle East in the initial offensive " ...
Specifically , Feith wanted to bomb the " triple border region " where Paraguay , Argentina and Brazil meet .
I think one thing 's for sure : that would have been " a surprise . "
And , not just for Osama bin Laden .
Moreover , if the criteria was just that our response be violent and " a surprise to the terrorists , " attacking South America is thinking kind of small .
Here 's what I would have suggested :
• assassinate the Dalai Lama
• blow up the moon
• have the entire Bush cabinet dress up as Carmen Miranda and then , on national television , commit hara - kari
I hope you might have some ideas of your own .
Spain to declare rights for great apes
The government of Spain today apparently declared support for the right to “ freedom and life ” for great apes — making it the first world legislature to recognize the rights of non-human entities .
It seems they were swayed by the lobbying of the Great Ape Project , the brainchild of philosopher Peter Singer .
Singer ’s point has long been that the category of “ animals ” is weirdly broad and imprecise : Both chimpanzees and snakes are classified as animals , but for Singer this makes no sense , because chimpanzees are closer to humans than to snakes .
Anyway , Singer ’s organization includes a “ Declaration on Great Apes ” that says that apes should not be killed except in self - defense , that they are not to be “ arbitrarily deprived of their liberty , ” and ought not to be subject to torture .
I ’ll avoid the obvious Gitmo - Bay joke and point out that I ’m not sure whether Spain has is adopting Singer ’s Delcaration outright , because the Reuters story does n’t clarify it .
Interestingly , animal - rights thinkers argue that Spain ’s actions constitute a philosophical tipping point .
As Reuters wrote :
The Spanish move could set a precedent for greater legal protection for other animals , including elephants , whales and dolphins , said Paul Waldau , director of the Center for Animals and Public Policy at Tufts University .
“ We were born into a society where humans alone are the sole focus , and we begin to expand to the non -human great apes .
It is n’t easy for us to see how far that expansion will go , but it ’s very clear we need to expand beyond humans , ” Waldau said .
They may also want to look at the potential rights of our celaphopod overlords .
As Eric Scigliano documented in a wonderful Discover magazine piece in 2003 , octopuses are so freakishly smart that they ’ll fashion toys out of debris in tanks just to stave off boredom .
And given that we are eventually going to be totally 0wnz0r3d in the Giant Squid Uprising , it would only be prudent buy some goodwill by enshrining the rights of Architeuthis via the UN .

Ban Ki-moon will lead the UN for the next five years
The resolution , adopted unanimously , follows Mr Ban 's nomination to succeed Kofi Annan by the UN Security Council .
Mr Annan is due to step down on 31 December after heading the UN for two five - year terms .
Mr Ban , 62 , will be the first Asian to head the UN since Burma 's U Thant , who held the post from 1961 to 1971 .
The general assembly confirmed Mr Ban 's appointment by acclamation - without a vote - on the basis of approval by all 192 members .
Priorities
Afterwards he told delegates he was " deeply honoured " and vowed to use his position to ensure that the organisation achieved more .
" The true measure of success for the UN is not how much we promise , but how much we deliver for those who need us most , " Mr Ban said .
We reform not to please others , but because we value what this organisation stands for
Ban Ki-moon
Ban Ki-moon profile
Mr Ban cited poverty , HIV / Aids , environmental degradation , protecting human rights and combating terrorism among his priorities .
He also mentioned reforms - a key demand of the US , the UN 's biggest contributor - but hinted that he would lead the process at his own pace .
" We reform not to please others , but because we value what this organisation stands for , " he said .
" We can not change everything at once .
But if we choose wisely , and work together transparently , flexibly and honestly , progress in a few areas will lead to progress in a few more . "
Mr Ban 's appointment comes as the UN is trying to resolve the crisis over North Korea 's nuclear programme .
He has played key roles in dealing with the standoff , both as South Korea 's foreign minister and as its ambassador to the UN .
There was a broad consensus within the UN that the next secretary general should be Asian .
Mr Annan congratulated his successor , hailing him as " a man with a truly global mind " with " exceptional qualifications " .
One of six candidates for the post , Mr Ban came top of all four informal polls in the Security Council and his five rivals all quit the race .

I knocked together this simple proof - of - concept Ruby - to - JavaScript converter in a few hours today .
It seems somehow wrong , like grafting a pretty girl ’s head onto a donkey , but I ’ve done it anyway !
It converts Ruby code like this :
class Demo def initialize @clicks = 0 3.times { self.puts (' Hello !
I am a Ruby script !') } end def puts ( str ) document.getElementById(' debug ' ) [ ' innerHTML '] = document.getElementById(' debug ' ) [ ' innerHTML ' ] + str + "
" end def clicked @clicks += 1 self.puts ( " Click number " + @clicks.to_s ) end end
into JavaScript code like this :
function Demo( ) { self =this ; self.instanceVariables={} ; self.instanceVariables ['@clicks '] = Number (0 ) ; Number ( 3) .times ( function ( ) { self.puts ( " Hello !
I am a Ruby script ! " ) } ) } Demo. prototype = { puts : function ( str ) { self =this ; document.getElementById(" debug " ) [ " innerHTML " ] = document.getElementById(" debug " ) [ " innerHTML " ] + str + "

It uses Ryan Davis et al ’s ParseTree and Florian Groß ’s ruby.js for most of the hard work .

The money the proud parents spent on hordes of bodyguards , Namibian undercover policemen , yards of screening material and weeks of subterfuge counted for nothing yesterday after the first pictures of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie 's baby were leaked on the internet to the fury of the glossy celebrity magazines that had paid millions for them .
Hello !
magazine had been touting them as " the most eagerly awaited baby exclusive of the year " , while in the US they were hailed as the " photos of the year " .
But their bubble was burst yesterday as the first pictures of the couple 's daughter , born in Namibia on May 27 , appeared on internet gossip sites ahead of their publication today .
Hello ! said it was taking legal action against sites - including Los Angeles gossip blog Defamer.com and community site LiveJournal - that broke the embargo , adding that it had no idea where the shots had come from .
" We were very shocked and horrified to see that this embargo has been breached , " said Hello ! features editor Juliet Herd .
" Hello ! is taking legal action around the world to stop internet sites and everyone else who may seek to publish . "
Several websites removed the shot as soon as Hello !
threatened them with a " cease and desist " letter but others left it on view .
Getty Images , which brokered the deal , said its legal team was also looking into the leak .
Following the birth of their baby , Shiloh Nouvel Jolie - Pitt , the couple announced they would let Getty sell the first pictures of the child with proceeds going to charity .
The auction , which resulted in People magazine winning exclusive US rights and Hello !
scooping the UK rights , broke all previous records for an estimated $ 7 m ( £ 3.8 m ) .
In the latest public relations strike in the war on copyright infringement , the music and film industries are sowing fears that content piracy , like drug trafficking before it , is being taken over by organized crime syndicates .
The problem is that the evidence – so far , at least – is lacking .
The mob -piracy meme began spreading in earnest last month , when the Recording Industry Association of America announced in a press release that piracy and organized crime were so intertwined that the entire counterfeit CD production business in the eastern half of the United States " is now dominated by organized criminal syndicates intent on monopolizing the illicit market . "
Organized crime 's entree into the content business was inevitable given the economics , says Warner Music spokesman Craig Hoffman .
" The markup for a kilo of heroin is 200 percent , " Hoffman says .
" The markup for pirated CDs and DVDs is 800 percent . "
" The business model is similar to dealing drugs , " says Chuck Hausman , deputy director of anti-piracy for the Motion Picture Association of America .
" The technology makes it easier – cheap burners , color laser printers and scanners ( for high - quality disc art and packaging ) .
It 's low cost to entry and they 're ( CDs , DVDs ) easy to hide . "
This line of reasoning helped fuel an exponential increase in the federal government 's efforts against intellectual - property violations last fall .
In October , the Department of Justice established the Intellectual Property Task Force and published an 80 - page report ( .pdf ) detailing the agency 's plans to combat piracy domestically and globally .
The report noted the potential for large criminal groups to cash in on the illicit content business .
" While the harmful consequences of intellectual - property theft may seem frightening , it is also disturbing to learn who is benefiting from many of these crimes , " the report reads .
" Intellectual - property theft has been linked to organized crime and , potentially , may fund terrorist organizations attracted by the profitability of these offenses . "
In fact , links between large gangs and piracy are well - documented in China and Russia , along with other developing countries .
But U.S. cases invariably target more run -of - the - mill outlaws , like download site operators and theater camcorder pirates .
Asked to cite actual U.S. convictions involving organized crime , the RIAA and MPAA instead presented a handful of pending piracy cases against warez networks , commercial replicators , a few members of street gangs and a smattering of individual drug dealers – but no John Gotti or Tony Soprano .
" It 's not organized crime families , as in ' the mob , ' " admits Bradley Buckles , head of the RIAA 's anti-piracy unit and former director of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
" But large groups engaged in organized criminal activity are involved . "
" Each link in the chain is organized – the manufacturers or burners , the distributors who collect the discs from the burners and the peddlers who get the discs from the distributors , " says Bill Shannon , the MPAA 's anti-piracy director on the East Coast .
In one case , an Oakland , California - based convicted drug dealer and pimp named Ali Rizwaan – aka " Cuban Tony " – was arrested in April for piracy .
Police executed search warrants at three locations operated by Rizwaan , and allegedly uncovered pirated movies and DVD - R burners , according to Hausman .
In another raid in San Antonio in early July , police arrested repeat offender Michael Portillo for piracy and found 47 burners , two unloaded handguns , two loaded automatic weapons , a bulletproof vest , some methamphetamine , heroin , cocaine and marijuana .
Two other men on the scene were arrested on drug - related charges .
And last month an individual member of one of Los Angeles ' notorious 18th Street gangs was arrested for peddling CDs and DVDs in Santee Alley in Los Angeles , where counterfeit handbags , clothing and other knockoff items are also for sale on the street .
The MPAA claims that Los Angeles street gangs , including Crazy Riders , the 18th Street gangs and 42nd Street Little Gangsters , are actively burning , distributing and selling pirated CDs and DVDs .
" We see more weapons on raids , " Shannon says .
" There 's a rise in violence because it 's a big cash business .
Some gangs are also extorting protection money from peddlers and distributors and others involved in selling pirated content and carrying around lots of cash . "
But do a handful of piracy cases with violent suspects add up to organized crime ?
Skeptics say no .
" A few gang members get arrested and all of the sudden there are reports that gangs are pigeonholed as being big into piracy , " says Alejandro Alfonso , who routinely testifies as an expert witness on Los Angeles gangs .
" But if anything , it 's small - scale stuff ....
Gangs might be involved on the fringes . "
" In the U.S. , piracy tends to be small - time players , " says Mike Goodman , a senior analyst at the Yankee Group .
" I 've not seen any cases of organized crime ....
It 's four , five , six guys who ( burn discs and ) sell them on the street . "
To doubters , MPAA 's Hausman and the Los Angeles district attorney 's office say stay tuned : Several large - scale , for - profit piracy operations are currently under investigation .
" There are a number of pending piracy cases I can't talk about , " says Jeff McGrath , district attorney at the high - tech crimes unit in Los Angeles .
" We 're also investigating the distribution of CDs and DVDs into stores , the mixing of illegitimate and legitimate product .
The quality of artwork can make it hard to tell them apart , " McGrath says .
For now , no convictions have been made , and neither the industry associations nor police are able to provide convincing detail , something they attribute to the early stage of their investigations .
" Building cases against groups who run burner labs can be tricky , because there are often not a lot of pirated discs on hand at one time , " Hausman says .
" It 's a just - in - time business . "
The U.S. generals running the war in Iraq presented a new assessment of the military situation in public comments and sworn testimony this week :
The 149,000 U.S. troops currently in Iraq are increasingly part of the problem .
During a trip to Washington , the generals said the presence of U.S. forces was fueling the insurgency , fostering an undesirable dependency on American troops among the nascent Iraqi armed forces and energizing terrorists across the Middle East .
For all these reasons , they said , a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops was imperative .
American officials backtracked on their expectations of what the U.S. military can achieve in Iraq months ago .
But this week ’s comments showed that commanders believe a large U.S. force in Iraq might in fact be creating problems as well as solutions .

“ This has been hinted at before , but it ’s a big shift for them to be saying that publicly , ” said Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington .
“ It means they recognize that there is a cost to staying just as there is a benefit to staying .
And this has not really been factored in as a central part of the strategy before . ”
The generals ’ comments reflect an evolving outlook that senior military officials and even Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have articulated in recent months .
The battle against Iraqi insurgents will not be won by the U.S. military , they have said , and the insurgency will persist long after U.S. troops have left .
“ If [ the insurgency ] does go on for four , eight , 10 , 12 , 15 years , whatever ... it is going to be a problem for the people of Iraq , ” Rumsfeld said in June .
“ They ’re going to have to cope with that insurgency over time .
They are ultimately going to be the ones who win over that insurgency . ”

The generals ’ words also represent a less ambitious definition of military success than what President Bush has put forth in recent statements .
At his ranch near Crawford , Texas , in August , Bush said that “ when the mission of defeating the terrorists in Iraq is complete , our troops will come home . ”
More recently , Bush has offered a more nuanced view of success , emphasizing the importance of training Iraqi troops as part of the U.S. mission to defeat the insurgents .
But the ground commanders told Congress on Thursday that the number of Iraqi units at the highest state of combat readiness had dropped from three to one since June .
And they pointed this week to problems caused by the presence of U.S. troops .

During his congressional testimony , Army Gen. George W. Casey , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , said that troop reductions were necessary to “ take away one of the elements that fuels the insurgency , that of the coalition forces as an occupying force . ”
A smaller U.S. presence could alleviate some of the anger feeding the insurgency , Casey suggested .
The same approach may prove helpful across the Middle East , commanders said .
The Central Command ’s Gen. John P. Abizaid , who supervises all U.S. troops in the region , said the broader fight against Islamic extremism required the United States to “ reduce our military footprint ” across the region and push governments in the Middle East to fight the extremists themselves .
Although Abizaid advocates a troop reduction , he does not favor total withdrawal .
He envisions such an exit preceded by the establishment of stable governments in Iraq and Afghanistan and accompanied by an assured flow of oil and enhanced regional security networks .

A smaller U.S. contingent would also encourage greater self - reliance among Iraqi forces in the face of an insurgency that could last a decade or more .
A reduction in American forces is essential to push more Iraqi troops onto the front lines , Casey said .
“ This is about dependency , ” he said .
Even among themselves , military officials have differed in their assessments of the number of Iraqi troops ready to take on the mission .
During a briefing Friday , Casey was asked whether there were enough Iraqi troops in Tall Afar to permanently keep insurgents out of the western town , where U.S. and government forces recently launched a major offensive .

“ We do have enough force , ” Casey said .
Yet the U.S. commander of the Tall Afar operation , Army Col. H.R. McMaster , said Sept. 13 that it would be some time before the town had enough trained Iraqi troops to keep insurgents from filtering back .
“ Is there enough force here right now to secure this area permanently ?
No .
Are there opportunities for the enemy in other areas within our region ?
Yes , ” McMaster said .
Among Americans , support for the war continues to dwindle , as growing numbers conclude that U.S. troops should be partially or completely withdrawn .
Only 32 % of those surveyed for a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll released last week approved of Bush ’s handling of Iraq , compared with 40 % in August and 50 % earlier this year .

The survey also showed that 59 % considered it a mistake to have sent U.S. forces to Iraq , up from fewer than half during the summer .
And 63 % said the troops should be partially or completely withdrawn , up 10 percentage points from August .
Just 21 % of those surveyed believed U.S. forces would win the war , while 34 % said they considered the conflict unwinnable .
Military officials and others familiar with Casey ’s strategy in Iraq say the U.S. plans a phased withdrawal , first pulling its troops out of the 14 provinces that commanders believe are most secure .
Initially , they would maintain a presence in the predominantly Sunni provinces of central Iraq , where most of the violence is occurring and the U.S. military suffers most of its casualties .
“ Withdrawing from the secure areas would be a good signal to the rest of Iraqis that this is coming for them eventually , ” said a Central Command advisor who has traveled frequently to Iraq and requested anonymity because he was speaking about a classified strategy .
The advisor said that U.S. commanders were concerned that Iraqi troops could become too dependent on the American presence , but that there were no plans for a hasty pullout from the violent provinces before the Iraqis were up to the task .
Advertisement
“ There ’s a line between what constitutes casual dependence and what constitutes not being ready to fight , ” he said .
“ For the most part , [ Iraqi troops ] are not ready to do the job .
And stepping back is just going to leave them vulnerable to a battle - tested army of insurgents . ”
JULY 20 -- Claiming that he found a video camera hidden in the ceiling of a sperm bank 's ' donation room , ' a Los Angeles man is suing the firm for negligence and emotional distress .
Ken Rigberg , 27 , charges that he discovered the pinhole camera during a June 2005 visit to Pasadena 's Pacific Reproductive Services .
According to Rigberg 's Los Angeles Superior Court complaint , a copy of which you 'll find below , he ' noticed an unusual hole in the ceiling tile ' of a private donation room , where he had just finished masturbating into a cup .
Upon inspection , Rigberg realized that ' there was a hidden surveillance camera on top of the ceiling tile , with the lens of the camera positioned to ... capture the activity within the private donor room . '
Rigberg is described in the lawsuit as a ' regular sperm donor ' who went to Pacific ' to provide an honorable and essential benefit to his community . '
According to Pacific 's web site , it pays men $ 100 per donation , and that most donors contribute ' once or twice weekly over a minimum one - year period or 65 donations . '
Rigberg 's attorney , S. Edmond El Dabe , provided TSG with a police photograph of the seized ceiling cam equipment , an image he received from Pacific 's insurance carrier .
El Dabe said Pasadena cops have been unable to determine who placed the video camera in the donation room ceiling .
The lawsuit , which was filed in late - May and does not specify monetary damages , asserts that Rigberg has , among other things , suffered fear , shame , humiliation , and chagrin as a result of discovering the surveillance gadget .
An ' emotionally traumatized ' Rigberg , who had been visiting Pacific for more than a year , 'no longer donates sperm , as he fears future illegal surveillance of his private acts , ' the complaint notes .

A LEGACY OF THE UNFORESEEN / Immigration reform : U.S. policies aimed at controlling the flow of newcomers historically have led to unexpected consequences

2006-05-07 04:00:00 PDT Washington --
Many of the most radical changes in the origins and numbers of America 's vast flow of immigrants were unintentionally set in motion , experts say , by politicians who expected an entirely different result .
As for the complex immigration overhaul now before Congress , they say history 's lesson from a century of immigration reform is : Fasten your seat belts .
Unlike goods that move across borders , immigrants are people .
An estimated 12 million are living illegally in the United States now .
Another 1 million gain legal residence each year .
Millions more are expected to seek entry in coming decades .
No one can accurately predict how they might respond to the harsh border crackdown offered by the House or the Senate 's plan to offer a path to citizenship for those here illegally and a guest worker program for new arrivals .
" Human behavior has often defied the best - laid plans , " said Daniel Tichenor , an immigration expert at Rutgers University .
The past is seldom consulted during today 's debates , but previous attempts at reform provide a roadmap of how quickly things can go off course .
It was a freshly minted young Massachusetts senator named Edward Kennedy who 40 years ago , in what he called " my maiden effort in the Senate , " managed the landmark Immigration Act of 1965 -- at the time a minor coda to the Civil Rights Act .
Today , Kennedy is the lead Democratic sponsor of the Senate 's bipartisan bill .
The 1965 act eliminated the national origins quotas of the 1920s that favored northern Europe .
It established visa preferences , still in place today , based on family unification and labor skills .
It imposed the first numeric limits on Latin American immigration .
And it forever changed the face of the United States .
" Arguments against the bill were chiefly based on unsubstantiated fears that the bill would greatly increase annual immigration " and permit " excessive entry " of Asians and Africans , Kennedy wrote in 1966 .
The administration declared that " immigration will not be predominantly from Asia and Africa ... indeed very few people from certain areas could even pay the cost of tickets to come here . "
New migrants were expected to come from Italy , Greece and elsewhere in southern and eastern Europe that had been restricted by the national origins quotas , in addition to the British , Germans and Scandinavians who had dominated the quotas .
Members of Congress asserted that hordes from other , darker continents would be unable to use family unification because they had no relatives in the United States .
Oddly , the national origins quotas had ignored Mexico , leaving the Southern border all but open before 1965 .
By blocking southern and eastern Europeans , the quotas allowed Mexican laborers -- and black farmers migrating from the South -- to fill their shoes .
Lawmakers considered Mexicans , unlike Poles or Italians , to be " returnable , " Tichenor said .
" If you want to look at the very early origins of illegal immigration as an issue in America , there it is . "
" This bill that we will sign today is not a revolutionary bill , " President Lyndon Johnson said on Liberty Island , Oct. 3 , 1965 .
" It does not affect the lives of millions . "
Within five years , Asian immigration had quadrupled .
The first new entrants came through occupational visas , then brought their families , beginning unanticipated network migrations , said New York University historian David Reimers .
Within a decade , the proportion of European to Asian and Latin American immigrants had reversed .
" The way we teach students is we say , in general , the unintended consequences of immigration reforms are more important than the intended consequences , " said Philip Martin , a farm immigration expert at UC Davis .
Two decades later , on Nov. 7 , 1986 , President Ronald Reagan signed another major immigration reform .
It was intended to stop illegal immigration , then seen as a burgeoning problem , by providing a one - time amnesty and banning employers from knowingly hiring illegal workers .
" Future generations of Americans will be thankful for our efforts to humanely regain control of our borders and thereby preserve the value of one of the most sacred possessions of our people , American citizenship , " Reagan said .
Sen . Alan Simpson , R - Wyo. , a chief sponsor of the bill , predicted employers would voluntarily comply with the new sanctions .
Employer sanctions quickly collapsed under widespread document fraud .
Enforcement , never vigorous , has dropped to negligible levels .
" People following it at the time knew that employer sanctions would be a joke without secure means of identification , " said Peter Skerry , a political scientist at Boston College .
" Everyone was sort of holding their nose , blocking their eyes , doing the best that could get cobbled together . "
Many experts believe that the current pattern of illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America was a consequence of the 1986 law 's border tightening -- followed by a tougher crackdown in 1996 that built fences in San Diego and El Paso .
" The perverse effect has been to dramatically lower return migration out of the country , " said Douglas S. Massey , a Princeton University sociologist and co-director of the Mexican Migration Project , a longitudinal survey of more than 18,000 migrants , the largest of its kind .
" So we 've transformed what was before 1986 a circular flow of workers into an increasingly settled population of families .
We have actually accelerated the rate of undocumented population growth in the United States and shifted it from a relatively less costly population of male workers into a much more costly population of families . "
The problem , he said , is that by making border crossing " very risky and unpleasant and increasingly expensive , you prolong the length of the trips , you reduce the probability of return migration , and you make it more likely that migrants ... just hunker down and stay . "
The rate of migration from Mexico has actually stayed constant for the last two decades , Massey found .
But the rate of return has fallen by half , from 50 percent to 25 percent .
Ever since Ben Franklin expressed alarm that growing enclaves of Germans in Pennsylvania showed no signs of learning English , Americans have feared new immigrants and waxed sentimental about the previous stock .
" One lesson from the past is that Americans have tended to celebrate their immigrant past but dread the immigrant present , " Tichenor said .
" They have often viewed the newest arrivals as menacing or as threats to the national identity or economy .
What 's intriguing is they 've usually made snap judgments in very short time horizons . "
U.S. policy has lurched between bouts of expansion and restriction , often accompanied by strong racial animus .
Borders were open until the late - 1800s , when Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 .
The 1907 " Gentlemen 's Agreement " barred Japanese laborers -- a deal made after the San Francisco school board ordered Japanese children to segregated Chinese schools .
The Chronicle warned of an invasion of vagrant Japanese workers it deemed " bumptious , disagreeable and unreliable . "
The government conducted mass deportations of Mexicans during the Great Depression and in a program labeled Operation Wetback in 1954 , deporting an estimated 1.4 million people in all .
Bad economic times , backlashes against new immigrants , or worries about national security often brought new restrictions .
The national origins quotas of 1924 and 1928 followed the Great Migration at the turn of the century and the isolationism and fear of Bolshevik influences that followed World War I .
Not even the Holocaust moved Congress to ease the restrictions .
Immigration often expanded after wars .
The 1954 War Brides Act admitted 100,000 spouses after World War II and the Korean War .
After the Vietnam War , more than 1 million Vietnamese , Laotians and Cambodians were admitted .
Expansions of immigration were often made over public objection .
" I do n't know a single poll going back to the 1930s that 's indicated the public wants more immigrants to come in as opposed to fewer , " said Reimers , the historian .
Defiance of public opinion is a striking constant of immigration policy , long fascinating political scientists .
Major expansions were often achieved through unorthodox alliances joining business , ethnic groups , free - market think tanks and churches .
Because immigration has often divided both political parties , interest groups wield extraordinary influence in the debates , said Stanford University political scientist Carolyn Wong , author of " Lobbying for Inclusion . "
Business lobbies wanting more labor visas , and ethnic groups wanting more family visas , often join powerful alliances .
California growers have long been key players .
Congress created its first major guest worker plan in 1942 , the Bracero ( " strong - armed one " ) program for unskilled Mexicans to relieve temporary labor shortages during World War II .
The program lasted 22 years , admitting 4.5 million workers .
Rife with abuses , it was dropped around passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 .
Many scholars believe the Bracero program laid the groundwork for today 's illegal immigration by setting up labor networks in Mexico and distorting the U.S. farm economy .
The program was plagued by red tape and graft on both sides of the border , inducing many Mexicans to cross illegally .
By providing an ample labor force of often - abused workers , it induced growers to plant high - profit , labor - intensive crops .
California growers were able to undercut Southern growers -- producing California 's vibrant fruit and vegetable industry which to this day relies on illegal migrants .
Because wages for migrant farm workers hardly rose , those who could leave for better paying jobs in cities fled the farms , requiring a constant flow of workers .
Growers warned that California 's canned tomato industry would die and food prices would rise if the Bracero program ended .
At its height in 1960 , 45,000 farm workers harvested 2.2 million tons of processing tomatoes , said Martin of UC Davis .
Six years after the program ended , a new oblong tomato was developed that could be machine harvested .
By 1999 , just 5,000 farm workers harvested 12 million tons of tomatoes and costs fell 54 percent , Martin found .
The United Farm Workers union soon won a wage increase .
" I think they honestly did n't think change could happen near as quickly as it actually happened , " Martin said .
Another expansion came in the 1990 immigration reform , including an obscure provision known as the " diversity visa " to fix perceived problems created by the 1965 act , then referred to by some as the " Irish Exclusion Act , " according to a study by DePaul University political scientist Anna O. Law .
Sponsored by Kennedy , the diversity visa was to redress the unforeseen problems of the 1965 law that had accidentally restricted immigration from " old seed sources of our heritage . "
But the diversity visa today admits 50,000 a year and is used heavily by Egyptians , Moroccans , Nigerians and other Africans .
" My own ballpark estimate is that in about 10 years , the country may not be so hysterical about Hispanics and may be more hysterical about Africans , " Reimers said .
EVOLUTION OF IMMIGRATION STANDARDS
The United States has always attracted large numbers of immigrants , often driven by economic and political events at home and abroad .
Large expansions are usually followed by restrictions and retrenchment .
U.S. laws have often led to unanticipated changes in the nature and composition of immigration flows .
Open borders :
From the founding until the 1880s , borders were open under the Naturalization Act of 1790 that said , " Any alien , being a free white person , may be admitted to become a citizen of the United States . "
The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s and 1850s and the California Gold Rush in 1849 drew many .
From 1820 to 1880 , Germany sent 3 million , Ireland 2.8 million and Britain 2 million .
Chinese laborers began to arrive through San Francisco in the 1850s to build the railroads .
The Great Wave of European migration peaked from 1900 to 1910 , before the outbreak of World War I. From 1880 to 1930 , 4.6 million arrived from Italy , 4 million from the Austro - Hungarian Empire , 3.3 million from Russia , 2.8 million from Germany , 2.3 million each from Canada and Britain , and 1.1 million from Sweden .
Chinese Exclusion Act 1882 : Along with the 1907 " Gentlemen 's Agreement " with Japan and the Alien Contract Labor laws of 1885 and 1887 , this law banned Asian laborers from the United States .
Congress also enacted a 50 - cent head tax on all immigrants and banned entry of idiots , lunatics , convicts and persons likely to become a public charge .
National Origins Quotas 1924 - 1964 : Enacted during an isolationist period after World War I and a backlash to the Great Wave of southern and eastern European migration .
Quotas for each nationality were set at 2 percent of the number of foreign - born persons of that nationality residing in the United States in 1890 , at attempt to lock in the ethnic makeup of the nation three decades earlier .
All but 14 percent of the quotas went to northern and western Europe .
The Western Hemisphere was exempt .
Many Mexican laborers entered during this time to expand and maintain the railroads .
The ban on immigrants from the " Asia - Pacific Triangle " continued until China became a U.S. ally in World War II .
In 1952 , many countries in Asia and Africa were given token allotments of 100 visas .
Bracero program 1942 - 1964 : Intended to meet farm labor shortages during World War II , the program lasted 22 years and brought in 4.5 million workers .
It was little used during the war .
It reached an annual peak of 450,000 workers in 1956 .
It proved unwieldy as well as harsh , and is widely believed to have laid the foundation for illegal Mexican immigration .
It also gave birth to Cesar Chavez 's United Farm Workers of America .
Immigration Act of 1965 : Enacted shortly after the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights
Act in an era of liberalization , it abolished the national origins quotas .
The Civil Rights
Act includes the phrase " national origin " as a prohibited class of discrimination .
Initiated by President John Kennedy , who wrote the pamphlet , " A Nation of Immigrants , " it was carried to enactment after his assassination by his younger brother , Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy .
The act created the structure of today 's immigration system based on preferences for family reunification and to a lesser extent job skills .
It also established the first quotas on Western Hemisphere immigration .
Sponsors expected the measure 's family unification provisions to open immigration to Italians , Poles and other Europeans excluded by the national origins system .
Instead , immigration shifted to Asia and Latin America .
Refugees : Used as a foreign policy tool during the Cold War and in response to wars .
President Dwight Eisenhower used his parole power to admit 30,000 Hungarian refugees in 1956 .
President Lyndon Johnson welcomed Cubans upon signing the 1965 act , the same day he said , " The days of unlimited immigration are over . "
President Ronald Reagan spurned refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala , where Marxist rebels were battling pro-U.S. governments , but welcomed Iranians .
After the Vietnam War , more than 1 million Vietnamese , Laotians and Cambodians were admitted .
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 : Backed by President Ronald Reagan , this law aimed to reduce the number of illegal immigrants , whose population had reached 5 million , through a combination of amnesty and sanctions against employers who hired illegal aliens .
Debate extended over a decade and was eerily parallel to today's .
Employer sanctions soon failed because of rampant document fraud and a general unwillingness to enforce them .
A special , looser amnesty for agriculture provided five times the number of legalizations anticipated .
Many of the farm worker applications were believed to be fraudulent but immigration agents were too overwhelmed to check .
No allowance was made for future flows , leading to further illegal entries .
Many families remained in a " mixed status , " partly legal and partly illegal .
Congress extended the amnesty in 1990 to include immigrants ' family members .
Diversity Lottery : Enacted in 1990 as an obscure provision of a wider bill addressing legal immigration , the " diversity visa " was intended to correct the exclusion of Irish and Italians by the 1965 act .
By the time the law passed , however , Italians had lost interest in emigrating .
The day it took effect , the Merrifield Post Office in Virginia , where applications were sent , received 1 million applications for 55,000 slots .
A few years later , the Irish also lost interest as their economy boomed .
Now used mainly by immigrants from Africa and the Middle East , the program works on a random lottery limited to countries that do not send large numbers of immigrants through other programs .
Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 : A tough border crackdown initiated by the Republican - led Congress and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton , the 1996 law was a backlash to the amnesty enacted 10 years earlier .
Spending on border enforcement soared .
Combined with 1986 border measures , border enforcement spending rose from $ 1 billion to nearly $ 5 billion a year .
Spending for detention and removal grew more than 750 percent .
Barriers were erected in San Diego and El Paso .
The law had the unanticipated result of interrupting circular migration patterns and trapping Mexican immigrants in the United States .
Illegal immigration continued to rise from the late 1990s to today .

History and hope .
They do n't always seem like the perfect couple , but just when you think it 's hopeless , along comes Adam Hochschild to remind us that even the most embedded of institutions can , in fact , be uprooted in little more than a long lifetime .
The use of the car , the burning of fossil fuels , the making of war , the arrogance of empire -- few institutions or ways of life were more " human , " more essential to our nature , than slavery .
In the piece that follows , Adam Hochschild takes us back to the first great human - rights campaign in history -- the movement to end slavery in the British Empire .
The men who began it were considered kooks .
It had no business succeeding .
Yet its legacy and its extraordinary achievements live on ( including the pioneering of most of the everyday tools any movement for change would automatically use today , from the political poster to the direct - mail fundraising letter and the media campaign ) .
Hochschild , author of King Leopold 's Ghost : A Story of Greed , Terror , and Heroism in Colonial Africa , gives us a peek below into his many - years - in - preparation history of the British anti-slavery movement , which will be published next fall .
In his hands , history offers us all unexpected hope .

Tom
On March 18 , 1783 , the Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser carried a short letter to the editor about a case being heard in a London courtroom .
The item caught the eye of a former slave living in England , Olaudah Equiano .
Horrified , he ran immediately to see an Englishman he knew , Granville Sharp , an eccentric pamphleteer and known opponent of slavery .
Sharp recorded in his diary that Equiano " called on me , with an account of one hundred and thirty Negroes being thrown alive into the sea . "
If you had proposed , in the London of early 1787 , to change all of this , nine out of ten people would have laughed you off as a crackpot .
The 10th might have admitted that slavery was unpleasant but said that to end it would wreck the British Empire 's economy .
It would be as if , today , you maintained that the automobile must go .
One in ten listeners might agree that the world would be better off if we traveled instead by foot , bicycle , electric train , or trolley , but are you suggesting a political movement to ban cars ?
Come on , be serious !
Looking back , however , what is even more surprising than slavery 's scope is how swiftly it died .
By the end of the 19th century , slavery was , at least on paper , outlawed almost everywhere .
Every American schoolchild learns about the Underground Railroad and the Emancipation Proclamation .
But our self - centered textbooks often skip over the fact that in the superpower of the time slavery ended a full quarter - century earlier .
For more than two decades before the Civil War , the holiday celebrated most fervently by free blacks in the American North was not July 4 ( when they were at risk of attack from drunken white mobs ) but August 1 , Emancipation Day in the British Empire .
To fully grasp how momentous was what began at 2 George Yard , picture the world as it existed in 1787 .
Well over three - quarters of the people on earth are in bondage of one land or another .
In parts of the Americas , slaves far outnumber free people .
African slaves are also scattered widely through much of the Islamic world .
Slavery is routine in most of Africa itself .
In India and other parts of Asia , some people are outright slaves , others in debt bondage that ties them to a particular landlord as harshly as any slave to a Southern plantation owner .
In Russia the majority of the population are serfs .
Nowhere is slavery more firmly rooted than in Britain 's overseas empire , where some half - million slaves are being systematically worked to an early death growing West Indian sugar .
Caribbean slave - plantation fortunes underlie many a powerful dynasty , from the ancestors of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to the family of the fabulously wealthy William Beckford , lord mayor of London , who hired Mozart to give his son piano lessons .
One of the most prosperous sugar plantations on Barbados is owned by the Church of England .
Furthermore , Britain 's ships dominate the slave trade , delivering tens of thousands of chained captives each year to French , Dutch , Spanish , and Portuguese colonies as well as to its own .
Strangely , in a city where it seems that on every block a blue - and - white glazed plaque commemorates a famous event or resident , none marks this spot .
All you can see today , after you leave the Bank station of the London underground , walk a block or two east , and then take a few steps into a courtyard , is a couple of low , nondescript office buildings , an ancient pub , and , on the site itself , 2 George Yard , a glass - and - steel high - rise .
Nothing remains of the bookstore and printing shop that once stood here , or recalls the late afternoon in 1787 when a dozen people - a somber - looking crew , one man in clerical black and most of the others not removing their high - crowned blade hats - filed through its doors and sat down to launch one of the most far - reaching citizens ' movements of all time .
Cities build monuments to kings and generals , not to people who once gathered in a bookstore .
And yet what these particular citizens did was felt across the world - winning the admiration of the first and greatest student of what today we call civil society .
What they accomplished , Alexis de Tocqueville wrote , was " something absolutely without precedent in history ...
If you pore over the histories of all peoples , I doubt that you will find anything more extraordinary . "
Months earlier , under Captain Luke Collingwood , the ship Zong had sailed from Africa for Jamaica with some 440 slaves , many of whom had already been on board for weeks .
Head winds , spells of calm , and bad navigation ( Collingwood mistook Jamaica for another island and sailed right past it ) stretched the transatlantic voyage to twice the usual length .
Packed tightly into a vessel of only 107 tons , slaves began to sicken .
Collingwood was worried , for a competent captain was expected to deliver his cargo in reasonable health , and , of course , dead or dying slaves brought no profits .
There was a way out , however .
If Collingwood could claim that slaves had died for reasons totally beyond his control , insurance - at £ 30 per slave - would cover the loss .
Collingwood ordered his officers to throw the sickest slaves into the ocean .
If ever questioned , he told them , they were to say that due to the unfavorable winds , the ship 's water supply was running out .
If water had been running out , these murders would be accepted under the principle of " jettison " in maritime law : A captain had a right to throw some cargo - in this case , slaves - overboard to save the remainder .
In all , 133 slaves were " jettisoned " in several batches ; the last group started to fight back and 26 of them were tossed over the side with their arms still shackled .
When the Zong 's owners later filed an insurance claim for the value of the dead slaves , it equaled more than half a million dollars in today 's money , and the insurance company disputed the claim .
The moment Equiano showed him the newspaper article , Granville Sharp leaped into action .
He hired lawyers , went to court , and personally interviewed at least one member of the ship 's crew and a passenger .
But the shocking thing about the Zong case - as much to Equiano and Sharp then as to us now - is that after more than a hundred human beings had been flung to their deaths , this was not a homicide trial .
It was a civil insurance dispute .
Sharp tried and failed to get the Zong 's owners prosecuted for murder .
But he fired off a passionate salvo of outraged letters about the case to everyone he could think of .
One letter apparently reached a prominent clergyman , who , the following year , became vice chancellor - the equivalent of an American university 's president - of Cambridge .
Disturbed by what he had heard , he put to use one of the most powerful tools at his command :
He made the morality of slavery the subject of the annual Cambridge Latin essay contest .
Latin and Greek competitions were a centerpiece of British university life .
To win a major one was like winning a Rhodes scholarship or the Heisman trophy today ; the honor would be bracketed with your name for a lifetime .
One entrant in the Latin contest was a 25 - year - old divinity student named Thomas Clarkson .
He had no previous interest in slavery whatever , he later wrote , but only " the wish of ... obtaining literary honour . "
Unexpectedly , however , as he read everything he could find , studied the papers of a slave trader who had recently died , and interviewed officers who had seen slavery firsthand in the Americas , Clarkson found himself overcome : " In the day - time I was uneasy .
In the night I had little rest .
I sometimes never closed my eye - lids for grief ....
I always slept with a candle in my room , that I might rise out of bed and put down such thoughts as might occur to me ... conceiving that no arguments ... should be lost in so great a cause . "
He won first prize .
When it was awarded in June 1785 , Clarkson read his essay aloud in Latin to an audience in Cambridge 's elegant Senate House ; then , his studies finished , already wearing the black garb of a deacon , he headed off toward London and a promising church career .
But he found , to his surprise , that it was slavery itself that " wholly engrossed my thoughts ....
Coming in sight of Wades Mill in Hertfordshire , I sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and held my horse .
Here a thought came into my mind , that if the contents of the Essay were true , it was time some person should see these calamities to their end . "
" A Fire of Indignation Kindling Within Me "
It was time some person should see these calamities to their end .
If there is a single point at which the anti-slavery movement in the British Empire became inevitable , it is the moment Thomas Clarkson got off his horse and sat down beside the road .
When he remounted and rode onward to London , it was with the determination , first of all , to publish his essay in English .
In the office of one well - known London publisher , he was dismayed that the man was interested only because the essay had won a prize .
Clarkson , by contrast , " wished the Essay to find its way ... among such as would think and act with me . "
He had just left the publisher 's office when , on the street , he ran into a Quaker friend of his family 's .
The Quakers were the only religious denomination that had come out against slavery , and the man said Clarkson was just the person he was looking for :
Why had n't he published that essay of his ?
Together , they walked a few blocks to the bookstore and printing shop of James Phillips , in George Yard , in the warren of narrow curving streets of London 's business district .
Bookselling , publishing , and printing usually happened under the same roof in those days ( with the printer 's family often living upstairs and perhaps a cow or pig or two in the back yard ) , and this was the work that Phillips did for Britain 's small Quaker community .
Clarkson took an immediate liking to him , and on the spot said Phillips could publish the essay .
This was the day Clarkson discovered that he was not alone .
With ferocious determination , he now dedicated himself to finding out everything he could about slavery .
Many ships sailed for Africa from the docks along the Thames , and after climbing on board and exploring one , he wrote , " I found soon afterwards a fire of indignation kindling within me . "
He systematically visited anyone with firsthand information : merchants , sea captains , army and navy officers .
With the instincts of a good reporter , " I made it a rule to put down in writing , after every conversation , what had taken place . "
The key people he would have to work with were clearly the Quakers ; they were rock - firm in their convictions , and they had a small but dedicated network around the country .
To them , it was clear that Clarkson was a godsend :
He was young , brimming with energy , and , above all , he was a member of the all - powerful Church of England .
The major reason the Quakers ' anti-slavery efforts had so far accomplished nothing was simply because they were Quakers .
People mocked them as oddballs who said " thee " and " thou , " who refused to take off their distinctive black hats except when preaching or praying , and who refused to use the names of the months or the days of the week because these derived from Roman or pagan gods instead of from the Bible .
To influence public opinion , the Quakers needed a talented Anglican willing to devote all his energy to the movement , and in Clarkson , at last , they had one .
Together , Clarkson and his Quaker allies carefully planned a broad organization from both faiths .
" Went to town on my mare to attend a committee of the Slave Trade now instituted , " wrote one Quaker in his diary .
In the late afternoon of May 22 , 1787 , the group of a dozen men officially assembled for the first time , at James Phillips ' bookstore and printing shop .
Probably the printers had gone home for the day , so there would have been no clanking flatbed press , but large sheets of uncut book pages would have been hanging from overhead wooden racks in the ceiling , the ink drying .
The committee targeted the slave trade , rather than slavery itself , because abolishing the first seemed within easier political reach and it also seemed likely to eventually end the second .
West Indian slavery was by every measure far deadlier than slavery almost anywhere else .
Cultivating sugar by hand , under a broiling sun , was - and still is - one of the hardest forms of labor on earth .
Tropical diseases were rampant ; the slaves ' diet was much worse than in the American South ; they died younger ; they had far fewer children .
The death rate on the brutal Caribbean plantations was so high that the slave population would have been dropping by up to 3 percent a year if it were not for the steady shipments of new slaves from Africa .
Stop the trade , abolitionists were - naively - convinced , and slavery itself would in the long run become impossible .
The committee now had to ignite its crusade in a country where the overwhelming majority of people considered slavery totally normal .
Plantation profits gave a major boost to the British economy , and the livelihood of tens of thousands of seamen , merchants , and shipbuilders depended upon the slave trade .
How to even begin the massive job of changing public opinion ?
More than nine out often Englishmen , and all Englishwomen , could not even vote .
Without this most basic right , could they be roused to care about the rights of other people , of a different skin color , an ocean away ?
In all of human experience , there was no precedent for such a campaign .
" Success to the Trade "
In June of 1787 , Thomas Clarkson got on his horse again and set off for the big slave - ship ports of Bristol and Liverpool .
He was looking for veterans of the trade who could eventually testify before parliamentary hearings .
he would also distribute pamphlets and quietly set up local abolition committees .
Amazingly , for many years to come , he would be the movement 's only permanent , full - time organizer .
A sense of foreboding came over Clarkson as he approached Bristol : " The bells of some of the churches were then ringing ; the sound ... filled me ... with a melancholy ....
I began now to tremble , for the first time , at the arduous task I had undertaken , of attempting to subvert one of the branches of the commerce of the great place which was then before me ....
I questioned whether I should even get out of it alive . "
This was not , it turned out , an unreasonable fear .
In the autobiographical history of the movement Clarkson later wrote , the very paper seems to burn with his outrage .
When he tracked down information about a massacre of some 300 Africans by British slave traders on the coast of what is today Nigeria , he wrote , " It made ... my blood boil ... within me . "
More than 6 feet tall , Clarkson had thick red hair and large , intense blue eyes that looked whomever he spoke to directly in the face .
As he stalks purposefully through the streets of Bristol , we can sense him fully finding his calling : " I began now to think that the day was not long enough for me to labour in .
I regretted often the approach of night , which suspended my work . "
The brutality of the slave trade , Clarkson discovered , was n't confined to the mistreatment of the slaves themselves .
He found a slave ship in the harbor , just returned from a voyage on which 32 seamen had died - a number larger than many a ship 's entire crew .
The treatment of one sailor , a free black man named John Dean , wrote Clarkson , " exceeded all belief ....
The captain had fastened him with his belly to the deck , and ... poured hot pitch upon his back , and made incisions in it with hot tongs . "
Dean had disappeared , but Clarkson found a witness who " had often looked at his scarred and mutilated back . "
Each discovery led to another .
If slave vessels were so notoriously brutal , why did sailors continue to sign on ?
For several weeks , Clarkson haunted Bristol waterfront pubs to see how officers recruited their crews .
" The young mariner , if a stranger to the port , and unacquainted with the nature of the Slave - trade , was sure to be picked up . "
He would be told that wages were high and women plentiful .
" He was plied with liquor ....
Seamen also were boarded in these houses , who , when the slave - ships were going out , but at no other time , were encouraged to spend more than they had money to pay for . "
The pub keeper then demanded payment , and only " one alternative was given , namely , a slave - vessel , or a gaol . "
Captains and mates refused to talk to Clarkson .
But one day in the street , an overheard fragment of conversation made him follow a well - dressed man , a doctor , as it turned out , named James Arnold .
He had made two slave voyages , which he described to Clarkson in gruesome detail , and was about to leave on a third .
( These ships often carried doctors ; healthy slaves fetched higher prices . )
Arnold " had been cautioned about falling - in with me , " but spoke boldly nonetheless , explaining that he was " quite pennyless ... but if he survived this voyage he would never go another . "
Would Arnold be willing " to keep a journal of facts , and to give his evidence , if called upon , on his return " ?
The answer was yes .
Several times , Clarkson tried to get slave - ship captains prosecuted for murder .
None of these attempts succeeded , but word of them got back to London , where the sober Quaker businessmen on the committee were alarmed that instead of quietly investigating , Clarkson was getting too combative .
One wrote to him , " I hope the zeal and animation with which thou hast taken up the cause will be accompanied with temper and moderation . "
But Clarkson showed no moderation as he rode on to Liverpool , the world 's largest slave - trade port , which would be sending 81 ships to Africa that year .
As he was walking past a ship chandler 's shop , he was shocked to see handcuffs , leg shackles , and thumbscrews in the window .
He also noticed a surgical instrument with a screw device , used by doctors in cases of lockjaw .
The shopkeeper explained :
It was for prying open the mouths of any slaves on shipboard who tried to commit suicide by not eating .
Clarkson bought one of each item ; from here on , he would display them to the newspaper editor in every town he passed through .
He was learning that organizing alone is not enough ; you need to wage a media campaign .
At the King 's Arms tavern in Liverpool , where he stayed , men pointed him out in the dining room .
" Some gave as a toast , Success to the Trade , and then laughed immoderately , and watched me when I took my glass to see if I would drink it . "
Before long , he began receiving anonymous death threats .
One day , looking back from the end of a pier in a heavy gale , " I noticed eight or nine persons making towards me ....
They closed upon me and bore me back . "
The group included one of the ship 's officers he was trying to have prosecuted for murder .
At this moment , his tall , strong build saved him from harm - and possibly from death if , like most Britons of his day , he did not know how to swim .
" It instantly struck me that they had a design to throw me over the pier - head ....
There was not a moment to lose .... I darted forward .
One of them , against whom I pushed myself , fell down ....
And I escaped , not without blows , amidst their imprecations and abuse . "
The Blood - sweetened Beverage
Within two or three months of Clarkson 's return to London , where the committee had been energetically recruiting supporters and distributing books and pamphlets , there appeared a dramatic sign of a sea change in public opinion .
There were no Gallup polls in those days , but there was one group of businessmen whose living depended on shrewdly gauging public tastes : the proprietors of London 's debating societies .
( Sex was always popular , for instance , with debate topics such as " Whether the fashionable infidelities of married couples are more owing to the depravity of the Gentlemen or the inconstancy of the Ladies ? " )
After years in which slavery was only rarely a subject , abruptly the abolition of the slave trade was the topic of half of all 14 public debates on record in the city 's daily newspapers in February 1788 .
At one , an ad promised that " A NATIVE OF AFRICA , many years a Slave in the West - Indies , " would speak .
The anonymous African was probably Olaudah Equiano .
Another newspaper reported " a circumstance never before witnessed in a Debating Society .
A lady spoke to the subject with that dignity , energy , and information , which astonished every one present ....
The question was carried against the Slave Trade . "
Other than at religious meetings , these may be , scholars believe , the first occasions that either a black person or a woman gave a public speech in Britain .
The most important expression of public feeling came on great , stiff rolls of parchment .
By the time Parliament adjourned for the year , petitions asking for abolition or reform of the slave trade had been signed by more than 60,000 people .
Petitions were a time - honored means of pressure in a country where voters had no control whatever over the House of Lords , and where fewer than one adult man in ten could vote for the House of Commons .
Anti-slave - trade petitions - never seen before - suddenly outnumbered those on all other subjects combined .
The superbly organized anti-slavery committee also pioneered several techniques used ever since .
For example , they periodically printed copies of " a Letter to our Friends in the Country , to inform them of the state of the Business " -- the ancestor of many a newsletter , print or electronic , published by activist groups today .
They also agreed on a piece of text delivered to every donor in greater London appealing for another contribution , at least as big as the last .
This may have been history 's first direct - mail fundraising letter .
When the famous one - legged pottery entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood joined the committee , he had one of his craftsmen make a bas - relief of a kneeling slave , in chains , encircled by the legend " Am I Not a Man and a Brother ? "
American anti-slavery sympathizer Benjamin Franklin , impressed , declared that the image had an impact " equal to that of the best written Pamphlet . "
Clarkson gave out 500 of these medallions on his organizing trips .
" Of the ladies , several wore them in bracelets , and others had them fitted up in an ornamental manner as pins for their hair . "
The equivalent of the lapel buttons we wear for an electoral campaign , this was probably the first widespread use of a logo designed for a political cause .
It was the 18th century 's " new media . "
Within a few years , another tactic arose from the grassroots .
Throughout the length and breadth of the British Isles , people stopped eating the major product harvested by British slaves : sugar .
Clarkson was delighted to find a " remedy , which the people were ... taking into their own hands ....
Rich and poor , churchmen and dissenters ....
By the best computation I was able to make from notes taken down in my journey , no fewer than three hundred thousand persons had abandoned the use of sugar . "
Almost like " fair trade " food labeling today , advertisements quickly filled the press : " BENJAMIN TRAVERS , Sugar - Refiner , acquaints the Publick that he has now an assortment of Loaves , Lumps , Powder Sugar , and Syrup , ready for sale ... produced by the labour of FREEMEN . "
Then , as now , the full workings of a globalized economy were largely invisible .
The boycott caught people 's imagination because it brought these hidden ties to light .
The poet Robert Southey spoke of tea as " the blood - sweetened beverage . "
Slavery advocates were horrified .
One rushed out a counterpamphlet claiming that " sugar is not a luxury ; but ... a necessary of life ; and great injury have many persons done to their constitutions by totally abstaining from it . "
The abolitionists pioneered another key organizing tool as well , and you have seen it .
Rare is the TV program or illustrated book about slavery that does not show a detailed , diagramlike top - down view of rows of slaves ' bodies packed like sardines into a ship .
The ship is a specific one , the Brookes , of Liverpool , and Clarkson and his colleagues swiftly printed 8,700 copies of the diagram , and it was soon hung on the walls of homes and pubs throughout the country .
Part of its brilliance was that it was unanswerable :
What could the slave interests do , make a painting of happy slaves on shipboard ?
Precise , understated , and eloquent in its starkness , it was the first widely reproduced political poster .
The First Political Book Tour
Uprisings of the oppressed have erupted throughout history , but the anti-slavery movement in England was the first sustained mass campaign anywhere on behalf of someone else 's rights .
Sometimes Britons even seemed to be organizing against their own self - interest .
From Sheffield , famous for making scissors , scythes , knives , razors , and the like , 769 metalworkers petitioned Parliament in 1789 .
Because their wares were sold to ship captains for use as currency to buy slaves , the Sheffield cutlers wrote , they might be expected to favor the slave trade .
But they vigorously opposed it : " Your petitioners ... consider the case of the nations of Africa as their own . "
Consider the Africans ' case as their own ?
Stephen Fuller , London agent for the Jamaican planters and a key figure in the pro-slavery lobby , wrote in bewilderment that the petitions flooding into Parliament were " stating no grievance or injury of any land or sort , affecting the Petitioners themselves . "
He was right to be startled .
This was something new in human history .
Meanwhile , something else feeding the country 's growing antislavery fervor was Olaudah Equiano 's autobiography , a vivid account of his life in slavery and freedom .
At seven shillings a copy , it became a best - seller .
For an extraordinary five years , he promoted his book throughout the kingdom , winning a particularly friendly reception in Ireland , whose people felt that they , too , knew something about oppression by the British .
Equiano's was the first great political book tour , and never was one better timed .
The slave interests were piqued .
In the biggest slave port , the editor of the Liverpool General Advertiser bemoaned the " infatuation of our country , running headlong into ruin . "
Pro-slavery forces now launched counterattacks .
They bought copies of a pro-slavery book for distribution " particularly at Cambridge " ( college towns leaned left even then ) and printed 8,000 copies of a pamphlet about how each happy slave family had " a snug little house and garden , and plenty of pigs and poultry . "
They sponsored a London musical , The Benevolent Planters , in which two black lovers , separated in Africa , end up living on adjoining plantations in the West Indies and are reunited by their kindly owners .
But Britons dependent on the slave economy were worried .
Some doggerel made the rounds in Liverpool :
If our slave trade had gone , there 's an end to our lives / Beggars all we must be , our children and wives /
No ships from our ports , their proud sails e'er would spread /
And our streets grown with grass where the cows might be fed .
The slave interests ' tactics bore a fascinating resemblance to the way industries under assault try to defend themselves today .
When , for instance , there were moves in Parliament to try to regulate the treatment of slaves , the planters hastily drew up a lofty - sounding code of conduct of their own and insisted no government interference was necessary .
They considered other P.R. techniques as well .
" The vulgar are influenced by names and titles , " suggested one pro-slavery writer in 1789 .
" Instead of SLAVES , let the Negroes be called ASSISTANT - PLANTERS ; and we shall not then hear such violent outcries against the slave - trade . "
The Movement Deflected
In Parliament , slavery 's most colorful spokesman was the Duke of Clarence , one of the many dissolute sons of King George III .
As a teenager , he had entered the Royal Navy and gone to the West Indies , where he was wined and dined enthusiastically by the plantation owners .
He showered marriage proposals and cases of venereal disease on their daughters and thoroughly imbibed their attitudes .
In his maiden speech before fellow members of the House of Lords in their red and ermine robes , he called himself " an attentive observer of the state of the negroes , " who found them well cared for and " in a state of humble happiness . "
On another occasion , he warned that Britain 's abolishing the trade would mean the slaves would be transported by foreigners , " who would not use them with such tenderness and care . "
Parliament was , of course , where the ultimate battle over the slave trade had to be fought .
As spokesman in the House of Commons , Clarkson had lined up William Wilberforce , a wealthy , diminutive member of Parliament from Yorkshire , widely respected for his piety and eloquence .
Except for his lifelong opposition to slavery , Wilberforce was Clarkson 's political opposite .
Where Clarkson was swept up by the radical currents of the age , Wilberforce feared democratic impulses , labor unions , rising wages , and women 's participation in political life .
Nonetheless , the two men were good friends and worked together closely for nearly 50 years .
But before Parliament could act , there were lengthy hearings .
Witnesses like James Penny , a former captain , made the slaves on the middle passage sound almost like cruise passengers : " If the Weather is sultry , and there appears the least Perspiration upon their Skins , when they come upon Deck , there are Two Men attending with Cloths to rub them perfectly dry , and another to give them a little Cordial ....
They are then supplied with Pipes and Tobacco ....
They are amused with Instruments of Music peculiar to their own country ... and when tired of Music and Dancing , they then go to Games of Chance . "
Rounding up eyewitnesses willing to speak against the trade was as difficult as finding military or corporate whistleblowers today .
For a seaman or ship 's officer to testify critically meant he could never find work on slave ships again .
At one point Clarkson rode 1,600 miles in two months , scouring the country for more witnesses .
Often , he complained , " when I took out my pen and ink to put down the information , which a person was giving me , he became ... embarrassed and frightened . "
The most dramatic witness had just returned from a slave voyage : James Arnold , the Bristol doctor whom Clarkson had persuaded to keep a journal .
The slave interests skillfully used the hearings as a delaying tactic , spreading them out over several years , and outmaneuvering Wilberforce , who was a naive and disorganized legislative strategist .
They beat back several of his attempts to get Parliament to abolish the slave trade , but by the spring of 1792 , some five years after that first landmark meeting at 2 George Yard , it looked as if public feeling against the trade was too strong to be resisted .
" Of the enthusiasm of the nation at this time , " wrote Clarkson , " none can form an opinion but they who witnessed it ....
The current ran with such strength and rapidity , that it was impossible to stem it . "
Exhausted , he had just finished one of his horseback organizing marathons around the country ; Equiano was finding friendly audiences wherever he went ; and the sugar boycott was at its peak .
William Wordsworth wrote that the anti-slavery fervor of that spring was nothing less " than a whole Nation crying with one voice . "
Clarkson and other activists lobbied members of Parliament with unrelenting intensity .
Anti-slavery petitions flooded Parliament as never before .
When unrolled , the one from Edinburgh stretched the entire length of the House of Commons floor .
Twenty thousand people signed in Manchester - nearly one - third of the city 's population .
Petitions from some small towns bore the signatures of almost every literate inhabitant .
Altogether , there were 519 petitions from all over England , Scotland , and Wales .
Four petitions arrived in favor of the trade .
The hearings for now finished , the parliamentary debate ran through the night .
And so we must imagine the House of Commons chamber dimly lit by candles in a chandelier and wall brackets ; the gowned , bewigged Speaker in his pulpitlike chair ; members bowing to him when they leave the floor ; the black - cloaked clerks below him ; the snuffboxes at the doors ; the candlelight glinting on the silver - and - gold ceremonial mace lying upon the central table ; and , rising into the gloom , the benches of members , many in boots and spurs .
The narrow visitors ' galleries high above them were packed , and newcomers were turned away .
Equiano got there in time , however .
Clarkson slipped a doorkeeper a handsome 10 guineas to let in 30 abolitionists .
When Henry Dundas , the politically powerful Home Secretary who controlled a large block of Scottish votes , rose to speak , no one knew where he stood .
Dundas began by declaring himself in favor of abolition , at which those in the gallery must have felt their spirits rise .
He then went even further , and declared himself in favor of emancipation of the slaves ... but far in the future , he added quickly , and after much preparation and education .
Then , to the abolitionists ' dismay , he introduced an amendment that inserted the word " gradually " in Wilberforce 's motion to abolish the slave trade .
This signaled the moment that comes in every political crusade , when the other side is forced to adopt the crusaders ' rhetoric :
The factory farm labels its produce " natural " ; the oil company declares itself environmentalist .
Dundas had called himself an abolitionist , but he asked that abolition be postponed .
The tall , slender prime minister , William Pitt , not yet 33 years old , spoke last , at 4 a .m .
He declared himself " too much exhausted to enter so fully into the subject ... as I could wish . "
But to read his speech today is to feel shame at the sound - bite political rhetoric of our own time .
Pitt spoke for more than an hour , extemporaneously .
He began by taking the " gradualists " at their word , that they favored abolition , and then one by one showed how each of their points was a better argument for ending the trade now .
Then he demolished the classic arguments of the slave traders .
Like arms exporters today , British shipowners claimed that if they ceased carrying slaves , the business would merely go to other countries , especially the great rival , France .
But how could anyone expect France to increase its slave trading when it was desperately trying to put down a vast rebellion - the Haitian revolution - in its prime colony ?
And as for the trade itself , Pitt asked , " How , sir !
Is this enormous evil ever to be eradicated , if every nation is thus prudentially to wait till the concurrence of all the world shall have been obtained ? "
Finally ,
Pitt made a grand historical comparison that cleverly made use of the country 's imperial arrogance .
Britain , he declared , and British laws and achievements , were the acme of human civilization .
But was it fair to call Africa barbarous and uncivilized , and to say that the slave traders were doing no harm by removing people from that continent ?
For in Britain , too , many centuries earlier , one would have found slavery and human sacrifice .
" Why might not some Roman Senator ... pointing to British Barbarians , have predicted with equal boldness , ' There is a people that will never rise to civilization ' ...? "
Legend has it that just as he concluded , the first rays of the rising sun burst through the large window behind the Speaker 's chair .
Pitt 's eloquence was not enough .
The gradualist proposal passed , and after more debate the House set 1796 , four long years hence , as the year when the slave trade was to end .
A far more significant obstacle , however , was the House of Lords , which voted down any abolition at all , gradual or otherwise .
The abolitionists were deeply discouraged .
Nonetheless , for the first time anywhere in the world , a national legislative body had voted for an end to the slave trade .
" My Children Shall Be Free "
Before the issue could come up again at the next year 's parliamentary session , Britain and France went to war - a conflict that lasted , with only two short interruptions , for 22 years , ending only at Waterloo .
The fighting brought with it a wave of repression :
Every progressive movement , including abolition , was stopped in its tracks .
It was not until 1806 , after Clarkson , his hair now turning white , had toured the country rallying the faithful again , that the abolitionists found a way of cloaking a partial slave - trade ban in patriotic colors .
Despite the war , British - owned slave ships , it turned out , were stealthily but profitably supplying slaves to French colonies .
Parliament swiftly forbade this , and with the momentum from that move , the abolitionists were able to get both houses to ban the entire British slave trade in 1807 .
They were still confident that this would soon spell the end of slavery itself .
However , now that Caribbean planters were no longer able to replace slaves worked to death by buying shiploads of new ones , they eased working conditions and improved the slaves ' diet .
By the 1820s , the slave birthrate was rising .
In England , the movement came back to life , pushing now for emancipation .
Once again , in his 60s , Clarkson headed off around the country , traveling for more than a year all told , visiting his contacts from decades before - or , more often , their children - and helping to start more than 200 local committees .
With their eyes again on a very conservative Parliament , he and his colleagues were cautious , advocating freeing the slaves in slow stages .
But this time something different happened .
More than 70 " Ladies ' " anti-slavery societies sprang up throughout Britain ; influenced by a fiery Quaker pamphleteer named Elizabeth Heyrick , they mostly pushed for immediate , not gradual , freedom .
One woman activist wrote , " Men may propose only gradually to abolish the worst of crimes , and only mitigate the most cruel bondage , but why should we countenance such enormities ...? "
When news of the revived movement crossed the Atlantic , at the end of 1831 , it helped ignite the largest slave rebellion ever seen in the British West Indies .
More than 20,000 slaves rose up throughout northwestern Jamaica .
Planters had long liked to build their grand balconied homes on breezy heights , and , now going up in flames , they acted as signal beacons .
As the militia were closing in on one plantation in rebel hands , a slave set fire to the sugar works , shouting , before she was shot , " I know I shall die for it , but my children shall be free ! "
By the time troops suppressed the revolt , some 200 slaves and 14 whites were dead .
The gallows or firing squads claimed more than 340 additional slaves .
However , the rebellion helped convince Britain 's establishment that the cost of continued slavery was too high .
William Taylor , a former Jamaican plantation manager and police magistrate , testified before a parliamentary committee that the revolts " will break out again , and if they do you will not be able to control them ....
I cannot understand how you can expect [ slaves ] to be quiet , who are reading English newspapers . "
After the most massive campaign of petitions and demonstrations yet seen , Parliament finally gave in .
Nearly 800,000 slaves throughout the British Empire became free on August 1 , 1838 .
On the sweltering night before , the Baptist church in Falmouth , Jamaica , hung its walls with branches , flowers , and portraits of Clarkson and Wilberforce .
A coffin was inscribed " Colonial Slavery , died July 31st , 1838 , aged 276 years " and was filled with chains , an iron collar , and a whip .
An open grave lay waiting outside .
Just after midnight , singing parishioners lowered the coffin into it .
Slavery in the largest empire on earth was over .
Of the 12 men who had assembled 51 years earlier in the Quaker bookstore and printing shop at 2 George Yard , Thomas Clarkson was the only one still alive .
Changing the World
Though born in the age of swords , wigs , and stagecoaches , the British anti-slavery movement leaves us an extraordinary legacy .
Every day activists use the tools it helped pioneer : consumer boycotts , newsletters , petitions , political posters and buttons , national campaigns with local committees , and much more .
But far more important is the boldness of its vision .
Look at the problems that confront the world today : global warming ; the vast gap between rich and poor nations ; the relentless spread of nuclear weapons ; the poisoning of the earth 's soil , air , and water ; the habit of war .
To solve almost any one of these , a realist might say , is surely the work of centuries ; to think otherwise is naive .
But many a hardheaded realist could - and did - say exactly the same thing to those who first proposed to end slavery .
After all , was it not in one form or another woven into the economy of most of the world ?
Had it not existed for millennia ?
Was it not older , even , than money and the written word ?
Surely anyone expecting to change all of that was a dreamer .
But the realists turned out to be wrong .
" Never doubt , " said Margaret Mead , " that a small group of thoughtful , committed citizens can change the world .
Indeed , it is the only thing that ever has . "

Levels of HTML knowledge
Inspired by Emil Stenström ’s Levels of CSS knowledge , I started thinking about the extreme difference in HTML knowledge among people working in the web industry .
It spans all the way from people who know next to nothing about it to those who know it well enough to write the actual HTML specifications .
I thought I ’d describe a few different levels of HTML knowledge .
For some people , these levels are stages that they pass while learning more and more about HTML , gradually understanding concepts such as web standards , semantics , and accessibility .
Others are at a certain level because it matches their attitude towards HTML and coding in general .
Many people never advance beyond the first few levels .
For some that is just fine , while for others it is not .
This is all written in a tongue - in - cheek way and is just my personal opinion .
Please do n’t over - react if you do n’t agree or think some of the descriptions are a bit harsh .
Try laughing instead .
The levels then :
HTML Level 0
People at this level have never seen HTML except by mistake , like when accidentally opening an HTML email in text mode .
These people do not work in the web industry and never will , so they have no wish or reason to move beyond Level 0 .
They are included in this article to provide a kind of bottom line .
Typical quote :
Age - tee - em - what ?
HTML Level 1
These people use the web enough to know that some kind computer programming magic is going on behind the scenes of the websites they use .
When trying to publish anything on the Web , they are helpless without a WYSIWYG editor of some kind .
It could be Photoshop , Dreamweaver , Frontpage , or the editor built into the CMS they have been told to use .
People keeping a website ’s content up to date can often be found at this skill level , and some argue that there should be no need for them to move to a higher level .
A lot of visually oriented designers are firmly stuck here by choice , often defending that choice by saying that “ Nobody in the print world edits PostScript code by hand , so why should the web be any different ? ”
Many web project managers unfortunately fail to progress beyond Level 1 .
Typical quote :
HTML ?
It ’s those tags you use to make text bold or italic .
HTML Level 2
This level contains people who know enough about HTML to be able to find their way around an HTML document as long as they stick to the few tags ( everything is called a tag at this level ) they recognise .
They do n’t really want to touch the HTML though .
Many Level 2 people are back - end programmers who prefer the safety of Visual Studio or whatever IDE they are using .
They think HTML is too simple for them to bother with and that applications should be smart enough to handle it all for them .
Level 2 developers seem very popular with CMS vendors .
Typical quote :
The controls I drag and drop in my IDE work fine in Internet Explorer , so why should I have to even look at the HTML ?
HTML Level 3
A lot of old school web developers who have been in the business since the late nineties can be found at this level .
Up until the end of last century these people coded HTML by hand , so they know all about nested tables and spacer GIFs .
Since then , WYSIWYG editors like GoLive and Dreamweaver have improved to the point where Level 3 people see no reason to learn more about HTML .
These days most of their HTML - related work is done in their editor ’s design view anyway , so they would rather spend their time learning a specific application instead of finding out more about what is going on behind the scenes .
Typical quote :
Yeah yeah , I ’ve heard about those fancy new ul and h1 tags , but I ’m doing just fine with my trusty old table , img , and br tags .
HTML Level 4
This level is where people start intentionally using doctypes .
The first step is almost always a transitional doctype , often XHTML 1.0 Transitional .
XHTML is more recent than HTML after all , so it ’s got to be better , right ?
People at this level are also the biggest fans of XHTML 1.1 , since they think a higher version number has to be better .
After hearing from someone that you should n’t use tables for layout , a lot of Level 4 people use div elements to recreate a table - like structure .
This of course leads to tag soup being replaced by div mania , and a lot of presentational markup , classitis , and inline CSS are produced by people at this level .
Most web developers who have reached Level 4 are willing to keep learning , and they understand that there are advantages to the methods being promoted by web standards oriented blogs and books .
But they have n’t yet grasped why those methods are better .
Typical quote :
How can I create a data table with divs and spans instead of tables ?
HTML Level 5
Most standards aware web professionals can be found here .
These people tend to think about structure and semantics first and presentation later .
Strict doctypes are generally used at this level to encourage the separation of semantic and presentational markup .
Whether the markup language is HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 is less important to many .
In fact , some people at Level 5 are questioning the use of XHTML .
Level 5 people tend to get into endless discussions about tiny markup details .
They can waste hours thinking about class names or reorganising their HTML and CSS files to make their code look pretty .
If you have reached this level I think you ’re doing extremely well .
For most people there is no compelling reason to move beyond this Level 5 .
Typical quote :
Hmm .
I wonder which type of list is the most semantic way to mark up this part of my document .
HTML Level 6
These people are the thinkers of the industry .
They spend a lot of time contemplating what will be useful in the future instead of right here and now .
The results of much of their work will probably not be of any practical use to the average web professional for at least another five years .
At Level 6 you may have moved beyond actually building websites for a living .
Instead you may be concentrating on writing future specifications or interpreting existing ones for browser vendors .
Typical quote :
I think the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 2 specs are too semantically limited , so I am working on a new markup language .
Finding the right level
It is n’t necessary for everybody to reach HTML Level 6 .
I consider myself a Level 5 person , and I ’m quite happy reading the specs instead of writing them so I do n’t really feel like I need to reach Level 6 .
People whose task is to keep a website ’s content up - to - date can even get by at Level 1 , provided that their CMS is good enough .
It all depends on your needs .
What does not , however , is your attitude towards HTML .
Even if you do n’t need or want to learn all there is about HTML , you have to acknowledge that it is the most important language on the web .
What level of HTML knowledge are you at , and what level are you aiming for ?

BBC News , Kuala Lumpur
The car , a Mercedes S-class , was protected by a fingerprint recognition system .
Accountant K Kumaran 's ordeal began when he was run down by four men in a small car as he was about to get into his Mercedes in a Kuala Lumpur suburb .
The gang , armed with long machetes , demanded the keys to his car .
It is worth around $ 75,000 second - hand on the local market , where prices are high because of import duties .
Stripped naked
The attackers forced Mr Kumaran to put his finger on the security panel to start the vehicle , bundled him into the back seat and drove off .
But having stripped the car , the thieves became frustrated when they wanted to restart it .
They found they again could not bypass the immobiliser , which needs the owner 's fingerprint to disarm it .
They stripped Mr Kumaran naked and left him by the side of the road - but not before cutting off the end of his index finger with a machete .
Police believe the gang is responsible for a series of thefts in the area .
Negotiators worked late into the night on a deal
In an eleventh - hour agreement ahead of a UN internet summit in Tunis , Tunisia , negotiators agreed to leave the US in charge of the net 's addressing system .
Instead an international forum will be set up to discuss net issues , although it will not have any binding authority .
The deal clears the way for the summit to focus on how poorer nations can benefit from the digital revolution .
About 10,000 delegates , including world leaders , technology experts and campaigners , are expected at the three - day World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) in Tunis .
International forum
Disagreements over control of the internet had threatened to overshadow the summit , with countries such as China and Iran pushing for an international body under UN auspices to oversee the net .
We did not change anything on the role of the US government with regard to the technical aspects that we were very concerned about
David Gross , US State Department
Why the net and politicians do n't mix
The Tunis deal leaves the day - to - day management of the net in the hands of the California - based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) , which answers to the US government .
Icann will keep its current responsibilities for overseeing domain names and addressing systems , such as country domain suffixes , and managing how net browsers and e-mail programs direct traffic .
The 170 nations taking part in the negotiations agreed on the creation of an Intergovernmental Forum to discuss all internet issues , such as spam , viruses and cyber crime .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Let 's just hope goverments and politicians do n't get too much say
David , UK
Send your comments
Mr Gross said the forum would not have oversight authority nor would it do " anything that will create any problems for the private sector " .
Its first meeting is likely to be held in Athens , Greece , early next year .
Casting a wider net
The agreement on internet governance means that delegates at the Tunis meeting can focus on how far governments have gone in their pledges for an " inclusive information society " , set out two years ago at a first summit in Geneva .
The hurdle here is more political than financial .
The cost of connectivity , computers and mobile telephones can be brought down
Kofi Annan , UN Secretary General
The Geneva summit disappointed many countries after the rich nations failed to back a Digital Solidarity Fund .
The fund , intended to help finance technology projects in developing countries , was formally launched earlier this year .
The voluntary fund has so far only raised $ 6.4 m ( £ 3.68 m ) in cash and pledges , so the UN will be hoping to encourage more contributions .
Opening the UN summit , Secretary General Kofi Annan said the task now was to make the move from diagnosis to deeds .
" The hurdle here is more political than financial , " he said .
" The cost of connectivity , computers and mobile telephones can be brought down .
" These bridges to a better life can be universally affordable and accessible .
We must summon the will to do it . "
One effort which will receive much attention is the non-profit One Laptop Per Child group , set up by Nicholas Negroponte , chairman and founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Labs .
It plans to produce up to 15 million sub -$ 100 laptops within a year .
Professor Negroponte will unveil the prototype at the summit .
There will be hundreds of other projects , events , roundtables , high - level talks and exhibitions at the summit too .
There are other larger social justice issues to be tackled , such as how to ensure freedom of expression and information for everyone on the net , an issue which bloggers will be watching closely .
Ahead of the summit , there have been concerns about freedom of expression in Tunisia , following alleged assaults or harassment of journalists and campaigners on the sidelines of the event .
WSIS takes place in Tunis from 16 to 18 November .
Why Cindy Sheehan is Right !
By David Duke
Cindy Sheehan , a mother who lost a son in the Iraq War , is determined to prevent other mothers and fathers from experiencing the same loss .
Courageously she has gone to Texas near the ranch of President Bush and braved the elements and a hostile Jewish supremacist media to demand a meeting with him and a good explanation why her son and other ’s sons and daughters must die and be disfigured in a war for Israel rather than for America .
Recently , she had the courage to state the obvious that her son signed up in the military to protect America not to die for Israel .
In a recent letter to “ Nightline , ” she wrote the following hard - hitting words :
Am I emotional ?
Yes , my first born was murdered .
Am I angry ?
Yes , he was killed for lies and for a PNAC Neo - Con agenda to benefit Israel .
My son joined the Army to protect America , not Israel .
Am I stupid ?
No , I know full - well that my son , my family , this nation , and this world were betrayed by George [ W. ]
Bush who was influenced by the neo-con PNAC agenda after 9/11 .
We were told that we were attacked on 9/11 because the terrorists hate our freedoms and democracy … not for the real reason , because the Arab - Muslims who attacked us hate our middle - eastern foreign policy .
That has n’t changed since America invaded and occupied Iraq … in fact it has gotten worse .
</>
Now , a gauntlet of personal attacks has been let out against her .
A recent article on David Horowitz ’s FrontPage and repeated by many pro-Israel zealots dares to compare her with that incorrigible American , me .
Here is a FrontPage reader ’s commentary published in the Lonestar Times .
… ( Sheehan ) voiced vaguely anti-Semitic rhetoric when she alleged that the Iraq War was all about protecting Israel , i.e. a Jewish conspiracy ( a similar opinion is frequently expressed by David Duke and his ilk ) . ” — From the Lonestar Times August , 13 , 2005
In truth , Cindy Sheehan is absolutely right .
Her son signed up in the military to defend America , not Israel , and to safeguard our own democracy , not the democracy of some foreign nation that neither wants nor needs it .
In advancing this war for Israel , government and media advocates obviously could n’t get Americans behind the war by saying it was a war for Israel .
They had to make up bogus reasons for the war , such as saying that Iraq was an imminent threat to America and that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
Now that these lies have been exposed , they have changed the rationale for the war to “ fighting for democracy ” and “ fighting against terrorism . ”
Here ’s a short list showing why Cindy Sheehan is right !
1 ) It was criminal for Cindy Sheehan ’s son to die for Israel rather than for the true interests of America .
From the beginning , this war was orchestrated from top to bottom by Jewish Neocons that saw the war as one for Israel ’s strategic objectives .
They ramped up the war through Jews such as Perle and Wolfowitz , the false intelligence through CIA analyst Stuart Cohen and by Israel ’s Mossad , and had a compliant Jewish - dominated media to cheer on the war .
The truth is the Iraq War has inflicted incredible damage on America and the American people .
It is war against America rather than in defense of America .
2 ) It was criminal to send her son to die for a lie .
There were no weapons of mass destruction , no nuclear program , no uranium from Niger , no links with Al Qaeda , no imminent threat to the American people .
Every reason the American people were given for going to war has turned out to be a lie .
3 ) It is criminal for her son to be forced to die for democracy in other ountries .
If Americans were sent to die for democracy or justice in all the countries of the world we deem unjust or undemocratic , then we must be ready to send millions of our sons and daughters to war all over the globe .
4 ) The lie that her son died for the good of the Iraqi People is false on its face .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraq men women and children have been killed , injured , made homeless and suffered from this war .
You do n’t save people by destroying their homes and hospitals , and throwing their country in chaos .
5 ) The Iraq war and her son ’s death did not defend American from hatred or terrorism .
In fact , the war is massively increasing hatred and terrorism .
For every one terrorist killed in Iraq , we are creating thousands more who hate and want to hurt America and Americans .
This is the surest way to lose the war on terror not win it .
6 ) Cindy Sheehan ’s son died for no true interest for the American people .
It has secured us no new or cheaper oil , it has cost a national treasure of hundreds of billions of dollars , it has alienated friends and allies , it has hurt American business around the world , it has separated and caused hardship upon millions of American military and National Guard families .
It has killed almost 2000 and maimed tens of thousands of loyal and brave Americans who do their duty in Iraq .
Again , this is war against every true interest of the America .
The only nation that benefits from it is Israel !
Cindy Sheehan has a lot to be angry about .
Her son was betrayed and his life lost by government officials who treasonably created and continue a war for Israel and the Jewish supremacist agenda rather than that of the United States .
We stand with Cindy Sheehan and the memory of her son which should spur all truly patriotic Americans to demand an end to this war for Israel , this war against America , the Iraq War .
It is not Iraq ’s borders that need protecting , it is the American border with Mexico !
Support our troops … bring them home !
Let them protect America and not die for Israel .
Sincerely ,
David Duke
Christian Coalition president - elect quits over lack of focus on poverty ORLANDO ( AP ) 
The president - elect of the Christian Coalition of America has declined the job , saying the organization would n't let him expand its agenda beyond opposing abortion and gay marriage .
The Rev. Joel Hunter , who was scheduled to take over the socially conservative group in January from Roberta Combs , said he had hoped to focus on issues such as poverty and the environment .
" These are issues that Jesus would want us to care about , " said Hunter , a senior pastor at Northland Church in Longwood , Fla .
Hunter announced his decision not to take the job during an organization board meeting Nov. 21 .
A statement issued by the group said Hunter left because of " differences in philosophy and vision . "
Hunter said he was not asked to leave .
" They pretty much said , ' These issues are fine , but they 're not our issues , that 's not our base , " ' Hunter said .
His resignation is the latest setback for the once - powerful group .
The Christian Coalition , founded in 1989 by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson , became one of the nation 's most powerful conservative groups during the 1990s , but it has faced complaints in recent years about its finances , leadership and plans to veer into non-traditional policy areas .
The group claims more than 2 million members .

This crazy photo from the Yomiuri Shimbun shows a diver swimming amongst a swarm of giant jellyfish .
These giant sea blobs , known as Echizen kurage ( Nomura 's jellyfish ) , inflict heavy damage on Japanese fisheries in the Sea of Japan each year .
This year 's invasion appears to be in full swing .
The number of jellyfish has risen dramatically off the coast of Maizuru in Kyoto prefecture since Typhoon No. 13 passed over the Sea of Japan in mid-September .
Thousands of the giant jellyfish , which can grow up to 2 meters ( 6 ft 7 in ) in diameter and weigh up to 200 kg ( 440 lb ) , become caught in fixed fishing nets each year .

Back at Speedera , in the Spring of 2003 , we won a contract to deliver the website and streaming files for a very popular TV show ( still bound by NDA , so I can't name it ) .
We had been delivering sites and video for networks and studios for years by that point , but in the Spring of 2003 , we noticed something we had never seen before .
For the years prior , when a TV show aired , we would see a perceptible increase in traffic to its website during the airing , but that traffic was never too significant .
In fact , visits to a particular show 's Internet site were often higher during the morning of the next workday when bored employees would close their office doors and surf to their favorite show sites .
That all changed in early 2003 .
With this particular show , when the show came on back East at 8EST , traffic to the site would spike .
But , even beyond that initial spike , these visitors stayed at the show 's website during the entire show !
Were they abandoning their television sets and running into the den to surf ?
To the contrary , they were feverishly clicking right there from the comfort of their couches while continuing to watch the show .
Sure enough , when the hour was up , traffic to the site steadily fell off over the next thirty minutes until reaching its lows .
So what was different about 2003 ?
Why had n't this happened before ?
Why was it that all of a sudden web surfers were hitting these TV show sites during the show itself ?
Our guess ?
Home WiFi networks .
That was a huge year for proliferation of residential WiFi .
With WiFi in the home , the computer moved out of the den and into the family room .
Now untethered , users , particularly kids who were used to multitasking throughout the rest of their lives , could now bring those laptops to the couch .
They had already been SMSing with each other while tubing out , so it seemed only natural they would break out the full browser experience at the same time .
These were just our speculative musings , and I never had any data to back it up .
So , it was with a chuckle that I read the notes from a colleague who just got back from the MipTV Conference in Cannes , France .
They noted that everyone in the content creation business is now talking about creating content for multi-platform / multi-screen ( TV , PC , mobile , iPod , etc ) and enabling simultaneous interactivity between them all .
My colleague mentioned that we should keep our eyes peeled for a new show on the BBC called the Wannabes in which the web will provide a realtime interactive experience that complements the broadcast view providing viewers with alternative perspectives and viewpoints on the big screen action .
Before , all the talk used to be about convergence .
Pundits predicted each of our devices would be merged into one for all of our communication and entertainment .
However , it looks more and more like what will really emerge is the concurrent use of many devices optimized for the time , place , network , activity , and the person using them all .
( . . . while I type this on my laptop and churn SMS messages on my Blackberry and watch a DVD on the TV . )
John Maeda created quite a stir with his montage of the Yahoo and Google homepages from 1996 to 2006 in simple is about staying simple :
Although Philipp Lenssen has posted on this topic before ( he calls it the portal plague ) , it 's still striking .
Altavista made the same mistake , and they did n't survive .
There 's an interesting anecdote about Google 's absolute focus on minimalism in Seth Godin 's book Purple Cow :
It turns out that the folks at Google are obsessed with the email they get criticizing the service .
They take it very seriously .
One person writes in every once and a while and he never signs his name .
According to Marissa Meyer at Google , " Every time he writes , the e-mail contains only a two - digit number .
It took us a while to figure out what he was doing .
He 's counting the number of words on the home page .
When the number goes up , he gets irritated , and e-mails us the new word count .
As crazy as it sounds , his emails are helpful , because they put an interesting discipline on the UI team not to introduce too many links .
It 's like a scale that tells you that you 've gained two pounds . "
And of course , 37signals is famous for their mantra of less as a competitive advantage :
Conventional wisdom says to beat your competitors you need to one - up them .
If they have 4 features , you need 5 .
Or 15 .
Or 25 .
If they 're spending X , you need to spend XX .
If they have 20 , you need 30 .
While this strategy may still work for some , it 's expensive , resource intensive , difficult , defensive , and not very satisfying .
And I do n't think it 's good for customers either .
It 's a very Cold War mentality -- always trying to one - up .
When everyone tries to one - up , we all end up with too much .
There 's already too much " more " -- what we need are simple solutions to simple , common problems , not huger solutions to huger problems .
What I 'd like to suggest is a different approach .
Instead of one - upping , try one - downing .
Instead of outdoing , try underdoing .
Do less than your competitors to beat them .
Usability guru Donald Norman thinks the comparison between Google and Yahoo is misleading , and offers the truth about Google 's so - called " simplicity " :
Is Google simple ?
No .
Google is deceptive .
It hides all the complexity by simply showing one search box on the main page .
The main difference , is that if you want to do anything else , the other search engines let you do it from their home pages , whereas Google makes you search through other , much more complex pages .
Why are n't many of these just linked together ?
Why is n't Google a unified application ?
Why are there so many odd , apparently free - standing services ?
I think this is a completely wrongheaded analysis , because I do n't want to do anything else .
All I want is to find what I 'm searching for .
Like Damien Katz , I believe features do n't matter :
These people do n't care about your flexible , brilliant architecture .
They do n't wish to tweak settings .
They do n't want to spend more than 10 consecutive seconds confused .
They just want simple , they want to get their task done and move on .
They do n't want to spend time learning anything because they know they 'll probably just forget it long before they 'll need to do it again anyway .
We should always be in pursuit of simplicity , in whatever form it takes .

Brad ,
It would be difficult for me to be any more miserable right now , I feel like the worst person ever .
First , let me start by saying that I am truly truly sorry , and I hate myself for hurting you .
Of all the people in the whole entire world , you were honestly the last person that I would ever want to wrong in any way .
There is no excuse at all for anything that happened , so I wo n't even try other than to say all of us had WAY too much to drink , and I did a stupid thing .
I can handle you being pissed at me , I absolutely deserve it , I can even handle the ugly words that were exchanged between us , what I can't handle is thinking that you see me as a different person .
It is weird , I feel like I just went through a horrible break up or something .
The world looked funny yesterday , I could n't crack a smile if you paid me , there are songs I can't listen to , and I just !
feel beyond crushed .
I do n't know if you meant everything you said to me , and I am hoping that you did n't .
I know that I was wrong on many levels , but I am also hoping that this is something that we can deal with .
I know it sounds totally crazy and stupid , but you have come to play such a significant role in my life , I can't imagine my days without you .
It is totally strange and weird to say that , and you could say that my behavior did n't reflect that , and you would be correct .
I hate feeling like you hate me , and I hate feeling like all of your friends think I am a terrible person , because I am not .
I know there is nothing I can say or do to take back what happened , but I just want you to know that fighting with you was just about the worst thing I could have ever imagined .
It was right up there with one of the ugliest nights of my life , and I would give anything in the world to rewind and fix it .
I am not sure if you will respond to this , part of me thinks that you wo n't .
If not today , then maybe some other time .
Also , thanks for getting my stuff together , although I think my sunglasses are still at your house , if you could keep your eyes peeled for them that would be great .
I can't even focus or work today , I can't eat , I seriously feel like it was an ugly break up , and I am hoping against hopes that it was not that and you are not done with me .
Please do n't cut me off , I really do n't think I can handle that .
I am so sorry .
Elizabeth Dear Elizabeth , Thank you for your concern .
I 'll be sure to file it away under " L " for " Long - winded diatribes from drunken wh0res I could n't care less about " .
You did a stupid thing huh ?
No ... doing long division and forgetting to carry the one is " a stupid thing " ;
Mixing in a red sock with a load of whites is " a stupid thing " ;
Bl0wing some guy in a bathroom for 45 minutes while I sit at the bar wondering if you 're taking so long because you ate too much bran that morning is n't as much a " Stupid thing " as it is grounds for permanent removal from my social calendar .
To be honest , I 'm not sure if it was more amusing that you went and degraded yourself in a public toilet not once but twice in a 2 hour span , or that you seemed to think that by saying " Well , I did n't F0 ck him " somehow gave you a clean slate .
So forgive me if I could n't care less if the world " looked funny " to you yesterday .
Since your world revolves around blow dryers , golden retrievers , Prada Bags and Jelly Beans , I 'm sure it must have been most unsettling to actually have to consider someone else 's feelings for 24 hours straight .
The good news for you is that my friends do n't think you 're a terrible person , they just think you 're the average run of the mill cuum - guzzling blond who commands about as much respect as your average child p0rn collector .
I could be wrong but , it 's pretty hard to respect some B &T chick who comes out to spend the night at my place even though she 's seeing someone else in New jersey and winds up tongue - bathing the ta1nt of anyone who decides 30 minutes of droning commentary on Colin Farrell 's new haircut is worth putting up with for a hand j0 b in the men 's room .
The good thing about being a guy is that when I eventually bump into the young lad who f1nger - blasted you on top of a towel dispenser last saturday , we 'll have a shot and laugh our heads off about the time it happened .
By the way , for the amount of time you claim to spend in spin class you really must be doing something wrong to sport the thunder thighs you do .
Watching you parade around my bedroom in a thong was a little like watching sea lions mate .
Thought you might like to know .
PS .
I BCC'd about 100 people on this email .
Talk to you never , Brad
After spending the night in Branson we tried our luck hitchin’ on the highway again .
Getting rides was slow going so we decided to break out our “ A game ” with some freestyle hitchin’ .
Here ’s a video titled “ The hitchhikers guide to the hitchhiking ” outlining the different moves we use to get our rides .
The barrel roll attracted the attention of Joey who came back to see what was going on .
He took us across the Arkansas state line and dropped us on the side of the highway 20 miles down the road .
Here we enjoyed sights such as a full size RV towing a full size Airstream trailer .
You know , sometimes the RV just ain't big enough .
After an hour of standing in our third location of the day , an Acura hatchback pulled over .
As we walked up to the car there did n’t appear to be much room available to fit us and our bags .
We were greeted by a friendly man speaking quickly in Spanish .
Not fully understanding what was going on , we jumped in the back seat .
Jose , Julio and Bryan did n’t speak any English , ya that ’s right his name is Bryan , but were happy enough to cram all five of us in the four seater car .
With our limited Spanish we managed to explain what we are doing , why we are wearing white suits and the directions to Little Rock .
The ride got even better when they told us how they love Bon Jovi and put in their CD .
It turns out it was actually Guns and Roses , but we did n’t have the heart to tell them .
Our new Latin American friends are originally from Nicaragua but are working in the Rogers area of northwest Arkansas .
It was difficult to communicate with them , but it was clear they love their new home in America , happy to be living the American dream .
The American dream for today was enjoying their day off , driving through the Ozark Mountains , celebrating the St. Louis Cardinals ’ winning the world series .
They took us south throught the Ozark Mountains for a couple hours to the town of Conway , then headed back home .
A biologically rich coral island chain in the Pacific Ocean northwest of Hawaii , which President Bush designated as a marine national monument , is under assault from floating garbage ranging from plastic bottlecaps to baby diapers .
Hailed by environmentalists as one of the president 's most enduring contributions to the environment , the Montana - sized monument includes uninhabited islands home to some 7,000 marine species , at least a quarter of which are found nowhere else on earth .
But the new national monument also resides on the edge what marine scientists call the great " eastern garbage patch " : a section of slowly rotating Pacific Ocean currents – or gyre – double the size of Texas that acts as a giant garbage collector .
Sitting between Hawaii and northern California , the patch 's sluggish currents wash onto the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument .
That 1,200 - mile - long island chain north of Kauai acts as the teeth of a giant comb , straining onto its otherwise pristine beaches and coral reefs floating trash , such as syringes , bags , six - pack rings , and tons of fishing nets and other gear .
Concern about the problem has risen to such a level that Congress has acted on it .
On Sept. 27 the House passed a bill that would give a lift to struggling ad - hoc efforts to clear debris from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands .
Their move follows the Senate 's approval of the legislation last year .
Observers are optimistic that the bill will be finalized , and Mr. Bush will sign it into law after the November election .
It would not be a moment too soon , experts say .
About 3 million tons of the trash floating in the garbage patch is plastic , estimates Charles Moore , founder of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation in Long Beach , Ca. , who has traversed the gyre on research expeditions .
Samples he collected in a recent study showed that there were more tiny bits of plastic by weight than there were plankton per cubic meter of sea water .
" It 's a toilet that never flushes , but just keeps accumulating , " he says of the patch .
" If you 're an organism in this area you have six times as much chance of bumping into something plastic as you do something natural . "
Globally , millions of tons of trash enter the ocean each year .
Between 60 and 80 percent of it is land - based , washing into streams and rivers and finally the ocean from landfills , storm water discharges , litter , and sewage overflows .
The rest is from ocean - based operations , including fishing gear , junk from oil and offshore mineral exploration , illegal offshore dumping , and shipping containers washed overboard .
A container of thousands of plastic yellow toy ducks bound from China to the US was lost in the Pacific Ocean in 1992 , but made news in 2003 when the ducks began washing up in Europe .
Examples of trash slopping onto US beaches have included Nike running shoes , Lego building blocks , umbrella handles , and hockey gloves , experts say .
Old " ghost " fishing nets adrift in the sea and smaller plastic objects are special hazards for marine birds and mammals because birds tend to gobble colored plastic until they die .
These hazards can have lasting effects on the monument since many species call the region home .
" Marine debris has a tremendous impact on the monument because of what 's there in terms of wildlife , " says Seba Sheavly , coordinator of the National Marine Debris Monitoring Program , a program funded by the Environmental Protection Agency .
" We have a critical situation for Hawaiian monk seals that are horribly depressed in number .
In the very place where the young are learning to fish and play , it 's where these old nets get caught . "
Animals are not all that get snared .
In August 2005 , a Russian minisubmarine became snagged in an old fishing net 625 feet below the Pacific Ocean surface before being rescued .
Cargo ships with propellers bound up in miles of old net pull into Hawaii for repairs , says Christine Woolaway , the Kalaeloa , Hawaii - based coordinator for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands cleanup .
But it was the heart - wrenching pictures of animals snarled in plastic packaging and old fishing lines that first grabbed public attention in the 1970s .
As of this past summer at least 130 countries including the US had ratified international agreements .
Hundreds of thousands volunteer for regular worldwide beach cleanups sponsored by the Ocean Conservancy , an environmental group that tracks marine debris .
Yet political action , public attention , and cleanup funding have waned in the past decade , overshadowed by issues such as climate change and declining global fisheries .
But hurricane Katrina , which pushed tons of debris into the Gulf of Mexico , and the new national monument , have helped give the issue some attention .
A debris- marine bill sponsored by Sens. Daniel Inouye ( D ) of Hawaii and Ted Stevens ( R ) of Alaska , was approved by the Senate last year .
Then , last month , the House unanimously approved the legislation , which sends $ 15 million and a mandate to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , US Coast Guard , and other agencies to rev up their garbage compactors .
It also provides modest grant funds for research , sets up a trash - tracking database , and mandates that federal agencies educate the public .
" We need some help , that 's for sure , because there 's more debris out there on those islands than any one agency can handle , " says Ms. Woolaway .
Since 1995 , at least 680 tons have been removed in the cleanup along the islands – much of it in old nets .
With little landfill space in Hawaii , an automotive salvage company shreds the nets with the residue burned to make electricity in an electric company boiler .
But even after a thorough cleanup , the next year tons more debris wash ashore from the eastern garbage patch .
" Every single piece of trash on the beach or in the water has a person 's face behind it – it's that simple , " Ms. Sheavly says .
" The cigarette lighters , shampoo bottles – the animals on the island did n't do that .
It comes from improper waste management practices .
This is a fixable problem , and the answer is simple :
We 've got to have more awareness and give people an opportunity to change their behavior . "
Washington Post - November 13 , 2005 The Right Way in Iraq By John Edwards
I was wrong .
Almost three years ago we went into Iraq to remove what we were told – and what many of us believed and argued — was a threat to America .
But in fact we now know that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction when our forces invaded Iraq in 2003 .
The intelligence was deeply flawed and , in some cases , manipulated to fit a political agenda .
It was a mistake to vote for this war in 2002 .
I take responsibility for that mistake .
It has been hard to say these words because those who did n’t make a mistake — the men and women of our armed forces and their families — have performed heroically and paid a dear price .
The world desperately needs moral leadership from America , and the foundation for moral leadership is telling the truth .
While we ca n’t change the past , we need to accept responsibility , because a key part of restoring America ’s moral leadership is acknowledging when we ’ve made mistakes or been proven wrong — and showing that we have the creativity and guts to make it right .
The argument for going to war with Iraq was based on intelligence that we now know was inaccurate .
The information the American people were hearing from the president — and that I was being given by our intelligence community — was n’t the whole story .
Had I known this at the time , I never would have voted for this war .
George Bush wo n’t accept responsibility for his mistakes .
Along with Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld , he has made horrible mistakes at almost every step : failed diplomacy ; not going in with enough troops ; not giving our forces the equipment they need ; not having a plan for peace .
Because of these failures , Iraq is a mess and has become a far greater threat than it ever was .
It is now a haven for terrorists , and our presence there is draining the goodwill our country once enjoyed , diminishing our global standing .
It has made fighting the global war against terrorist organizations more difficult , not less .
The urgent question is n’t how we got here but what we do now .
We have to give our troops a way to end their mission honorably .
That means leaving behind a success , not a failure .
What is success ?
I do n’t think it is Iraq as a Jeffersonian democracy .
I think it is an Iraq that is relatively stable , largely self - sufficient , comparatively open and free , and in control of its own destiny .
A plan for success needs to focus on three interlocking objectives : reducing the American presence , building Iraq ’s capacity and getting other countries to meet their responsibilities to help .
First , we need to remove the image of an imperialist America from the landscape of Iraq .
American contractors who have taken unfair advantage of the turmoil in Iraq need to leave Iraq .
If that means Halliburton subsidiary KBR , then KBR should go .
Such departures , and the return of the work to Iraqi businesses , would be a real statement about our hopes for the new nation .
We also need to show Iraq and the world that we will not stay there forever .
We ’ve reached the point where the large number of our troops in Iraq hurts , not helps , our goals .
Therefore , early next year , after the Iraqi elections , when a new government has been created , we should begin redeployment of a significant number of troops out of Iraq .
This should be the beginning of a gradual process to reduce our presence and change the shape of our military ’s deployment in Iraq .
Most of these troops should come from National Guard or Reserve forces .
That will still leave us with enough military capability , combined with better - trained Iraqis , to fight terrorists and continue to help the Iraqis develop a stable country .
Second , this redeployment should work in concert with a more effective training program for Iraqi forces .
We should implement a clear plan for training and hard deadlines for certain benchmarks to be met .
To increase incentives , we should implement a schedule showing that , as we certify Iraqi troops as trained and equipped , a proportional number of U.S. troops will be withdrawn .
Third , we must launch a serious diplomatic process that brings the world into this effort .
We should bring Iraq ’s neighbors and our key European allies into a diplomatic process to get Iraq on its feet .
The president needs to create a unified international front .
Too many mistakes have already been made for this to be easy .
Yet we must take these steps to succeed .
The American people , the Iraqi people and — most important — our troops who have died or been injured there , and those who are fighting there today , deserve nothing less .
America ’s leaders — all of us — need to accept the responsibility we each carry for how we got to this place .
More than 2,000 Americans have lost their lives in this war , and more than 150,000 are fighting there today .
They and their families deserve honesty from our country ’s leaders .
And they also deserve a clear plan for a way out .

General Dannatt took on his role in August
UK Army Chief speaks on Iraq
Chief of the General Staff Sir Richard Dannatt told the Daily Mail that the military campaign fought in 2003 had " effectively kicked the door in " .
He also said that initial planning for the post - war period had been poor .
There are currently more than 7,000 British soldiers in Iraq , based largely in Basra in the south of the country .
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said Britain had " a clear strategy " and worked with international partners " in support of the democratically elected government of Iraq , under a clear UN mandate . "
BBC political editor Nick Robinson described Sir Richard 's remarks as " quite extraordinary " .
He said the new head of the British army 's comments " directly contradicted so much of what the government had said " .
I do n't say that the difficulties we are experiencing round the world are caused by our presence in Iraq but undoubtedly our presence in Iraq exacerbates them
Sir Richard Dannatt
Send us your comments Reaction to general 's call Profile : Sir Richard Dannatt
Sir Richard might be issuing a " very public warning " to the next prime minister , our correspondent added .
In his interview , Sir Richard added that any initial tolerance " has largely turned to intolerance .
That is a fact " .
Sir Richard , who took on his role in August , also said planning for what happened after the initial successful war military offensive was " poor , probably based more on optimism than sound planning " .
' Not invited in '
He said : " I do n't say that the difficulties we are experiencing round the world are caused by our presence in Iraq but undoubtedly our presence in Iraq exacerbates them . "
Most of the British forces in Iraq are based in Basra
Sir Richard told the newspaper : " We are in a Muslim country and Muslims ' views of foreigners in their country are quite clear .
" As a foreigner , you can be welcomed by being invited in a country , but we were n't invited certainly by those in Iraq at the time . "
He added : " Whatever consent we may have had in the first place , may have turned to tolerance and has largely turned to intolerance . "
Downing Street issued a short statement in response to the general 's comments .
It said : " It 's important that people remember that we are in Iraq at the express wish of the democratically elected Iraqi government , to support them under the mandate of a UN resolution . "
However , Sir Richard has received praise for coming forward .
Major General Patrick Cordingly said : " I think it is a very brave thing for him to say .
I do agree .
I think there comes a time when you have got to let Iraq get on and look after its own security . "
Rose Gentle , whose soldier son was killed in Iraq , said : " I 'm just really delighted that Sir Richard Dannatt has stood up and spoken out .
He is protecting our boys .
" We have been saying for two years this needed to happen and I think military families have done a good bit . "
The image of Earth in space like a blue marble highlighted the planets fragility and the beauty of Earth .
Earth , our home , is the third planet from the sun .
It 's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen , oceans of water on its surface and , of course , life .
Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system .
It 's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets , Mercury , Mars and Venus .
Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles ( 13,000 kilometers ) and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball .
But , it 's not perfectly round .
Earth is really an " oblate spheroid , " because its spin causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator .
Water covers roughly 71 percent of Earth 's surface , and most of that is in the oceans .
About a fifth of Earth 's atmosphere consists of oxygen , produced by plants .
While scientists have been studying our planet for centuries , much has been learned in recent decades by studying pictures of Earth from space .
Earth 's orbit
While Earth orbits the sun , the planet is simultaneously spinning on an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole .
It takes Earth 23.934 hours to complete a rotation on its axis and 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the sun .
Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the ecliptic plane , an imaginary surface through the planet 's orbit around the sun .
This means the Northern and Southern hemispheres will sometimes point toward or away from the sun depending on the time of year , and this changes the amount of light the hemispheres receive , resulting in the seasons .
Earth 's orbit is not a perfect circle , but rather an oval - shaped ellipse , similar to the orbits of all the other planets .
Our planet is a bit closer to the sun in early January and farther away in July , although this variation has a much smaller effect than the heating and cooling caused by the tilt of Earth 's axis .
Earth happens to lie within the so - called " Goldilocks zone " around the sun , where temperatures are just right to maintain liquid water on our planet 's surface .
Statistics about Earth 's orbit , according to NASA :
Average distance from the sun : 92,956,050 miles ( 149,598,262 km )
Perihelion ( closest approach to the sun ) : 91,402,640 miles ( 147,098,291 km )
Aphelion ( farthest distance from the sun ) : 94,509,460 miles ( 152,098,233 km )
Length of solar day ( single rotation on its axis ) : 23.934 hours
Length of year ( single revolution around the sun ) : 365.26 days
Equatorial inclination to orbit : 23.4393 degrees
Earth 's formation and evolution
Scientists think Earth was formed at roughly the same time as the sun and other planets some 4.6 billion years ago , when the solar system coalesced from a giant , rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula .
As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity , it spun faster and flattened into a disk .
Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun .
Other particles within the disk collided and stuck together to form ever - larger bodies , including Earth .
Scientists think Earth started off as a waterless mass of rock .
" It was thought that because of these asteroids and comets flying around colliding with Earth , conditions on early Earth may have been hellish , " Simone Marchi , a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado , previously told Space.com .
But in recent years , new analyses of minerals trapped within ancient microscopic crystals suggests that there was liquid water already present on Earth during its first 500 million years , Marchi said .
Radioactive materials in the rock and increasing pressure deep within the Earth generated enough heat to melt the planet 's interior , causing some chemicals to rise to the surface and form water , while others became the gases of the atmosphere .
Recent evidence suggests that Earth 's crust and oceans may have formed within about 200 million years after the planet took shape .
Internal structure
Earth 's core is about 4,400 miles ( 7,100 km ) wide , slightly larger than half the Earth 's diameter and about the same size as Mars ' diameter .
The outermost 1,400 miles ( 2,250 km ) of the core are liquid , while the inner core is solid ; it 's about four - fifths as big as Earth 's moon , at some 1,600 miles ( 2,600 km ) in diameter .
The core is responsible for the planet 's magnetic field , which helps to deflect harmful charged particles shot from the sun .
Above the core is Earth 's mantle , which is about 1,800 miles ( 2,900 km ) thick .
The mantle is not completely stiff but can flow slowly .
Earth 's crust floats on the mantle much as a piece of wood floats on water .
The slow motion of rock in the mantle shuffles continents around and causes earthquakes , volcanoes and the formation of mountain ranges .
Above the mantle , Earth has two kinds of crust .
The dry land of the continents consists mostly of granite and other light silicate minerals , while the ocean floors are made up mostly of a dark , dense volcanic rock called basalt .
Continental crust averages some 25 miles ( 40 km ) thick , although it can be thinner or thicker in some areas .
Oceanic crust is usually only about 5 miles ( 8 km ) thick .
Water fills in low areas of the basalt crust to form the world 's oceans .
Earth gets warmer toward its core .
At the bottom of the continental crust , temperatures reach about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1,000 degrees Celsius ) , increasing about 3 degrees F per mile ( 1 degree C per km ) below the crust .
Geologists think the temperature of Earth 's outer core is about 6,700 to 7,800 degrees F ( 3,700 to 4,300 degrees C ) and that the inner core may reach 12,600 degrees F ( 7,000 degrees C ) — hotter than the surface of the sun .
Magnetic field
Earth 's magnetic field is generated by currents flowing in Earth 's outer core .
The magnetic poles are always on the move , with the magnetic North Pole accelerating its northward motion to 24 miles ( 40 km ) annually since tracking began in the 1830s .
It will likely exit North America and reach Siberia in a matter of decades .
Earth 's magnetic field is changing in other ways , too .
Globally , the magnetic field has weakened 10 percent since the 19th century , according to NASA .
These changes are mild compared to what Earth 's magnetic field has done in the past .
A few times every million years or so , the field completely flips , with the North and the South poles swapping places .
The magnetic field can take anywhere from 100 to 3,000 years to complete the flip .
The strength of Earth 's magnetic field decreased by about 90 percent when a field reversal occurred in ancient past , according to Andrew Roberts , a professor at the Australian National University .
The drop makes the planet more vulnerable to solar storms and radiation , which can could significantly damage satellites and communication and electrical infrastructure .
" Hopefully , such an event is a long way in the future and we can develop future technologies to avoid huge damage , " Roberts said in a statement .
When charged particles from the sun get trapped in Earth 's magnetic field , they smash into air molecules above the magnetic poles , causing them to glow .
This phenomenon is known as the aurorae , the northern and southern lights .
Earth 's atmosphere
Earth 's atmosphere is roughly 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen , with trace amounts of water , argon , carbon dioxide and other gases .
Nowhere else in the solar system is there an atmosphere loaded with free oxygen , which is vital to one of the other unique features of Earth : life .
Air surrounds Earth and becomes thinner farther from the surface .
Roughly 100 miles ( 160 km ) above Earth , the air is so thin that satellites can zip through the atmosphere with little resistance .
Still , traces of atmosphere can be found as high as 370 miles ( 600 km ) above the planet 's surface .
The lowest layer of the atmosphere is known as the troposphere , which is constantly in motion and why we have weather .
Sunlight heats the planet 's surface , causing warm air to rise into the troposphere .
This air expands and cools as air pressure decreases , and because this cool air is denser than its surroundings , it then sinks and gets warmed by the Earth again .
Above the troposphere , some 30 miles ( 48 km ) above the Earth 's surface , is the stratosphere .
The still air of the stratosphere contains the ozone layer , which was created when ultraviolet light caused trios of oxygen atoms to bind together into ozone molecules .
Ozone prevents most of the sun 's harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching Earth 's surface , where it can damage and mutate life .
Water vapor , carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun , warming Earth .
Without this so - called " greenhouse effect , " Earth would probably be too cold for life to exist , although a runaway greenhouse effect led to the hellish conditions now seen on Venus .
Earth - orbiting satellites have shown that the upper atmosphere actually expands during the day and contracts at night due to heating and cooling .
Chemical composition
Oxygen is the most abundant element in rocks in Earth 's crust , composing roughly 47 percent of the weight of all rock .
The second most abundant element is silicon , at 27 percent , followed by aluminum , at 8 percent ; iron , at 5 percent ; calcium , at 4 percent ; and sodium , potassium and magnesium , at about 2 percent each .
Earth 's core consists mostly of iron and nickel and potentially smaller amounts of lighter elements , such as sulfur and oxygen .
The mantle is made of iron and magnesium - rich silicate rocks .
( The combination of silicon and oxygen is known as silica , and minerals that contain silica are known as silicate minerals . )
Earth 's moon
Earth 's moon is 2,159 miles ( 3,474 km ) wide , about one - fourth of Earth 's diameter .
Our planet has one moon , while Mercury and Venus have none and all the other planets in our solar system have two or more .
The leading explanation for how Earth 's moon formed is that a giant impact knocked the raw ingredients for the moon off the primitive , molten Earth and into orbit .
Scientists have suggested that the object that hit the planet had roughly 10 percent the mass of Earth , about the size of Mars .
Life on Earth
Earth is the only planet in the universe known to possess life .
The planet boasts several million species of life , living in habitats ranging from the bottom of the deepest ocean to a few miles into the atmosphere .
And scientists think far more species remain to be discovered .
Researchers suspect that other candidates for hosting life in our solar system — such as Saturn 's moon Titan or Jupiter 's moon Europa — could house primitive living creatures .
Scientists have yet to precisely nail down exactly how our primitive ancestors first showed up on Earth .
One solution suggests that life first evolved on the nearby planet Mars , once a habitable planet , then traveled to Earth on meteorites hurled from the Red Planet by impacts from other space rocks .
" It 's lucky that we ended up here , nevertheless , as certainly Earth has been the better of the two planets for sustaining life , " biochemist Steven Benner , of the Westheimer Institute for Science and Technology in Florida , told Space.com .
" If our hypothetical Martian ancestors had remained on Mars , there might not have been a story to tell . "

The award - winning Russian journalist and author Anna Politkovskaya , a fearless reporter on the Chechen wars and critic of the Putin administration , was murdered in Moscow last weekend .
In a previously unpublished article , she explains why , despite death threats , she had to continue writing
I am a pariah .
That is the main result of my journalism throughout the years of the second Chechen war , and of publishing abroad a number of books about life in Russia and the Chechen war .
In Moscow I am not invited to press conferences or gatherings that officials of the Kremlin administration might attend , in case the organisers are suspected of harbouring sympathies towards me .
Despite this , all the top officials talk to me , at my request , when I am writing articles or conducting investigations - but only in secret , where they can't be observed , in the open air , in squares , in secret houses that we approach by different routes , like spies .
The officials like talking to me .
They are happy to give me information .
They consult me and tell me what is going on at the top .
But only in secret .
You do n't get used to this , but you learn to live with it .
It is exactly the way I have had to work throughout the second war in Chechnya .
First I was hiding from the Russian federal troops , but always able to make contact clandestinely with individuals through trusted intermediaries , so that my informants would not be denounced to the top generals .
When Putin 's plan of Chechenisation succeeded ( setting " good " Chechens loyal to the Kremlin to killing " bad " Chechens who opposed it ) , the same subterfuge extended to talking to " good " Chechen officials , whom of course I had known for a long time , and many of whom , before they were " good " officials , had sheltered me in their homes in the most trying months of the war .
Now we can meet only in secret because I am a pariah , an enemy .
Indeed , an incorrigible enemy not amenable to re-education .
I 'm not joking .
Some time ago Vladislav Surkov , deputy head of the presidential administration , explained that there were people who were enemies but whom you could talk sense into , and there were incorrigible enemies into whom you could n't and who simply needed to be " cleansed " from the political arena .
So they are trying to cleanse it of me and others like me .
On 5 August 2006 , I was standing in the middle of a crowd of women in the little central square of Kurchaloy , a dusty village in Chechnya .
I was wearing a headscarf folded and tied in the manner favoured by many women of my age in Chechnya , not covering the head completely , but not leaving it uncovered either .
This was essential if I was not to be identified , in which case nobody could say what might happen .
To one side of the crowd a man 's tracksuit trousers were draped over the gas pipeline that runs the length of Kurchaloy .
They were caked with blood .
His severed head had been taken away by then and I did n't see it .
During the night of 27 - 28 July , two Chechen fighters had been ambushed on the outskirts of Kurchaloy by units loyal to the pro-Kremlin Ramzan Kadyrov .
One , Adam Badaev , was captured and the other , Hoj - Ahmed Dushaev , a native of Kurchaloy , was killed .
Towards dawn , not far short of 20 Zhiguli cars , full of armed people , drove into the centre of the village and up to the district police station .
They had Dushaev 's head with them .
Two of the men suspended it in the centre of the village from the pipeline , and beneath it they hung the bloodstained trousers I was now seeing .
The armed men spent the next two hours photographing the head with their mobile phones .
The head was left there for 24 hours , after which militiamen removed it but left the trousers where they were .
Agents of the procurator - general 's office began investigating the scene of the fighting , and local people heard one of the officers ask a subordinate : " Have they finished sewing the head back on yet ? "
The body of Dushaev , with its head now sewn back in place , was brought to the scene of the ambush and the procurator - general 's office began examining the scene of the incident in accordance with normal investigative procedures .
I wrote about this in my newspaper , refraining from comment beyond dotting a few 'i 's in respect of what had happened .
I reached Chechnya at exactly the same time as the issue of the newspaper with the article .
The women in the crowd tried to conceal me because they were sure the Kadyrov people would shoot me on the spot if they knew I was there .
They reminded me that Kadyrov has publicly vowed to murder me .
He actually said during a meeting of his government that he had had enough , and that Politkovskaya was a condemned woman .
I was told about it by members of the government .
What for ?
For not writing the way Kadyrov wanted ?
" Anybody who is not one of us is an enemy . "
Surkov said so , and Surkov is Ramzan Kadyrov 's main supporter in Putin 's entourage .
" Ramzan told me , ' She is so stupid she does n't know the value of money .
I offered her money but she did n't take it , ' " an old acquaintance , a senior officer in militia special forces , told me that same day .
I met him secretly .
He is " one of us " , unlike me , and would face difficulties if we were caught conferring .
When it was time for me to leave it was already evening , and he urged me to stay in this secure location .
He was afraid I would be killed .
" You must n't go out , " he told me .
" Ramzan is very angry with you . "
I decided to leave nevertheless .
Someone else was waiting for me in Grozny and we needed to talk through the night , also in secret .
He offered to have me taken there in a militia car , but that struck me as even more risky .
I would be a target for the fighters .
" Do they at least have guns in the house you are going to ? " he continued anxiously .
Throughout the war I have been caught in the middle .
When some are threatening to kill you , you are protected by their enemies , but tomorrow the threat will come from somebody else .
Why am I going on at such length about this ?
Only in order to explain that people in Chechnya are afraid for me , and I find that very touching .
They fear for me more than I fear for myself , and that is how I survive .
Why has Ramzan vowed to kill me ?
I once interviewed him and printed the interview just as he gave it , complete with all his characteristic moronic stupidity , ignorance , and satanic inclinations .
Ramzan was sure I would completely rewrite the interview , and present him as intelligent and honourable .
That is , after all , how the majority of journalists behave now , those who are " on our side " .
Is that enough to make someone vow to kill you ?
The answer is as simple as the morality encouraged personally by Putin .
" We are merciless to enemies of the Reich . "
" Who is not with us is against us . "
" Those who are against us must be destroyed . "
" Why have you got such a bee in your bonnet about this severed head ? "
VasiliyPanchenkov asks me back in Moscow .
He is director of the press office for the Interior Ministry troops , but a decent man .
" Have you nothing better to worry about ? " I am asking him to comment on the events in Kurchaloy for our newspaper .
" Just forget it .
Pretend it never happened .
I 'm asking you for your own good ! "
But how can I forget it , when it did happen ?
I loathe the Kremlin 's line , elaborated by Surkov , dividing people into those who are " on our side " , " not on our side " , or even " on the other side " .
If a journalist is " on our side " , he or she will get awards , respect , perhaps be invited to become a deputy in the Duma .
If a journalist is " not on our side " , however , he or she will be deemed a supporter of the European democracies , of European values , and automatically become a pariah .
That is the fate of all who oppose our " sovereign democracy " , our " traditional Russian democracy " .
( What on earth that is supposed to be , nobody knows ; but they swear allegiance to it nevertheless : " We are for sovereign democracy ! " )
I am not really a political animal .
I have never joined any party and would consider it a mistake for a journalist , in Russia at least , to do so .
I have never felt the urge to stand for the Duma , although there were years when I was invited to .
So what is the crime that has earned me this label of not being " one of us " ?
I have merely reported what I have witnessed , no more than that .
I have written and , less frequently , I have spoken .
I am even reluctant to comment , because it reminds me too much of the imposed opinions of my Soviet childhood and youth .
It seems to me our readers are capable of interpreting what they read for themselves .
That is why my principal genre is reportage , sometimes , admittedly , with my own interjections .
I am not an investigating magistrate , but somebody who describes the life around us for those who cannot see it for themselves , because what is shown on television and written about in the overwhelming majority of newspapers is emasculated and doused with ideology .
People know very little about life in other parts of their own country , and sometimes even in their own region .
The Kremlin responds by trying to block my access to information , its ideologists supposing that this is the best way to make my writing ineffectual .
It is impossible , however , to stop someone fanatically dedicated to this profession of reporting the world around us .
My life can be difficult , more often humiliating .
I am not , after all , so young at 47 to keep encountering rejection and having my own pariah status rubbed in my face , but I can live with it .
I will not go into the other joys of the path I have chosen , the poisoning , the arrests , the threats in letters and over the internet , the telephoned death threats , the weekly summonses to the procurator - general 's office to sign statements about practically every article I write ( the first question being " How and where did you obtain this information ? " ) .
Of course I do n't like the constant derisive articles about me which appear in other newspapers and on websites that have long presented me as the madwoman of Moscow .
I find it disgusting to live this way ; I would like a bit more understanding .
The main thing , however , is to get on with my job , to describe the life I see , to receive visitors every day in our editorial office who have nowhere else to bring their troubles , because the Kremlin finds their stories off - message , so that the only place they can be aired is in our newspaper , Novaya Gazeta .

Aluminum is the most abundant metal element in the earth 's crust , but it is always found in a compound rather than an easily - refined ore .
Alum is one such compound .
Scientists tried to tease the metal out of alum , but the process was costly until Charles Martin Hall patented an inexpensive method to produce aluminum in 1889 .
History of Aluminum Production
Hans Christian Oersted , a Danish chemist , was the first to produce tiny amounts of aluminum in 1825 , German chemist Friedrich Wöhler developed a method that produced enough to study the metal 's basic properties in 1845 .
French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte - Claire Deville finally developed a process that allowed commercial production of aluminum .
However , the resulting metal still sold for $ 40 per kilogram in 1859 .
Pure aluminum was so rare at that time it was considered a precious metal .
Charles Martin Hall Discovers the Secret of Cheap Aluminum Production
On April 2 , 1889 , Charles Martin Hall patented an inexpensive method for the production of aluminum , which brought the metal into wide commercial use .
Charles Martin Hall had just graduated from Oberlin College ( located in Oberlin , Ohio ) in 1885 with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry when he invented his method of manufacturing pure aluminum .
Charles Martin
Hall 's method of processing the metal ore was to pass an electric current through a non-metallic conductor ( molten sodium fluoride compound was used ) to separate the very conductive aluminum .
In 1889 , Charles Martin Hull was awarded U.S. patent number 400,666 for his process .
His patent conflicted with that of Paul L.T. Heroult who arrived at the same process independently at practically the same time .
Hall had enough evidence of the date of his discovery that the United States patent was award to him rather than Heroult .
In 1888 , together with financier Alfred E. Hunt , Charles Martin Hall founded the Pittsburgh Reduction Company now known as the Aluminum Company of America ( ALCOA ) .
By 1914 , Charles Martin Hall had brought the cost of aluminum down to 18 cents a pound , and it was no longer considered a precious metal .
His discovery made him a wealthy man .
Hall obtained several more patents to improve the production of aluminum .
He received the Perkin Medal in 1911 for outstanding achievement in applied chemistry .
He was on the Board of Trustees for Oberlin College and left them $ 10 million for their endowment when he died in 1914 .
Aluminum from Bauxite Ore
One other inventor needs to be noted , Karl Joseph Bayer , an Austrian chemist , developed a new process in 1888 that could cheaply obtain aluminum oxide from bauxite .
Bauxite is an ore that contains a large amount of aluminum hydroxide ( Al2O3·3H2O ) , along with other compounds .
The Hall - Héroult and Bayer methods are still used today to produce nearly all of the world 's aluminum .
Aluminum Foil
Metal foil has been around for centuries .
Foil is solid metal that has been reduced to leaf - like thinness by beating or rolling .
The first mass - produced and widely used foil was made from tin .
Tin was later replaced by aluminum in 1910 , when the first aluminum foil rolling plant “ Dr. Lauber , Neher & Cie. , Emmishofen . ” was opened in Kreuzlingen , Switzerland .
The plant , owned by J.G. Neher & Sons ( aluminum manufacturers ) started in 1886 in Schaffhausen , Switzerland , at the foot of the Rhine Falls - capturing the falls ’ energy to produce aluminum .
Neher 's sons together with Dr. Lauber discovered the endless rolling process and the use of aluminum foil as a protective barrier .
From there began the wide use of aluminum foil in the packaging of chocolate bars and tobacco products .
Processes evolved to include the use of print , color , lacquer , laminate and the embossing of the aluminum .

東京都大田区で開催されているPerl技術者向けカンファレンス「
YAPC :: Asia 2006 Tokyo」 で2006年3月29日，日本最大のソーシャル・ネットワーキング・サイト（SNS）である「mixi」を運営するミクシィのBatara Kesuma（バタラ・ケスマ）取締役最高技術責任者（CTO）が，増え続ける膨大なトラフィックにどのように対処してきたのかについて講演した。カギとなるのは「データベース分割」である。
mixiのシステムはもとも とBatara氏が1人で作り上げたものだ。2003年当時，米国でFriendsterなどのSNSがはやっており，同氏が会社（現在のミクシィ，当時はイー・マーキュリー）にSNSを作りたいと提案したところ認められたという。同氏が開発を始めたのは2003年12月。3カ月でコーディングし，2004年2月にサービスを開始した。
mixiがサービスを開始すると，すごい勢いでユーザーが増えていった。2カ月後にはユーザー1万人，1日60万ページ・ビューを達成した。「思ったよりペースが速かった」（Batara氏）という。ユーザーは最初の1年間で21万人，次の1年間で200万人以上にふくれあがった。現在は300万人以上になり，1日に約1万5000人のペースで新しいユーザーが増えている。しかも，70％がアクティブ・ユーザー（72時間以内にアクセスするユーザー）であり，ユーザーは1週間に平均3時間20分をmixiに費やしている。日記のレコードは1億件以上あり，1日に50万件以上の新しい日記レコードが増え続けている。これは，秒間約6レコードのペースだ。これに加え，コメントの数は日記レコード数のおよそ4倍におよぶ。
こうした膨大なアクセスを処理するには，スケーラビリティが大きな問題になる。mixiのシステムはオープンソースのソフトウエアが支えている。Linux 2.6 ，Apache 2.0，MySQL
4.0/4.1/5.0，そしてPerl 5.8。いわゆるLAMPである。このうち，Webサーバーはサーバーを増やすことで水平にスケールできるのであまり問題にならないという。「問題は，MySQLがスケールしないこと」（Batara氏）である。
MySQLのスケーラビリティを確保する手段としてまず考えられるのが，レプリケーションである。データの書き込みを行うデータベースと読み出しを行うデータベースを分け，書き込みを行うデータベースから読み出しを行うデータベースにデータを複製する。ただ，レプリケーションは，データの書き込みが多いケースではあまり効果がない。そしてmixiはまさにそのケースに当てはまるという。mixiの日記サービスでは読み出しが85％に対し書き込みが15％，メッセージ・サービスでは読み出しが75％に対し書き込みが25％と，検索系サービスなどに比べると書き込みの割合が高い。
そこで登場するのが，データベースを分割することによる負荷の分散である。mixiでは，2段階のレベルでデータベース分割を行った。
まずレベル1では，テーブルの種類によってデータベースを分けた。どのテーブルがどのデータベースにあるかを示すパーティション・マップを用意する。利点は古いデータベースから新しいデータベースへの移行が容易なことだ。欠点はJOINができないこと。MySQL
5にはこの問題を解決するための「FEDERATED
table」という機能があるが，当時はまだMySQL
5は正式リリースされていなかった。そこで，SELECTを2回投げる，あるいはテーブルが小さければ複製する，といった方法で対応したという。
レベル1のデータベース分割後もmixiのトラフィックは増え続けた。その結果，再びデータベースの負荷が大きくなり，再度分けなければならなくなった。これがレベル2である。今度は，ユーザーIDを利用したパーティショニング・キーを用意し，このキーでデータを格納するデータベースを分けた。つまり，ユーザーによってどのデータベースにデータを置くかを変えるのである。
レベル2には2種類の方法があるという。「マネージャ・ベース」と「アルゴリズム・ベース」である。マネージャ・ベースは，パーティション・マップを格納するデータベースを追加する方法だ。利点は管理が楽であること。欠点は，パーティション・マッピングの際に余計なクエリが一つ発生してしまうこと。一方，アルゴリズム・ベースは，アプリケーションの中だけでパーティション・マップを処理する方法である。利点は，データベースにパーティション・マップの情報を取りにいく必要がないこと。欠点は，管理が難しいことと新しいデータベースを追加する際にトリッキーな方法が必要になることだ。mixiでは，これら二つの方法をテーブルの種類によって使い分けているという。
ただ，こうしたデータベース分割により新しい問題点も発生した。一つのWebページにいくつもの違うデータベースの情報を表示しようとすると，多くのコネクションが発生してしまうのだ。この問題に対処するため，mixiではメモリー・キャッシュを利用している。具体的には，メモリー・キャッシュを実現するためのmemcachedを，Perlプログラムを動かすためのApacheモジュールであるmod_perlと同じサーバーにインストールしている（2GBのメモリーを積んだ39台のサーバー）。Batara氏によると「mod_perlはCPUを食うが，memcachedはCPUを食わないので，いいコンビ」だという。
Batara氏は，レベル1とレベル2のデータベース分割をいつ行ったかも明らかにした。2004年10月に日記のテーブルをレベル1分割，2005年3月に日記のテーブルをレベル2分割，2005年4月にコミュニティのテーブルをレベル1分割，2005年10月にコミュニティのテーブルをレベル2分割という順番で行ったという。
データベース分割の手法については，さらなる改良も検討している。現在は，非常に多くの日記を書いている個人がいてもデータベースを分けられない。そこでタイム・スタンプでデータベースを分散することを考えている。これはマネージャ・ベースのレベル3に相当するという。アルゴリズム・ベースも，よりよいアルゴリズムを探しているという。
講演後は，聴衆の関心の高さを反映して，多くの質問が寄せられた。例えば「どんなタイミングでキャッシュ・サーバーのデータを変えているのか」という質問に対しては，「データによってエクスパイアの時間はまちまち。よく変更されるものは短く，あまり変更されないものは長くなっている」という回答だった。また「現在の開発チームの規模」を尋ねる質問の回答は「（ミクシィの求人情報サイトである）Find Job！やデザイナなどすべて合わせて20名弱」だった。「なぜPerlを選択したか」というPerlのカンファレンスにふさわしい質問も出た。「（先に開発した）Find Job！でPerlを使っていたので引き続き使った。また，mod_perlのサイトに（米国の玩具ショッピング・サイトである）eToysの資料があり，スケーラビリティのあるシステムを作れると思った。Pythonも考えたが，（Perlの）CPANに比べてライブラリが少なかった」というのがBatara氏の回答である。
It 's another dangerous day in America .
Bird flu is spreading , the North Koreans have a nuclear bomb , and Osama bin Laden is still at large .
The federal security threat - warning system points to " elevated . "
Citizens nationwide have been told to be extra vigilant against new terror attacks .

Meanwhile , in the midsize city of Portland , Oregon , the authorities have other things on their minds .
A little before 6 pm on this ordinary Saturday evening , there is a hit - and - run in the city 's western suburbs .
A moment later , a silent alarm goes off in a building near downtown .
At 6:03 , there 's trouble with a drunk on the north side , and at almost the same time there 's a report of a disturbance at a Home Depot .
Three quiet minutes go by , and then at 6:07 comes news of another hit - and - run .
From a room on the 10th floor of the old Heathman Hotel downtown , I follow the action as it scrolls across the screen of my laptop , little exclamation points popping up on a detailed satellite photo of the town .
Each alert is attached to a short bit of text .
I can zoom out , watching multiple traumas light up across the whole metropolitan area of 1.7 million people , or zoom in , finding nearly silent places where nothing that requires attention from the police happens for a long time .
The resolution is so good , I can pick out individual buildings .
At 7:38 pm there 's news of a robbery downtown .
At 7:53 pm another robbery occurs , across the Willamette River .
Between these incidents , there 's a motorist in distress , an audible burglar alarm , and a problem with an " unwanted person " serious enough for the police to dispatch three units .
I stay in front of my map for hours , watching a swift , unceasing flow of local problems .
While there is an undeniable voyeuristic appeal to a real - time data feed of break - ins , auto thefts , fisticuffs , and public drunkenness , the true value of this experimental system lies elsewhere .
For several months , I 've been talking with security experts about one of the thorniest problems they face :
How can we protect our complex society from massive but unpredictable catastrophes ?
The homeland security establishment has spent an immeasurable fortune vainly seeking an answer , distributing useless , highly specialized equipment , and toggling its multicolored Homeland Security Advisory System back and forth between yellow , for elevated , and orange , for high .
Now I 've come to take a look at a different set of tools , constructed outside the control of the federal government and based on the notion that the easier it is for me to find out about a loose dog tying up traffic , the safer I am from a terrorist attack .
Art Botterell is a 51 - year - old former bureaucrat whose outwardly earnest , well - formulated sentences have just the degree of excessive precision that functions among technical people as sarcasm .
At one time , Botterell worked for the State of California , in the Governor 's Office of Emergency Services .
But he quit that job in 1995 .
Today , Botterell is supported by his wife , a teacher , leaving him time to save America .
I first met Botterell earlier this year at a discussion of the book Safe : The Race to Protect Ourselves in a Newly Dangerous World .
( Safe has four authors , including Katrina Heron , the former editor in chief of this magazine , and Evan Ratliff , whose story , " Fear , Inc. , " appears in this issue . )
He caught my attention because , in an evening of discouraging commentary on the security establishment , he alone expressed optimism .
There are enormous public safety resources that remain untapped , Botterell argued .
" The focus in homeland security is on the idea of America as an invincible fortress , " he told me later .
" Most of the effort goes into prevention , law enforcement , and the military .
But those of us in emergency management tend to think , ' Well , stuff happens .
So , what are you going to do about it ? ' "
In the world of disaster management , here is some of the stuff that happens : Levees burst , power grids go dark , oil tankers run aground , railcars full of toxic chemicals tumble off their tracks , tornadoes sweep houses into the sky .
In dealing with such catastrophes , emergency managers have experience in the cascade of consequences :
Phone service vanishes , hospitals are jammed , highways slow to a crawl , shelters overflow .
No matter how much advance planning may have been done , disaster response becomes an improvisation , and society eventually rights itself through the cumulative effect of many separate acts of intelligence .
Obviously , if you want citizens to improvise intelligently , it is wise to let them know as soon as possible when something goes wrong .
Back in 1989 , when he was working for the state of California , Botterell started creating an innovative warning system called the Emergency Digital Information Service .
Botterell 's system – still in use – aggregates weather alerts , natural disaster information , and other official warnings into a common database , then makes them available through multiple media : pager , email , the Web , and digital radio broadcast .
Because EDIS warnings are picked up by television newsrooms , local police , school principals , building management firms – anybody who wants them – the system injects massive redundancy into the public warning system and ensures that any serious news will immediately be bouncing around multiple communication channels .
EDIS was designed to fix two flaws in traditional warnings like tsunami sirens , telephone trees , and old - fashioned broadcast alerts .
The first problem is that specialized warning systems are infrequently used , and usually fail under stress .
But the second problem is more serious : Humans are encoded with a tendency to pause .
When we receive new information that requires urgent action , we hesitate , testing the reality of the news and thinking about what to do .
Emergency managers are all too familiar with this feature of human nature .
They call it milling .
Milling is rational – and dangerous .
Even when a warning is successfully delivered , there are deadly delays before people respond .
What are they doing in these minutes , hours , and even days ?
They are talking to friends and family , watching the news , listening to the radio , calling the police , counting their money , and trying to balance the costs of leaving against the risks of staying .
When alerts are given through rarely used pipelines , milling increases .
And when the information distributed by hard - pressed government officials is confusing or contradictory , milling increases even more .
During a large disaster , like Hurricane Katrina , warnings get hopelessly jumbled .
The truth is that , for warnings to work , it 's not enough for them to be delivered .
They must also overcome that human tendency to pause ; they must trigger a series of effective actions , mobilizing the informal networks that we depend on in a crisis .
To understand the true nature of warnings , it helps to see them not as single events , like an air - raid siren , but rather as swarms of messages racing through overlapping social networks , like the buzz of gossip .
Residents of New Orleans did n't just need to know a hurricane was coming .
They also needed to be informed that floodwaters were threatening to breach the levees , that not all neighborhoods would be inundated , that certain roads would become impassible while alternative evacuation routes would remain open , that buses were available for transport , and that the Superdome was full .
No central authority possessed this information .
Knowledge was fragmentary , parceled out among tens of thousands of people on the ground .
There was no way to gather all these observations and deliver them to where they were needed .
During Hurricane Katrina , public officials from top to bottom found themselves locked within conventional channels , unable to receive , analyze , or redistribute news from outside .
In the most egregious example , Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff said in a radio interview that he had not heard that people at the New Orleans convention center were without food or water .
At that point they 'd been stranded two days .
By contrast , in the system Botterell created for California , warnings are sucked up from an array of sources and sent automatically to users throughout the state .
Messages are squeezed into a standard format called the Common Alerting Protocol , designed by Botterell in discussion with scores of other disaster experts .
CAP gives precise definitions to concepts like proximity , urgency , and certainty .
Using CAP , anyone who might respond to an emergency can choose to get warnings for their own neighborhood , for instance , or only the most urgent messages .
Alerts can be received by machines , filtered , and passed along .
The model is simple and elegant , and because warnings can be tagged with geographical coordinates , users can customize their cell phones , pagers , BlackBerries , or other devices to get only those relevant to their precise locale .
The EDIS system proved itself in the 1994 Northridge earthquake , carrying more than 2,000 news releases and media advisories , and it has only grown more robust in the decade since .
Anyone who has paid close attention to the evolution of the Internet will recognize the underlying power of the Common Alerting Protocol .
Good standards and widespread access , not hardware or software , bring social networks to life .
CAP provided the first proven warning standard , but when it comes to participation , California 's EDIS remained strikingly primitive .
To this day only certain agencies – like the US Geological Survey , law enforcement and fire departments , and the National Weather Service – are permitted to send out information .
This increases trust , but at the expense of scope .
Until recently , CAP was like the markup languages that existed before the invention of the Web – a useful set of technical rules whose potential to change society looked like nothing more than the exaggerated enthusiasm of a few geeks .
Open data standards are n't sexy .
You can't sell them to the government for a pile of cash .
And it 's hard to pose in front of them for celebratory photographs .
On May 11 , 2005 , a small plane took off from an airfield in Pennsylvania , wandered around for a bit , then aimed straight for the Capitol .
This was the type of incident the homeland security establishment had been preparing for ever since 9/11 .
An evacuation began , and reporters caught sight of members of Congress rushing down the steps of the Capitol .
Just over half an hour later , the plane was on the ground .
As the pilot explained that he was merely lost , rounds of congratulations began to circulate ; the government 's quick reaction had proven that new investments in public safety were paying off .
Then the DC mayor , Anthony Williams , told reporters that nobody had alerted his administration to the threat until after the all - clear was sounded .
There are more than half a million civilians in the District of Columbia .
Was n't anybody thinking about them ?
Washington 's emergency protocols , it turned out , were a jumble after all .
And the same is true across the nation .
Thousands of vulnerable targets have been identified , but there is no credible plan for protecting them .
The reason is simple :
Any plan would be inherently incomplete .
The possibilities for disruption are too numerous .
You could plan forever and still not account for all of them .
The word that security experts use to describe simple threats to complicated systems is asymmetry .
As Stephen Jay Gould pointed out in his essay " The Great Asymmetry , " catastrophe is favored by nature .
Species diversity increases for millennia , and then an asteroid extinguishes many forms of life ; a skyscraper that takes years to build can be destroyed in an hour .
The wreck of a city by a hurricane is an example of asymmetry .
So is terrorism – the relative ease of destruction is the edge terrorists use to compensate for their small numbers .
On the other hand , software designers have gotten pretty good at increasing resistance to asymmetrical threats .
The principles are well known :
Use uncomplicated parts , encourage redundancy , and open the system to public examination so flaws can be discovered and fixed before they become catastrophic .
The key is not to anticipate every problem , but to create flexible networks that can route around failure .
Yet ever since 9/11 , the security establishment has gone in the opposite direction , building highly specialized tools , centralizing control , and increasing secrecy .
After the debacle of the errant Cessna , federal officials pointed out that a system to coordinate response to aerial attacks had already been installed .
The system , called the Domestic Events Network , involves an always - open conference call .
A dedicated speakerphone sits in the DC police headquarters .
In this case , a human error had occurred – some idiot hung up the line .
But of course the problem goes deeper than that .
Such rarely used systems actually produce idiocy .
Who could remain ready to act on a signal that seldom , if ever , comes through ?
Eventually , people zone out .
They stop paying attention .
They become idiots .
Real reactions to real threats take an entirely different form .
In the case of the Cessna flyover , plenty of citizens knew that there was an evacuation , even those with no special access to government communications .
Why ?
Because as soon as the evacuation of the Capitol began , it was noted by reporters and bystanders .
Within minutes , it was on the Internet .
Wherever they occur , major threats nearly always trigger instant ripples through electronic networks .
Bursts of communication are unleashed as witnesses spread the word .
This is the raw material of warning .
The good thing is that the signal is immediate .
The bad thing is that it comes with a lot of noise .
A formal structure for warnings , like Art Botterell 's Common Alerting Protocol , eases transmission but does n't make the information more reliable .
We still need a way to analyze the warnings , to sort the raw cries of amazement and confusion , the requests for aid , and the coolly professional descriptions of experts , and assemble these records into a real - time portrait of a bad event .
We need a system to boost intelligence everywhere , providing the kind of distributed , networked resistance crucial for surviving asymmetrical attacks .
Such work could hardly be performed by machines .
Operators would have to take calls from people on the ground , separate out the cranks , dampen the hysteria , and keep a precise record .
In theory , all that information could then easily be pushed back out to the public .
Such a system would be expensive , difficult to build , and extremely valuable .
Fortunately , in most cities , it already exists .
" A 911 call center is a resource of awesome power , " says Carl Simpson , the director of emergency communications for the city of Portland , " because when something goes wrong , everybody dials 911 . "
I was talking with Simpson at the entrance to the metropolitan area 's hypermodern Bureau of Emergency Communications .
He led me up to the call center , a large , theatrical , open space where dozens of operators were taking incoming emergency calls and dispatching police , fire , or medical response teams .
Being a 911 operator means balancing seemingly contradictory skills .
On one hand , operators have to be fanatically precise and well - organized .
On the other , they must be able to establish rapport with panicky callers .
Operators need excellent spatial memories so that they can keep a map of an ongoing crisis clear in their minds .
But they can not be wedded to an old picture of reality , because the city is constantly changing .
It takes more hours to become a fully trusted operator in Simpson 's center than it does to become a licensed helicopter pilot .
The washout rate during training is 40 percent .
I spent most of the day listening to calls , hearing how the narratives of people in distress are taken in , rearranged , stripped of irrelevancies , compared to known data ( " There 's a parking lot on the north side there , ma'am , is that where you are ? " ) , and coded for urgency .
Simpson pointed out that most people think of a 911 call center only in terms of the data coming in .
Very few people have considered what would happen if , after collecting all those public cries of alarm , you extracted the essentials , tagged them for easy distribution , then reversed the flow and pumped that information back out .
In 2002 , Simpson went to lunch with a Portland businessman named Charles Jennings .
A serial entrepreneur , Jennings made his first product 28 years ago ; it was a little booklet called Drought Gardening that included a back - cover photo of the author in a full hippy beard .
Later , he helped run his wife 's company , which sold pastries at a street market under one of Portland 's downtown bridges .
After stints as a news - paper columnist , a comic strip writer , and a film and television producer , Jennings got into the software business , creating three companies in 10 years .
After September 11 , Jennings pulled together several large public meetings in Portland to discuss how the local tech community could help out .
Counterterrorism expert Richard Clarke appeared at one of them and spoke about one of the biggest but least - glamorous public safety problems : Emergency personnel – police , firefighters , paramedics – can't share information easily in a crisis .
A handful of projects emerged around that time , including a nonprofit founded by Jennings called the Regional Alliances for Infrastructure and Network Security , and a private software firm called Swan Island Networks ( Jennings is CEO ) .
Their goal was to create a system linking public safety agencies .
Jennings ' engineers discovered Art Botterell 's CAP standard , in which they saw a lingua franca of emergency communication .
They added mapping , messaging , and security features and set out to license the package to public safety agencies for a fee under the name Connect & Protect .
But this plan , seemingly straightforward , included a twist that turned out to be a radical breakthrough .
The twist was in the very definition of a public safety agency .
What is a public safety agency ?
Obviously , the police count , but what about , say , hospitals ?
If hospitals are included , then why not clinics ?
If clinics , why not schools , senior housing , and neighborhood groups ?
Connect & Protect was designed to link people who need to share information in a crisis .
But this turned out to be a lot of people .
During that lunch in 2002 , Jennings pitched Carl Simpson the idea of capturing all the cries of distress pouring into the 911 center and using them to warn the public .
He wanted to use Connect & Protect to give his swarm of public agencies a real - time picture of the region 's emergency activity .
At first , Simpson was dubious , but a few weeks later , after a visit to a local school , he changed his mind .
Simpson had been standing out on the grounds with the principal when a teacher walked up and asked where the kids would be having lunch that day .
The principal squinted up at the clouds and said , " Outside . "
Simpson , whose job puts him in the middle of a complex , highly effective sensor network , found this style of information gathering unimpressive .
" His sole basis for deciding whether to put his kids inside or outside is a glance at the sky ? " he told me later .
" What if there was a chemical fire nearby ?
What if the police were combing the neighborhood for a criminal ? "
Such emergencies are rare , but when they happen the principal ought to know .
Simpson called Jennings back and offered access to the 911 data on two conditions .
First , there had to be no additional effort on the part of the dispatchers .
And second , it had to be offered to the public schools for free .
Jennings ' company automated the process of reformatting the 911 call records into the CAP standard , and he and Simpson started inviting people to sign on .
The schools got access , of course .
They invited the security officers at the Oregon Zoo to join the network – it gets 1.3 million visitors a year .
The county parole officers got access so they could keep an eye on incidents that might lead them to violators .
Then they went further .
They provided the 911 data to a private property manager responsible for three high - rises on the east side of the Willamette River , and they also gave access to the management of Lloyd Center , Portland 's biggest shopping complex .
The public libraries and the county transportation officials and even the dogcatchers got the warnings .
Meanwhile , the evangelists at the nonprofit that Jennings had founded were out peddling the idea that Connect & Protect was n't just for receiving alerts , it was for sending them , too .
The raw data of warning and public safety did n't have to come from 911 alone .
Almost everyone receiving information could contribute information .
Network effects began to take hold , and by late 2005 recipients of the 911 alerts were sending warnings directly to one another every day .
Messages about auto break - ins at the mall went to high - rises across the street , where the security office had 32 guards on staff .
Parole officers sent alerts to the schools .
On the Oregon coast , hotel managers used Connect & Protect to pass along news of storm threats .
During a recent tsunami warning for the West Coast , Connect & Protect beat the beach siren in one coastal town by 24 minutes .
Connect & Protect is now a large conglomeration of overlapping alerts stretching across nine Oregon counties .
Each stream of warnings is controlled by the agency that issues it .
Fairly strict security features attempt to limit abuse of the warnings – certain categories of calls , such as reports of sexual crimes , are not transmitted publicly , the alerts can't easily be copied or pasted , anonymity is forbidden .
Despite these controls , Connect & Protect blatantly undermines privacy .
Pick up the phone and call 911 , and your address flashes across screens around the city – maybe even your neighbor's .
Then again , if you have a real need for help , your neighbor might be just the person you want to know about it .
Like a charcoal rubbing that reveals the pattern of a relief , the spread of Connect & Protect exposes the region 's real security network , a ubiquitous but previously hidden tangle of private and public groups .
The lines of authority through which the alerts travel on Connect & Protect do not form a simple pyramid , but extend in a mycelial net that grows thicker in some places , thinner in others .
The network copies – but also broadens and blurs – the existing web of governance .
Eventually , most people may be touched by such a network , but the origin and route of any message is unpredictable and constantly changing .
Many of the important nodes of this network are run by people like Derek Bliss .
The tall , skinny 36 - year - old is the regional manager of First Response , the largest private security firm in the Northwest .
" Let 's say there 's a high school football game that does n't go so well , " Bliss says , noting that he has security contracts with 10 percent of the Portland schools .
" Remarks are made , and our guys have to keep people apart .
We send out an alert to all the other schools . "
Bliss plays no official role in his region 's crisis management bureaucracy .
Yet his office takes about 16,000 calls per year .
The 15 cars he has on duty , his secure dispatch center equipped with a generator , his contacts with property owners around the city – none of these count as public resources , even though his team would almost certainly be active in any emergency .
Nationally , the employees of private security firms like First Response outnumber public law enforcement officers four to one .
The traditional way to tap into such private security firms – and the rest of the unseen resources that might help in a disaster – is by staging elaborate drills .
But you can't drill for every type of threat , and you can't drill all the time .
Everybody has better things to do .
Laborious training sessions are forgotten during the long stretches when everything 's fine .
That is the true nature of citizens .
Even with constant propaganda , it 's impossible to keep us safe by keeping us scared .
Weeks , months , and years pass , and we insist on living normally again .
If national safety – the ability to respond to hurricanes , terrorist attacks , earthquakes – depends on the execution of explicit plans , on soldierly obedience , and on showy security drills , then a decentralized security scheme is useless .
But if it depends on improvised reactions to unknown threats , that 's a different story .
A deeply textured , unmapped system is hard to bring down .
A system that encourages improvisation is quick to recover .
Ubiquitous networks of warning may constitute our own asymmetrical advantage , and , like the terrorist networks that occasionally carry out spectacular attacks , their power remains obscure until they 're called into action .
The virtual space station will be transformed into a nightclub
Gamers can use the card at cash machines around the world to convert virtual dollars into real currency .
The card is offered by the developers of Project Entropia , an online role - playing game that has a real world cash economy .
Last year , a virtual space resort being built in the game was snapped up by a gamer for $ 100,000 ( £ 56,200 ) .
The buyer , Jon Jacobs who plays in the game as a character called Nerverdie , is developing the space station into a virtual night club through which the entertainment industry can sell music and videos to gamers .
" We 're bridging the gap between virtual reality and reality right now , " said Jan Welter , founder of Project Entropia .
Alternate worlds
Project Entropia is one of several games known as massively multi-player online role - playing games ( MMORPGs ) .
The games allow people to inhabit alternate virtual worlds as a character of their choosing .
We are creating the next level of the online experience
Jan Welter , Project Entropia
In Entropia , these avatars , as they are known , play out their virtual lives in a planet called Calypso that has two continents with large expanding cities .
The basic version of the game is free .
But according to Jan Welter , just like the real world you need money to experience everything the Universe has to offer .
" If you fell out of nowhere and landed in a street in London , you could walk around there for free .
But if you want to have fun then you need to spend money , " he said .
" It 's the same in our world . "
The Entropia economy works by allowing gamers to exchange real currency for Project Entropia Dollars ( PEDs ) and back again into real money .
Ten PEDs are the equivalent to one US dollar .
Making money
Gamers can earn cash by accumulating PEDs via the acquisition of goods , buildings and land .
For example a gamer may choose to be a hunter who traps virtual animals for their furs .
These can then be sold to a virtual seamstress who makes and sells clothes .
The founding company , MindArk , makes money because all of the tools used by characters in the game have a finite life and need to be repaired .
If a hunter needs to continue using his weapon to make money , he must pay MindArk to repair it .
Last year $ 165 m passed through the game and the founders of the online Universe expect that to at least double in 2006 .
The new cash card blurs the boundary between the virtual and physical world even further .
It allows people to access their virtually acquired PEDs and convert them into real world money at any cash machine in the world .
" We are creating the next level of the online experience , " said Mr Welter .
Virtual treasure
The card , issued by MindArk , is associated with the players Entropia Universe account and has all of the features of a real world bank account .
Players can transfer , withdraw , deposit and even view account balances using the system .
" It is incredible to now think that it is possible to manufacture and sell a virtual item one minute and then go out and buy real dinner the next minute , with the same funds , " said Jon Jacobs , owner of the virtual space resort .
For many people , games like Entropia have become a real source of income .
In December 2004 , another character called Deathifier , bought a virtual treasure island for $ 26,500 ( £ 13,700 ) .
The real person behind the character , an Australian gamer called David Storey , recouped his money within a year by selling land to build virtual homes as well as taxing other gamers to hunt or mine on the island .
The sale of the island was in the Guinness book of World Records as the most virtual dollar ever spent .
The sale of the space station in 2005 is the new record holder .

Finally , Gerry Sussman said " Of course , you can't expect Lisp to do something like that ; Lisp can't do things like this .
If you want to deal with massive data sets , you have to use C . It is sad but true . "
I said , " Gerry , I think this would run on an old 1 MIPS 3600 with 8 Mbytes of RAM .
I 'd just rewrite this in Common Lisp .
The code would be cleaner because of the generic functions for sequences and I 'll throw out my private sort function and just use the one built into Common Lisp . "
Sussman said " If that is true then the whole Scheme project has been a waste and I 'll shut it down . "
" Do n't say that , Gerry ! " I admonished .
" I 've written a lot of Lisp Machine programs over the years and I 'm pretty sure that it can do this . "
Sussman was insistent .
If that creaking old LispM could sort the phone numbers , MIT Scheme was history .
It took me 20 minutes to convert the code , which ended up being about one third as many lines .
It took 45 minutes to run on the 3600 whose paging bar was on continuously ( reading a 30 Mbyte file into VM ) but it terminated with the answer I needed .
Gerry was despondent until Bill Rozas , his grad student and one of the scheme implementors , showed up .
" Of course MIT Scheme could n't run it .
That 's because you were using READ to read numbers .
You can't do that for 300,000 numbers .
You have to write your own READ - NUM that is specialized just to read numbers .
Then it will run fine . "
Sussman breathed a big sigh of relief .
I switched to Macintosh Common Lisp .

How Much Does It Cost Your Household for War ?
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
Someone once told me that politicians use war to hide economic depressions .
That war - making artificially relieves unemployment , boosts productivity and helps to invent new technologies .
Wars also distract the citizenry away from the failings of their own governments and focus attention on a common external enemy .
Wars conceal economic depressions because wartime debt spending can be explained away as the costs of combat .
For example , the financial allotment for the war in Iraq is excluded from the government budget altogether and funds are acquired through special emergency appropriations .
The Iraq war would add about $ 100 billion to the annual cost of defense spending .
By not reporting this expense , the pie chart used to show how much each segment of government costs , as a percentage of total revenues , is misleading and defense spending appears smaller .
It also makes the economy look rosier than it really is .
Here is the pie chart the government uses to inform citizens where their money is going ?
Hey , just 16 cents on the dollar for protection from Osama bin Laden , Al Qaeda , the Taliban , North Korea , and various other threats .
Sounds pretty economical , heh ?
So , take a blind guess what the percentage of the US Federal budget is allotted to war making ?
Ten percent ?
A third of the federal budget ?
Guess again , could it be half of the annual federal outlays ?
Seems impossible , but it may be so .
To give you a little help in this guessing game , here is the standard pie chart provided by the government displaying the percentage of spending by category .
Robert Higgs , Senior Fellow in Political Economy for the Independent Institute , took a stab at determining the amount of defense spending in 2004 .
What Higgs showed was the Federal Budget lists expenses for the Department of Defense at about 16 % of the federal outlays ( $ 344.4 billion in 2002 ) .
But this is not all of the defense spending Higgs uncovered .
When defense spending is added for other government departments ( Dept. of State , Dept. of Energy , Dept. of Veterans Affairs , Homeland Security , NASA and the interest attributable to past debt - financed defense outlays ) , the figure rises by 73 % ( to $ 596.1 billion ) , or about 27 % of the 2004 federal budget .
[ San Francisco Chronicle , Jan. 18 , 2004 ]
But the largesse of government is difficult for even a sleuth like Higgs to fully calculate .
The Los Alamos Study Group based in Albuquerque , New Mexico , say they have been dissatisfied with the quoted total for US military spending .
So they conducted their own analysis .
For fiscal year 2005 , the closest of their calculations to Higgs ’ 2004 estimates , the Los Alamos Study Group estimates the cost of military spending is more like $ 793 billion , which would represent 38.4 % of the total revenues ( $ 2.064 trillion ) for 2005 .
The March 2006 newsletter of the Friends Committee on National Legislation calculates defense spending is about 42 % of the federal budget ( $ 783 billion out of a 2005 budget of $ 1,865 billion , not including Social Security and Medicare Trust fund income ) .
However , the War Resisters League ( WRL ) may have a more inclusive list of war expenses .
The WRL took figures from Fiscal Year 2004 as percentage of federal funds .
The big difference in WRL defense figures from other estimates is it designates a larger portion of the interest payments paid for money loaned to fund past wars , more like 80 % of the entire federal debt load , compared to other groups that estimate only 50 - 60 % of the debt .
The WRL says most ( if not all ) of the national debt would have been eliminated without debit spending for wars .
So all totaled , the WRL estimates 49 % of the estimated 2007 federal budget will go towards military spending !
But even this figure is understated .
Really , military spending is much greater than the 49 % figure because this percentage is calculated on federal outlays , not revenues .
The expense budget includes money that was borrowed to fund war .
When calculated as a percentage of revenues only , not counting borrowed money , the percentage rises even higher .
There is another way defense spending is minified .
Federal funds ( from taxes ) and Trust Funds ( from Social Security and Medicare ) are lumped together ( so - called Unified budget ) so the human needs portion of the budget looks bigger , the war budget relatively smaller .
The Many Ways Military Spending Is Minified
Defense spending is presented as the Budget for the Defense Department and not for other branches of government involved in military spending ( Dept. of State , Dept. of Energy , Dept. of Veterans Affairs , Homeland Security , NASA )
The cost of current wars ( Iraq ) is off - budget and funds are acquired through special funding legislation .
Military budget does not include interest on the debt for prior wars that were fought .
Military spending is presented as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product so it appears as 3 - 4 % of total spending instead of nearly half of the federal budget .
Trust funds for Medicare and Social Security are included in the total federal budget to make defense spending look smaller .
Defense spending is calculated as a percentage of federal outlays , not revenues .
Federal outlays include money borrowed to fight wars .
When calculated as a percentage of revenues only , not counting borrowed money , the percentage rises even higher .
One of the other ways the federal accounting practices diminish the size of war spending is to compare it against the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , rather than the total revenues in a year .
Or restated , defense spending is often calculated as a percentage of total earnings in the entire population rather than a percentage of taxes paid to government .
It ’s a ruse .
So military spending in 2004 was said to be only 3.9 % of GDP .
This makes it sound like hiring security guards costs less than 4 % when it actually costs about half of the federal revenues .
No wonder the federal government has to hide the largesse of its war machine .
Bankers love wars funded by debt so they will gain perpetual interest on their money .
The Heritage Foundation estimates per capita military spending in the U.S. is rising at an unprecedented pace ( see chart above ) .
Another concern is that government tends to never return any money to taxpayers should it ever have a surplus .
The federal government projects revenue increases over the next few years ( though these are often specious ) and begins to calculate how much it can add to the defense budget even before the money comes in .
For example , in 2005 federal receipts increased by $ 274 billion , a 14.5 percent increase , and the largest increase in 24 years .
It was all gobbled up by the ever - hungry federal behemoth .
The chart below estimates future projected federal revenues .
Where will all this money go ?
How much more to fund war ?
Source : The White House ( in billions )
Oddly , the US continues to develop war technologies designed to fight a non-existent enemy .
Russia has dropped its military spending from about $ 260 billion to just $ 30 billion annually .
[ San Jose Mercury News , August 16 , 2000 ]
The US has become a nation whose productivity is being measured by war spending .
How do the nation ’s voters go about expressing their desire to cut back on military spending ?
Politicians make it difficult to oppose unbridled defense spending .
For example , knowing the current public opinion to restrict illegal immigration , in 2005 the House of Representatives tacked a provision onto President Bush ’s emergency $ 81.3 billion war spending legislation that would make it all but illegal to issue driver ’s licenses to undocumented immigrants .
They know how to keep the war machine going .
[ San Francisco Chronicle March 16 , 2005 ]
Something ’s Gotta Give : How long can the US continue funding Medicare , Social Security and Wars ?
The day is coming when the federal government will not be able to fund all three of its major financial outlays — Medicare , Social Security and war making .
Somewhere in 2008 the federal government will begin an inevitable downward financial spiral .
Cutbacks in Medicare spending and extending the age to receive social security benefits will still not stave off the looming catastrophe .
The Heritage Foundation makes us aware that , beginning in 2008 , the Social Security cash surplus begins to decline .
In 2018 the annual benefit costs exceed cash revenue from taxes .
In 2028 the trust fund ceases to grow because even taxes plus interest fall short of benefits .
And by 2042 the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted and only 73 — 81 % of benefits could be paid .
Payroll taxes would have to be raised to 60 % of income to pay for Social Security near mid-century to meet all obligations .
Growing out of debt fallacy
Growing the economy out of this problem would require double - digit economic growth .
In the 1990s the economy grew at a rate of about 3.2 % per year .
Double - digit economic growth would trigger curbs in the money supply from the fed .
To balance the nation ’s budget in 2040 would require a 60 % cut in federal spending ( about the cost of defense spending ) .
To understand the false idea of growing the economy to get out of debt , imagine a sole family wage earner going deeper into debt and assuming he can pay it all back based upon anticipated future paycheck increases .
Retiring Baby Boomers will deplete the Medicare trust fund
Furthermore , the cost of Medicare " is about to explode , " says the Heritage Foundation .
Medicare spending is projected to jump tom $ 395 in FY 2007 to $ 504.4 billion in FY 2011 .
Some modest cuts in Medicare spending will offset a small portion of this growth .
But such cuts " do not even begin to tackle the enormity of the task facing Congress and the nation , " says the Heritage Foundation .
Medicare has unfunded liabilities of $ 30 trillion !
To fully fund Medicare ’s obligation to provide health care for retirees would require a rise in Medicare payroll taxes from 2.9 % to 13.4 % .
The recent passage of Medicare drug benefits only adds to the problem .
Health care spending was $ 1.4 trillion in 2001 but will rise to $ 3.1 trillion by 2012 !
This is because the senior citizen population is rising and will double by 2030 to 71 million .
Around 2011 the Baby Boomers will begin to turn 65 and by 2030 one in five Americans will be of retirement age .
The sickest 10 percent of Medicare beneficiaries account for 75 percent of outlays , and each costs the system about $ 37,000 .
The smokers , overeaters , alcoholics , etc. rack up the biggest bills .
Since 75 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries have incomes below $ 25,000 and spend on average $ 2,605 in out - of - pocket costs for their medical care , few savings can be squeezed from the elderly .
Will the war machine win out ?
At some time in the future Congress has to decide whether it can continue to spend nearly half of the annual federal budget on defense ( war making ) without making huge cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare .
Will the war machine win out over the government ’s commitment to fund health care and pension funds ?
In the next decade or two there will be far more retirees voting in elections .
Would you anticipate they will favor funding war over direct benefits to themselves ?
Is the federal government ready to reduce military spending ?
It does n’t appear so .
In 2003 when President Bush asked for an additional $ 87 billion for military and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Los Angeles Times said Congress had " no appetite for offsetting the increases with cuts in domestic spending . "
[ LA Times , Sept. 17 , 2003 ]
Cut Social Security to free up more war money
In 2002 Patrick Chisholm of The Christian Science Monitor outrageously suggested that reforms in Social Security would free up more dollars for military spending .
This is the kind of mentality that exists .
Social Security is " crowding out " defense spending , said Chisholm .
He said if it were n’t for the government " entitlement " programs ( you mean the Medicare and Social Security trust funds that citizens paid into over their lifetime , Mr. Chisholm ? ) , " billions more federal dollars would be freed up for spending on more police and security guards , more FBI agents , " etc .
Can you imagine this ?
Chisholm makes Medicare and Social Security sound like doled - out welfare , not repayment to recipients who have paid for these benefits ahead of time .
The federal government gets to renege on its obligation to make Social Security payments because of the growing need for more security guards ?
Chisholm said that policymakers will be faced with " huge pressure to bail out Social Security and Medicare at the expense of everything else " ( everything else being military spending ) .
[ Fight terrorism by reforming Social Security , Patrick Chisholm , the Christian Science Monitor , Feb. 26 , 2002 ]
Congress is misdirected
At least some in Congress are not oblivious to the problem .
In 2003 Rep. Dennis Kucinich proposed trimming the Pentagon budget by 15 % , or $ 60 billion , but instead of increasing Social Security or Medicare withholding taxes , Kucinich suggested diverting that money to " dwindling domestic priorities " such as education .
This became the Ready - to - Teach Act that passed Congress .
It ’s obvious , if taxes collected for Medicare and Social Security must increase at some time in the future , taxes allotted to military spending must be cut .
But if military spending is cut , wo n’t many jobs be lost ?
Well , the Defense Monitor states , " As far as providing jobs , military spending is a much worse investment than other federally funded programs .
For example , $ 1 billion spent by the Pentagon on weapons , supplies and services generates 25,000 jobs .
However , the same $ 1 billion would create 30,000 mass transit jobs , 36,000 housing jobs , 41,000 education jobs , and 47,000 health care jobs . "

Giove - A will demonstrate key technologies
Giove - A transmitted the first of its navigational signals to ground stations in the UK and Belgium on Thursday .
The UK - built satellite was launched on 28 December from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
It is a demonstrator for the network that will give Europe its own version of the US Global Positioning System .
Giove - A was placed into orbit some 23,000 km ( 14,292 miles ) above the Earth .
The first signal from Giove - A heralds a new era for location technologies
Francis Tuffy , Location and Timing Knowledge Transfer Network
" We have now reached the point where we 've started to validate the whole Galileo signal , " Philip Davies of SSTL told the BBC News website .
" Thursday was the first day when the first actual Galileo signal was sent from space to Earth .
" If you had receiving equipment , you could have picked it up anywhere on Earth within visibility of the satellite - we picked it up in the UK at the Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire . "
' Celestial mechanics '
Mr Davies said people had been working around the clock at the control room in Guildford , Surrey , to check out the satellite 's payload .
Giove - A was carried into orbit on a Soyuz - Fregat launch vehicle
The Galileo signals transmitted by Giove - A will now be analysed in detail to make sure they satisfy the criteria set by the International Telecommunications Union .
The 3.4 bn -euro ( £ 2.3bn ; $ 4bn ) partnership project between the European Space Agency and the European Commission will give civilian users a satellite navigation and positioning service that is 10 times more accurate than the alternatives available today .
While public signals from GPS are already widely used by the likes of sailors , mountaineers and motorists , the US military reserves the right to limit its use or switch it off for security reasons .
" The first signal from Giove - A heralds a new era for location technologies , " said Francis Tuffy , director of the new Location and Timing Knowledge Transfer Network ( KTN ) , which was set up by the UK's Department for Trade Industry ( DTI ) to help industry to benefit from the Galileo signal .
THE SAT - NAV FUTURE
Navigation for navigation 's sake will not drive applications
Uptake pushed forward by services that add value to data
Huge potential for internet - linked services run off mobiles E.g. finding a restaurant , and directing you to nearest ATM Multimedia delivered to tourists ' mobiles as they walk around ' Guardian angel ' services will locate separated children Possibilities are endless ; mobile firms already brainstorming Database and billing companies planning for large markets
Galileo puts UK on map Q&A : Europe 's Galileo project
" But it is up to UK industry to make Galileo work for us and this requires a joint effort from academia , industry and government .
" If we can create real applications which use the strength of the Galileo signal , we could be looking at the creation of a whole new industry . "
On Thursday , South Korea became the latest non-European Union country to sign up to a Galileo cooperation programme , alongside China , Israel and Ukraine .
" Korea 's support for Galileo is an important milestone for the project , " said Francis Tuffy .
" The backing of such a leader in technologies such as mobile telecommunications demonstrates to UK firms the worldwide potential for location technologies .
Now it is up to us to turn this support into commercial results . "

Google purchased YouTube for more than a billion dollars .
That “ pop ” you hear is not the end of the Web 2.0 bubble , but the end of the Google Myth .
The Google Myth is simple : to produce good businesses , hire the best engineers and leave them alone except for occasional priority setting .
Most recently , engineers have been forwarding around this post from Steve Yegge , which contains an overview of Google ’s management practices – admittedly , Nirvana for engineers .
More than any other company , Google has promoted the myth that these practices produce good businesses .
Do n’t get me wrong – good engineers , left alone with the right culture , can do great work .
This is particularly true if they are the users of their own products and they have no partners or customers relying on strict deadlines .
In consumer Internet , that ’s largely true , and Google has some products that delight me .
I use Google Maps , have a Gmail account , and use Gtalk .
All are great products , but none are very good businesses .
Each has a tiny fraction of the market .
“ Who Will Win the Map Wars ?
Google or MSN ” was the question people were asking recently .
How about MapQuest or Yahoo , who between them have over 70 % of the market – up from last year ?
Are you a Gmail user ?
Good , you can join the other 3 % of people who are .
Yahoo
Mail added more users last year than Google ’s entire user base .
Gtalk ?
Great , enjoy talking to the other 44 thousand people using it regularly , or you could use AIM or Skype with over 40 million .
In market after market , Google has made an innovative product and forced the other guys to improve .
I thank them for that , but even after many years , the products have not turned into businesses .
Where Google does have good ( ok , fantastic ) businesses – search and Adwords / Adsense – the management techniques are less loose by necessity .
Management takes a far stronger role in setting priorities .
Google ’s additional products are merely PR , done for the buzz .
That ’s great for Google , because it keeps their name in front of you and keeps you using their search product .
Those methods are not so great for the rest of us who rely on products to build businesses .
The more pedestrian incremental features needed to create a business – the stuff the engineers hate – are left behind at Google .
With the purchase of YouTube , Google is admitting the Google Myth is false .
Google already has a video service platform and the engineers to out - do YouTube technically .
Instead , Google is buying YouTube for over a billion dollars .
Now that Google ’s management believes video is an actual business , they are looking outside Google ’s engineering culture to build it .
The myth that a good product by itself is sufficient , so engineers should be set free from business folks , just went “ pop ” .
Google joined the rest of us who are still searching for that ideal balance between business needs and the freedom needed by creative talent .
Welcome to the real world , Google , and good luck keeping your best talent as you transition more of your products to businesses .
77 TV stations aired ' fake news reports ' Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday April 5 , 2006 Print This | Email
This A study by a group that monitors the media reveals that , over a ten month span , 77 television stations from all across the nation aired video news releases without informing their viewers even once that the reports were actually sponsored content , RAW STORY has found .
One " news report " that aired on three stations relied on a video news release ( VNR ) produced by a PR firm on behalf of General Motors which was even apparently based on a " false claim . "
Center for Media and Democracy 's Fake TV News : Widespread and Undisclosed is " a multimedia report on television newsrooms ' use of material provided by PR firms on behalf of paying clients , " containing video footage of the 36 video news releases ( VNRs ) cited in the report , plus a map and spreadsheet of the stations cited .
General Motors , Intel , Pfizer and Capital One are among the companies who produced VNRs with the help of three PR firms , and " [ m ] ore than one - third of the time , stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety . "
An Oklahoma City FOX station owned by Sinclair is pegged as the " report 's top repeat offender , " airing five VNRs in full on its news broadcasts , with " the publicist 's original narration each time . "
Three stations " not only aired entire VNRs without disclosure , but had local anchors and reporters read directly from the script prepared by the broadcast PR firm . "
News broadcasts based on a General Motors VNR stand out in the report as a striking example of " fake news , " not just because they were left largely unchanged when aired on stations in Louisiana and Pennsylvania .
" GM , who introduced the first manufacturer web site in 1996 , has recently lowered prices , in some cases by thousands of dollars , on all of their models as a direct result of the customers ' ability to comparison shop on the Internet , " Medialink 's Kate Brookes " reported " in all three broadcasts .
But the Center for Media and Democracy blasts GM's " historical claim " as " fake . "
" A simple dated search for " automotive web site " in the Nexis news database revealed a press release from August 1995 in which Volkswagen heralded the launch of their web portal , " the report states .
" It was n't until February 1996 that General Motors announced gm.com in their own press release . "
A comparison between the General Motors VNR and one of the news broadcasts can be seen at this link .
Last year the New York Times published an article called " Under Bush , a new age of prepackaged TV news " - written by David Barstow and Robin Stein - which reported on the stealthy use of VNRs created by government agencies that crept into network news broadcasts .
The Times revealed that even though Radio - Television News Directors Association 's " code of ethics " specifies to " clearly disclose the origin of information and label all material provided by outsiders , " the Federal Communications Commission has " never disciplined a station for showing government - made news segments without disclosing their origin . "
Last June , Chris Baker at the Washington Times reported that the Radio - Television News Directors Association " submitted a 13 - page statement that said few TV stations air VNRs , and those that do almost always identify the source " to the Federal Communications Commission .
The statement drew from an " informal survey of 100 members " because , as the president of the Association told the Washington Times , " concrete data " was " hard to come by . "
An article in Thursday 's Times by Barstow ( New York Times registered link ) indicates that the Center " presented its findings yesterday to F.C.C. officials , including Jonathan S. Adelstein , a commissioner who has criticized video news releases . "
Impressed by the " scope of what they found , " Adelstein told the Times that it was a " disgrace to American journalism , " and proof of " potentially major violations " of F.C.C. rules .
It took nearly two weeks to get the PowerBook fixed , but for now I ’m a Macboy again .
On balance , the Mac experience is better .
But Ubuntu is not that far behind , and it ’s catching up .
I ’m thinking about the endgame .
Where OS X Wins ·
The single biggest quality - of - life delta , weirdly , was the control keys .
On Mac , it ’s command - C for cut and command - V for paste .
On Linux it ’s Control - C and Control - V , except when it ’s not , which is in a terminal window and Emacs , which is where I spend a whole bunch of my time .
OK , a small irritant , but one that bites all the time .
Then there are the fonts .
Anti-aliasing is an optional extra on Linux , and I was n’t willing to do the sources .
list wrangling to get the bleeding - edge allegedly - anti- aliased Emacs .
Also , lots of fonts Windows & Mac people use every day just are n’t there on Linux .
There are apparently some gyrations and downloads and things you can do to get some of them .
I could n’t get Flash working ( complaints about the amd64 architecture ) , which meant lots of irritating little holes in Web pages everywhere .
Not being able to watch YouTube is a real time - saver , though .
And of course , OS X ’s single - menubar - across - the - top is Right , other options are Wrong .
Photoshop Elements has special controls to make it real easy to create 4x6 and 5x7 prints of babies for grandmothers .
Where Ubuntu Wins ·
You do n’t have to think , when you ’re Alt - tabbing , about applications vs. windows .
You do n’t have to worry about Fink vs. DarwinPorts vs. build - from - source , everything you ’ll ever need is in a package and ready to go .
Linux is a little better at poking around SMB space , finding and connecting to Windows servers .
The Gimp has a Curves control , which you have to spend a thousand bucks to get from full - bore Photoshop .
Next Steps : Applications · I have so had it with Apple applications .
A couple weeks with Thunderbird made it obvious I should have long since dumped Mail.app .
Every week iCal gets slower and every week I hate it more .
When I was on Ubuntu , I maintained my schedule by typing it into a plain - text document in Emacs , and that was so much less painful .
Next Steps : Operating Systems ·
Once
I get myself working in an application suite that ’s entirely free from data lock - in , which in effect means all - OSS , then the choice of operating system and hardware becomes independent of the apps I use .
Right now , oversimplifying egregiously , you might classify the Unix - like operating systems like so :
OS X is the winner for suspend / resume , wireless networking , typography , and outboard screen handling .
Solaris is the winner for observability , virtualization , and big-iron threading .
Linux ( Debian & friends anyhow ) is the winner for package management and running on an infinite variety of different hardware .
Aside from that , I ’d say it ’s pretty well a wash .
My Next Computer Will Be ... ·
Well , I do n’t know .
Weirdly , now that I ’ve realized that I can have a decent application suite that does n’t lock up my data and runs on whatever OS / Hardware , my desire to get off the Mac has moderated .
On the other hand , if , next time I go shopping , a real good reason to go with Solaris or Linux instead comes along , I ’ll do it without much angst .
And I ’ll put in the time then to go score those fonts and that anti-aliasing code and switch from Gnome to KDE and so on and so forth .
Oh Yes , Video · First , it ’s dorky to try to pretend that a laptop , any laptop , is an appropriate device for video editing .
Second , right now , near as I can tell , the Mac software in this space is just a whole lot better .
So I think that my future probably has a dedicated Mac video - editing box in it .
And if that ’s the only Mac I end up using , well whatever .

" The situation is so bad many people say it is worse than it has been in the times of Saddam Hussein , " said Manfred Nowak , a UN special investigator on torture , at a press conference in Geneva .
He said government forces , private militia and terrorist groups were all involved .
" You have terrorist groups , you have the military , you have police , you have these militias .
There are so many people who are actually abducted , seriously tortured and finally killed , " said Mr Nowak , an Austrian law professor .
" It 's not just torture by the government .
There are much more brutal methods of torture you 'll find by private militias . "
Mr Nowak also said that bodies were being discovered with very heavy and very serious torture marks .
He said a mission to Iraq to investigate torture was too dangerous , but he had gathered information from interviews with people in Amman , Jordan , and other sources .
Mr Nowak is in Geneva to brief the UN Human Rights council - a body that addresses human rights violations - on the situation of the United States detention facility at Guantanamo Bay .
He is one of five UN human rights investigators who in February called for the closure of the camp on the grounds it was a " torture camp " .
The calls were rejected by the US .
Mr Nowak 's comments come a day after the human rights office of the UN assistance mission for Iraq ( Unami ) raised concerns about the violence gripping the country .
It said that 6,599 civilians had died in July and August .
Unami cited increasing evidence of violent torture , a growth in the numbers of death squads , and a rise in the honour killings of women and girls .
" Corpses appear regularly in and around Baghdad and other areas .
Most bear signs of torture and appear to be victims of extrajudicial executions , " said the report .
The van Gogh murder , committed in 2004 , lives on in Europe as an emblem and a threshold in the accumulating body of evidence and incidents of intimidation by Muslims living within Western society .
In Australia , our own extreme symptom and threshold in this same trend and cultural struggle was the gang - rapes of dozens of young women by Muslim men in Sydney .
Nine trials have worked through the courts so far as a result of these crimes .
In this cultural clash , the treatment of women is the most hotly contested terrain .
Not just the treatment of non-Muslim women by Muslim men , but the treatment of Muslim women within Western culture .
Many Muslim women live under constraints that are unacceptable to wider society .
For years , a symptom of this tension , which is largely submerged , has been the distraught young women turning up at the Australian embassy in Beirut to escape forced marriages .
In the midst of this cultural and moral struggle one element has been conspicuously missing - the feminists - the authors , academics and commentators who rose to prominence as advocates of women 's rights .
In Australia and Europe , their response to the growing levels of sexual intimidation , harassment or suppression of women by Muslim men has either been a deafening chorus of silence , or denial and blame - shifting .
Instead , the combat has been left to journalists , and the heaviest work has been done , at great risk to themselves , by dissident women inside Islamic culture .
Women such as Hirsi Ali , who , before her life in Holland became intolerable and she retreated to the United States , wrote The Caged Virgin , a book in which she comments : " Islam dominated the lives of our family … I was taught that Islam sets us apart from the rest of the world , the world of non-Muslims .
They , the others , the kafirs , the unbelievers , are antisocial , impure , barbaric , not circumcised , immoral , unscrupulous , and above all , obscene ; they have no respect for women ; their girls and women are whores …
" Islam is strongly dominated by a sexual morality derived from tribal Arab values dating from the time of the Prophet … a culture in which women were the property of their fathers , brothers , uncles , grandfathers , or guardians …
" [ Yet ] the adherents to the gospel of multiculturalism refuse to criticise people whom they see as victims … Criticism of the Islamic world , of Palestinians , and of Islamic minorities is regarded as Islamophobia and xenophobia … I cannot emphasise enough how wrongheaded this is .
It is racism in its purest form . "
Her voice was joined by that of Wafa Sultan , a psychiatrist who fled Syria after members of the Muslim Brotherhood gunned down one of her university professors in the classroom .
She became a legend on the internet this year after standing up to a fundamentalist cleric on Al - Jazeera TV , brilliantly articulating the real schism facing the Western world : " The clash we are witnessing around the world is not a clash of civilisations .
It is a clash between two opposites , between two eras .
It is a clash between a mentality that belongs in the Middle Ages and another mentality that belongs to the 21st century .
It is a clash between civilisation and backwardness , between the civilised and the primitive , between barbarity and rationality . "
Last year , from the safety of Canada , a Muslim woman dissident , Irshad Manji , wrote The Trouble With Islam , which challenged the Koran 's core statements on women ( such as , " Men have authority over women because God has made the one superior to the other " ) .
She also raised the issue of double standards among Western liberals : " Why does the legitimate questioning of some people ( Muslims , for instance ) carry the charge of being racist while legitimate questioning of other people ( say , non-Muslim Americans ) does n't ? "
She was joined this year by other writers , including the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen , who fled to Europe after her novel Shame invoked death threats from Muslim fundamentalists , when they signed an open letter calling for an end to the double standards of liberal Western intellectuals : " We reject ' cultural relativism ' which accepts that men and women of Muslim culture should be deprived of the right to equality , freedom and secular values in the name of respect for cultures and traditions …
Islamism is a reactionary ideology . "
The most recent and most scathing commentary has come from a British journalist , Melanie Phillips , whose new book , Londonistan , examines the culture which produced last year 's terrorist bombings in London by British Muslims .
She is outraged by the dangerous hypocrisy of self - styled " progressives " : " It is remarkable that the left … with its obsessions with issues like gay rights , equality for women and sexual licence … should have forged an alliance with radical Islamists who preach death to gays , the subjugation of women and the stoning of adulterers .
It is an eye - opener to see , on the streets of London , so - called ' progressives ' marching shoulder to shoulder with radical Islamists under the metaphorical banner of human rights and the literal banners of Hamas . "
In Australia , much the same .
Prominent feminists have responded to the cascade of reactionary provocations by Muslim men in this country with an ideological forbearance , and a pall of silence .
The silence of the lambs .
Paul Sheehan 's book " about " the courts and sexual assault , Girls Like You , will be published by Pan Macmillan on Wednesday .

How do you measure success when it comes to ministry ?
Is it the number of weekly attendees ?
This article is a first simplistic ( but comprehensive ) assessment of World Oil Exports , here defined has the total amount of liquid hydrocarbons that are surpluses in producing countries .
This assessment is made by projecting in to the future fixed change rates that reflect current trends in liquids production and consumption in countries where presently the difference between the two is positive .
The outcome of this assessment is worrisome .
Introduction
Although the debate is growing around the point in time when global oil production starts to decline permanently , for countries or regions where oil production is null or very low , the amount of oil available for trade in the market is a much more relevant issue .
Such is the case of the European Union ; with oil consumption topping 14.5 Mb/d , only two of its member states figure in the exporting countries list , and both with marginal numbers .
More than worrying with a Peak Oil date , importing countries should worry on the future availability of tradable oil .
It is therefore of the highest importance for importing countries to know in advance the amount of oil available to the market , and from which countries / regions it may come , in order to prepare correctly for the future .
This assessment uses as data sources the Statistical Review of World Energy , published yearly by BP , and the monthly newsletter published by ASPO , where assessments for future oil production are available for more than 40 individual countries .
Future oil consumption and production is projected using static change rates for the period starting in 2006 and finishing in 2020 .
These rates are determined by current trends and by reserves / future discovery assessments made by Colin Campbell and published in the ASPO 's newsletters .
In this text the word " oil " is used for simplicity as synonym of liquid hydrocarbons , for the past data on consumption and production used includes Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) .
Oil Exporters
Oil exporting countries are defined as having in 2005 an oil production greater than oil consumption , thus resulting in a surplus .
Using the data published by BP on its Statistical Review of World Energy of 2006 , the following countries are identified : Saudi Arabia ,
Former Soviet Union ( where individual data is available for Russia , Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan ) , Norway , Venezuela , Iran , United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , México , Algeria , Qatar , Canada , Malaysia , Ecuador , Argentina , Colombia , Denmark , Egypt and United Kingdom .
Due to lack of data for consumption , Angola , Nigeria and Iraq are left out of this first assessment .
This issue will be revisited in the concluding stages of this article .
Figure 1 shows how these exporting countries rank in the world oil market .
Figure 1 - Oil producing countries identified for 2005 .
The " Others " slot contains all countries producing less than 400 Kb/d .
The statistical review contains historical data from 1965 to present , which is worth observing :
Figure 2 - Past oil exports from countries where data on consumption is also available .
The well know energy crisis of the past appear in an interesting fashion : the major declines in exports come after the events that generated it .
Such might be a sign of a market ruled more from the Demand side than from the Supply side .
That situation is likely to reverse as the peak in world oil production is approached .
The early 1980s are years of marked difficulties for exporters , on both wealthy sides of the Atlantic internal production backed off demand ( Alaska and North Sea ) .
Exporting numbers of the 1970s are only surpassed in the mid 1990s .
This fall on oil demand can be a reasonable explanation for the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Future Oil Production
Future oil production is projected applying the decline / growth rates identified by Colin Campbell to the data published by BP .
In most cases the numbers of each source for daily production do not match , Campbell 's assessments focus on Conventional Oil , while BP 's historical data on " All Liquids " ( a somewhat loose definition which includes Liquefied Natural Gas and other non-specified liquids ) .
Still these differences are usually small , requiring special treatment only in three cases .
Following is a list of the countries assessed .
Next to the country name is the year of original assessment by Colin Campbell and in quote the author 's view at the time .
A brief explanation of the rate used for projection then follows .
Saudi Arabia - 2006
Production stands at 9 Mb/d giving a low depletion rate of 1.9 % , , which itself is reason to doubt the higher official reserve estimates
The country is endeavouring to offset the natural decline of its aging fields by infill drilling as well as advanced horizontal drilling to tap the less productive zones in the reservoir .
A tar -seal on the eastern flank of Ghawar , deprives it of a natural water drive , meaning that massive amounts of water have to be injected .
It is also bringing on new much smaller fields , including offshore extensions .
While the country claims to be able to increase production to 12 Mb/d , it is here thought more likely that it will be hard pressed to hold present production , which is here modeled to remain about flat for another twenty years before decline sets in at about 3 % a year .
It may not be able even to do that .
Sweet Oil production in Saudi Arabia has likely peaked leaving the country in some sort of momentarily difficulties to replace past production rates with sour crude .
The declared recoverable reserves stand at 270 Gb , a number hardly with geological meaning , given that original oil in place is declared to be 720 Gb.
Including the 105 Gb already produced ; that would imply a mean recovery rate of over 50 % for the entire country .
The current assessment by Colin Campbell stays around 160 Gb , which is probably optimistic for it implies a mean recovery of 37 % , roughly meaning the successful application of tertiary recovery methods for the entire country .
Still this last estimate is used which make it plausible for Saudi Arabia to continue producing liquid hydrocarbons at rates in excess of 11 Mb/d .
Russian Federation - 2003
Accordingly , we may expect a second peak around 2010 .
It is clear that the reserve estimates of around 50 Gb as reported by the Oil & Gas Journal were far too low .
Exactly how far is difficult to know , but we tentatively favour an figure of about 60 Gb , still giving a fairly low depletion rate of 3 % , which is one argument against higher estimates .
Production rose steeply up to 2005 and stalled there after ; a peak is still expected circa 2010 at 10 Mb/d .
Kazakhstan - 2005
Insufficient is known about the country to make a very reliable assessment but the indications are that about 37 Gb have been discovered , of which only 6.6 have been produced .
Future discovery is here assessed at about 8 Gb , giving a rounded total of 45 Gb .
With such substantial reserves , the country has little incentive to explore for more .
If this is approximately correct , it might be reasonable to model production rising to about 1.4 Mb/d by 2010 followed by a plateau to the onset of decline around 2030 .
This projection is kept without change .
Azerbaijan -2004
Production is currently running at about 300 kb/d at far below capacity pending the construction of the new export pipeline when it may triple .
The midpoint of depletion is forecast for around 2015 , when production would decline at about 2.5 % a year .
This projection is kept without change .
Norway - 2003
Oil production commenced in 1971 and has grown steadily to just over 3 Mb/d. Some 16
Gb have been produced , which is close to half the total discovered .
Peak production was passed in 2001 ( barring any shortlived surge from new small developments ) , and will be followed by a relatively high decline of almost 7 % a year .
From 2004 to 2005 the depletion rate for Norway was actually 7 % .
Venezuela - 2006
On this basis , the depletion rate of Regular Conventional production stands at no more than 2 % , suggesting that even the present reserve assessment may be too generous .
It is here assumed that production can be held at 1.8 Mb/d until around say 2015 before a gentle decline sets in .
As already mentioned , the East Venezuela Basin has substantial reserves of Non-Conventional heavy oil , lying at depths of between 500 and 1500 m .(...)
Production commenced in 1990 and has risen to about 650 000 kb/d .
It is assumed here that production will be flat to 2015 rising thereafter at 3 % to peak in 2030 before declining at 2 % a year .
This projection is kept without change .
Iran - 2003
(...) production could in resource terms rise to a second peak in 2009 at almost 5 Mb/d before commencing its terminal decline at 2.6 % a year , but operational and investment constraints may prevent such a level being reached in practice , with 3 - 4 Mb/d peak being perhaps more likely .
Production rose to 4 Mb/d in 2004 and stalled beyond that .
Based on the same resource base this daily production could be maintained up to 2020 .
Like Saudi Arabia , Iran 's declared recoverable reserves ( 130 Gb ) have been under great criticism .
While Colin Campbell 's estimates sit around 70 Gb , Samsam Bakhtiari , a retired head - man of the Iranian Oil Company , declared this year that recoverable reserves stay around 40 Gb .
The projection here used can be considered fairly optimistic .
Abu Dhabi ( UAE ) - 2004
Oil production stands at 1.8 Mb/d , and is here assumed to remain flat at that level to the depletion midpoint in 2026 , declining at about 2 % a year thereafter to about 1 Mb/d by 2050 .
Assessment not available for states other than Abu Dhabi .
Production for UAE has in fact been flattening in the last years , making Colin Campbell 's assessment quite plausible .
Kuwait - 2004
Kuwait 's production is expected to rise from a present 1.8 Mb/d to a second peak ( depletion midpoint ) at 2.7 Mb/d in 2018 , before entering its terminal decline at about 2 % a year .
This projection is kept without change .
Mexico - 2003
Mexico is here assessed to be capable of producing a total of 50 Gb to 2075 , giving a midpoint of depletion in 1999 , some fourteen years after what appears to be a premature actual peak in 1985 .
Production now stands at about 3.2 Mb/d , being subject to a fairly high depletion rate of 5 % a year .
Mexico seems to have peaked only in 2004 , but the future decline rate is maintained .
Algeria - 2004
Production is currently running at 1 Mb/d , and is expected to rise to a peak of 1.4 Mb/d by 2006 at the midpoint of depletion , before falling to about 850 kb/d by 2020 and 300 kb/d by 2050 .
Algeria produces large amounts of LNG , reaching a total of 1.8 Mb/d for Liquids in 2003 and 2 Mb/d in 2005 .
Future production is modeled with Colin Campbell 's assessment ( 3 % annual decline ) for Conventional Oil plus a constant of 0.8 Mb/d for LNG .
Qatar - 2005
Conventional Oil Production 2004 0.78 Forecast 2010 0.53 Forecast 2020 0.27
The country has been exporting Liquefied Natural Gas for some time , and has plans to expand the capacity greatly , such that production is expected to rise to 1.4 Mb/d by 2011 , making it the world 's largest exporter .
Several gas - to - liquids plants are also being developed by Chevron / Sasol , Exxon , Shell and others , which are expected to yield 1 Mb/d in a few years ' time .
Petrochemical production , including the world 's largest ammonia - urea plant providing critical synthetic nutrients for agriculture , is also set to expand .
Productions rises of 9 % were experienced in last years , which should continue up to 2011 , beyond that an annual increase of 3.5 % is used .
Liquids :
2011 1.93
2020 2.67
Canada - 2004
[ Tar Sands ] production , including derivatives , is here estimated to rise from about 1 Mb/d today to a plateau at 2.6 Mb/d starting in 2020 , in a slow , labour - and capital - intensive process , also carrying environmental costs .
Canada seems to produce around 1 Mb/d of LNG , a figure likely to fall due to Natural Gas depletion .
Total liquids production is projected increasing around 2 % annum to 4.1 Mb/d in 2020 .
Malaysia - 2005
Production stands at 855 kb/d , which is believed to be the peak , being set to decline at about 6 % a year , which is typical of an offshore environment .
If so , production will have declined to about 570 kb/d in 2010 and 300 kb/d in 2020 .
Change rate from 2004 to 2005 was - 4.3 % ; since this was the first decline year , Colin Campbell 's 6 % seems quite reasonable .
Ecuador - 2003
Production now stands at about 400 kb/d , the capacity of the line .
The depletion peak has been accordingly somewhat delayed by the limits to export , not being expected until 2004 .
Production is likely to have fallen to about 250 kb/d by 2020 and 80 kb/d by 2050 .
From 2004 to 2005 production still increased by 1.1 % , which indicates a near term peak .
A new projection is made with a decline of 4 % to a liquids production of 290 kb/d by 2020 .
Argentina - 2003
Production peaked in 1998 declining to 750 kb/d in 2002 .
It means that Argentina will become a net importer by around 2010 assuming no increase in demand , which will no doubt further stress its economy and financial stability .
Decline rates have been erratic since 1998 , with a fall of 7 % from 2003 to 2004 being the highest .
Henceforth decline is modeled at 6 % per year decreasing production to 290 Kb/d by 2020 .
Colombia - 2006
Production , reflecting the two main discovery cycles , reached a peak of 816 kb/d in 1999 at the midpoint of depletion .
It has since declined to 520 kb/d giving a current depletion rate of just under 5 % a year .
Projection kept without change .
Denmark - 2004
Indigenous production peaked in 2002 and is set to decline at about 7 % a year .
A final peak was set in 2004 at 390 kb/d , with a decline of 3.3 % for the next year .
The 7 % figure is here used for it's a common number for offshore terminal declines .
Egypt - 2003
Production 2002 0.27 Forecast 2010 0.17 Forecast 2020 0.09 Current Depletion Rate 5.9 %
The country will become a net importer of oil within about five years as domestic production continues to fall .
There 's a big gap from Colin Campbell 's numbers to BP 's , almost 500 kb/d ; which most likely is LNG .
Depletion rate for Liquids is has been stable around 4 % , hence this is the figure used for projection .
United Kingdom - 2006
Current ( 2005 ) oil production of 1.8 Mb/d is set to decline at the current depletion rate of 7.5 % a year , meaning that it will have halved in ten years .
The days of UK as an oil exporter are already over .
Future Oil Consumption
This is an all but easy assessment , and is performed with some risks .
Unlike western importing countries , most of the analyzed countries experienced profound changes in consumption patterns since the turn of the century .
Future consumption is mainly obtained by projecting the change rates observed in the last years , especially since 2003 when higher oil prices started being felt .
There is a clear pattern in recent years of growing affluence in these exporting countries , which are mostly outside the wealthy importer blocs ( Europe , North America , Japan and Oceania ) .
The hardest question to answer is for how long will these countries continue in the soaring consumption growth path .
Saudi Arabia
After a period of slow growth during the years of low oil price , consumption in Saudi Arabia soured above 7 % during 2 years to settle down at 4.7 % in 2005 .
Future growth is modeled at 4 % annum .
Figure3 - Oil consumption and change rates in Saudi Arabia .
Russian Federation
Oil consumption has been steadily growing around 1.5 % / year , with 2004 being the exception with 2.6 % .
The increasing incomes from oil exports do not seem to affect much the country consumption ; the 1.5 % figure is kept .
Figure 4 - Oil consumption and change rates in the Russian Federation .
Kazakhstan
Erratic decline / growth through the last years makes projections difficult .
It is likely that the 2005 figure will be maintained for some time as the country experiences greater affluence as an oil exporter .
Future consumption growth is modeled as slowing down 1 % each year from 10 % to 5 % from which point it settles .
Figure 5 - Oil consumption and change rates in Kazakhstan .
Azerbaijan
After two spectacular declines in 2001 and 2002 , the country came back to life the next three years , going above 10 % in 2003 and 2005 .
Future growth is modeled has maintained at
10 % / year , for Azerbaijan is currently a somewhat undeveloped country .
Figure 6 - Oil consumption and change rates in Azerbaijan .
Rest of FSU
Consumption in the remaining countries is modeled as growing 2 % / year .
Norway
Consumption history yields years of growth alternating with years of decline ; still the mean since 2001 is positive .
Future consumption growth is modeled at 1.2 % / year .
Figure 7 - Oil consumption and change rates for Norway .
Venezuela
In the last 5 years 2003 was a clear outlier with a decrease of almost 20 % ; without this year the mean growth stands at 8 % / year .
2004 can be argued has a correction year from the previous crisis , but 2001 and 2002 had similar large numbers , thus 8 % is the figure used to project future growth .
Figure 8 - Oil consumption and change rates for Venezuela .
Iran
Steady growth since 2000 between 4 % and 7 % annum with 2001 a clear outlier .
The mean of these figures from 2000 to 2005 , barring 2001 , is 5.75 % which seems reasonable to project future growth .
Figure 9 - Oil consumption and change rates for Iran .
UAE
After a long period of decline , consumption growth came back strongly in 2001 .
From 2003 onwards growth rates are settling on the 5 - 6 % range .
The mean of these last 3 years , approximately 5.5 % , is thus used .
Figure 10 - Oil consumption and change rates for UAE .
Kuwait
Strong growth in the late nineties was followed by tow years of stillness ; from 2002 onwards growth picked up again with rates varying between 5 % and 10 % annum .
The mean rate of these last 4 years , 8 % is used for projection .
Figure 11 - Oil consumption and change rates for Kuwait .
Mexico
Since 2000 a trend of erratic slow growth is visible , with 2002 a clear outlier .
The mean of these figures since 2000 , and excluding 2002 , is 1.75 % and looks like a reasonable number for future growth .
Figure 12 - Oil consumption and change rates for Mexico .
Algeria
Steady growth in the range of 3 % to 6 % , with an outlying 11 % in 2002 .
The mean figure since 2000 without 2002 , 4 % , is thus used for future growth .
Figure 13 - Oil consumption and change rates for Algeria .
Qatar
A nation very hard to model , registering growth rates of 22 % for 2001 and 47 % for 2002 , followed by a 3 % decrease in 2003 , in turn followed by strong increases in 2004 and 2005 .
Oil production in the country will increase beyond 2020 , hence a high growth rate , circa 10 % , is quite probable .
Figure 14 - Oil consumption and change rates for Qatar .
Canada
After 4 years of growth with rates above 2 % , 2005 comes as the first year of declining consumption in a long time .
The mean figure for the 2001 - 2004 period is 3.8 % , probably a too higher number for a wealthy country .
Still oil production is projected to grow beyond 2020 , making likely future consumption growth , here set at around half of the 2001 - 2004 period .
Figure 15 - Oil consumption and change rates for Canada .
Malaysia
Growth years alternate with decline years in a nation already on terminal production decline .
Future consumption is modeled as decreasing 2 % / year ; still Malaysia will stop being an exporter before 2020 .
Figure 16 - Oil consumption and change rates for Malaysia .
Ecuador
After a decline in 2002 , growth came back in the following years staying above 3 % .
The mean of the last 3 years , approximately 4 % , is thus used .
Figure 17 - Oil consumption and change rates for Ecuador .
Argentina
As for many others not so wealthy exporters , a decline period is followed by strong growth from 2003 onwards .
Future growth is modeled at 5 % , reflecting the last three years .
Figure 18 - Oil consumption and change rates for Argentina .
Colombia
The country experienced shy consumption growth in the last 3 years , in spite of high decline rates in production .
Future production is projected as growing 1.5 % / year , a number close to the mean of the last 3 years .
Figure 19 - Oil consumption and change rates for Colombia .
Denmark
2005 seems to be an exceptional year for the country , the first where consumption did n't decline since 1996 .
The good student is projected as keeping up the good work and declining consumption 3 % / year , in line with the trend observed in the 2000 - 2004 period .
Such keeps Denmark as a marginal exporter through out 2020 .
Figure 20 - Oil consumption and change rates for Denmark .
Egypt
A country that illustrates perfectly the affluence growth in less wealthy oil exporters .
After 3 difficult years of decline , consumption gets back on track toping 8.5 % in 2005 .
The mean of these last 3 years , 5 % , is used for 2006 ; beyond that Egypt 's days as an exporter are over , and consumption will probably have to accommodate to the declines in production .
Figure 21 - Oil consumption and change rates for Egypt .
United Kingdom
Although experiencing a period of 3 years in a row with consumption growth above 1 % , UK is a card out of the set of exporters .
Figure 22 - Oil consumption and change rates for the United Kingdom .
Future Oil Exports
The final result can be observed in Figure 23 , obtained by subtracting the projected consumption from the projected production for each country .
Once a country stops being an exporter is thereafter left out of the total .
The countries leaving the exporters club are : United Kingdom in 2006 , Egypt in 2007 , Argentina in 2010 , Mexico in 2015 , Malaysia in 2019 and Colombia also in 2019 .
Figure 23 - Total
Oil exports from the assessed countries , including the projections for the 2006 - 2020 period .
The graph in Figure 23 depicts a very clear scenario : total exports from the assessed countries declines from hereafter , never recovering again .
The decline rate grows with time , as seen Figure 24 :
Figure 24 - Total
Oil exports and evolution rates for the assessed countries , including the projections for the 2006 - 2020 period .
The declines rates resulting from the projections made are never higher than those observed during the early 1980s , still in 15 years total oil exports decline almost 40 % from 36.2 Mb/d to 22.6 Mb/d .
This period ahead might not have much in common with the crisis lived in the 1970s and 1980s , but if economic recession takes over in importing countries , periods of heavy decline might happen , followed by periods of recovery .
It 's worth looking closely to this period in figure 25 .
Figure 25 - Decline rates in total oil exports for the assessed countries during the projected period , 2006 to 2020 .
Four different periods can be identified :
. 2006 - 2010 : slow decline below 2 % / year ;
. 2011 - 2013 : first acceleration to a decline rate close to 4 % / year ;
. 2014 - 2016 : steady decline at 4 % / year ;
. 2017 - 2020 : new acceleration up 5 % / year .
The first acceleration is probably the most critical period and follows the peak in world oil production .
The final years of the 2010s decade will present great challenges for oil importing nations .
Finally is worth mentioning that these four periods seem to fit on Samsam Bakhtiari 's Four Transitions of which the first started last year .
Important countries left out
There are three main countries for which consumption data is not available , hence not included in the calculations : Angola , Iraq [ ed ] and Nigeria .
For the last two even if the data existed projection would be difficult .
Both countries are experiencing serious social disturbances , Iraq is unfortunately undergoing what is technically a war , and in Nigeria social inequity is leading to rebellion from people to whom oil has only brought disadvantages .
Some sort of social transformation is to expect in the following years in these countries , hopefully towards more stable environments .
As for Angola the times of social unrest seem to be gone , although elections are yet to take place , the liberal opposition is now unarmed .
In 2003 the 5 million Angolans consumed little over 40 Kb/d .
Today that number is unknown but is surely much higher , perhaps several orders of magnitude , due to an explosion in the housing market , an to a sharp increase in population ( there are reports of 1 million Chinese living in Luanda alone ) .
The latest assessment made by Colin Campbell pushed the peak in Angola 's production back to 2011 ( from circa 2018 ) , more inline with other specialists ( e.g. Cramez ) .
The adding of future oil exports from Angola would not change much the overall picture , probably softening the decline rates before 2011 and augmenting them thereafter .
Still this is an oil exporting country worth assessing if consumption data can be found in the future .
Conclusions
This assessment should be taken " with a grain of salt " , it is not to be expected that the future will follow these projections .
But looking at these numbers , there some trends that clearly arise , the most important being a decline from 2005 onwards of the amount of oil coming to the market .
This situation is a consequence of consumption growth at higher pace than production in most of oil exporting countries .
Once the amount oil available for export becomes lower than the amount required by the importing countries costs start to rise , forcing an abnormal wealth transfer from buyers to sellers .
This newly acquired wealth will improve affluence in exporting countries , which in turn drives up internal consumption ( better automobiles , better and farther from center houses , more goods imports and transportation , etc ) .
This feedback loop will perpetuate itself until some event or constraint tackles consumption growth in the exporters ' side , or until the importers collapse from lack of new wealth to transfer .
The former is the most likely scenario .
For oil importing countries like EU these projections bring a worrisome conclusion : mitigation strategies for oil scarcity should have started taking effect in 2005 .
For this to happen , planning should have started in the late 1980s or early 1990s .
Although programs for liquid hydrocarbons replacement exist in the electric generation sector in the EU , US or Australia , none of these countries seems to have prepared to phase out oil in the transportation sector .
In the case of the EU it is also important to note the failure to plan an alternative to nuclear electric generation , an important energy source in some member states , since its stalling due to negative public opinion .
Finally another consequence must be observed : unfortunately , as laid down originally by Colin Campbell ( and further improved by the folks at PostCarbon and Rich Heinberg ) , the Oil Depletion Protocol may only function if exporting countries restrain their oil consumption .
Up to the Peak Oil epoch the Protocol can work if exporting countries match their consumption growth to the production , freezing the amount of oil coming on market .
After Peak
Oil these countries would have to decrease their internal consumption in order to mach the decline rate of world production with that of world consumption .
It is hard to envision less wealthy countries reducing their consumption in order to provide oil to wealthier countries .
Let 's just hope for the best .

An ice core about two miles long -- the oldest frozen sample ever drilled from the underbelly of Antarctica -- shows that at no time in the last 650,000 years have levels of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane been as high as they are today .
The research , published in today ’s issue of the journal Science , describes the content of the greenhouse gases within the core and shows that carbon dioxide levels today are 27 % higher than they have been in the last 650,000 years and levels of methane , an even more powerful greenhouse gas , are 130 % higher , said Thomas Stocker , a climate researcher at the University of Bern and senior member of the European team that wrote two papers based on the core .
The work provides more evidence that human activity since the Industrial Revolution has significantly altered the planet ’s climate system , scientists said .
“ This is saying , ‘ Yeah , we had it right . ’
We can pound on the table harder and say , ‘ This is real , ’ ” said Richard Alley , a Penn State University geophysicist and expert on ice cores who was not involved with the analysis .
Previous records , from an ice core drilled at the Russian Antarctic station Vostok , extended back 440,000 years .
Extracting and analyzing that core was a major achievement , but the core stopped short of a time period scientists are anxious to study because it was like today’s .

Climate scientists called the analysis of the older records spectacular because they were so clear and said they would become “ canonical ” additions to the climate record .
“ It ’s really important , ” Ed Brook , an ice core expert at Oregon State University said of the new research .
“ Those 200,000 years were a lot harder to get than the previous 400,000 -- and those were hard enough . ”
Ice cores are plugs drilled from glaciers and ice sheets .
They are composed of tens of thousands of layers of fallen snow and air bubbles compressed over time .
Ice cores are among the most powerful tools available to climate scientists .
The chemistry of the ice reveals temperatures from the distant past , while bubbles within the ice are minuscule time capsules that capture air and greenhouse gases as they existed hundreds of thousands of years ago .
The ice core was drilled by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica from a high plateau in East Antarctica called Dome C that rises about two miles above sea level .
It is one of the driest , coldest parts of the continent , where summer temperatures can fall to 50 degrees below zero .
Temperature records from the core were published in 2004 , and scientists have been waiting for an analysis of the core ’s gases .
The last time carbon dioxide levels were as high or higher than today was probably tens of millions of years ago , Alley said .
Over millions of years , carbon dioxide levels shift because of slow geological processes , such as weathering of rocks , swallowing of crust into subduction zones and the release of gases from volcanoes .
But these processes are much slower and more gradual than the current rapid increase of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels , Alley said .

Scientists are enthusiastic about the ice core because it includes about eight full glacial cycles .
The Vostok sample had four .
Glacial cycles occur roughly every 100,000 years and include long periods of cold , when ice ages occur , and brief , warm interglacial periods , such as the current one .
The cycles are controlled by shakes , wobbles and tilts in the Earth ’s orbit around the sun that determine the amount of sunlight falling on and warming the planet .
The Vostok core showed that warm interglacial periods lasted about 10,000 years .
Because the current temperate interglacial period has lasted about 12,000 years , many scientists had speculated that the planet was overdue for an ice age .
But the new core shows that the interglacial period of 440,000 years ago , when the Earth ’s position relative to the sun was similar to what it is today , lasted nearly 30,000 years and was not ended by natural decreases in carbon dioxide , Stocker said .
The work suggests that the next ice age is about 15,000 years away .
“ Anyone counting on an ice age to head off global warming , or hoping to justify human greenhouse - gas emissions as a useful attempt to head off the next ice age , will find no comfort in the ice - core record , ” Alley said .

The latest findings also run counter to a theory presented two years ago by William Ruddiman , a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia , that humans who lived five thousand or more years ago are responsible for delaying the next ice age because their activities -- forest clearing and rice growing -- started to raise greenhouse gas levels when they should have been naturally declining .
“ This claim can no longer be upheld , ” said Stocker , because the ice core shows greenhouse gases do not naturally decline after 10,000 years in the longer interglacial periods like today’s .
Scientists are eager to look further back into earth ’s climatic past .
About a million years ago , the earth shifted from ice age cycles that were 40,000 years long into cycles that were 100,000 years long .
This shift from a “ 40 K world to a 100 K world ” is a major mystery , said Oregon State ’s Brook , and will require a core that reaches deeper into the ice and much further back in time .
Brook is co-chairman of a joint European and American group that hopes to start drilling in coming years a core that could produce ice and bubbles that are 1.2 million to 1.5 million years old .
An important part of the Free Telephony Project is the idea of “ open hardware ” .
The hardware designs that are being developed are being placed in the public domain under the GPL .
As a business model , it ’s a bit of an experiment .
The technology being developed has very strong business possibilities – for example the ability to build a powerful IP - PBX for a couple of hundred dollars , much less than current IP - PBXes and even less than a low end analog PBX .
I have had to fend off several corporate dudes who wanted me to join them in ventures to make lots of money .
It ’s hard to turn them down but as I was not interested in “ closing ” the hardware they ran away fast .
This makes sense if you want to build a large business , you need “ secret sauce ” .
In other words : Intellectual Property ( IP ) .
What I would really like is some sponsors for my work who can work with the open hardware concept , but so far they all want to lock up the IP .
Which of course is the right thing to do if you want to make lots of money .
This has made me think through the concept of open hardware :
I think open software has been a good thing for the world , so I think open hardware is also good .
If closed IP makes a small amount of people a lot of money – does opening the IP make a moderate amount of money for a large amount of people ?
The latter seems a better outcome to me .
It also suggests that open hardware benefits small companies more than large ones .
I think the specific benefit of open hardware is lower R&D costs .
This is what is happening with my project – there is a small team of people designing DSP boards , BRI - ISDN hardware , doing Asterisk ports etc .
So far I would estimate about 5 man -years of hardware R&D I now have available for free .
If I like I can now re-use this open hardware in my local market , potentially without hurting the business of my co-developers .
There is a spirit of cooperation rather than competition .
A common perception is that “ if the hardware design is open , people will just copy it and put you out of business ” .
Well after some thought I disagree .
A business is much more than just the product design – for example you need support , capital , manufacture , service , and relationships with customers .
So even if the whole design is open , you can still build a nice little business ( but perhaps not a $ 100 M business ) .
You can also add proprietary components and build on the open technology , or focus on your local market .
My pet favourite – open hardware allows us to invent new business models , for example developing countries could build advanced telephone systems for cost price .
This is so much better than buying technology from a first - world profit - oriented business that must charge a 70 % mark up to cover their overheads .
This is the business model behind the one laptop per child project .
A $ 100 laptop is possible if u remove the overheads , use community input and sponsership for R&D and build volume .
Well a $ 100 IP - PBX is also possible .
Another benefit is that the hardware can be built locally ( remember the hardware design is free ) overcoming import tariff problems and building local industry .
Combining these elements means lots of people getting connected cheaply .
And that is a very good thing for the world .

We all know that countries like China , Singapore , North Korea , as well as organizations such as the U.S. military , the State of Kentucky , and various corporations , local school districts and public libraries censor their Internet users ’ web surfing .
Bennett Haselton of Peacefire has a solution he calls the Circumventor .
And to bring in more Circumventor users , Peacefire is paying $ 10 per IP address to anyone who installs the anti-censorship software and leaves it running for at least a week .
Circumventor is a simple piece of software based on James Marshall ’s CGIProxy script running under ActiveState Perl and the OpenSA web server on Windows 2000 or XP .
( No word on whether it runs on Windows Vista , but I suspect it would . )
Once installed , the Circumventor creates a small Web service for which Peacefire then shares its URL with “ people who need them , such as people serving in the U.S. military overseas , and victims of totalitarian dictatorships such as China , North Korea , and high school , ” Haselton wrote on the Peacefire Web site .
It usually takes three or four days before Web filtering companies and national governments add new URLs to their blocking lists , Haselton said .
To get paid , you simply install the Circumventor software :
Download ActivePerl and install it .
It must be installed to C: Perl ( this should be the default ) .
Accept all of the default options .
Download OpenSA 2.0.2 beta and install it .
Accept all of the default options .
( If you get to a screen titled “ Server Information ” and it does n’t have values filled in for “ Network Domain ” , “ Server Name ” and “ Administrator ’s Email Address ” , just fill in these boxes with made - up random values — the Circumventor does n’t use them . )
Download the circumventor - setup.exe program and pick “ Save ” — then once you have saved it on your computer , run the circumventor - setup .
exe file that you saved .
Note that even if you have more than one computer in your home , you can only install it on one computer per external IP address ( the address assigned by your ISP ) , you need a broadband connection where the IP address will remain the same for at least a week , and you may need to forward port 443 from your cable or DSL modem ’s firewall to your computer .
Once you ’ve installed it , e-mail bennett@peacefire.org with the URLs of the Circumventor scripts , which the program gives you during setup .
After they ’ve been up a week , he ’ll send you $ 10 via PayPal or mail you a check .
And you ’ll be helping people in less free countries bypass their national censorship filters , as well as helping U.S. servicemembers bypass their censorship filters .
( Hat tip : Electronic Frontier Foundation )
If someone is convicted of a crime and dies before exhausting all his appeals , is he innocent ?
That 's the question now challenging federal prosecutors in the latest twist of the Enron case .
A legal precedent could clear the record of Enron founder Kenneth Lay , even though he was found guilty of six counts of conspiracy and fraud , because of his sudden death last month .
The move could also make tens of millions of dollars in his estate off - limits to creditors .
The Justice Department has said it will use all available legal means to reclaim the money related to the criminal charges Mr. Lay was convicted of in May .
But those means may be few because of the legal precedent set by the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , which found in 2004 that a person 's criminal record is " abated , " or wiped out , if he or she dies before having a chance to exhaust all appeals .
The rationale is that someone convicted of a crime should not be denied the right to have the trial 's fairness tested , says Brian Wice , a Houston attorney .
In this case , it means Lay 's conviction , trial , even his indictment will most likely be abated – making him an innocent man .
The lawyer handling Lay 's estate has already filed a motion with US District Judge Sim Lake , asking him to erase Lay 's criminal record , based on the ruling by the Fifth Circuit , which governors federal courts in Texas .
That may be hard for the public to take , says Ross Albert , an Atlanta lawyer formerly with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
" There is a presumption of innocence that comes before every conviction .
But Ken Lay , at the time he died , was not presumed to be innocent , " says Mr. Albert , who believes the Fifth Circuit is " zealously " protecting the prerogative of the appeals court even though well over 80 percent of all criminal appeals are denied .
Courts do not see eye to eye on the issue of abatement .
Just last week , for instance , the Washington State Supreme Court held that convictions will no longer be vacated when a defendant dies during appeal .
The issue is ripe for US Supreme Court review , but it 's unlikely that federal prosecutors , known as the Enron Task Force , will take it that far , experts agree .
US to fight abatement but is unlikely to win
Prosecutors have indicated that they will file a motion opposing the request for abatement , but that would require Judge Lake going against legal precedent – something that most agree is highly unlikely .
In going after Lay 's money , " it 's back to square one for the government , " says Mr. Wice .
It can sue either Lay 's estate in a civil asset - forfeiture case or his wife , Linda Lay , as the executor of the will .
Experts agree that a civil - forfeiture suit is the most likely course of action , given the fact that Mrs.
Lay was never charged with a crime and would be a very sympathetic witness .
" But a civil - forfeiture case is going to be very time - consuming and expensive , " says David Smith , an Alexandria , Va. , lawyer and expert in such cases .
" You would essentially have to redo the entire criminal case .
And because civil discovery is much broader , the case could drag on for years . "
What 's most likely to happen , these experts say , is that the government will settle with Lay 's estate – something that occurs in the vast majority of civil suits .
But others are clamoring for a share as well .
" There is a long line of civil claimants on the Lay money .
So there are all kinds of other ways beyond the criminal case to get that money , " says Samuel Buell , a former federal prosecutor on the Enron Task Force who now teaches law at Washington University in St. Louis .
" But the longer it takes to get , by virtue of inflation and legal fees , the less there is at the end . "
Lay 's estate moves to settle suits
Late last week , it appeared that the Lay family was ready to put the litigation behind it .
In a civil case brought by employees , lawyers said they were within days of coming to terms with the Lay estate on a settlement over the company 's inadequacy in diversifying its retirement plan .
Depending on the sum , that could make the government 's settlement plans moot – especially since Lay claimed at trial to have been financially wiped out when Enron 's stock became worthless .
Indeed , the Enron Task Force indicated after Lay 's death that it will try to hold Jeffrey Skilling , Enron 's ex-CEO , accountable for the full amount of restitution .
He was found guilty of 19 of the 28 counts he faced .
Prosecutors had initially asked for $ 139.3 million from Mr. Skilling and $ 43.5 million from Lay .
Now , they are asking Skilling to pay the entire $ 182.8 million , based on the conspiracy charge , which says anyone involved can be held responsible for 100 percent of the restitution .
In any case , Lay was being asked to forfeit only a tiny fraction of all the money that was lost when Enron collapsed , says Professor Buell .
He sees the government 's actions as mostly symbolic at this point and says that even if the judge vacates Lay 's conviction , it does n't speak to the merits of the case against him .
No matter the outcome , says Wice , " he 's guilty as sin in the public 's eye .
Try convincing the people in this town otherwise . "

Editor 's note from Oskar K. Tannenbaum , PhD .
What follows is the last known recorded work of Anthony F. , shortly before his disappearence on March 15th , 2006 .
Researches speculate that Mr. F succombed to his unfortunate habit of overscheduling himself and committing his time to too many people , and left his final words of guidance for mankind on the eve of what he understood to be a potentially permanent descent into madness .
However , experts are , as of yet , uncertain of the true intent behind this piece - its sheer randomness undermines any pretense of a definitive final summary of his prescriptions for humanity .
In fact , we at Free University of Berlin are hesitant to even label this piece as " authentic . "
Thus , the reader should proceed with caution and realistic expectations .

Rudy Ray Moore is a cinematic artist like none other .
His artistic credits include : where Mr. Moore plays a pimp whose " hoes " know Kung Fu and use it to clean up the streetswhere Mr. Moore plays Tucker , a retired cop -turned - disco DJ - turned vigilante when his nephew picks up an addiction to P.C.P.
For the money that Sting spent on penile enhancement surgery , or the money that Axl Rose stuffed into the G - strings of Brazilian pole - dancers , Rudy Ray Moore could have made more than two - dozen movies about kung - fu prostitutes ( but I 'm not one to romanticize what might have been ) ... When the trucker - style mesh baseball cap becomes part of the uniform , it 's no longer " ironic " ( as everyone now knows , since we 've set the record straight on THAT issue ) .
Pabst Blue Ribbon still sucks - it has sucked ever since the long bygone days when it was the official beverage of the actual , honest - to - god American working class .
Drinking it thus CANNOT make you cool .
No one , anywhere , at anytime , is allowed to use the increasingly cold temperatures that we 're witnessing during wintertime as proof against global warming .
It is irrefutably true that the average temperatures on Earth have increased .
It is also irrefutable that both the arctic and antarctic icecaps have been steadily shrinking .
Warmer temperatures mean that more ice is falling into the ocean , and thus temporarily cooling the waters that reach North America .
Furthermore , since more moisture is being evaporated into the atmosphere , a greater amount of precipitation in the winter is to be expected .
Thus , unusually cool winters DO NOT UNDERMINE GLOBAL WARMING .
You are still free to disagree on whether there is in fact global warming if you really insist .
HOWEVER : no one is allowed to cite cold days during the winter as evidence of this view ( ever .... I mean it , not ever ) .
I apologize in advance for the canned summary of Constitutional Law I that is necessary for a full explanation of why George W. Bush is a threat to the very fabric of American government .
Article II of the Constitution clearly states that the only powers that the president of the United States has are those " necessary and proper " to " faithfully execute " the laws passed by congress .
This was pointed out in the Supreme Court 's holding in , where Harry Truman attempted to seize American steel mills to keep them producing war materials for use in Korea while the workers striked .
Any " inherrent " powers the executive branch has but that remain unlisted in the Constitution are exclusively in the realm of foriegn relations - the President is in fact the only branch of government vested with powers in the international sphere , and certain powers must be inherrent to any " head of state .
" Thus , when the text of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act specifically forbids eavesdropping on the private communications between people in the United States , the President has now power to do anything but " faithfully execute " this law .
Thus , Bush 's eavesdropping on suspicious - looking Arab - American citizens and members of P.E.T.A. cannot be justified under any half - cocked bullshit about executive power .
Do you enjoy electricity ?
Jet engines ?
Semi-conductors ?
Thank the scientific method .
Almost all of the technological progress that mankind has enjoyed has taken place in the past 300 years .
This is thanks to a system of thought that focuses only on natural explanations for phenomenon in the world around us that survive numerous tests and retests .
The " theory " of evolution was also derived from this same marvelous mode of thought .
However , let us define our terminology : technically , evolution is in fact only a " theory . "
However , " gravity " to this day is referred to as Newton 's Theory of Gravitation .
EVERYTHING in science is a theory , since the only proof that scientists rely upon for formulating their beliefs are PAST observations of PAST events .
However , take comfort in the fact that this minor technicality does nothing to impair the " truth " of scientific observations the next time you use a USB flash drive ; everytime you plug one in , you are single - handedly proving the truth of Quantum Mechanics .
Thus , no true scientific theory would look at the complexity of the world around us , throw up its hands and say , " It's SO COMPLEX !
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT !
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SPOOKY INVISIBLE FATHER FIGURE LIVING IN THE SKY WHO CREATED IT .
" This is not to say that there might not be some sort of creator - however , calling the belief in such a being " science " is anathema to the very underpinnings of our civilization as we know it .
In sum - you are free to believe in it .
However , you 're not allowed to call it " science . "
Ever.HUGS !!!

Fun Facts about Mt. St. Helens
In 1947 , a local logger discovered Ape Cave when his truck fell into a sinkhole that led to the lava tube cave .
The first explorations were done by a Boy Scout troop in 1950 , and they named the cave for their sponsor ; a group of loggers and foresters called the St Helens Apes .
Harry Randall Truman ( born in 1896 ) died in the 1980 Mt St Helens eruption when he famously and stubbornly refused to leave his beloved Mt St Helens Lodge on the shore of Spirit Lake .
It ’s presumed that his sixteen cats perished with him .
All other lodges and four campsites around Spirit Lake were also destroyed in the eruption , and 56 people other than Truman also perished .
Mt St Helens Summit can only be reached on foot .
Although no technical skills are required , it is a rugged trek on steep and uneven trails often requiring scrambles over rough volcanic rocks .
You need to be in good physical condition , prepared for mountain wilderness conditions , changeable weather ( including snow before mid-summer ) and in possession of a permit .
It takes from six to twelve hours to hike in and back out again over a distance of almost ten miles .
The trek is well worth the effort , as the scenery is beautiful and the panorama from the summit provides superb views of the 1980 blast area and crater , the cone , lava dome , and surrounding mountains and forest .
Spirit Lake
Spirit Lake
Once a crystal clear mountain lake popular with outdoor enthusiasts , Spirit Lake was devastated by the 1980 eruption .
The debris from the landslide caused by the eruption increased the size of the lake almost two - fold and reduced its depth by the same amount .
The surface was covered with thousands of tree trunks ripped out of the ground .
Lava and volcanic gases eliminated all oxygen from the water , essentially killing the lake and all life within it .
Scientists predicted the lake would never recover , but today it is on the road to recovery .
Ape Cave
Ape Cave
Ape Cave is located within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest .
It is a volcanic lava tube , unusual in the Cascades Mountain Range .
It is the longest continuous lava tube in the continental United States , but there are longer ones in Hawaii .
There is a Forest Service Interpretive Center near its entrance where you can rent lanterns and book guided walks during the summer months .
Dress warmly , as the temperatures never go higher than 42 degrees Fahrenheit , wear sturdy non-slip shoes , and have at least two light sources per person .
Johnston Ridge Observatory
Johnston Ridge Observatory
This observatory and interpretive center is located at the end of State Highway 504 in the very heart of the blast zone .
It contains a fascinating collection of information on the volcano , the 1980 eruption , and harrowing first - hand stories from survivors and eyewitnesses .
This area provides the best views of the mountain that you will get without climbing it !
Must See Sights
Gifford Pinchot National Forest surrounds
Mt St Helens , and is a wonderful natural area with hiking , camping , cycling , mountain biking , fishing , and other outdoor activities .
Lava Canyon is a beautiful canyon on Mt St Helens .
After the 1980 eruption , a suspension bridge was built precipitously over the canyon and the spectacular falls below .
It leads to a hiking trail over the area devastated by the eruption .

Rationalization is something we all do ( often daily ) when confronted with events that go against our plans and desires .
The process is simple .
We take a complex event , replete with unknowns , and put it into a framework where everything makes sense to us .
The usual output of this process is " if only we had ( or not ) done this or that ... " or " if we had taken this approach ( substitute your pet theory here ) things would have turned out grand . "
We are now at the start of a long process of rationalization over the US defeat in Iraq .
The most common of these rationalizations include : if only we had " ... not disbanded the Baathist army , " " ... sent in more troops , " or " ... become better at nation - building . "
However , in each case the approach is one dimensional , since we tend to view ourselves as the only actors on the stage .
The actions and reactions of the opposition are discounted and explained away as fluff and background noise ( those pesky terrorists ... ) .
A better , and more sane approach , is to embrace the concept that war is a conflict of minds .
There are two sides .
For every change in approach there will be counters mounted by the opposition .
In the case of Iraq , that opposition was extremely difficult to beat since it was organized along the lines of open source warfare .
This organizational structure gave it a level of innovation , resilience , and flexibility that made it a very effective opponent .
Given this , the simplest explanation for the outcome in Iraq is that we were just beaten by a better opponent ( the Israeli 's seem to be getting this , why can't we ? ) .
The real question we should be asking ourselves is whether or not our maximalist goals in Iraq could ever have been achieved given the capabilities of the opposition and the limited levels of commitment we were able to bring to to bear on the problem .
I suspect the answer is no .
The goals did n't match our capabilities and there were n't any simple tweaks to our strategy that would have changed the outcome .
This was a difficult way to learn this lesson , but given our tendency towards rationalization , I doubt that it will be learned at all .
New Orleans will force evacuations
Superdome , refuge for thousands , may be torn down
NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) -- New Orleans ' mayor ordered law enforcement agencies Tuesday night to remove everyone from the city who is not involved in cleaning up after Hurricane Katrina , whether they want to go or not .
Mayor Ray Nagin instructed all public safety officers " to compel the evacuation of all persons ... regardless of whether such persons are on private property or do not desire to leave , " according to a written statement from his office .
The order did not apply to people in Algiers on the West Bank side of Orleans Parish .
Many residents have refused to leave New Orleans despite a mandatory evacuation and warnings from government officials that staying in the flooded city represents a health risk .
In Washington , White House and congressional sources said Tuesday that the Bush administration plans to ask Congress for $ 30 billion to $ 50 billion to aid in the next phase of the recovery effort .
( Watch a report on the storm 's political fallout -- 2:09 )
The request , which would add to the $ 10.5 billion already approved , will be made as early as Wednesday , they said .
House hearings examining the government 's response to Katrina were canceled by Republican leaders who instead want a still unspecified " congressional review " by a joint House and Senate panel , Majority Leader Tom DeLay , a Texas Republican , said late Tuesday .
That development followed a busy day in the capital , with lawmakers from both parties criticizing the governmental response and vowing to investigate .
Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins , a Maine Republican , told reporters that " governments at all levels failed . "
President Bush met with his Cabinet to discuss the relief efforts , saying he would be leading an inquiry and would be sending Vice President Dick Cheney to the region .
( Full story )
Gen . Richard Myers , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters that the military had 58,000 troops in the region by Tuesday , including 41,000 from the National Guard and 17,000 active - duty personnel .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the deployment would not hamper the military 's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" We have the forces , the capabilities and the intention to fully prosecute the global war on terror while responding to this unprecedented humanitarian crisis here at home , " he told reporters .
Holding out
Rescue workers say many holdouts have insisted on staying in their homes or makeshift residences rather than obey the mandatory evacuation order Nagin first put into effect on August 28 , the day before Katrina crashed ashore .
( See video on people who refuse to leave -- 2:51 )
Some said they were concerned about their property being looted , while others were unaware of disaster 's full extent , worried about their pets or concerned that conditions would be even worse in shelters .
The standing water in New Orleans is contaminated with E. coli bacteria , a highly placed official in the New Orleans mayor 's office told CNN on Tuesday .
U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona said conditions in the city are " really unsafe at this point . "
( Full story )
The city 's deputy police chief , Warren Riley , said Monday the holdouts numbered in the thousands .
Nagin told reporters
Tuesday he wanted everyone out of the city " because it 's a health risk . "
" These citizens will have to be removed for their own good , " Police Superintendent Eddie Compass told CNN .
The mayor also fiercely denied rumors that he had ordered relief workers to stop delivering water to those who refused to evacuate .
The toxic nature of the water is evident from the smell of garbage , human waste and rotting corpses , and the slick sheen of oil , gasoline and other chemicals on the surface .
" I understand wanting to stay in their homes , not wanting to give up on New Orleans , " Nagin said .
" But we have a very volatile situation .
There 's lots of oil on the water , gas leaks where it 's bubbling up , and there 's fire on top . "
Nagin said he wanted to reassure the holdouts that it was " OK " to evacuate .
" Leave for a little while .
Let us get you to a better place , and let us clean it up , " he said .
Nagin said most of the survivors that rescuers are finding now are elderly and in desperate need of emergency medical care .
Aftermath widespread
The disaster area left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina covers the Gulf Coast from southeast Louisiana to Mobile , Alabama -- and at least 150 miles inland .
The storm crushed houses , leaving some towns little more than wood piles .
The storm surge along the Mississippi coast reached more than 20 feet in some areas and knocked out power for most of the state as a diminishing Katrina continued its destructive trail northward last week .
Tuesday , more than 350,000 customers were still without electricity .
All but one of Mississippi 's major highways have reopened .
Other states were shouldering some of the burden by taking in evacuees and sending crews to help in search - and - recovery , cleanup or shelter operations .
The Louisiana Superdome was so heavily damaged during Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath that it likely will have to be torn down , a disaster official working with the governor 's office told CNN .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the initial assessment of the famed dome indicated the damage is " more significant than initially thought . "
Katrina sheared away much of the roof 's covering , and rainwater began leaking into the stadium when it was being used as a shelter of last resort for thousands of residents stranded by the storm .
The Superdome is the home of the New Orleans Saints professional football team .
The NFL season begins this weekend , and it is not clear where the Saints will play .
Slow drain
Two operational pumping stations are lowering the water levels , Nagin said , but water still covers about 60 percent of the city .
" I saw water levels drop significantly in certain areas of the city , " the mayor said Tuesday after a flyover .
" I 'm starting to see rays of light all throughout what we are doing , " he said .
" We are starting to accumulate accomplishments . "
The Army Corps of Engineers estimated it would take between 24 and 80 days to pump floodwater out of New Orleans and its surrounding parishes , much of which are below sea level .
Even with all that water , firefighting was difficult .
Fire Chief Charles
Parent said the city was being hit with " several large fires a day , " including four Tuesday .
Water to fight fires comes from helicopters snagging bucket - loads from lakes and canals , and also from the West Bank of the Mississippi River , where the hydrant system still works .
There , firefighters fill giant tankers and drive them to the fires .
( Watch video of aerial water drops -- 3:49 )
" Fires are getting a good head start on us because of delays in detection , " Parent said .
" There 's nobody out there to call 911 , and once somebody does see it there 's no 911 system . "
Nagin said Tuesday that officials hoped to give the city running water again " in a day or so , " but cautioned that it would have to be boiled .
Meanwhile , search - and - rescue teams encountered the living and the dead out on the fetid waters .
Jennings Ewing , the leader of a team from the Texas General Land Office , told CNN that many of the " stragglers " who want to stay in the city think the water will " go down in two or three days . "
Electricity is slowly coming back online , said Entergy New Orleans executive Dan Pack .
Other developments
Public schools in New Orleans and neighboring St. Bernard Parish may be shut down for the entire school year due to damage from Hurricane Katrina , Louisiana 's Superintendent of Education Cecil Picard said Tuesday .
Many students whose families evacuated have begun to register for schools in other states or other parts of Louisiana , he said .
With the National Flood Insurance Program expected to pay out billions of dollars in claims to cover the flood damage in Louisiana and other hard - hit states , homeowners that are suddenly interested in the extra protection may be forced to pay more for coverage .

Correction Appended
“ It ’s time we got teenage girls reading comics , ” said Karen Berger , a senior vice president at DC Comics .
And DC , the comics powerhouse best known as home to Superman and Batman , has a program to make that happen .
In May , DC plans to introduce Minx , a line of graphic novels aimed at young adult female readers , starting with six titles in 2007 , each retailing for less than $ 10 .
The stories will be far removed from the superheroes who more typically appeal to young males .
They include “ Clubbing , ” about a London party girl who solves a mystery ; “ Re- Gifters , ” about a Korean - American teenager in California who enjoys martial arts ; and “ Good as Lily , ” about a young woman who meets three versions of herself at different ages .
Teenage girls , Ms. Berger said , are smart and sophisticated and “ about more than going out with the cute guy .
This line of books gives them something to read that honors that intelligence and assertiveness and that individuality . ”
As a whole , the line is positioned as an alternative for teenage girls who have , especially in bookstores , become increasing smitten with the Japanese comics known as manga .
In 2004 , DC started CMX , a manga imprint , to capture part of that audience .
The marketing then was similar to that used for DC ’s other titles .
Groupware Bad

" How will this software get my users laid ? " Stop .
Please just stop quoting that .
Staaaahhhhhp .
Greetings , people of the future !
This piece has gotten a lot of attention over the years .
I have heard a lot of people saying that they had been " inspired " by it .
I fear that what they meant was that they were inspired by the one pull - quote that people tend to quote from it , and ignored the rest .
So if someone has linked you to this page , or if you 've googled that pull - quote and ended up here , let me give you some context .
I wrote this in 2005 , which was more than a year before Facebook was open to the general public .
The world was different then .
When I hear people say that they were " inspired " by this , I fear that the result of such inspiration was most likely to cause them to participate in the construction of the Public - Private Surveillance Partnership .
These people told themselves that they were building tools to " bring people together " when in fact what they were doing was constructing and enabling the information - broker business models used by companies like Facebook and Equifax , where people are not the customers but rather are the raw materials whose personal details are the product .
I was talking about decentralization and empowerment of the individual .
They went and build the exact opposite .
It 's not a great feeling to think that someone may have read your words and then gone on to construct the dystopian hellscape that we 're now living in , where Twitter is the prime enabler of actual Nazis and Facebook 's greatest accomplishment has been to put a racist rapist in the White House .
If all the people who claimed to have been " inspired " by this piece had n't been , and had just kept writing middleware for banks or whatever , the world might have been a slightly better place .
I wish I had never published this .

Today
Nat announced this new calendar server project called Hula , and I 've got a funny story about that .
Nat was in town , and he stopped by to say hi and chat , and he said , " So we 've got this big pile of code we 're going to release , and we 're going to build an open source groupware system !
It 's going to be awesome ! "
And I said , " Jesus Mother of Fuck , what are you thinking !
Do not strap the ' Groupware ' albatross around your neck !
That 's what killed Netscape , are you insane ? "
He looked at me like I 'd just kicked his puppy .
Groupware BAD
See , there were essentially two things that killed Netscape ( and the real answer is book length , so I 'm simplifying greatly , but )
The one that got most of the press was Microsoft 's illegal use of their monopoly in one market ( operating systems ) to destroy an existing market ( web browsers ) by driving the market price for browsers to zero , instantaneously eliminating something like 60 % of Netscape 's revenue .
Which was , you know , bad .
But the other one is that Netscape 4 was a really crappy product .
We had built this really nice entry - level mail reader in Netscape 2.0 , and it was a smashing success .
Our punishment for that success was that management saw this general - purpose mail reader and said , " since this mail reader is popular with normal people , we must now pimp it out to ` The Enterprise ' , call it Groupware , and try to compete with Lotus Notes ! "
To do this , they bought a company called Collabra who had tried ( and , mostly , failed ) to do something similar to what we had accomplished .
They bought this company and spliced 4 layers of management in above us .
Somehow , Collabra managed to completely take control of Netscape : it was like Netscape had gotten acquired instead of the other way around .
And then they went off into the weeds so badly that the Collabra - driven " 3.0 " release was obviously going to be so mind - blowingly late that " 2.1 " became " 3.0 " and " 3.0 " became " 4.0 " .
( So yeah , 3.0 did n't just seem like the bugfix patch - release for 2.0 : it was . )
Now the problem here is that the product 's direction changed utterly .
Our focus in the client group had always been to build products and features that people wanted to use .
That we wanted to use .
That our moms wanted to use .
" Groupware " is all about things like " workflow " , which means , " the chairman of the committee has emailed me this checklist , and I 'm done with item 3 , so I want to check off item 3 , so this document must be sent back to my supervisor to approve the fact that item 3 is changing from `unchecked ' to `checked ' , and once he does that , it can be directed back to committee for review . "
Nobody cares about that shit .
Nobody you 'd want to talk to , anyway .
Users GOOD
If you want to do something that 's going to change the world , build software that people want to use instead of software that managers want to buy .
When words like " groupware " and " enterprise " start getting tossed around , you 're doing the latter .
You start adding features to satisfy line - items on some checklist that was constructed by interminable committee meetings among bureaucrats , and you 're coding toward an externally - dictated product specification that maybe some company will want to buy a hundred " seats " of , but that nobody will ever love .
With that kind of motivation , nobody will ever find it sexy .
It wo n't make anyone happy .
Ok , I said it was a funny story , but obviously that 's not the funny part , unless sad is funny .
Anyway , I babbled at Nat along these lines for a while , predicting that , while I was sure that anyone he talked to in a corporation would tell him , " free groupware , yes , awesome ! " , there was really no reason to even bother releasing something like that as open source , because there was going to be absolutely no buy - in from the " itch - scratching " crowd .
With a product like that , there was going to be no teenager in his basement hacking on it just because it was cool , or because it doing so made his life easier .
Maybe IBM would throw some bucks at a developer or two to help out with it , because it might be cheaper to pay someone to write software than to just buy it off the shelf .
But with a groupware product , nobody would ever work on it unless they were getting paid to , because it 's just fundamentally not interesting to individuals .
So I said , narrow the focus .
Your " use case " should be , there 's a 22 year old college student living in the dorms .
How will this software get him laid ?
That got me a look like I had just sprouted a third head , but bear with me , because I think that it 's not only crude but insightful .
" How will this software get my users laid " should be on the minds of anyone writing social software ( and these days , almost all software is social software ) .
" Social software " is about making it easy for people to do other things that make them happy : meeting , communicating , and hooking up .
Calendars USEFUL
I said , instead of trying to build some all - singing all - dancing " collaboration server " where you 're going to throw in all kinds of ridiculous line items like bulletin boards and task tracking and other shit , let 's suppose you narrow your focus to just calendars .
The first thing you want to do is make it trivially easy for someone to publish their calendar , allowing other people to check their schedule ( and , for example , know when our target user has classes , when he 's planning on studying at a cafe , what nights he 's thinking of going to a movie , and what concerts he intends on seeing ) .
Right now people can do that by publishing .ics files , but it 's not trivial to do so , and it 's work on the part of other people to look at them .
If it 's not HTML hanging off our friend 's home page that can be viewed in any browser on a public terminal in a library , the bar to entry is too high and it 's useless .
Then the next thing you want is an invitation manager like Evite but that does n't suck .
Evite sucks because they 're spammers , and because it 's more important to them to put advertising in front of your eyeballs than to be useful , so the mail they send out does n't actually include any information , in a lame - assed attempt to drive hits to their web site .
So what you want next is a free replacement for Evite -- but more to the point , one that does n't require any kind of server running anywhere .
And if it does n't work with webmail , you 've lost before you 've even begun , so do n't do something dumb like requiring a plugin .
The trick you want to accomplish is that when one person is using your software , it suddenly provides value to that person and their entire circle of friends , without the friends having had to do anything at all .
Then , later , you pull the friends into the fold : if one of them starts using the software , they become their own hub , and get the benefit they have already witnessed from a distance .
And then Nat went back to whichever flyover state Novell is in , and a few days later he said to me , " wow , you really bummed me out , because the dozen other people I had talked to before you were all like , `a free groupware system , that 's an awesome idea ! '
Then you depressed me , and I came back here and told the other guys what you had said , and they were all , ` Oh , fuck .
He 's right . ' "
Wait , was there a funny part ?
Ok , maybe not .
Nevermind .
burning hypocrisy .
© 2002 , 2003 Jamie Zawinski < jwz@jwz.org >
The hypocrisy of the Burning Man Organization pisses me off .
For those of you who do n't know , Burning Man is this giant festival out in the middle of the desert where people build gigantic art installations , and then burn them at the end of the week .
It 's held on a dry lake bed , which is an incredibly hostile and unforgiving natural environment .
The week before Labor Day , a city of 30,000 + crazy people springs up overnight , and then vanishes .
It 's really pretty neat .
However , the corporation that owns and controls the event is incredibly hypocritical .
So much so that I wo n't give them my money any more .
I went to the event for three consecutive years .
In 2001 , my friend rzr_grl registered as a " pro photographer " .
You see , the Burning Man Corporation allows " personal use " photography , but if you are a " professional " ( whatever that means ) , or if you record video even for personal use , they insist that you register with them .
And so , she got to see a copy of the printed Burning Man Media Kit , which , taken in conjunction with the contract they make photographers sign , was possibly the most hypocritical pairing I 've seen .
The Burning Man organization presents itself as this spontaneous community effort , with everybody sharing and nobody in charge , and yet , their legal attitude is , " if you take a photo on the playa , we own it , and get to tell you when and where and how it can be published .
Even if you take that photo of yourself , inside your tent , surrounded by your own stuff . "
The best part : they also demand a whopping ten percent of any profit you make on your photos !
Plus , they also demand that you send them a copy of all photos you take , and they claim the right to use them however they like , without paying you .
They get complete editorial control over your work ; the contract even says
the project will contain no images of nudity , sexual activity , the use of drugs
because of course there is no nudity at Burning Man !
That there is no sex and drugs goes without saying .
Now , restrictions like this are not , of themselves , necessarily bad things -- they all just a matter of contract .
I have no problem with contracts entered into freely by both parties .
When you buy the ticket , and you camp on the land they rented , you submit to their rules , and their rules consist of a Disney - like protection of their " brand " .
They try to protect the image of " Burning Man " in as structured and proprietary a way as Disney protects The Mouse : you would not be surprised if Disney demanded the same kind of submission the part of any press who took photos inside Disneyland .
But the thing that yanks my chain is that they do all this -- they give you a straight - up totally one sided work - for - hire contract that essentially says , " if you are a photographer , and you are at the Burning Man event , then you are our employee and we own all your work " -- and they try to soften the blow by accompanying it with a smarmy press kit that re-states the terms of the contract in this totally weaselly way : they go on at length about how they are viciously protecting their brand for your own good .
And every other paragraph says stuff like " Larry Harvey -- dare we say it -- a Genius ... "
It is to gag .
They 're taking a totally standard , normal , corporate line toward their theme park -- but that idea embarrasses them ( they do n't like to think of it as a theme park . )
So they cloak it in bullshit and hope that everyone will buy the lie that it 's actually some spontaneous group - hug , and not a theme park .
Here 's just one example of how they fail to live up to their own press :
After you 've paid your $ 200 to $ 300 to enter the park , money is prohibited throughout Burning Man .
They like to think of it as a " gift economy " .
However , the Burning Man Corporation runs a cafe at " center camp " where you can buy drinks and snacks with good old US Currency .
This is the only place that is allowed .
Why ?
Because they need to " recoup their costs " on the construction of the tent , and on all that coffee .
Why does n't this same logic apply to everyone else ?
There are a lot of participants who sink a huge amount of time , effort , and material into building their camps , and yet , they are prohibited from selling anything , even if only to " recoup costs . "
Why ?
Because the Burning Man Corporation made the rules , and so they get to apply different rules to themselves , even about such fundamental ideological issues .
I think someone should do Capitalism Camp : the theme of the camp will be to trade US Currency for Goods and Services .
If anyone complains , tell them , " Dude , radical self - indulgence !
Stop harshing my mellow ! "
But I do n't , really ; I think the noncommercial nature of Burning Man is one of the more interesting parts of it .
I use this as an example of where the corporation chooses to play by totally different rules than anyone else when it suits them , even on something as fundamental to their ( purported ) philosophy as this .
Now , you might say that the motivations of the Burning Man Corporation are different than those of the Disney Corporation , and that makes their intentional obfuscation OK .
But I say that , A ) that does n't make it ok , and B ) I do n't think the motivations are different in the first place .
Disney protects the mouse because the mouse 's image is their whole business , and any change in how the mouse is viewed by the public could effect their ability to do their thing .
Burning Man is no different .
Disney protects their brand because if someone else exploited their park in a way they did n't like , it would no longer be projecting the image that they want , and the park would no longer be profitable ( or , " full of happy little kids " if you prefer to look at it that way . )
I do n't have any problem with that .
What I have a problem with is the hypocrisy : Disney is at least honest about what they are doing and why .
The Burning Man people went through such amazing verbal and mental gymnastics to avoid using the word " brand " in their press kit that it was comical .
Some will say that the difference between the two cases is that Disney 's motivations are based on " market " concerns while the Burning Man Corporation 's motivations are based on " aesthetic " concerns .
But I think that 's wrong , because there is no difference between " market " concerns and " aesthetic " concerns !
There is no distinction between " aesthetic sense " and " branding " .
Disneyland and Burning Man have exactly the same goals in that respect : presenting a consistent face to customers .
( Or " participants " , or " cast members " , or whatever buzzword the corporation in question chooses to use . )
From an article in SF Weekly :
" It 's not about controlling the press , " says Marian Goodell , Burning Man 's " Mistress of Communications , " who oversees the event 's public affairs .
" It 's about imagery . "
Bullshit , Marian , it 's about getting people to publish what you want about the event , and not publish their own views if you find those views distasteful :
In their application for press credentials , print journalists are asked to state their intended story angles .
Angles that festival handlers strongly discourage include depicting Burning Man as a rave , a nudist event , a drug event , or an event that is " like Mardi Gras " or " like Woodstock . "
Angles that are encouraged include " Burning Man is a new kind of community , " " Burning Man 's gift economy , where nothing is bought , sold or bartered , " [ except at the Center Camp Cafe ] and " Burning Man is an art festival . "
If a journalist suggests a " wrong " angle , Burning Man 's media team will suggest a " right " one .
I 've enjoyed Burning Man every time I 've gone , but after reading their press kit , I 'll be damned if they 're getting another dime from me .
Which is why I have not gone since : I 'd feel dirty giving them my money , and sneaking in sounds like just too much effort .
Now , please note that I am not complaining that Burning Man is " about money " and should n't be .
I 've got no problem with money .
I think it would be cool if there was an event that actually was what Burning Man professes to be .
I also think Disneyland is a lot of fun .
What pisses me off is the hypocrisy .
If they just came out and admitted they were running the Raverland / Hippieland contingent of the Magic Kingdom , that would be fine with me .
But they do two things : they run the event with a media strangle - hold that would make the White House proud ; and then in the same breath they claim " we 're doing it to protect you ! "
If they were truly the enlightened anarchists they claim to be , they could n't even consider such a thing : that kind of action is diametrically opposed to the views they pay lip service to .
If they practiced what they preach , they could never conscience the filing of a lawsuit like this one : if you only believe in freedom for people who share your aesthetic judgment , you do n't believe in freedom at all .
I do n't think their behavior is " unreasonable " or ( should be ) illegal .
What pisses me off is their halfassed attempts to hide their behavior .
I hate that they lie about it .
They pretend " we 're all in this together " , but , in fact , some animals are more equal than others , are n't they ?
Anybody Need a Best Friend ?
This guy is offering to be your best friend , for a price , via eBay .
He lives in New York City and calls himself Rent - a - Pal : “ The lucky Winning Bidder and RENTAPAL will exchange unlimited emails for a period of 30 DAYS on any subject that you like .
RENTAPAL will provide you with a compassionate ear , good conversation , feedback and advice – the kind that could only come from a close , caring friend . ”
I assume this is not a gag , but I kind of wish it were .
If he ’s for real , I think he should have used a photo that looks a little less … um … pervy .
His starting bid is $ 19.69 and so far he has zero bids .
I ca n’t say I ’m that surprised .
Still , considering the expense of psychotherapy , especially in NYC , his service might be a real bargain .

Catches from the deep include a possible new species of dragonfish
In pictures
They include waif - like plankton with delicate translucent bodies related to jellyfish , hundreds of microscopic shrimps , and several kinds of fish .
The voyage is part of the ongoing Census of Marine Life ( CoML ) which aims to map ocean life throughout the world .
Plankton form the base of many marine food chains , and some populations are being disrupted by climatic change .
Zooplankton are tiny marine animals .
Many live on floating plants ( phytoplankton ) , and many are in turn eaten by fish , mammals and crustaceans .
If you say ' how do you sample the oceans and see what global climate change is doing ? ' , you 've got to have the background data
Peter Wiebe
" The deep ocean below 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) is rarely sampled , " observed Peter Wiebe , from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US , lead scientist on the recent voyage .
" It 's very difficult ; you need many thousands of metres of cable , " he told the BBC News website .
" We were able to sample at 1,000 m intervals down to 5,000 m ( 16,500 ft ) . "
Gooey creatures
Thousands of specimens were captured during the cruise , of which 500 have been catalogued .
They include shrimp - like copepods and ostracods , swimming worms , and tiny jellyfish - some of the gooiest and most fragile animals in the sea .
Most are adjusted to living in the cool deep , where temperatures hover around one or two Celsius .
Samples were caught in nets which could descend several kilometres
As soon as they came on board ship , they were plunged into ice - cooled buckets to restore a semblance of their usual habitat ; even so , many perished before they could be studied .
This was one of the first projects to sequence DNA at sea , a process which Dr Wiebe believes will become much more common as scientists seek quick and easy ways to identify species .
" Many of these creatures occur in the Indian , Pacific and Atlantic oceans , and you can't tell them apart visually , but maybe we 'll discover that genetically they are different , " he said .
" If you say 'how do you sample the oceans and see what global climate change is doing ? ' , you 've got to have the background data . "
Several more voyages are planned in the next two years specifically to examine zooplankton , and scientists involved in CoMZ are also finding places on other cruises in relevant areas .
By the time CoML ends in 2010 , it hopes to have found and studied every zooplankton species in the ocean .

強力な検索技術を軸に、地図情報、ニュース配信、デスクトップ検索など新サービスを次々と開始している米グーグル。Webの新しい使い方の概念をまとめた「 Web2.0」のリーダー的存在とも言われている同社で、日本をはじめ世界各国における新サービスの戦略を統括しているケン・トクセイ
インターナショナルプロダクトマネージャーに話を聞いた。
■ Web2.0という概念が注目を集めている。
Web2.0は目新しい概念で広く認識されていると思います。ただ、グーグルとしては特定の概念や技術に縛られることはありません。サービスの向上に必要であれば、その技術を使うだけのことです。Web2.0は、既存のサービスを見て、後から概念を当てはめたものだと考えています。
地図サービスにしても、まずは地図と情報を結び付けてWebベースでもっと便利に使いたい、という発想がありました。これを実現するためにJavaScriptとXMLを組み合わせ、結果としてAjaxと呼ばれる手法が注目されるようになったのです。RSSについても同じです。我々は、革新的なサービスをどう実現していくかという点を考えているのです。
■ Web2.0、RSS、Ajaxは重要ではない？。
Web2.0について社内で議論することはないですね。RSSやAjaxも技術としては使用していますが、「RSSやAjaxを使うぞ」と意図的に取り込んでいるわけではありません。地図をマウスでドラッグして操作できるということは、とても便利なサービスです。その点ではAjaxは重要な技術ですが、我々は技術よりも、サービスの質を向上させることを優先します。技術はサービスの向上を助けるためのものです。
■地図を使ったサービスで、ヤフーのようなポータルサイトを目指しているように見える。
我々の目指すサービスは、情報を利用しやすいように整理して提供することです。「Googleローカル」では、ユーザーが情報を見つけやすいように、地図と地域情報を組み合わせました。さまざまな情報をできる限り効率的に利用できるシステムを用意することで、ユーザー、コンテンツの提供者、企業、そしてグーグルにとってもウィン−ウィンの関係になれるのです。ポータルサイトのように、必ずしもユーザーが同じサイト内に留まる必要はないのです。
■地図サービス のAPIを提供することで、サービスが競合することはないか。
競合するとは考えていません。情報の流れがさらに効率的になり、インターネットをもっと便利にしていくことができると考えています。
サービスを提供する事業者にとっては、グーグルの機能を取り込んで、簡単に便利な地図サービスを提供できるのですから、ユーザーにも、事業者にとってもメリットがあります。
我々 はAPIを無料で使えるようにしており、“ ルーズ ”
な形で公開しています。こうすることで、特定の興味を持った人が独自の地図を作成できます。例えば、チーズショップの地図、アラスカを自転車で旅行するための地図などです。これらの地図を我々で作ることはありません。特定の興味と豊富な知識を持っている人々が独自の地図を作ることで、同じ興味を持った人々が集まり、コミュニティーができるのです。
■マイクロソフトやヤフーなども地図サービスを始めたが。
他社からも同様のサービスが登場することで、よい補完関係になると考えています。我々のサービスが有益だと認められた、ともいえます。過剰に意識することはありませんが、他社のサービスから学ぶこともあります。
■新サービスを次々と提供できる要因は。
最も大きな要因は、我々自身が技術に親しんでいるだけでなく、熱心なインターネットのユーザーだということです。我々自身が欲しいサービスを作る、という発想からアイデアが生まれるのです。会社はそれを手助けする環境を作っています。
就業時間の20％を自分の自由なプロジェクトに割り当てていいというルールも、アイデアが生まれる土壌を支えています。エンジニアが情熱を持てるプロジェクトに時間を割けるのです。
命令されなくても、アイデアが自然と集まるカルチャーもあります。実現したいアイデアを「テックトーク」というフォーラムで発表することができます。構想段階のアイデアに対し、お互いに批評を加えて詰めていきます。週に何度も開かれ、誰でも参加して意見をいうことができます。社内の学会みたいなものです。
良いアイデアは自然と社内でも注目され、人が集まり、実現されていきます。実際にサービスを開始するときには、創業者をはじめ経営陣が検討し、ゴーサインを出します。とはいえ、プロジェクトはトップダウンで決まるわけではなく、エンジニアの熱意が支えているのです。アイデアを選択する基準は、利益を生み出すかは重要ではなく、どれだけの人々が使い、便利に感じるのか、ということです。
■今後、どのような方針でサービスを展開していくのか。
これまでと方針を変えることはありません。ただそのためには、これまで以上に市場を理解し、海外の拠点も拡充していかなければならないでしょう。現在、サービスをさらに迅速に投入できるよう、米国だけでなく、世界各国で優秀な人材を確保しようとしています。どこでも人材が足りません。ただ、サービスが広がったとしても我々の核となる方針は変わりません。
高木さんの日記で 、
そうすると、「 h」付きと「 h」無しを逆にしたらよかったのにと思えてくる。
ということだったので、ERB を改造してサクッと作ってみた。 rerb 。
とりあえず、h の意味を逆転させてしまうと（hを流用してしまうと）それはそれで 混乱すると思ってそれは避けたのだが、高木さんは「 hの逆 」を命名してくれなかったので、 とりあえず " raw html " ということで r を使った。何かいいアイディアはないものか 。
ついでに、rerb - cgi という名前で起動された場合は CGI モジュールを内包して、 ローカル変数 cgi , header 経由で引数や出力ヘッダにアクセスできるようにしてみた。 そういうわけで、test.ehtml は ( rerb - cgi という実行ファイルを用意すれば ) 単独でcgiとして動作して ……/test.cgi?q=%3c%3d%3e%3 f&p=2nd+param とか起動しても ちゃんと quote が行われるような例になっている 。
内部的には 、Ogawaさんの
で、やっぱり思ったのは 、PHPにしろPerlにしろSQLにしろ、String Processingの範疇にあるプログラムは、ほとんど常に処理中の文字列が指し示す「型」を意識しなければ作れないにも関わらず、最もベーシックな型である「文字列型」だけを使って実装されていることに、一番の問題があるのではないか、ということです。
とか、こ の 「こめんと」その他でも何度となく「HTML と String は違う型だと思え 」とは主張してきたわけですが、
それをちょっとだけ踏まえて HTML 文字列型は RERB :: Rerb_html という型で実装されていたりします。 ( というか , r 埋め込みを実装するには今の ERB / Ruby を前提にするとそうせざるを得ない )
実際に作ってみると、本当はもっと強く型を意識して言語から設計しないといけない気もしてきたり
するのですが、それはおいおい研究ネタにでもすることにして、quick hack としては 結構面白いものができたかな、と思ってみたり。 あ、header 部分の RHS 対策とか、 attribute を single quote で括ったときの処理とか 、
「 これを使えば万全」になるような細工は全然してないので気をつけてね :-)
Watches can be used for just about everything these days , from watching TV to learning Japanese , we ’ve selected ten of the strangest ( or coolest ) for your enjoyment .
Which ones are your favorites ?
10 . Linux - Powered Watch

It basically had a host of PDA functions ( phonebook , scheduler , picture viewer , etc. ) and included a monochrome 640 x 480 VGA display .
Rumsfeld is accused of fostering an atmosphere of arrogance
The White House has said it is happy with the way Mr Rumsfeld is handling his job and the situation in Iraq .
But the backing comes as the number of retired generals calling for him to be replaced has risen to six .
It is being described as a rebellion led by those who know Mr Rumsfeld 's handling of the war from the inside .
The two most recent retired generals to voice their unease about Mr Rumsfeld 's handling of the war are Maj Gen John Riggs and Maj Gen Charles H Swannack Jr , both of the Army .
I feel he has micromanaged the generals who are leading our forces
Maj Gen Charles H Swannack Jr
In a radio interview Gen Riggs , a former division commander , said it was time for Mr Rumsfeld to go because he fostered an atmosphere of " arrogance " among the Pentagon 's top civilian leadership .
" They only need the military advice when it satisfies their agenda .
I think that 's a mistake , and that 's why I think he should resign , " he told National Public Radio ( NPR ) .
Gen Swannack Jr , who led the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq , went even further .
He questioned whether Mr Rumsfeld was the right person to lead the fight against terrorism .
CRITICAL RETIRED GENERALS Maj Gen Charles H Swannack Jr , Army Maj Gen John Riggs , Army Maj Gen John Batiste , Army Gen Anthony Zinni , Marines Lt Gen Gregory Newbold , Marines Maj Gen Paul Eaton , Army
" I really believe that we need a new secretary of defence because Secretary Rumsfeld carried way too much baggage with him , " he told CNN .
" Specifically , I feel he has micromanaged the generals who are leading our forces . "
Gen Riggs , who has been an outspoken critic on problems facing the US military before , served in the army for 39 years and became a three - star general .
He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions as a helicopter pilot during Vietnam , but retired with the loss of one of his stars after the army said he had misused contractors , according to the NPR website .
Gen Swannack
Jr commanded the 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq from 2003 - 4 .
The White House insists Mr Rumsfeld has its firm backing
Retired Marine Gen Anthony Zinni told CNN
Mr Rumsfeld should be held responsible for a series of mistakes , beginning with " throwing away 10 years worth of planning , plans that had taken into account what we would face in an occupation of Iraq " .
' Fine job '
But others have come out in support of the embattled defence secretary , who twice offered to resign over the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal - offers which US President George W Bush rejected .
Retired Marine Lt Gen Mike DeLong , who was deputy commander of Central Command as the US military prepared to invade Iraq in March 2003 , said Mr Rumsfeld was good at his job .
People ... should never question the dedication , the patriotism and the work ethic of Secretary Rumsfeld
Gen Peter Pace ,
Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman
" When you walk in to him , you 've got to be prepared , " he told CNN .
" You 've got to know what you 're talking about .
If you do n't , you 're summarily dismissed .
But that 's the way it is , and he 's effective . "
And the White House has made clear once again that Mr Rumsfeld retains its full support .
Spokesman Scott McClellan said President George W Bush believed Mr Rumsfeld was doing a " fine job " at a very difficult time - when the nation was at war and the military undergoing major restructuring .
Mr Rumsfeld , when asked if the calls for his resignation were affecting his ability to do the job , answered only " no " .
And Gen Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said criticism was to be expected at a time of war in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
But he said people " should never question the dedication , the patriotism and the work ethic " of Mr Rumsfeld .
Mud , gas and boiling water that have been gushing out of the ground in East Java since May , submerging half a dozen villages and 20 factories , could continue for a century with " catastrophic consequences " , European experts said yesterday .
Efforts to seal the channels through which the mud is escaping are unlikely to succeed , and it is impossible to tell how much fluid remains underground , according to a University of Oslo geology team .
" It 's unlikely to stop permanently for a long time , " Adriano Mazzini told a press conference in Jakarta .
" It 's hard to say when the overpressure will have been fully released .
It could be one , 10 or 100 years .
But to seal it will be very , very difficult . "
According to Mr Mazzini , unless the flow stops soon , the affected land , which has already starting sinking , could subside significantly .
" It will be catastrophic , " he said .
The mud started flowing on May 29 , a couple of hundred metres from where the gas company PT Lapindo Brantas was drilling an exploratory well nearly two miles deep .
It has been gushing up to 50,000 cubic metres a day - or two large bathsfull a second - ever since .
At least four villages will almost certainly have to be destroyed , and two others have been flooded .
More than 11,000 people have evacuated their homes .
On September 8 , the central government , fearing a political disaster as well as the environmental impact , took command of the operation to stem the flow , control the flood ( which now covers about 400 hectares ( 1,000 acres ) and supervise the social programmes for the affected communities .
A spokesman for the government team told the Guardian the latest findings were " useful and worrying " .
He said : " They show we still have a lot of work to do . "
Observers said the president , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , had been wise to intervene .
" This could be the achilles heel of this government , " said Dennis Heffernan , a political and business consultant .
" Unless more resources are put to work , we 're in danger of a catastrophe on the level of the Exxon Valdez . "
The Exxon Valdez was an oil tanker that sank in Alaska in 1989 , causing widespread environmental devastation .
All the expenses are being borne by Lapindo , which is controlled by the family of Indonesia 's senior welfare minister , Aburizal Bakrie .
Estimated costs are thought to be well over £ 70 m , while the company 's insurance only covered £ 15 m .
Mr Mazzini , whose team has studied mud volcanoes for more than a decade and spent just under a week on site , said it was impossible to say conclusively whether the drilling caused the disaster .
There has been speculation that the disaster was caused by Lapindo failing to use a proper casing during drilling .
Mr Mazzini said this was unlikely .
" This is a huge case of overpressure , " he said .
" A casing would not have made any difference , I do n't think .
But I 'm not a drilling expert . "
The mudflow is thought to have been caused by one of four possibilities : gas - charged fluids breaching coral mounds on top of the limestone rock ; a magmatic reaction generating gas ; a new - born mud volcano ; or hydrothermal fluids migrating from neighbouring areas .
Norton , Clooney Find Gift Baskets Embarassing
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
I ’ve always thought that it was strange how the richest people always seem to get so much for free .
Kind of counter - intuitive , do n’t you think ?
I know , everyone wants their product on the arm of a celebrity – it ’s simple marketing .
Now Ed Norton is speaking out against the baskets , â€ œI mean the gift baskets , worth amounts of money that a low income family could live on for a year , [ are given to ] people who have so much already .
It gets depressing .
You sit there , going , â€ ˜This is an embarrassment .
â€™â€ 
George Clooney auctioned his basket off through United Way last year .
Norton also says that he and others want to do away with the swag altogether , â€ œA lot of us have talked to the Academy Awards producers about this and I think theyâ€™re actually going to scuttle the gift baskets and that kind of stuff.â€ 
Also not helping the gift basket frenzy :
This past year there was all sorts of issues as gift - baskets were declared taxable by the IRS .

A file detailing aspects of AT&T's alleged participation in the National Security Agency 's warrantless domestic wiretap operation is sitting in a San Francisco courthouse .
But the public cannot see it because , at AT&T 's insistence , it remains under seal in court records .
Inside the Secret Room Courtroom Clash !
A federal judge refuses to give AT&T back its internal documents , but orders the EFF not to give them out .
Whistle - Blower 's Precognition
Years before the NSA 's warrantless surveillance program made national headlines , then - AT&T technician Mark Klein suspected his company was colluding with the government to spy on Americans .
The Ultimate Net Monitoring Tool
A little - known company called Narus makes the packet - inspection technology said to be the basis of the NSA 's internet surveillance .
Here 's how it works .
Plus :
Daily updates from 27B Stroke 6 , the Wired News security and privacy blog .
The judge in the case has so far denied requests from the Electronic Frontier Foundation , or EFF , and several news organizations to unseal the documents and make them public .
AT&T claims information in the file is proprietary and that it would suffer severe harm if it were released .
Based on what we 've seen , Wired News disagrees .
In addition , we believe the public 's right to know the full facts in this case outweighs AT&T 's claims to secrecy .
As a result , we are publishing the complete text of a set of documents from the EFF 's primary witness in the case , former AT&T employee and whistle - blower Mark Klein – information obtained by investigative reporter Ryan Singel through an anonymous source close to the litigation .
The documents , available on Wired News as of Monday , consist of 30 pages , with an affidavit attributed to Klein , eight pages of AT&T documents marked " proprietary , " and several pages of news clippings and other public information related to government - surveillance issues .
The AT&T documents appear to be excerpted from material that was later filed in the lawsuit under seal .
But we can't be entirely sure , because the protective order prevents us from comparing the two sets of documents .
This week , we are joining in efforts to bring this evidence to light in its entirety .
We are filing a motion to intervene in the case in order to request that the court unseal the evidence , joining other news and civil rights organizations that have already done so , including the EFF , the San Francisco Chronicle , the Los Angeles Times , the San Jose Mercury News , the Associated Press and Bloomberg .
Before publishing these documents we showed them to independent security experts , who agreed they pose no significant danger to AT&T .
For example , they do not reveal information that hackers might use to easily attack the company 's systems .
The court 's gag order is very specific in barring only the EFF , its representatives and its technical experts from discussing and disseminating this information .
The court explicitly rejected AT&T 's motion to include Klein in the gag order and declined AT&T 's request to force the EFF to return the documents .
Unified Theory of Learning Systems ; or why markets , neural nets , evolution , and Page Rank are all the same thing
I was recently thinking about the commonalities between all systems that can learn .
Neural networks learn by updating the strength of the connections between neurons .
Groups of people and societies in general learn by leveraging the power of markets .
Species learn through natural selection and evolution .
The Page Rank algorithm that Google uses to analyze the links between all pages on the web learns by updating the weight of each page based on the pages that link to it .
What do all these systems have in common ?
I will try to answer that question in this post .
I first saw the connection between neural networks and markets when I was thinking about prediction markets .
In a neural network , every time a connection is used to produce a " positive " result the strength of the connection is increased , and every time it is used to produce a " negative " result the strength of the connection is decreased .
Positive and negative depend on the purpose of the neural network .
If the neural network is the brain of a mouse , finding cheese would be considered a positive result but getting an electric shock would be a negative result .
If the neural network is supposed to identify a handwritten number 6 , then correct identification would be considered positive , and incorrect identification would be a negative .
In any case , the positive signal could be considered a payment to the neural system , and the updating of the weights is how the neural net distributes the payment among those connections that were responsible for the results .
Those connections that are right , i.e. that were activated when the payoff was positive , get paid more by having their strength increased .
In contrast those connections that were wrong lose part of their fortune by having their strength diminished .
We can start seeing an analogy to a market here , a connection is a bet in a particular direction , and those connections that get it right have more to bet in the next round , but those connections who get it wrong have less to bet .
Now let 's look at a market .
When an individual buys a security in a market he is betting that the security is going to go up in price .
If he is right he makes money and the purchasing power of his account increases , if he is wrong , he loses money and his purchasing power decreases .
Next time he makes a decision to buy or sell , the amount that he can buy or sell is going to be limited to how much he has in his account .
After several rounds those who usually guess right will have pretty big accounts , and those who usually guess wrong will have very small accounts .
So their guesses will be weighted differently , and the price resulting from aggregating those guesses will become more accurate .
Once the market reaches a steady state the purchasing power of individuals will be proportional to how good they are at guessing the right price , and the aggregate price will be the most accurate .
So the purchasing power of each individual is the weight of their vote , the strength of their connection to the final aggregated price .
From the previous paragraphs we can see how neural nets and markets are alike .
We can think of markets as weighted voting systems , where the size of the account of each individual is their weight , and the system updates the weights of individuals according to the accuracy of their votes in predicting an outcome .
We can think of neural networks as markets where connections bid for a particular correlation between the activity of two neurons , and those who bid correctly get rich , but those who bid incorrectly lose their shirts .
We can now start to see some of the commonalities :
1 ) Both of these learning systems have a predicted signal and an actual signal , their objective is to make the predicted sinal equal to the actual signal .
In the case of a market the predicted signal is the market price of a security and the actual signal is the true price of the security , the price that makes supply equal demand and that makes markets clear .
In the case of a neural net the predicted and actual signals are more obvious since neural nets are designed for pattern recognition where the pattern is the actual signal , and the predicted signal is what the neural net guesses when it is learning .
2 ) Both of these systems are composed of several distinct units that vote / bet for an outcome , or for a part of the process in an outcome .
In the neural net each connection between two neurons is a vote for the state of one neuron being relevant to the state of the other neuron in predicting an outcome .
In a market each individual buying or selling a security is voting on whether that security is overpriced or underpriced .
3 ) Both of these systems give different weights to different voters .
Connections are weighted in a neural net , different market participants have different levels of wealth , where the wealth represents buying power , and since each transaction is a vote , the vote is weighted by the wealth of the person doing the transaction .
4 ) Both of these systems learn by updating the weights of the voters .
In a market those who vote wrong lose some of their wealth , in a neural net those connections who contribute to wrong results lose part of their strenght .
5 ) Once these systems learn , their weights stop being updated .
This is achieved by a dynamic equilibrium where the sum total of positive updates is equal and opposite to the sum total of negative updates .
Once a neural net learns what it needs to learn , the weights remain stable , they lose as much as they gain in every training round .
Once the market participants have attained a level of wealth that represents all their knowledge on a particular security , they are as likely to guess right as they are to guess wrong , so their gain as frequently as they lose and their wealth remains static .
Now that we have these basis , it is easy to see how they extend to other learning systems .
Consider evolution , each gene is a vote for a particular physical characteristic for an organism , and on how likely is the organism that possesses that characteristic to survive in its environment .
Those genes that vote correctly get reproduced more often than those who vote incorrectly , and their percentages in the population increase .
This means that they have a higher weight on the percentage of the next generation .
The wealth / weight of each gene is represented in the percent probability that they have of being passed to the next generation in contrast to competing genes .
The fitness in genetic algorithm parlance .
Once the optimal phenotype is reached the percentages reach a steady state , where half of the organisms are helped by the characteristic , and the other half are hindered .
This shows that evolution is very similar to markets and neural nets , since it conforms to the same five broadly outlined principles above .
What about the Page Rank algorithm ?
This algorithm is applied to a directed graph to find out which nodes are the most popular .
At first glance you would want to count how many incoming links each node has to measure its popularity .
That is a good first approximation , but not all links are equal , the links of more popular nodes are worth more than the links of unpopular nodes .
So you start by counting the links and assigning a popularity to each node , then you count the links again but weight the links according to the popularity of the incoming node .
This updates the popularity of each node , so you do this again , until you reach a steady state and the popularity measure of the nodes does n't change .
Again , we can see that each node is voting by linking to other nodes , and its vote is weighted by its popularity .
Its popularity is updated according to how many popular nodes point to it .
The algorithm of updating can be thought of as a flux of popularity through the system , from the least popular to the most popular .
Each node in between has some popularity coming in and some going out .
The steady state is reached when the popularity coming in equals the popularity going out .
Although the training signal here is less obvious than in other learning systems , it is still something separate from the predicted signal , it is the actual popularity of each node according to the graph topology .
As we can see Page Rank also shares the same five basic characteristics of learning systems that markets , neural nets , and evolving systems all have .
I think we can apply the same sort of analysis to anything that learns .
That is a conjecture that I am not going to prove because it would require me to either enumerate all learning systems , or prove that a system that does n't share those characteristics cannot learn .
That proof might be doable , but that would be too much work for a Friday night post .
My purpose is only to advance the hypothesis that all learning systems are instances of the same algorithm and to provide some examples as evidence to that conjecture .
To the science and engineering inclined , this can serve as motivation to specify the learning algorithm exactly by observing many instances of systems that learn .
To the mathematically inclined , this could serve as motivation to find a rigorous argument of why this is true .
To the scientifically inclined with a skeptic bent , this can serve as inspiration to try to disprove it probably by finding an example of a learning system that does n't fit the model .
As for me , this was just a way to record an insight I found interesting .
As I finish writing this I realized that the expectations maximization algorithm , and the fuzzy clustering algorithm also fit this description , but I leave these as an exercise to the reader because I am tired of typing , and I want this post to be short enough for people to actually read .

As noted yesterday in The Diet Plan and The Three Habits , I 'm presenting the spreadsheet I used to track my weight loss progress .
Before digging into it , I 'd like to point out that this is n't terribly fancy .
It met my needs and did what I wanted .
But I 'm no Excel whiz , so there 's a really good chance that you could make this prettier , more useful , and somehow better than I can .
Overview
The spreadsheet has two worksheets , selectable via the tabs at the bottom .
One is labeled Calories and the other is Weight .
Both worksheets also contain charts that provide a visual summary of the data collected .
In both case , there are two lines on each chart .
The blue line represents the data you recorded : morning weight or total calories for the day .
The pink line is the one we pay attention to .
It is the 5 day moving average for the data we 're recording .
By using the 5 day moving average , we smooth out the daily fluctuations in weight and the variations in calorie consumption .
This is very important .
Using the 5 day moving average helps to factor out the daily ups and downs that might otherwise discourage you into thinking that it 's not working .
The Weight Page
The weight page is where you record whatever the scale tells you each morning without judging your progress .
This is scientific data collection .
Do n't let it affect your mood for the day !
It 's just a number .
As you can see in the thumbnail above or in the full - sized version , there are 5 columns of data on the left side of the page : date , weight , average , change , and total loss .
You need only supply the date and weight .
All the others populate themselves .
The " average " is the 5 day moving average , so there 's nothing there for the first few days .
The " change " represents the day to day positive or negative change .
The " total loss " column represents how much weight you 've lost to date .
There are two other data points above the chart that are not strictly necessary early on .
I added them very late in the process once I had a few months of data .
The " daily average " is intended to provide an idea of how much weight I was losing each day .
From that the " avg daily calorie deficit " cell is derived ( to the right ) .
How do I compute that ?
Since we know how much weight is vanishing each day ( on average ) and how many calories are in a pound of fat ( roughly 3,500 ) , it 's a simple matter of division .
This comes is useful later on .
Once you 've lost the weight you 'd like to , it 's safe to start increasing your daily calorie intake .
But you need to know how far to go .
Using this data , you 'll be able to figure out how many calories you need each day .
The Calorie Page
Like the weight page , the calorie page has some data collection and a chart .
The data collection is a bit more involved since I wanted to record my calorie intake for every meal and snacks .
You do n't need this level of detail here , but I wanted all the data in one place .
All you really need is the dataset that 's under the chart : date , calories , and average .
Again , all you really need to do is put in the date and number of calories .
The average will be computed for you .
There 's also an " average / day " cell off to the right that I found useful later on to see how I was doing overall .
Odds are that you 're not going to hit your exact calorie targets every day .
By looking at the overall average , you 'll know how close you 're getting .
Some folks might record more quantity information ( portion sizes or weights ) while others may do less .
If you 're eating mostly pre-sized packaged foods , it 's pretty easy .
Otherwise you may be doing some estimation or using a kitchen scale and CalorieKing.com to figure out what numbers to record .
As on the weight chart , the calorie chart has two lines .
The blue simple connects the dots between the daily calorie intake points .
The pink line is a 5 day moving average of that data that smoothes out the day to day peaks and valleys , showing you how you 're trending ( up or down ) .
Download It
As promised , I 've provided a copy of this spreadsheet for download : weight - tracker.xls ( 300 over downloads already ! )
Use at your own risk , modify to suit your needs , and all that stuff . :-)
Tomorrow we 'll look at goal setting , some of the numbers in my spreadsheet , and factors you might consider in your own weight loss plan .
Oh , feel free to use the data in my spreadsheet .
But , please , no comments on my particular food choices .
Some days I ate whatever was handy rather than planning a " good " meal .
Update : Wow .
I 'm impressed .
Nearly 300 people have already downloaded the spreadsheet .
Had I known it'd be popular , I 'd have tried to pretty it up a little .
Maybe .

The prospect of Sharia law in Ontario sparked protests in Canada
A report by Ontario 's former attorney general Marion Boyd had recommended the use of Islamic law to settle issues such as divorce and child custody .
But Premier Dalton McGuinty ruled against the move , saying there should be " one law for all Ontarians " .
Protests were held against the Sharia law proposal in major Canadian cities , as well as in Paris , London and Vienna .
Critics said allowing Islamic tribunals could lead to discrimination against women .
' Common ground '
If the recommendation had been accepted , Ontario would have become the first Western jurisdiction to allow the use of Sharia .
I think our voice got heard loud and clear , and I thank the government for coming out with no faith - based arbitrations
Homa Ar - Jomand
Women 's rights activist
Ontario has allowed Catholic and Jewish faith - based tribunals to resolve family disputes on a voluntary basis since 1991 .
Mr McGuinty , who had been studying Ms Boyd 's report since last December , said he was concerned religious family courts could " threaten our common ground " .
He told the Canadian Press news agency : " There will be no Sharia law in Ontario .
There will be no religious arbitration in Ontario .
There will be one law for all Ontarians . "
' Loud and clear '
Women 's rights activist Homa Ar - Jomand , who helped organise the rallies last Thursday , said she was delighted by the decision .
" I think our voice got heard loud and clear , and I thank the government for coming out with no faith - based arbitrations .
" That was the best news I 've heard for the past five years , " she said .
According to the latest census in 2001 , about 600,000 Muslims live in Canada .
It is often said that an important advantage of the decimal notation over the Roman one is that makes multiplication of numbers much easier .
Adding CLXXVII to XXIII may be relatively straightforward -- but how about multiplying the two ?
It is indeed easier to multiply these as decimal numbers 177 by 23 , but the Romans also had a multiplication method of their own .
It was probably discovered by trial and error , and it always worked , though the Romans did not know why .
Here the method is described , and its secret explained .
The Romans started by writing the numbers next to each other .
Of course , they used Roman numerals -- but to make it clear in what follows , here decimal notation will be used throughout .
Suppose we need to derive 177 x 23
After writing down the numbers ( here the multiplication sign was added ) , halve the first one and double the second , writing the new numbers below the preceding ones .
If the number being halved is odd , just ignore the remainder .
Repeat this operation as long as you can : 177 x 23 88 46 44 92 22 184 11 368 5 736 2 1472 1 2944
Now cross out in the second column all numbers where the corresponding number in the first column is even : 177 x 23 88 46 44 92 22 184 11 368 5 736 2 1472 1 2944
Then add up the remaining numbers : 23 + 368 + 736 + 2944 = 4071
You can verify that indeed 177 x 23 = 4071 .
The Romans did all this using their own cumbersome notation , but people used to handling numbers were experienced in doubling and halving , and could carry it out fairly quickly .
Doubling can be relatively simple : XXIII doubled is XXXXVI , doubled again DXXXXII ( Romans wrote 4 =IIII,40 =XXXX , and notations like 4 =IV were only introduced in the middle ages ) .
Like the method we use , it reduced the multiplication of two numbers to addition , which Roman numerals could handle .
But why did it work ?
To find the reason , one must express the numbers in the first column in binary notation -- as a sum of powers of 2 .
The powers 2 ^N for N=0, 1,2,3,4 ... are N 2N 0 1 1 2 2 4 = 2 x 2 3 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 4 16 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 5 32 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 6 64 7 128 and so forth .
Every number can be written in just one way as the sum of powers of two .
In this case 177 = 1 + 16 + 32 +128
When a number is written in binary notation , each digit represents one power of 2 .
Reading from right to left , a digit is 0 if that power of 2 is absent in the number , 1 if it is present .
It can only be present once : if twice or more , a higher power of 2 could be used .
This is very similar to the way we write decimal numbers : the digits of 177 tell us that 100=1 is present 7 times , 101=10 is also present 7 times , and 102=100 is present once .
Since 177 = 1 + 16 + 32 +128 we have in binary notation 177 = 1011 0001
The last digit of any binary number is 1 if it is odd , 0 if even .
Lopping off that number creates a new binary number , with two properties :
The same binary number is produced for any odd number and the even number just below it , e.g. 177 = 1011 0001 and 176 = 1011 0000 both give 1011 000 = 88
In the new number , each digit is demoted one binary level :
the " 2 " digit in the original number becomes the " 1 " digit ,
the " 4 " digit becomes the " 2 " digit
the " 8 " digit becomes the " 4 " digit
the " 16 " digit becomes the " 8 " digit
and so forth .
That means ,
If the old number is even , the new number is half its value ( no remainder )
If the old number is odd , the new number is half its value ( ignore remainder )
Thus when we " divide by 2 and ignore the remainder " we end up with the number whose binary representation is obtained by lopping off the last binary digit .
Let us rewrite the earlier table , but add binary representations , and for convenience , shift to the right entries which have even multiples of 23 and which in binary notation end in 0 : 177 ( 1011 0001 ) x 23 88 ( 1011 000 ) 46 44 ( 101100 ) 92 22 ( 10110 ) 184 11 ( 1011 ) 368 5 ( 101 ) 736 2 ( 10 ) 1472 1 ( 1 ) 2944
Note whenever the left - hand number is odd , the last digit is 1 .
By singling out the odd numbers on the left , we identify the non-zero digits in the binary expansion !
Now , how do we multiply two numbers in the decimal system , , say 177 by 23 ?
The digits of 177 tell us that it contains 7 " ones " , 7 " tens " and one " hundred " : 177 = ( 7 x 1 ) + ( 7 x 10 ) + ( 1 x 100 ) Therefore 177 x 23 = ( ( 7 x 1)x23 ) ) + ( 7 x 10)x23 ) ) + ( 1 x 100 ) x23 ) ) or else 177 x 23 = ( 7 x 23 ) +( 7 x 230 ) + ( 1 x 2300 ) , or else
This reduces a complicated multiplication to a series of simple multiplications , followed by a simple addition .
In the binary system , 10 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 ... are powers of 2
Binary Decimal 1 1 10 2 100 4 1000 8 10 000 16 100 000 32 and so forth .
To use a similar strategy for multiplying 1011 0001 x 23 ( for clarity , we use decimals to write 23 ) , for every digit " 1 " in 1011 0001 we multiply 23 by the corresponding power of 2 , and then add the result .
1011 0001 contains " 1 " four times , so we expect to add 4 powers of 2 .
Earlier we showed that 177 = 1 + 16 + 32 +128 and each " 1 " in 1011 0001 corresponds to one of those powers .
To start from the smallest power ( as in the above sum ) we must look at the digits from left to right .
The first " 1 " corresponds to " 1 " which is the same in binary or decimal .
The next " 1 " shows that 177 contains ( once ) 10000 ( binary ) = 16 ( decimal ) , and so on .
The right hand column of our table , where 23 is doubled and redoubled , contains the number 23 times all powers of 2 = 1,2,4,8 ... .
By adding there the numbers corresponding to the " 1 " digits of 177 = 1011 0001 , we sum up the product of 23 by only those powers of 2 , contained in 177 .
The result therefore equals 177 x 23 .
The Romans did not know anything about the binary system .
They just knew that their method worked , which was good enough for them .
Interestingly , electronic computers , which use binary numbers , employ a similar method !
Note Even before the Romans , ancient Egypt used a similar system ( see descriptions about the Rhind Papyrus ) .
More details about ancient mathematics and methods of calculations are in the book " How Mathematics Happened " by Peter E. Rudman , 314 pp. , Prometheus books 2007 .
American photographers may be irritating to the stars they shoot , but they rarely boo .
Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn found out the hard way that it 's not always the same across the pond .
While touring to promote thier movie , ' The Break - Up , ' the couple posed -- separately -- for a mob of media in Hamburg .
This fits with their long - standing tendency to not be photographed together .
But the German photographers wanted a two - shot , and loudly cajoled Vince to join Jennifer under the lights .
Finally , Vince did step forward , but only with the film 's director , Peyton Reed , standing between Vaughn and Aniston .
This teasing maneuver only further upset the media , whose voices swelled with groans and boos .
Making profits from incivility on the roads
I hardly ever drive anymore since I moved close to where I work .
So whenever I do , the incivility on the roads leaps out at me .
People do things in cars they would never do in other settings .
Honking .
Swearing .
Cutting to the front of the line .
And that is just my wife .
The other drivers are far meaner .
One obvious reason is that you do n’t have to live with the consequences for any length of time .
If you cut in line at airport security , you will be in close proximity to the people you insulted for quite some time .
With a car you make a quick getaway .
Making that getaway also means you are unlikely to be physically beaten , whereas giving someone the finger as you walk down the sidewalk has no such safety .
When I used to commute , there was one particular interchange where incivility ruled .
( For those who know Chicago , it is where the Dan Ryan feeds into the Eisenhower . )
There are two lanes when you exit the highway .
One lane goes to other highway , the other goes to a surface street .
Hardly anyone ever wants to go that surface street .
There can be a half - mile backup of cars waiting patiently to get on the highway , and about 20 % of the drivers rudely and illegally cut in at the last second after pretending they are heading toward the surface street .
Every honest person that waits in line is delayed 15 minutes or more because of the cheaters .
Social scientists sometimes talk about the concept of “ identity . ”
It is the idea that you have a particular vision of the kind of person you are , and you feel awful when you do things that are out of line with that vision .
That leads you to take actions that are seemingly not in your short - run best interest .
In economics , George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton popularized the idea .
I had read their papers , but in general have such a weak sense of identity that I never really understood what they were talking about .
The first time I really got what they meant was when I realized that a key part of my identity was that I was not the kind of person who would cut in line to shorten my commute , even though it would be easy to do so , and seemed crazy to wait for 15 minutes in this long line .
But , if I were to cut in line , I would have to fundamentally rethink the kind of person I was .
The fact that I do n’t mind when my taxi driver cuts in these lines ( actually , I kind of enjoy it ) probably shows that I have a long ways to go in my moral development .
All this is actually just a rambling prelude to my main point .
I was in New York City the other day and my taxi cab driver bypassed a long line of cars exiting the freeway to cut in at the last second .
As usual , I enjoyed being an innocent bystander / beneficiary to this little crime .
But what happened next was even more gratifying to the economist in me .
A police officer was standing in the middle of the road , waving every car that cut in line over to the shoulder , where a second officer was handing out tickets like an assembly line .
By my rough estimate , these two officers were giving out 30 tickets an hour at $ 115 a pop .
At over $ 1,500 per officer per hour ( assuming the tickets get paid ) , this was a fantastic money making proposition for the city .
And it nails just the right people .
Speeding does n’t really hurt other people very much , except indirectly .
So to my mind it makes much more sense to go directly after the mean - spirited behavior like cutting in line .
This is very much in the spirit of Bratton ’s “ broken windows ” policing philosophy .
I ’m not sure it cuts down the number of cheaters on the roads in any fundamental way since the probability of getting caught remains vanishingly small .
Still , the beauty of it is that ( 1 ) every driver that follows the rules feels a rush of glee over the rude drivers getting nailed , and ( 2 ) it is a very efficient way of taxing bad behavior .
So , my policy recommendation to police departments across the country is to find the spots on the roads that lend themselves to this sort of policing and let the fun begin .
T he author of this problem is Albert Einstein who said that 98 % of the people in the world could n't solve it .

This liquid nitrogen ice cream recipe is a bit of a departure for me - as anyone who reads this site regularly will recognize .
I was n't much of a science geek in college .
At the time I was more interested in apertures than atoms , cyanotypes over cryogenics , and vignetting before viscosity .
My interest in chemistry pretty much started and stopped in the photography lab .
So , it is with a bit of wide - eyed wonderment and curiosity that I observe the molecular gastronomy movement .
Watching what is going on is both exciting and intimidating - the laboratory is melding with the kitchen and vice versa .
A whole new vocabulary of textures , tastes , and techniques is emerging and evolving .
A friend of a friend showed up at a recent cooking night with a hardcore , four foot tank of liquid nitrogen .
What might one do with a giant tank of liquid nitrogen ?
LN2 , for those in the know , btw .
Make liquid nitrogen ice cream , of course .
Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream - creamy !
I needed a play - by - play explanation .
Apparently many school - aged kids make liquid nitrogen ice cream as part of elementary - school science lessons .
My school however , never made it beyond shaking cream in a jar with a marble to make butter - the year after that we sprouted lima beans .
To make liquid nitrogen ice cream you start with an ice cream base in a metal mixing bowl .
Fire up the mixer ( Kitchen - Aid was in use here ) at low - med speed .
Pour the liquid nitrogen into the bowl a bit at a time as the mixer is running .
It freezes up ever so creamy and beautifully .
Will I die if I eat it ?
I asked that .
I also asked a host of other questions .
Are those plumes of Halloween - looking smoke coming off the bowl going to gobble up all the oxygen in the room ?
Are we all going to go to sleep and never wake up ?
You really , really , need to be careful with this stuff - do your homework and really get up to speed on the proper way to handle it ( some starter links below ) .
You need to treat it as seriously as you would a deep fryer filled with hot oil and the like .
You like your fingers , right ?
LN2 can cause them to shatter .
Imagine what it could go if you got it in your eyes .
Survival instincts aside , I savored every bite of the ice cream .
Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream Recipe
There are lots of chefs playing around with LN2 in the kitchen .
If jumping into the molecular gastronomy pond is something that piques your interest , liquid nitrogen ice cream seems like a good gateway recipe .
Not sure if I see myself going down to the local welding supply shop to stock up on it , but I understand the allure .
There is an great eGullet thread on cooking with liquid nitrogen .
It covers safety considerations , LN2 experiences , and input from people using it in their own kitchens .
Also , be sure to read this materials sheet on liquid nitrogen .
One of the things I 'm curious about and do n't have a good ( or well - founded ) sense of , is how these " extreme " culinary techniques impact the nutritional or beneficial properties found in food .
When I say extreme I mean the extreme fast freeze brought on by liquid nitrogen , or the chefs using lasers - that sort of thing .
My sense is that these types of techniques are tough on ( natural ) ingredients .
I have a good sense of what high temps can do to beneficial essential fatty acids ( like those found in nuts or unrefined nut oils ) , or to the phyto - nutrients in fruits and vegetables - and it's not always pretty .
I 'd love to open this up for discussion .
I 'll include the base recipe for my favorite vanilla bean gelato below , I suspect it would pair quite nicely with a tank of the cold stuff .
Let me know .

The blog became a regular read for hi-tech industry watchers
Robert Scoble 's blog about his life and events inside and outside Microsoft became the unofficial corporate voice of the company .
Many turned to his blog to find out how the firm reacted to big news events .
His blog won praise for its neutrality and readiness to point out Microsoft 's mistakes or praise its rivals .
Conversation piece
Mr Scoble 's blog , called Scobleizer , is widely seen as helping to humanise Microsoft and shift its stance from arrogant and aloof to one that is more inclusive and accepting of criticism .
It also commented on broader changes in the net world and how they affected the company .
I love Microsoft and Microsoft did not lose me , at least as a supporter and friend
Robert Scoble
The success of Scobleizer kicked off a number of copycat blogs which aimed to expose the inner workings and opinions of other companies to more public scrutiny .
Within Microsoft , Mr Scoble helped to run the Channel 9 news site that aired video interviews with hundreds of employees to gain an insight into the projects they were working on .
Mr Scoble will stay at Microsoft until the end of June and then move to start - up PodTech .
Net .
He joins as vice - president of content and will help prepare video interviews with the great and good of the technology world .
In a fitting twist , the news about Mr Scoble 's departure broke on another blog before he had chance to tell regular readers via his own journal .
In a posting on 10 June , Mr Scoble explained the reasons for his departure and said it has not arisen because he had fallen out with his employer .
" I love Microsoft and Microsoft did not lose me , at least as a supporter and friend , " he wrote in the entry .
Rubyをはじめとするスクリプト言語ではなく、なぜJavaを選ぶのか。
そして、XPをはじめとするアジャイル開発ではなく、なぜウォーターフォールを選ぶのか。
そこには、言語の良し悪しや、開発プロセスの考え方などが理由の中心にあるわけではなくて、SIerというビジネスの仕事の仕方（ビジネスモデル）に起因している。
RubyやXPは、考え方や技術としてはとても良くて、生産性もあがるし、何よりもソフトウェアをクリエイティブに作り上げることができ、利用者にとっても使い勝手がよく、スポンサー（経営者）にとっても経営戦略に沿ったものが手に入り、開発者にとっては何よりも仕事に対してやりがいを感じることができる。すばらしい！・・・・が。。。
しかし、だからといって、誰でもRubyやXPを使って開発をするべきか、というとそうではない。もし、本質を理解しない誰かが、「やってみたいのだが・・・」と相談に来たら、それはやめて、Javaとウォーターフォールでやりなさい、と助言するだろう。それは・・・なぜか？
まず、XPやRubyをうまく実践するには、それなりのスキルとマインドが必要になってくるのは確かで、それも理由のひとつではあるが、オススメしない本質はそこではない。それは、SIerのビジネスモデル（受託開発）がディフェンシブ（防御的）な開発しか許さないからである。
ディフェンシブな開発とは、開発途上のリスクを計画上の時点でなるべく潰し、開発側に発生する利益分を減らさないような開発の進め方をすることを言っている。加えて、この場合、開発側はリスク分はなるべく多めに見積もり金額にいれようとしがちだ。
なぜそうなるのか。今のSIビジネスでは、決められた金額の中でどれだけ安く作り上げることで利益を出す構造だからである。つまり、お客様と金額と内容で合意し、発注を受けたら、後は、その中で当初の金額よりも安く作れば利益率は上がるのである。人月幾らで受発注している段階で、そこを安くするには、単価を下げるしかなく、オフショアなどの下請け会社に投げることで多くのマージンを獲得できるのである。
そうなると、良いシステムができあがるはずもなく、如何にローコストで作るかということだけに力点が移ってしまう。もちろん、品質が悪ければクレームとなり次の仕事につながらないという問題が発生するが、震度５の地震などほとんど起きることもないので、なんとかなっているという、まるでどこかの話みたいな構図ができあがっている。
SI の会社でシステム開発業務をしている限り、ディフェンシブにならざるを得ないのである。だからこそ、上流工程と呼んでさもシステム開発には重要だと言って要件定義に注目してみたり、ITアーキテクトが重要だと言って方式設計に注目してみたりしているのだろう。その注目している理由は、いかに自分達の利益分を守るか、という背景の中で起きていると考えれば自然なことである。それらの個々の活動にはまっとうな理由があるだろうが、その理由が生まれる背景となる文脈にディフェンシブな開発という側面があればこそである。
要件定義で、なるべく事前に要求を全部洗い出して、決めきって、合意を取って、必要とあらばハンコも押して、それ以外に発生したら別料金をもらえるようにして、開発に取り掛かろうと。そうしておけば、後は、下請けをどんだけ叩いて安く作らせるかに注力できる。方式設計も同じこと。なるべく事前に方式を決めて、構造を決めて、できることを決めきっておこうという話。・・・しかし、こうしたやり方で、本当に要件が決めきれるのだろうか。そして、方式も決めきれるのだろうか。逆に、決めきれたとしても、それが本当に求めている要求なのだろうか。その方式で良いのだろうか。これでは、顧客にとっての新しいイノベーションは生まれることはないだろう。
余談ではあるが、今のシステム開発だと、使うライブラリなどのバージョンはどう考えているか？システムの提案時で安定しているバージョンを提案するか、ちょっと考えたリリース時期を見越して、そこに向けたバージョンを提案するかもしれない。SIerはそれで良いが、システムを使うユーザにとってはそのシステムが１０年使われるかもしれない。その間のバージョンアップはどう考えているのか。そんなこと考えてない提案は多すぎる。一発作ってしまえば良い考え方があまりに多い。とはいえ、そういう提案だときっと、リリース後、数年でリプレース提案をかけてまた儲けられる、なんてことも考えられる。でも、これって、なんだかビジネスとしては、あまりにチンピラすぎる。ドカンと作って数年もって、またドカンと作るのは、もうやめた方が良い。2004年に策定したEJB2.0をベースにした方式のシステムを2007年にリリースするなんて、まったくもってナンセンスだ。
さて、本題に戻すが 、SIの開発ではディフェンシブにならざるを得ないのである。そうなると、プログラミング言語としても、インタフェースを作れたり、コンパイラで型チェックが入ったりするようなJava言語が向いているのである。これは、Javaでクリエイティブな開発ができないとは言ってない。Javaの一部の特性が、SIというビジネスにフィットしていたというだけの話である。ただ、Javaを使うことによって下請けやオフショアに開発を出すことを容易にすることができる。だから、Javaを選ぶのである。
そして、このことはウォーターフォールも同じである。工程ごとに確実に決めて、なるべく被害が発生しないように石橋を叩きながら進めようと考えれば、ウォーターフォールを選ばざるを得まい。ただし最近では、仕様書で石橋を叩いたつもりでも、結局うまくいかない場合が多いのであるが。それにしても普通に考えたら、いかに上手にウォーターフォールを進めるかということに注力してしまう。
このように、ディフェンシブにならざるを得ないということを考えると、今のSI業界の抱えている矛盾や構造が全てつながってくる。契約の問題もしかり、工数計算の問題もしかり、会計基準の問題もしかり。ディフェンシブであるために、本来は新しい技術要素なんて本番のプロジェクトに入れてはいけないのだ。。。
さて一方 、RubyとXPで開発をすると、オフェンシブ（攻撃的）な開発が実現する。どんどんと新しい機能を追加できるし、アイディアも実現までの時間が短くて済む。何か新しいシステムを作り上げようと言う時は、こうした軽さが無いと作れないだろう。そして、ソフトウェア開発は、本来、こうであるべきだと思う。ただし、このオフェンシブな開発を実現するためには、今のSIerのビジネスの仕方では、障壁が多すぎる。簡単なところだと、そもそも人月計算をする時点で、沢山のものを同じ時間で作ってしまうと、受注金額が下がってしまう。これでは意味が無い。また、見積もり時以外の機能を、エクセレントに作ったとしても、単に開発者が苦労するだけで、お金が貰えなかったら意味がない、などである。長年アジャイル開発を続けて感じ続けていた違和感がこれであった。
RubyとXPはオフェンシブだから品質が悪いのでは、という危惧もあるかと思うが、品質の問題に関しては、オフェンシブかディフェンシブかなんて関係の無い話だし、いずれにせよ最重要に考えるべき話だ。そして、ディフェンシブな開発ではないがしろにされてしまいかねないのは既に話した通りだ。「攻撃こそ最大の防御」という言葉もある。一定の基準値で品質を確保するような品質の考え方ではなく、品質さえも作りこんでいくぐらいの開発の生産性があれば良いのではないか。
ディフェンシブであることは、多くの弊害をもたらしている。やはり見積もり金額でよーいドンの世界だと、プロジェクトの成功は能力や付加価値よりも運が重要な要素になってしまいがちだ。良い顧客がついたとか、高めの見積もり金額で受注できたとかで、プロジェクトの成否が変わってきて、どれだけ高い技術力があっても、顧客によってはプロジェクトがポシャる時は往々にしてある。また、このゲームのルールに従ってビジネスを続ける限り、会社の規模とか体力でしか大きな案件は取れず、小さな会社はサブコントラクターにしかなれないのである。
こうした構造には、受注側のSIerだけの問題が原因ではなく、発注側にも原因がないわけではない。多くの発注者にとってみれば、システム開発はアウトソースするものという意識があり、予算額でシステムを作らせれば良いと考えがちだ。そうなると、お金を出してるんだから・・・という態度になってしまいがちだし、いかに予算額の中で沢山の機能を盛り込めるか、というところがその発注側の担当者のミッションになってしまい、やはり不幸な結果になるのは目に見えている。なので、バグが仕様かで揉めることが多いのだろう。そうなると、受注側は、さらにディフェンシブになって、どれだけリスクを低くできるかと同時にリスク分を見積もりに詰め込めるかを考えるようになる。もはや、悪魔のスパイラルが走っているといっても過言ではない。
そこで、システムを必要としている企業であれば、もはや、SIerなどに頼むのではなく自社で優秀なプログラマーを雇用して、そこで開発をした方が良いのではないだろうか。その方が、コストも安くてすむし、何より、柔軟なシステム開発が可能となる。その場合、RubyやXPを使ってオフェンシブな開発も実現できるのではないか。SIerに頼んで、どこの馬の骨かわからん奴等に作られるよりは、よっぽど安心できるのではないか。SIerの中にいる優秀な人材は、顧客側のシステム部門に行った方が良いのではないだろうか。
しかし、それも現在の日本では中々難しい。日本の経営層には、いまだにシステム部門をコストセンターとしか見ていない場合が多い。そうなると、システム部の立場は社内で弱く、システムとは予算内でいかに作るかだけで、それを活用してビジネスを上手に展開していこうとまでは考えられていない。そうなると、先ほどの直雇用のモデルではうまくいかない。せっかくのプログラマーも社内調整に走るようでは、宝の持ち腐れ、やめてしまうに違いない。
やはり、システムに対する重要度の認識が高くないと、そういった構造には中々なりえない。逆に、重要度が高いと認識しているIT企業は、自社で作っている場合がほとんどだろう。IT企業にとっては、システムこそが事業の中心だからだ。（ちなみにIT企業とSIerは完全に別の業界である）だからこそ、本当に優秀なエンジニアは、SI業界など去って、IT企業に行った方が良いんじゃないかと思ってる。
そうはいっても、最近では徐々にIT投資が重要だという認識が広まりつつあると聞いている。おそらく近い将来、経営とITは今よりももっと密接なものとなるだろう。そうなった場合、経営はゴーイングコンサーンであり、一年ごとに見直しをして続けていかねばならないのに対して、システムだけが従来どおり、数年に１度ドカンと作って減価償却していくような作り方で良いのだろうか。いや、経営とITが密接に結びつくのであれば、システム開発も１年ごとに見直すべきだろう。１年以上のプロジェクトは禁止の方向で。そして、システムは、常に改修を続けていくスタイルに変えていくべきじゃないか。
そうなったときに、今のディフェンシブな開発の延長上に、SIerの未来は無いと思える。そういう世の中になったとき、今後どうしていくべきか考える時期に来ているのではないか。むしろ、その変化を待つのではなく、未来に向けたSIerのビジネスモデルを考え、ゲームのルールを変えてしまえば、輝かしい未来となるかもしれない。そうなってしまうと、もはやSIerとは呼べないかもしれないけれど。
つまり、現場での改善活動も重要だけれども、ドラスティックに今の問題だらけのSI業界を変えてしまうには、SIerのビジネスモデルを変えるしかない。現場の改善活動ってことでアジャイルの普及とかしているけれど、そもそものビジネスモデルを変えるためには、経営者の判断が必要になる。それも、ある程度影響力のある企業の経営者でなければ難しいだろう。独立してフリーランスになったとしても、同じゲームのルールに従っていては勝ち目はない。
勿論、ここまで悲観的になることもなく、新しい技術要素を学び取り入れ、生産性を上げてお客様に良いシステムを提供し喜んでもらうということはとても大事なことだし、個々のレベルで取り組まなければならないことではある。それで、エンジニアとしてのQoEL（Quality of Engineering Life）は高められるに違いない。しかし一方で、業界全体が袋小路に差し掛かった感もぬぐえない。自然とQoELをあげることができ、それが豊かな生活に直結するような業界に変えることも考えていかなければ、と思う。
There has been a lot of talk about how to optimize Firefox to run the most efficiently .
CNet ’s most recent article goes through some helpful tips but does n’t jump into many details .
Here I am going to explain which extensions have memory leaks or will slow down Firefox ’s performance .
First , before I dive into the main topic there are a few things that you should change in your Firefox settings if you really want to optimize this .
Just follow this tutorial that I put together .
Okay , now let ’s talk about the extensions .
This is the point that you may want to turn your head because I am about to bring some truth to some of the most popular extensions .
IE Tab 1.0.7 !
Yes , it is true that one of the most convenient extensions has a memory leak .
I ca n’t say that I am super shocked by this because how efficient can it be to run Internet Explorer in Firefox ?
Session Saver 0.2.1.031 has a known memory leak .
ForecastFox 0.8.5 also has a memory leak … and that very disappointing since most Firefox users have this sitting in their toolbar ( so what is the weather like by you :) ) .
Filterset . G Updater AND FlashGot used in conjunction will produce a memory leak .
FasterFox does n’t have a memory leak specifically , but it will not help your Firefox performance .
It does help your browsing performance but if you decide to keep this extension at least make sure you do n’t have prefetching enabled .
Tabbrowser Extensions does n’t have memory leaks either but will definitely slow Firefox down and it has many conflicts with other extension .
It can even stop Firefox from being able to startup !
A better alternative is Tab Mix or Tab Mix Plus which offer the same set of features .
If you do n’t need all the features of Tab Mix Plus then just use Tab Mix to lower the memory usage a little .
Please check for updates to ensure you are using the most recent version of the following extensions : Adblock 0.5.3.042 , AdBlock Plus 0.6.1.1 , NoScript 1.1.3.9 , Search Keys 0.7.3 , Thumbs 0.6.2 — each of these extensions HAD known memory leaks but they have now been fixed .
That is about it for the most popular Firefox extensions that have been tested .
Another important thing to do is upgrade to Firefox 1.5.0.1 if you have n’t already .
This build has fixed two memory leaks that were very common : leak when selecting and leak from global scope polluter .
The latest trunk also has a long list of memory leak fixes so keep your eyes peeled for a new release of Firefox .
UPDATE : It appears that in the Digg posting of this article that the author of ForecastFox made a comment :
We know Forecastfox 0.8.5 has some memory leaks .
We are planning on doing a full leak analysis for 1.0 .
In the mean time , I ’ve been actively working on resolving some of the leaks , and I think I ’ve made some good progress for our 0.9 release .
Also , while the current build of IE Tab is up to 1.0.8 there is no mention that they fixed the memory leaks in this updated build .
UPDATE 2 : Tracy wrote in and said that a good alternative to ForecastFox is Weather Watcher .
I did n’t even think of mentioning that but this is the software that I run on my computer .
It is not an extension for Firefox but takes very little RAM and is FREE !

Creating the conditions for the formation of black holes is one of the aims of particle physics
It was generated at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ( RHIC ) in New York , US , which smashes beams of gold nuclei together at near light speeds .
Horatiu Nastase says his calculations show that the core of the fireball has a striking similarity to a black hole .
His work has been published on the pre-print website arxiv.org and is reported in New Scientist magazine .
When the gold nuclei smash into each other they are broken down into particles called quarks and gluons .
These form a ball of plasma about 300 times hotter than the surface of the Sun .
This fireball , which lasts just 10 million , billion , billionths of a second , can be detected because it absorbs jets of particles produced by the beam collisions .
But Nastase , of Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , says there is something unusual about it .
Ten times as many jets were being absorbed by the fireball as were predicted by calculations .
The Brown researcher thinks the particles are disappearing into the fireball 's core and reappearing as thermal radiation , just as matter is thought to fall into a black hole and come out as " Hawking " radiation .
However , even if the ball of plasma is a black hole , it is not thought to pose a threat .
At these energies and distances , gravity is not the dominant force in a black hole .
The RHIC is sited at the Brookhaven National Laboratory .
“ With the help of external review boards that would include a prisoner advocate , ” Mr. Bronstein said , “ I do believe that the potential benefits of biomedical research outweigh the potential risks . ”

Holmesburg closed in 1995 but was partly reopened in July to help ease overcrowding at other prisons .
Under current regulations , passed in 1978 , prisoners can participate in federally financed biomedical research if the experiment poses no more than “ minimal ” risks to the subjects .
But a report formally presented to federal officials on Aug. 1 by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences advised that experiments with greater risks be permitted if they had the potential to benefit prisoners .
As an added precaution , the report suggested that all studies be subject to an independent review .
“ The current regulations are entirely outdated and restrictive , and prisoners are being arbitrarily excluded from research that can help them , ” said Ernest D. Prentice , a University of Nebraska genetics professor and the chairman of a Health and Human Services Department committee that requested the study .
Mr. Prentice said the regulation revision process would begin at the committee ’s next meeting , on Nov. 2 .
The discussion comes as the biomedical industry is facing a shortage of testing subjects .
In the last two years , several pain medications , including Vioxx and Bextra , have been pulled off the market because early testing did not include large enough numbers of patients to catch dangerous problems .
And the committee ’s report comes against the backdrop of a prison population that has more than quadrupled , to about 2.3 million , over the last 30 years and that disproportionately suffers from H.I.V. and hepatitis C , diseases that some researchers say could be better controlled if new research were permitted in prisons .
For Leodus Jones , a former prisoner , the report has opened old wounds .
“ This moves us back in a very bad direction , ” said Mr. Jones , who participated in the experiments at Holmesburg in 1966 and after his release played a pivotal role in lobbying to get the regulations passed .
